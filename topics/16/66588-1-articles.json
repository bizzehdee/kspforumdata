If you add more and more radial tanks, the total surface area of the rocket that\u0027s exposed to air (basically all of the nose cones and the capsule) increases, whereas if you build \u003Cem\u003Eupward\u003C/em\u003E, only the capsule and maybe a few other things are exposed to the air, greatly reducing drag. You might want to try Procedural Fairings, which creates a disposable shell around the top of your rocket to protect it from drag. Also, with FAR, flat surfaces are terrible and will almost never work in atmosphere. I\u0027m not sure if you\u0027re doing the gravity turn right; you should do a veeeery gradual turn, following the prograde marker otherwise your rocket will flip out from the drag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drethon","CreatedById":100831,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T20:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout the fins if I turned earlier and slower the rocket flipped backward instead of continuing the turn and started tumbling. However if I leave the fins on and turn at 100ms (I was typically turning as late as 10km or as early as 5km) and then follow the prograde down until the rocket is at 45 degrees it seems pretty stable. I bet the control surfaces or gimbals would have helped but I think I\u0027l leave them off to work with the physics rather than trying to fight it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know building out doesn\u0027t work well with FAR but I\u0027m trying to strike a balance between not being too wide but still having a wide lander for stability.

You\u0027re getting problems with excessive drag on your lander. A fairing can help with that. Just make sure to edit the fairing higher up on the staging list, as the default value will separate the fairing while drag\u0027s still a big problem -- I\u0027ve gotten flipovers from something as simple as a dish antenna while still 30 km up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T20:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had the exact same problem when I started using FAR earlier this year. I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E what causes the tumble is your drag vector, thrust vector, and gets to far out of alignment with the direction of travel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if you accelerate to 300 m/s at 10 km traveling straight up, then the drag vector is straight down (I \u003Cem\u003Eassume \u003C/em\u003E, and being counter acted by thrust vector, straight up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, same situation, and you suddenly turn over into a 45 degree gravity turn, you\u0027re still traveling straight up (you don\u0027t suddenly change direction), you tumble. Your drag is still going straight down (opposing the direction of travel), but the thrust is no longer in line with the drag, so the drag produces torque and rotates the nose towards the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd when that happens, you\u0027re gonna have a bad day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have found works well is to turn gradually in the atmosphere, and increase control methods to counter-act the drag-torque that wasn\u0027t there in stock KSP. Control methods include fins (ones with control surfaces are better), SAS (okay for this situation), thrust vectored engines (better), and I find RCS (debateable). Personally, I find RCS to be really effective when you put it way up high on your stack, which is far away from the CoM in a launch vehicle, so it works as a lever arm to keep you pointed in the right direction. It\u0027s not an efficient use of RCS though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience, the best way to handle this FAR drag-tumble is to avoid making any sudden orientation changes while in the low atmosphere (the light blue part of the pressure indicator below the altimeter). With FAR, I nudge the heading off vertical about 5 degrees right off the pad, then I slowly nudge it over as much as the rocket tells me I can. If I see funny things happening, or RCS staying on while the heading is steady, I leave it alone until higher up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep at it, and you\u0027ll get used to FAR\u0027s model. It\u0027s more challenging than stock, and learning how to finesse your rockets into orbit what makes it fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T20:31:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should also balance that Goo Can on the side of your rocket.

If you turn your nose too far away from the prograde marker while in an atmosphere, your craft \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E flip and tumble. Doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s an aircraft or a rocket, doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re pitching or yawing. The more drag you are experiencing (i.e. going fast at low altitudes), the worse this problem becomes. People who are used to the general \u0022fly straight up to 10k then make a full 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 turn\u0022 will instantly fall prey to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fins and winglets counter this effect by making the rocket want to stay flying straight ahead on its own (provided you mount them at the bottom). This increases the leeway you have for turning away from the prograde marker. In some situations where you would flip normally, the fins will pull the rear back in line and thus keep the rocket going straight. They can only do so much though - if you turn far enough that you\u0027re offering the broad side of your rocket to the onrushing air, you will not go to space today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a lot of drag at the top of your rocket - for example having a wide lander not covered by a fairing - does the exact opposite: it makes your rocket want to turn away from the prograde marker on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-24T09:52:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2014 09:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
