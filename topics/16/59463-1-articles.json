Observing aircraft during takeoffs I have seen that the landing gears tend to bend, despite attempts to block them with support elements. This problem manifests itself not only with Landing gears introduced by mods (B9 aerospace, firespitter), but also with stock\u0027s LG. does anyone know how to fix this? is a very frustrating situation, because of this problem have already left the game several times \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E I hope someone can help me.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T20:08:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure the landing aren\u0027t canted (tilted) to either side.

If the aircraft is flexing then that is tilting the landing gear, or if you don\u0027t have landing gear supporting the center of the plane, then it can also flex a little and this tends to cause the problem. If these solutions don\u0027t work, you might also have control surfaces that aren\u0027t aligned properly with symmetry. You can check this by having the breaks on, on the runway, then push the WASD keys and see how the control surfaces react. If any of them bend in the opposite direction of the other one, then that\u0027s also an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example of the strut solution:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k3BWVm5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k3BWVm5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example of perfect landing gear for this plane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WB98PjL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WB98PjL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-09T20:23:09Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2014 08:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by 700NitroXpress\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"edemapolmonare","CreatedById":100521,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T21:12:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried both solutions, but the problem persists. I made sure that the models were very rigid, and straight landing gears, for now, the only solution was to apply two pairs of LG (front and back), but it is good only for large aircraft, for small planes, Having regard to the limited space, I have to opt for a tricycle gear configuration, and with only a few models can complete a take-off. what seems strange is that the landing gears despite the apparent rigid, during \u0022rush\u0022 on the runway, they seem made \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9of jelly also coming to bend 45 degrees\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T21:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPics might help diagnose the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T02:59:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like your plane might simply be too heavy, edemapolmonare.
