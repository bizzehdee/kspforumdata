It seems there used to be a great \u0022jet compendium\u0022 but the forum implosion seems to have fed that to the kraken. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntake airflow, intake size, intake power, intake air (initial/max)... it\u0027s all jibberish to me right now. I know I need intakes on my jet aircraft, but my \u0022intake air\u0022 resource just constantly goes down. Is that a sign of too few intakes? A lack of speed? Too high? A combination of all of these?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T12:06:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Farrow\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Farrow\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA combination of all of these?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt means you buffer is reducing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe IntakeAir resource bar just shows the buffer.

The jet compendium has probably imploded and I can\u0027t recall all the details. But the amount of intake air generated is dependant of altitude (higher altitude means lower air), speed (the faster you go the more air is pushed into the intake), the intake area which is different for each intake and the angle of attack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the engines their isp is only (I think) dependant on the altitude and it\u0027s thrust only dependend on it\u0027s airspeed. The turbojet has much better high speed and high altitude thrust and isp than the basic jet engine but the basic one is much better at sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
