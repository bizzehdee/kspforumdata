The XYZ arrows will match up with\n\nsaid objects angle of placement. This makes it easier to manipulate the object in relation to what its connected to.\n\nDoes anyone know how to activate this mode?\n\nI tried the ALT key, but no joy.\n\nThanks in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T06:32:06Z","Content":"Sounds like maybe the C key. That switches modes between angle snap to free angle. Free mode is very nice for offset too."},{"CreatedByName":"Solar71","CreatedById":140993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T06:38:10Z","Content":"I know about angle snap. I know how to turn that on and off. thank you.\n\nBut im talking about something a little different.\n\nIm talking about the three angle arrows being offset or off angle. To match the part.\n\nBut I will try what you said. \u0022C\u0022 key. I will click it and see what happens. Thanks again."},{"CreatedByName":"Promii","CreatedById":36781,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T06:40:12Z","Content":"The F-key will switch between global and local translation, which is what I think you are referring to."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T07:42:20Z","Content":"\u0022F\u0022-Key, as said before."},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T10:18:18Z","Content":"You are looking for the #3 key. #1 to return to normal mode.
