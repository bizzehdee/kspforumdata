I guess that\u0027s more of a obvious design flaw, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the things I am interested in are roughly how the failure of connections between parts are calculated (no need for precise equations, I was more wondering which parameters it considered; velocity/acceleration/mass etc/properties of the part). Also I was wondering how connections between struts were modelled. Is it simply modelled as one part connected to another, or does it take into account the exact position and angle of the strut? Also, can too many struts cause a more precarious rocket by restricting motion at all?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T02:19:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBelieve it or not, someone did \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68598-The-Physics-Glitchers-a-case-study-of-KSP-s-rigidbody-breakdowns\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ean investigation into how KSP\u0027s rigid-body physics works\u003C/a\u003E just yesterday.
