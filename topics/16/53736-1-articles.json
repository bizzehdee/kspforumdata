I use F12 to take screenshots and I\u0027ve been posting them. I go to view profile and next to the most recently played games there\u0027s a screenshots button below it. Just now today, that button isn\u0027t there. Where did it go? Also, I go to KSP on the library tab and click the view screenshot library on the bottom. It then takes me to a blank page that tells me it\u0027s easy to make screenshots on Steam. Thanks Steam, I know that. Where are they tho?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also took a new screenshot, uploaded it to the Steam cloud, clicked the View Online button, but Steam\u0027s loading wheel just goes and never takes me to the screenshot. What\u0027s going on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI restarted Steam and the same thing happens. I also verified the integrity of the KSP game cache. So KSP isn\u0027t to blame, this is a Steam issue.
