I usually wait till between 20km and 25km because the air really thins out and the thrust curve is reaching its maximum. You also want to aim for sort of a smooth transition where you don\u0027t level out completely, but not climbing too fast. More of a parabolic arc up to altitude. I find for heavier aircraft it\u0027s a bit better to have an upward prograde as you\u0027re nearing 30km\u002B than to be going faster with a level prograde. This makes pushing the AP higher with rockets a bit easier, so you\u0027re not experiencing a lot of drag thrusting rockets level at 28km. Also, when you have to pitch way up like that for the rockets, the air intakes become much less effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy typical airspeed gates:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10km, 200 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15km, 350 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20km, 650-700 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E24km, 1000 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom here, you have to play it out a bit based on weight, but usually...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E30km, 1600 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E32km, 1800 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, with modified intakes you have and the weight of your plane, I think you\u0027re better off NOT shutting down motors as you climb. If you watch them closely, you\u0027re better off throttling all of them down together and keeping all 6 on. With this build you\u0027ll probably have more overall thrust that way but you\u0027ll have to pay more attention to flameouts. When building, place your inboard TurboJets last so they flame out first (and cause less flat spins). Also, turning on your NERVAS a little early with this isn\u0027t so painful because of the reduced throttle. But the airspeed boost from the rockets can help keep your intake air up a bit longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s my 2 cents.

Instead of turning off your first couple of turbos, stay at that altitude and maximise your speed. Once your surface acceleration drops below 0.5m/s/s fire up your nukes to push faster and higher at full throttle. You are running heavy so your TWR needs extra oomph to keep that intake air level high.
