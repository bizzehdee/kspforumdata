Its probably rare to have the game trying to autosave at the same time you are in timewarp, but if it does happen at the same time it could cause stutters or low frame rate while the game attempts autosave every five seconds until you are not timewarping. I changed my autosave interval to 2400 or every 40 minutes, and I doubled the \u0022AUTOSAVE_SHORT_INTERVAL=5\u0022 to 10 seconds. It should be more like 120sec or 2 minutes. But since these 2 things happening at the same time is pretty rare, autosave and timewarp, I\u0027m leaving my settings where they are until I experience the stutters again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[h=2][/h]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T20:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP might be trying to save during launch, but it can\u0027t when in an atmosphere and the 5 second interval is not far off the ~4 seconds reported by people with the sound stutter issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d be \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E interesting to see what changing this does for someone affected with stutters \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T21:03:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich file is this specifically?
