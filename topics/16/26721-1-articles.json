Rover below the landing stage which either lands onto the rover wheels themselves or suspends the rover underneath the body of the lander and releases it from a very short drop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI.e. the explicit skycrane that lowers the rover down with a cable and the non-explicit skycrane where the landing stage is detached from the top of the rover after landing. Paradoxically, in real life, skycrane was created not because it\u0027s superior in terms of energy or engineering -- it isn\u0027t -- but because they didn\u0027t want to mess up the dust on the landing site if at all possible. In KSP this is apparently the lightest and the most generally applicable method, the stock \u0022Rover \u002B Skycrane\u0022 is made this way, and it\u0027s especially suitable for small automated rovers which are meant to be used unattended. I\u0027ve been using the Kerbal Attachment System plugin to suspend rovers underneath the body of a piloted lander (which, when using LV-N engines, will often have them mounted on the sides of the body and have the bottom free to get some clearance from the ground) with it, or hold them by a docking port and winch them up by two symmetrical winches until the docking port sucks them in, and retain the ability to take them with me when relocating to another landing location. That works moderately well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Rover above the landing stage, a-la Lunokhod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas the advantage that the lander can be much heavier and has no chance to mess up the top of the rover, which would be important on a higher-gravity body. The disadvantage then is that you need to make the landing stage flatter, (or wider) and provide a ramp for the rover to drive down -- either prebuilt this way and descending in an open configuration (never actually seen that done) or opening after landing. The latter can be done with the Damned Robotics plugin which provides you with a servo-controlled hinge, or another means to lower a ramp, but the examples I\u0027ve actually seen done just landed onto the bottom of the box the rover was in and blew a wall open with a decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Rover suspended off the side of a lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will need two of them to balance the lander\u0027s center of mass, and this method is suitable for very big landers which you don\u0027t want to make even bigger or taller and relatively light rovers. That will typically give you a much taller drop, so the only practical method to do that I can think of involves suspending it off a Kerbal Attachment System winch and gently lowering it down. That works perfectly -- getting it back up, howerver, in my experience, does not, as interpenetrating objects that can result will disintegrate the lander. If you don\u0027t expect to get the rover back up, it works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Rover with integrated landing stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, a rover that includes it\u0027s own engines, lands under it\u0027s own power onto it\u0027s wheels or extra landing legs, sometimes with parachutes, and keeps some fuel just in case it needs to navigate an extra-steep climb. People don\u0027t seem to commonly do that, but when they do, that\u0027s usually for monster piloted rovers weighing upwards of 20 tons. Sometimes they land on one end and later tip over with the use of Damned Robotics tools, other times they transfer to target lengthwise but turn horizontally for landing.

Paradoxically, in real life, skycrane was created not because it\u0027s superior in terms of energy or engineering -- it isn\u0027t -- but because they didn\u0027t want to mess up the dust on the landing site if at all possible. In KSP this is apparently the lightest and the most generally applicable method, the stock \u0022Rover \u002B Skycrane\u0022 is made this way, and it\u0027s especially suitable for small automated rovers which are meant to be used unattended. I\u0027ve been using the Kerbal Attachment System plugin to suspend rovers underneath the body of a piloted lander (which, when using LV-N engines, will often have them mounted on the sides of the body and have the bottom free to get some clearance from the ground) with it, or hold them by a docking port and winch them up by two symmetrical winches until the docking port sucks them in, and retain the ability to take them with me when relocating to another landing location. That works moderately well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Rover above the landing stage, a-la Lunokhod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas the advantage that the lander can be much heavier and has no chance to mess up the top of the rover, which would be important on a higher-gravity body. The disadvantage then is that you need to make the landing stage flatter, (or wider) and provide a ramp for the rover to drive down -- either prebuilt this way and descending in an open configuration (never actually seen that done) or opening after landing. The latter can be done with the Damned Robotics plugin which provides you with a servo-controlled hinge, or another means to lower a ramp, but the examples I\u0027ve actually seen done just landed onto the bottom of the box the rover was in and blew a wall open with a decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Rover suspended off the side of a lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will need two of them to balance the lander\u0027s center of mass, and this method is suitable for very big landers which you don\u0027t want to make even bigger or taller and relatively light rovers. That will typically give you a much taller drop, so the only practical method to do that I can think of involves suspending it off a Kerbal Attachment System winch and gently lowering it down. That works perfectly -- getting it back up, howerver, in my experience, does not, as interpenetrating objects that can result will disintegrate the lander. If you don\u0027t expect to get the rover back up, it works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Rover with integrated landing stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, a rover that includes it\u0027s own engines, lands under it\u0027s own power onto it\u0027s wheels or extra landing legs, sometimes with parachutes, and keeps some fuel just in case it needs to navigate an extra-steep climb. People don\u0027t seem to commonly do that, but when they do, that\u0027s usually for monster piloted rovers weighing upwards of 20 tons. Sometimes they land on one end and later tip over with the use of Damned Robotics tools, other times they transfer to target lengthwise but turn horizontally for landing. I\u0027ve yet to see one explicitly balanced to land and do interplanetary transfers horizontally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.
