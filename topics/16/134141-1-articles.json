These type of station and craft would be employed well down the road from the initial interactions with Mars like stratocheif66 is working on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will start with one main station design and two ferry designs; one for crew transport and one for cargo/materials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUtilizing ISRU for production of additional fuel on the surface of the planet allows for much smaller craft with very reasonable round trip deltaV. Producing fuel in orbit also has its advantages that i will explore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, I am working with a 70 tn prototype. It has about 4600 deltaV of fuel and can produce another 4600 deltV of fuel after landing over a period of 70 days. This is the crew variant and can support 3 persons for 210 days if needed. Crew, supplies, capsule come in about 7.5tn. So the cargo variant will have about the same capacity of 11% weight cargo for a 70 tn craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a completely reusable craft, and will use a pure propulsion profile for ascent and decent. I may incorporate aero interactive devices of some sort to shave some deltaV requirements, but for now I am trying to keep it simple.

It will develop more as the ferry design is refined and we get a better understanding of the frequency of the initial transit scheduled.

My current ferry prototype is using two of the largest chemical engines and will most likely be scaled back to one or two of the smaller units. This will increase the time on the surface and I will need to look at what my limits will be regarding that. In moving away from the RTGs, I need to develop a solar plan. At current, I am thinking solar panel systems that will be deployed/assembled by hand/robot once landed on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I could build a permanent large solar installation on the surface and use that to power the ferry\u0027s refueling process, I prefer to contain the solar harvesting potential in the ferry itself. Most all initial craft, I think, will need to be lifeboats, and all but stand alone systems. Relying only on permanent solar installations would also limit sub orbital hop range. Later these solar installations will be present, but for the initial ferries and surface infrastructure I want as much self sufficiency as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETwo\u003C/strong\u003E is to take another look at boil off and scaling for time and active craft in game. We have good hardware/mods to keep fuels at the right temp, but I would like to look at performance of cryo systems in martian atmosphere and power requirements.
