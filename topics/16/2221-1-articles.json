I don\u0027t want how fast the \u0027body\u0027 is, i wan\u0027t how fast the Trusters are. I don\u0027t know if i am making myself understand, i just can\u0027t find the right words. I hope you understand. It\u0027s pretty mutch like cars. I wan\u0027t something that tells me how fast my engine is working... or something like that. Im sorry for my english.
