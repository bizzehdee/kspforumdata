target is ahead of you and raise it if it is behind you, but if you\u0027re orbiting at low altitude, you will have to go higher either way to avoid grazing the atmosphere and re-entering) and then wait until the separation gets close.\u00A0 For these sorts of approaches, it sometimes makes sense to circularise at the modified orbit because it makes the rendezvous go more quickly, but for small changes, it usually works better to keep one apsis at your target\u0027s orbit and stay elliptical.\u00A0 As the markers get closer, that is a visual indication of how much your target is catching up to you (or vice versa).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, the target-position marker (the one pointing up) will skip over the closest-approach marker.\u00A0 This indicates that your target will pass you on the next orbit.\u00A0 That\u0027s how you know that it is time to change your orbit back towards the target orbit.\u00A0 However, you don\u0027t want to change it the whole way:\u00A0 you want to get to the same place as the closest-approach marker and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eslowly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0thrust to move the orbit back while watching in map mode.\u00A0 What you will see is that the target-position marker will slide along its orbit:\u00A0 what you will want is to slide it to align with your closest-approach marker.\u00A0 When that happens, shut down your engines.\u00A0 Your orbits aren\u0027t yet matched, but you won\u0027t want to fully match until you have actually rendezvoused.\u00A0 You can check the separation distance on the closest-approach marker; it ought to be under 2.5 km and ideally under 1 km.\u00A0 Closer is better to a point; I usually try for 0.2 km because I don\u0027t want to have any collisions and because 200 metres is quite close enough for orbital rendezvous.\u00A0 Collisions\u00A0aren\u0027t likely but I had a nasty surprise once when I tried to rendezvous with a station, so I stay safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you have to wait one more orbit, and once you get to the point of closest approach, you ought to see the target floating next to your rocket.\u00A0 Now is the time to fully match.\u00A0 The way to do this is to set the navball to target mode (do this by clicking on the speed display at the top of it) and thrust retrograde until the target velocity equals zero.\u00A0 Retrograde when you\u0027re in target mode is defined with respect to the target\u0027s relative velocity; so making it zero means that you and your target have matched orbits.\u00A0 The match isn\u0027t perfect (and it won\u0027t be unless you dock) so the target velocity will start to rise as you drift apart, but a good rendezvous will give you a fairly stable match for at least five\u00A0minutes, which is plenty of time to do most anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are more visually-inclined, Scott Manley does a better job of explaining it than I do, because he has pictures:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv
