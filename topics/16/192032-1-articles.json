Under many circumstances, on low-G worlds, the suspension settings will cause all four wheels to be constantly bouncing above the ground by a tiny distance. If they are not touching the ground, then there is no friction (duh). Generally you do this by choosing wheels appropriate to the mass of the craft and then adjusting the \u0022spring\u0022 setting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, the setting you want is called \u0022Friction\u0022, in the menu. It probably says \u0022Friction: Auto\u0022, with a button. Click the button once so that it says \u0022Manual\u0022. It will then give you a slider to adjust.

Damping is black magic, that you tweak blindly after you set the springs to the correct softness for the ride you want.
