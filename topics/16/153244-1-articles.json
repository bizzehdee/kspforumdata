That Klaw will then \u0027attach\u0027 to the lander can when you get close enough. It may take a few tries (as in: it may bounce off instead of attach) so don\u0027t worry if it does not attach on the first try. It is essentially a docking procedure, except the 2nd ship does not have a docking port, and you can just attach the Klaw anywhere you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurviving re-entry without everything blowing up is indeed your biggest challenge. But if you have managed to attach the Klaw in a symmetrical way to the lander can, then your ship just got a little longer and heavier. If the attachment is not symmetrical, then the combined ship may tumble around on re-entry and eventually blow up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExperienced players may try to put the Klaw inside a cargo bay, so that the lander can will attach inside the cargo bay. They then just close the doors, and fly home without problems. That makes the re-entry a lot easier, but the docking procedure (attaching the Klaw) is more difficult. Also, the ship is a lot larger, because you need a Mk3 cargo bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E = Sphere of Influence - if you are within the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E of a planet/moon, you can orbit it.

Attach the Klaw anywhere, and try to get to orbit around Minmus. Then (1) save your game, (2) release the cargo - hopefully it does not start to spin wildly, and (3) attach the Klaw again in a more symmetrical way. (4) Don\u0027t accept such contracts again.
