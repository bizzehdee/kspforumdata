I\u0027m having a little issue when I execute maneuvers with the RemoteTech Flight Computer in Realism overhaul. Most of the engines are unthrottleable and they can be only cut off, so when the Flight Computer ends the maneuver it tries to throttle down but the engine of course\u00A0doesn\u0027t stop. So I was wondering is there any workaround for this problem?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot using RemoteTech is not an option \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T06:53:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you know by roughly how much RT overshoots, then you can simply assign that much less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.
