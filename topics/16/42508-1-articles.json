I\u0027m not here to get into some argument over the relative manliness of using MJ for this, that, or the other. You asked a question and I\u0027m trying to give you an answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike it or not, in the specific case of interplanetary transfers, MJ is a very poor \u0022nav computer\u0022 because it\u0027s too anal about getting a perfect synch between your position in orbit around Kerbin and the timing of the ejection burn. So if you want your flotilla to arrive more or less at the same time at Duna, you CANNOT use MJ to plot the transfers because it will launch the ships weeks or months apart. So there\u0027s nothing for it but to do the maneuver nodes manually for each ship. End of story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, once the maneuver nodes are set, you\u0027re probably looking at ejection burns of 6-10 minutes for each ship in the flotilla. If you feel honor-bound to sit there and do all this manually, that\u0027s your business.
