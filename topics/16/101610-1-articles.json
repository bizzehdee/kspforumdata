It looks as if the planet was staying still and background (including Kerbol, moons, satellite orbits, etc.) was rotating around it. But when you activate the KSP window camera stops tracking: the background stays still and the planet begins to rotate.\n\nIs there a way (or may be a mod) to get the same effect in active KSP window to capture some fascinating videos?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T14:22:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 02:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shnyrik**"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T21:53:23Z","Content":"You can plant a flag, focus on it, head to map view, turn off all the indicators (to do this you will need to open up the navball, then hover your mouse near the top of the screen, then hide the navball) This should give you what you want."},{"CreatedByName":"TrevTrevarian","CreatedById":134252,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T22:21:34Z","Content":"I may be remembering this wrong, but I think that won\u0027t make the camera rotate, only translate relative to the movement of the surface.
