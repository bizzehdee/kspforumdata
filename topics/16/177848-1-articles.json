So any high drag aero parts (eg. mk2 parts) are also going to have high drag in the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, aero surfaces have increased lift under water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne big problem is that you can\u0027t\u00A0 \u0022rotate\u0022 your plane for liftoff when it\u0027s on the water. You can use canards and hydrofoils to raise the nose a little bit -- and that usually helps you pick up some speed. But using a conventional design with rear horizontal stabilizers is usually a non-starter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing a couple of small elevons or small wing parts below the water level as hydrofoils can help a lot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheFlyingKerman","CreatedById":182407,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-27T05:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are some major differences.

Two pairs of canards, a panther and 400 units of fuel gave this upside down rover a range of 300\u002Bkm at 50m/s and with some more experimentation I\u0027m sure I could have done better. (Check out the throttle position). Take the canards away and the range and speed become impossible. I\u0027ve used also canards on other boats with good results. Try using the authority limiter of the canards to get the boat out of the water and then adjust for cruising trim.
