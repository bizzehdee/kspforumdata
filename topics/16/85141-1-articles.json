The opposite direction (where you\u0027ve already been) is \u0022retrograde\u0022. (In space, the direction your craft is MOVING is not necessarily related to the direction your craft is POINTED.) You need to point your vehicle retrograde (\u0022backwards\u0022), and fire up the engine. This will slow you down, which in turn will lower your orbit. Lower your orbit enough and you will hit atmosphere, reenter, and eventually land. (You did bring parachutes along, right?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe navball (bottom center of your screencapture) can help you with this: the orange icon in the middle of the navball (looks like a letter V with wings) is the direction your spacecraft is pointed. The yellow icon slightly to its right on your screencap (looks like a circle with airplane wings and tail) is the prograde marker. If you turn your craft so those two icons line up, you will burn in the direction of travel--this will increase your velocity and your orbit will grow larger/higher. That is the opposite of what you want to do. So what you want to do is turn your craft around, and find the yellow icon that looks like a circle with an X in it and three rocket-fins. That marks \u0022retrograde\u0022. To de-orbit, line up direction icon with that retrograde icon and throttle up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ninja\u0027d. Multiple times.
