Fuel wise, there\u0027s not much difference; you\u0027re right in that all the liquid fuel tanks except for the Round-8 and Oscar-B have a 9:1 full-to-dry mass ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1b: Ideal mass for your spacecraft, huh? Well, for that you use the Rocket Equation: delta-V = Isp * Go * ln(M/Mo), where Isp is the specific impulse of your engine/stage, Go is standard gravity (9.81 m/s^2; ALWAYS), LN is the natural logarithm function, M is the total mass of your rocket and Mo is its dry mass (how much it weighs after the fuel\u0027s gone). To make orbit, you want ~4,550 m/s worth of delta-V. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very general answer to your question; \u0022ideal mass\u0022 is a concept you should probably forget about. The better question to ask is 1) what do you want to do and 2) what\u0027s the smallest craft I can build that will do that job. What you can measure is how much your payload weighs, and then figure out how much fuel and how much thrust it\u0027s going to need to get it where you\u0027re planning to send it. Learn the rocket equation: that\u0027s the best thing you can do. Learn how to run it backwards (i.e. start with how much delta-V you want) to figure out how much fuel you need for the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Yes it\u0027s possible. Just don\u0027t let go of the ladder (i.e. don\u0027t hit the space bar) once you\u0027re outside until you learn how to go jetpacking; there\u0027s a tutorial for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: You\u0027ll want to get to as many of the science instruments as you can as quickly as you can. The direct route is Starting Tech -\u0026gt; Basic Rocketry -\u0026gt; Survivability -\u0026gt; Science Tech -\u0026gt; Electrics / Space Exploration -\u0026gt; Advanced Electrics / Advanced Exploration -\u0026gt; Electronics -\u0026gt; Advanced Science Tech, but realistically you\u0027ll want some of the other technologies (Fuel Systems and General Contruction come to mind) to make your life easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I\u0027d do to start. Build a rocket consisting of a small parachute and Mk1 Command Pod, 10-12 FL-T200 fuel tanks and an LV-T30. Launch that with SAS on (T-key) and put it into a polar orbit (steer north or south instead of east after 10,000 m). Once you\u0027re in orbit, start doing EVA reports over the various biomes. Do a crew report while you\u0027re at it. Bring that back down and don\u0027t fret when parts of your ship start exploding when it gets back to the ground; you\u0027ll be fine once you\u0027re down to five tanks left. Recover and profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to fly that thing, it\u0027s straight up to 10k, then north at 45 degrees. Re-aim at the prograde marker once you\u0027re at or above 35 seconds to Apoapsis. Burn along the horizon once the time to Apoapsis exceeds one minute and keep burning until the apoapsis is up to about 125,000. Stop your burn but be ready to burn a little more if the Apoapsis falls below 70,000. While you\u0027re burning and after you\u0027ve turned at 10k, keep your gee meter right there at the top; don\u0027t let it get too far above the top of the meter and throttle back as necessary. Circularize at the Apoapsis. You should have enough fuel with the setup I suggested to do all of that and have a little left over to de-orbit at the end of the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T10:07:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething to add to the already plentiful answers to the question of \u0022why should I use part X over parts Y and Z if the end result is identical?\u0022:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that, while you are playing career mode, that is actually a very new thing that was only just added and isn\u0027t nearly complete.

Therefore, I recommend the following mission, Place a MK-1 Command Pod on the launch pad.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E With only the command pod on the launch pad, do the following;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E1. Conduct a Crew Report.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E2. EVA Jeb and do an EVA report.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E3. Take a soil sample on the launch pad.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E4. Return to the capsule and enter it.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E5. Recover the capsule.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis simple mission should net you some 12 Science Points which will enable you to unlock Tier 1 Parts so you can build a proper suborbital rocket for your next mission.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E Now, go to the Research Lab and spend some Science Points to unlock Tier one parts. This will give you a decoupler to separate the capsule from the spent rocket, Goo canisters for some simple research, and a bigger fuel tank.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EYour second mission; build a suborbital rocket;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E Using the MK-1 capsule, add the following;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E1. Place a parachute on the top\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E2. Using symmetry mode, place 2 Goo canisters on the side of the capsule. Be sure that the crew hatch is clear or Jeb won\u0027t be able to exit to do an EVA.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E3. Place a decoupler under the capsule.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E4. Place a stack of three FL-T400 fuel cans under the decoupler\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E5. place the LV-30 engine under that.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDo the mission as follows;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E1. Press T to activate automatic stabilization for launch.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E2. Hold the shift key down until the throttle indicator reads full.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E3. When ready, press the Space key to launch.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E4. Start a sub orbital turn at about 10,000 meters by pressing the D key and releasing it several times. It may help to press the F key to temporary turn off stabilization while making the turn. Practice will prefect what would be called a Gravity Turn.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E5. If you find that the G meter is getting out of the green throttle back with the Ctrl key until it comes back. Too much acceleration in the lower atmosphere causes excessive drag and waste fuel.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E6. Stage the rocket when it runs out of fuel and shuts down.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E7. Now, activate one of the Goo canisters and save the report.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E8. When you are in space, you will hear the music playing, do a Crew Report, activate and save the data on the second Goo canister, do an EVA but don\u0027t let go, do an EVA report, and return to the capsule.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E9. Turn off the stabilization by pressing the T key before reentering the atmosphere. The capsule will stabilize bottom down for reentry. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E10. When reentry heating and shock wave effect has completed and your speed has dropped below 500m/sec, hit the spacebar to deploy the parachute. It will deploy into drogue mode, then at 500 meters from the surface, deploy fully.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E11. When you land, either in the water or on land, do an EVA, take a soil sample, and return to the capsule. If you are unable to reenter, don\u0027t worry.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E12. Recover the capsule or Jeb.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E13. If the capsule couldn\u0027t be recovered because Jeb was outside, go to the Flight Center and recover the capsule from there.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E Go to the Research center with the 50 Science Points you have just earned and unlock all the Tier 2 parts. You can now build a multistage rocket to place you into orbit, go to Mun or Minmus, return, and get enough Science Points to start unlocking Tier 3 Parts. Do multiple missions in different biomes of those three places to unlock a ton of Science Points. Enjoy.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t be afraid to experiment with different designs.
