If the struts connect two seperate stages they will auto-disconnect upon staging. Also, if you undock a craft that is strutted to the main \u0022mothership,\u0022 the struts will auto-disconnect again.\n\nUnless it\u0027s for purely aesthetic reasons, but even then the struts disappear once they\u0027re disconnected. You can\u0027t actually see struts that aren\u0027t connected to anything.\n\nSo...I guess I don\u0027t really follow why you would need to disengage the struts independently..."},{"CreatedByName":"TYRT","CreatedById":72285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T18:55:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Put decouplers or docking ports underneath the struts.\n\nThanks man i tried decouplers, but docking ports are properly working."},{"CreatedByName":"QPDO","CreatedById":104760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T09:48:03Z","Content":"I use Extraplanetary Launchpads which allows an Engineer to scrap parts.
