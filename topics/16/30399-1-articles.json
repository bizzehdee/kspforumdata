When I try to course correct with my RCS thrusters it tilts my craft from my projected SAS heading and my SAS immediately kicks in and forces the RCS thrusters to fire in the opposite direction. Could this be from the fact that my RCS thrusters are not on my center of mass? This is just a theory of mine and havent been able to test it out myself yet.
