You have 552m/s of dV left in your current stage, so probably that bottom FL-T400 fuel tank (You appear to have two of them there) KSP Will always draw fuel from the furthest tank first, so your top FL-T400 drains to empty before your bottom FL-T400, and because of your decoupler your satellite fuel tank (The FL-T100) doesn\u0027t drain at all."},{"CreatedByName":"Starchaser","CreatedById":139724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T15:17:07Z","Content":"Both FL-400s show empty\n\nThe screen was too busy to be able to show them all in 1 pic.\n\nI scrolled in closer\n\n[![dj3O4G8.png](http://i.imgur.com/dj3O4G8.png)](http://imgur.com/dj3O4G8)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nGrr. well, you saw the FL-T100 in the first pic.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T15:16:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starchaser**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T15:26:28Z","Content":"A better pic would be helpful.
