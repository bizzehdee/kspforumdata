Bringing a dedicated vessel and leaving it behind may well be more economical. But there\u0027s a reason why the staging approach is so popular: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA craft that can barely take off from Tylo can handsomely \u003Cem\u003Eland and take off\u003C/em\u003E from Vall. It may then proceed to \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E Pol and Bop, landing on one and meeting the mothership at the other, allowing the MS to skip one Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith smart use of docking adapters, the same vessel may also be used as an upper stage on Laythe, but that\u0027s probably not as easy as it used to be in the olden days when aerodynamics were ridiculous. I strongly recommend you bring wings for Laythe: it\u0027s atmosphere is ridiculously thick even at 40-45km. A gliding entry will take forever but work well, and the wings are a lot lighter than the heatshields you\u0027d need otherwise. You don\u0027t need that many wings, by the way: if it\u0027s a half-decent glider on Kerbin, it will work nicely in Laythe\u0027s upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
