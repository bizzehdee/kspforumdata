However, if you don\u0027t mind the asteroid \u003Cem\u003Elosing\u003C/em\u003E mass on the way, install drills and an ISRU (and a small ore tank, it\u0027s required) on your asteroid mover. As you mine the ore, not only do you get to turn it into free fuel, but on top of that the mass of ore you mine is removed from the asteroid, making it lighter and easier to push.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust don\u0027t run the ISRU and the engines at the same time without having an amount of fuel in your tanks as a buffer. If you try to feed the engine on nothing other than the ISRU output, things bug out and your engine won\u0027t produce any thrust (but it still consumes the entire output).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T11:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy default astroid mover is an half lengt MK3 tank with 6 LV-N pointing down, stack on bottom with a set of large reaction wheels, isru, ore tank a long 1.25 meter rocket fuel tank for verniers. a strut with the claw and two drills, this comfortably moves class E, one option is to replace the MK3 with an rocket fuel tank even go hybrid engine.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow doing an gravity assist around kerbin is likely to save you a lot if Jool is near the launch window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T14:33:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave they updated Asteroid Day yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Sentinel camera (which, if I recall, was the only part from Asteroid Day not made stock) would \u0027find\u0027 asteroids that threatened the planet next out from its orbit, so putting one between Dres and Jool would generate new asteroids near Jool. \u00A0If you find them already there, then it takes a lot less brute force to move them where you want them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a pure-stock solution, you could start at Dres instead of Kerbin. \u00A0Good luck with the launch windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"max_creative","CreatedById":159640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T18:26:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m interested in this because\u00A0I\u0027m probably going to take the class C I have orbiting Kerbin and return it to its family (Dres)\u00A0I was thinking mun assist and when it gets to Dres rendezvous with it on a hyperbolic trajectory and switch asteroid tugs to\u00A0save time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your problem you need to save Delta-V on ejection from Kerbin.
