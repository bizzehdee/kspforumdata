The closest i can get to is in \u0027angle snap mode, but it tilts around the plate\u0027s node wrong and I cannot get it to work the way I would like. I also have ideas like MaceyDean\u0027s (youtube) \u0022Vulture\u0022 but these Ideas are impossible to achieve if I cannot get them to snap right. Does anyone have any pointers to how I can get it to snap in a way like the picture?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL:DR -- I need help finding angle snaps on objects so that I can create a greater variety of ideas. Can anybody help me?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drlambnz","CreatedById":70967,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T23:14:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMod \u002B w,a,s,d,q,e rotate the object by 5 degrees, I believe.
