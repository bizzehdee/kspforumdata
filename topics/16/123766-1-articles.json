Be aware that KSP can be finicky about clipping-- you can do it, but you\u0027re more likely to run into physics glitches if you do. With as much clipping as you\u0027re using, it\u0027s a miracle that the rover doesn\u0027t spontaneously blow up just sitting on the launch pad. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E If you can find a way to redesign your rover to not use so much clipping, you\u0027ll likely have a saner experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you\u0027re using the RoveMate as your probe core. That means that when you\u0027re sitting on the surface, your navball will be very confusing: your rover is \u0022looking\u0022 straight up at the sky, which will make it hard to steer. Suggest adding a forward-facing probe core (like an OKTO2) that you can then designate as \u0022Control From Here\u0022 when you\u0027re landed, so that your navball will be sane (the horizon will show what a forward-facing driver sees, with sky above and land below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is no doubt contributing to your reaction-wheel problems. When you tell the reaction wheel \u0022yaw left\u0022 by hitting the A key, that\u0027s based on an \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eupward\u003C/span\u003E looking viewpoint, which means it doesn\u0027t steer the rover towards the left, it will try to roll it over sideways. Total confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded to this is the fact that (rather confusingly) KSP maps rover steering controls to the same WASD by default that are used for controlling torque rotation. I solved this by remapping the rover steering controls from WASD to the numpad keys 8456, so that when I\u0027m steering my rover I\u0027m not also causing confusing torque commands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I noticed that in your rover you\u0027ve got a set of three torque wheels intersecting each other at right angles. I know you didn\u0027t do this for cosmetic reasons, since they\u0027re clipped inside the rover and invisible. Therefore, I assume you\u0027re trying to accomplish some sort of control this way. Be advised that you don\u0027t need to do this. A single reaction wheel works for torque on all axes. You don\u0027t need to make a \u0022sphere\u0022 out of them, just stack three of them normally if one isn\u0027t enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the summary of how to fix your rover:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
