That\u0027s probably not precise enough. My solution to that problem was creating a subassembly with two docking ports on an I-Beam to have a standardized connection I could place anywhere."},{"CreatedByName":"SoWeMeetAgain","CreatedById":145256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T07:16:22Z","Content":"well, no, that is not the problem, but thank you for the suggestion. As said when first docking they both connected. And I did copy the whole thing to make sure they were at the same distance, note that each of the legs has two halfsize tanks instead of one fullsize, thats why."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T07:28:52Z","Content":"Kerbal Attachment System lets you add struts in orbit, which give you the same stability you would normally use multi-docking for, but without the finickiness of multi-docking.
