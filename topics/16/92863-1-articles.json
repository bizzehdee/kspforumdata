I had attatched a Small Reaction Wheel to the Stayputnik, and I had experienced so broken parts with the rover so far. Plenty of electric charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was in rotational mode, I could make the rover move very slowly by making it walk like a rabbit, which isn\u0027t what I wanted from this rover. I couldn\u0027t make the wheels work at all. They would turn but they wouldnt \u0027go\u0027. First thing I tried was to move into linear mode, but nothing worked there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond thing I tried was to turn off the reaction wheel, no success there. I tried using Q and E and it worked well, and I got the rover spinning at 10000 rpm or so, but I couldn\u0027t make WASD work.

In the s creenshot, judging by the labeling on your Stayputnik, when you try to tell your rover to move \u0022forward\u0022, you\u0027re attempting to tell it to move at right angles to the way its wheels are pointing. Depending on orientation, rotation, and rover build, this can result in rover-driving being annoying or impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/v0.25/Screenshots/screenshot866.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot866.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a rover controlled by a probe brain, best practice is to have the brain positioned and rotated so that, if you were lying on top of the rover with your head at the front and your feet at the back, you could look down and read the label on the probe brain. That makes the navball horizon level, with the V in the arrow pointed downward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Hmm. After running some tests on Kerbin, it looks like as far as getting wheels to turn, probe orientation isn\u0027t /as/ important as I remembered it to be. (When actually /navigating/, or using MJ Rover autopilot, that\u0027s a different matter entirely) Guess I will have to throw my hat in with the \u0022Minmal Traction\u0022 crowd.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-15T00:19:49Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2014 12:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by maltesh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T23:54:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee, I set my rover controls to seperate buttons (IJKL) so they dont affect SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T23:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is very possible you are using your reaction wheels when trying to move your rover.
