The contract requires 2 EVA reports from 2 sites, and a low flying crew report at a third site. So on the surface of either of the EVA sites, I take EVA reports on the surface, but nothing seems to register or confirm my completion of the requirement. Am I misunderstanding the contract/how it works, or is it not working properly?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpenSpaceCorp","CreatedById":98977,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T05:58:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait never mind, I got it now!
