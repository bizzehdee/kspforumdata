I\u0027m going to presume you mean over 1000 meters per second, which is a lot faster than 1000 feet per second and very very fast to be coming in for a landing. If you were firing retro rockets, then you probably didn\u0027t have enough rocket for the mass of your craft, and I do have to ask if you were landing from a Mun orbit or directly from a transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly I\u0027m going to pick on you for a moment, \u0022Sorry for the bad spelling\u0022 is not an excuse. Computer spell check is ubiquitous, I use Google Chrome as my browser, spell check is on at all times by default. I\u0027m not saying you have to know how to spell, I\u0027m saying get your computer to fix it for you. Language barrier is one thing, but acknowledging you\u0027re going to spell badly in advance and then not doing anything to fix it is not acceptable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T20:45:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour spelling is impeccable, its your grammar that needs work.

It sounds as if you tried to land directly from a capture. Advice from me is to enter orbit first then go for landing. Also make sure you have enough power to slow down to 5 m/s or less for landing.
