Mostly there are problems between decouplers and liquid fuel tanks, but not always.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I doing wrong here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-14T17:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of using the large decouplers, I use the small ones and add 4 struts between the parts it connects.

The best work around is to just modify the part.cfg file for the large decoupler and increase its strength from 22 to something like 120-175. This is a temporary fix until .17 is released.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-14T18:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne word:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStruts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may be a little, say, \\\u0027overly dramatic\\\u0027 with them, but if there\\\u0027s something that falls off, wobbles extremely, or, in a catastrophic failures are the cause of it, attack it with struts. That\u0027s my advise. Just, don\u0027t overdo it, 4 is enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, symmetry helps a lot, too. There\u0027s a circle with a yellow dot in it on the top left hand corner of the VAB scene, to the right of tehe part menus. Left click to increase the amount of radial objects added, right click to decrease. Use symmetry with struts, too.

Another side of it however is how it is being flown, since that impacts the Max G and Max Q.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI highly recommend using the MechJeb mod to do an ascent for you first. If only to get an understanding of the optimal ascent profile for a given rocket. For example, if there is ample thrust-to-weight on first stage, MechJeb will throttle down to reduce wasting fuel on drag (although you will get more gravity loss, it will be less than drag loss at full throttle). This efficiency means more fuel weight later, so your max G is posponed to thinner air. While MechJeb is doing it\u0027s job, you can also keep a closer eye on the G loading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe decouplers may still fail. If so, you can then apply struts or change the design a little fix the problem, knowing that your not adding more weight and drag than needed for an optimal ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
