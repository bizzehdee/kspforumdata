The trick is stability, place ur CoG in front of ur CoL (CoG = center of gravity, CoL = center of lift). This SHOULD make your craft relativel stable. I personally use canards, and at least 2 control surfaces in teh back, as well as reaction wheels. reaction wheels, even if they are heavy, have 1 perk: they do not use any fuel (well they use electricity but 1-2 RTGs or some panels and ur set), so i strongly reccomend those if you choose to cut down on wing based controlk surfaces and prefer to stay away from RCS. Also, RCS has 1 more mega issue i forgot to mention, it is EXTREMELY inefficient. So inefficient that outside of very minor adjustments, its gonna take a crapton of fuel just o pull off a few dV. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, the best tip i have is to make it balanced, make the aircraft fly well without any control surfaces, then add some to give you some bit of control. Overall, using RCS/vernors mid-flight is a crutch, while it works for some extremely unstable craft (heck ive used them on some capital ships that just refused to fly straight), in general you want to make a craft that can fly straight, before using RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
