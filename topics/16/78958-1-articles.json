With really good piloting you can land from low orbit for only 2300 m/s, but most people spend a few hundred extra m/s on the final landing approach. 2600 m/s might be enough on the descent stage, but it could be pretty close. I would suggest 3000 m/s for the descent if it\u0027s your first time landing on Tylo. The ascent is much easier than the descent, even with low TWR, and can pretty easily be done for about 2500 m/s.

At Laythe you have the advantage that you can aerobrake straight into orbit, and at Tylo you have the advantage that you\u0027ll get rid of the heavy descent stage and won\u0027t have to carry it around everywhere.
