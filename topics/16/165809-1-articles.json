Follow a gradual curve so that you pass through 45 degrees at around 10km up and continue softly nudging it over little by little until you are horizontal by the time you reach 60 kilometers.

be able to engage at high altitudes or space.\u00A0 The nature of my designs has tended to result in the first stage burning out no higher than 26-27km (and that was on my too-steep profiles).\u00A0 I\u0027m probably losing a lot of efficiency from the Pug because it\u0027s being required to operate in the atmosphere too early.\u00A0 This is probably also why in my previous attempts at a shallower launch profile, I couldn\u0027t even get out of the atmosphere at all.\u00A0 Perhaps I should consider a heavier, more versatile rocket in the Stage 2 role, like the LV-T45 Swivel.\u00A0

With stock air, a good launch \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is 1.5 or so (at least it was last I checked; the old 1.6-1.7 rule may still apply). As you\u0027re flying along, watch your gee meter - if it climbs out of the green at any point, that\u0027s a cue to throttle the engine back. You don\u0027t need to change out the engine - just play with the throttle limiter until you get a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E in that range. You can always swap out the engine later if you need to, and you can always adjust the throttle limiter more in flight if you feel it necessary to do so.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe second-stage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is not high enough; \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E is telling you that much.

You\u0027re losing delta-V to gravity at that point. Your second craft has rectified this somewhat, but you\u0027re saying it\u0027s giving you control headaches.
