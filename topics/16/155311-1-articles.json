I have used the Mobile Processing lab (in kerbin orbit) to level-up kerbals who have gone to the mun and/or minmus, but did not get the expected results. For example, one particular kerbal has planted a flag on the mun, planted a flag on minmus, and is currently orbiting kerbin. After leveling up in the lab, her info in the astronaut complex shows: \u00A0\u0022orbit around kerbin=2, plant flag on mun=4, plant flag on minmus=3\u0022. \u00A0These numbers differ from the wiki\u00A0(\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience\u003C/a\u003E), which shows 5xp for mun flag and 6.25 for minmus flag. I\u0027m concerned my XP rewards will continue to be wrong as I head out to other planets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question, does the mobile lab not fully level up kerbals? Does Science mode XP work differently? Is there a setting for \u0022experience difficulty\u0022 that I didn\u0027t catch? Or, is this a sign that a mod is messing with my settings and I should head over to mod support to find out which one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MonsterBenny","CreatedById":173999,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-20T18:26:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI checked the XP of my Kerbals in my carreer mode game: Flag on Mun 5 XP, Flag on Minmus 6 XP.
