You can see by the intact struts that it can be launched in one launch (I used fairings but only for looks). Notice that I mounted the legs on the side tanks to make the lander wider and more stable The lander can drop the side tanks and legs to ensure it can make orbit again but has more than enough fuel to land, make one or two hops and return without dropping them. I have reused that specific lander for Mun trips probably 6 or 7 times, though I have replaced the command module twice now, the 2nd one used an LV-N and the 3rd used interstellar\u0027s plasma engine and beamed power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5IalNnX.png\u0022 alt=\u00225IalNnX.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bWa0U9g.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bWa0U9g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d2FqD8Y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022d2FqD8Y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T09:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a guide to designing and building your own vehicle to meet your requirements, I would suggest the following.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart with a lander - basic requirements are that it has sufficient dV to de-orbit at the Mun, land and then regain orbit. Include RCS fuel and thrusters so that you can rendezvous with your command ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, design your command ship. At the very minimum, this only needs enough dV to return to Kerbin from the Mun. If you use aerobraking, you don\u0027t even need enough fuel to establish orbit at Kerbin on your return. A minimum fuel command ship like this will rely on your lifting stage to get it in to orbit around the Mun though. If you want to have a craft that more closely emulates an Apollo style mission, your command craft will need to have enough dV to do a Munar insertion burn from LKO, and also a Munar orbit burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have both of these craft, you then just need a launch vehicle. It should only need 2 stages. The first to get it close to orbit at Kerbin. The second will complete the orbit burn. If you have gone with a low dV command module, this second stage will also need to have enough fuel to do the Munar insertion and orbit burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hacktech","CreatedById":57094,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T11:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all your help.
