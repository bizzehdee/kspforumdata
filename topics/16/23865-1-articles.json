My space-station has a Lander-can directly connected (on top of) a Hitchhiker Storage Container yet when I\u0027m in IVA \u0022mode\u0022 all I can do is look around the Lander Can and not move to another area despite the fact that everything is either on top of one another or connected with Hull Mounted Clamp-o-trons and Robomax Humbax Multi-Point Connectors...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this simply not possible right now?
