For example, would four engines with an impulse of lets say 320, give me a total impulse of 1280? Which when we times by G, give me a Vexh of 12552.704 for use in the rocket equation? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause when using this to calculate my \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV, I seem to end up with a ridiculously high number (around 10000m/s) which should be more than enough to leave Kerbin on an orbital trajectory. However, I am not seeing these results in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso on a side note, I would be really grateful if anyone could explain why whenever I am flying a 3-man capsule, using the larger stock parts, about 15,000m up my craft suffers insane amounts of G-force and tears itself apart? The craft literally bends in on itself sometimes, or a structural failure between two connected fuel tanks sends the rocket motor plowing into the rest of the rocket. I have no trouble getting to the Mun and back with the smaller parts and 1-man capsules, but 3-man capsules continue to elude me, even after directly copying other peoples successful designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-01T14:34:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Darkstorm406 and welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I can\u0027t answer your question, other people here will be able to, though I will say that even with \u0022on paper\u0022 excellent performance numbers, you have to take into consideration the increased mass of the engines and fuel needed to feed them, which would reduce your real world performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the second issue though, it is now easy to overstress your craft with the new engines especially at high altitudes where the atmospheric resistance drops off, so watch your G meter, plus the new decouplers seem to be too feeble as well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit, I should have mentioned, when at higher altitudes, to avoid over stressing the craft, reduce the throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-01T14:41:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2012 02:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCardinal","CreatedById":22874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-01T14:49:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe formula you use doesn\u0027t take gravity and resistance (drag) into account (which counteract the acceleration by the rocketengine(s)).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you launch a craft with MechJeb (the ascend pilot) and press the stats button, a screen with all kinds of information will enlighten you completely.

If four engines have a specific impulse of 320 each, then all of them together will still have a specific impulse of 320. As you know, specific impulse is related to the exhaust velocity. If you think about it, each rocket engine has it\u0027s own exhaust velocity, and putting more of the same rocket engines next to each other will not increase their exhaust velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets more complicated if you\u0027re using more than one engine with different specific impulse values.
