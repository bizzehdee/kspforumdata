Click it if it says orbital or surface.\n\nNext, on your navball, turn the ship towards the pink circle in a circle. That\u0027s towards the target.\n\nIf you have RCS on your ship, touch h/n to go forward/backwards, and ijkl for translation.\n\nAs you get near, line up your ship so the ports will face each other for a flush contact."},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T21:35:10Z","Content":"It sounds like you\u0027ve got the hard part down.\n\nIf both you and your target can maneuver, I suggest switching to your target, control that craft from the docking port, then right clock on your ship\u0027s docking port, and point its docking port to your ship. Then switch back to your ship and point your docking port at your target\u0027s docking port.\n\nThen you can just lightly tap the \u0027h\u0027 key with RCS enabled to send yourself toward the docking port.\n\nKeep the relative speed under .2 m/s and you should be docked in no time!"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T22:13:37Z","Content":"Sounds like a station-keeping problem. With your navball in \u0022target\u0022 mode (click the text that says \u0022orbit\u0022 or \u0022surface\u0022 on the top), point retrograde and thrust forward with your engines or RCS thrusters (The \u0022H\u0022 key) until your velocity reads 0 m/s, or as close as you can manage.\n\nThen try again: Face the target (Purple circle on navball), switch to second ship, have it face the first ship, then thrust forward with either to dock. Should be MUCH easier."},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T23:12:08Z","Content":"I went away from the game for about a year, last time I played was .23-ish I think. I didn\u0027t have any trouble docking at that time. Now... sheesh. The target marker in the nav-ball jumps around all over the place. I can\u0027t match velocity to save my life. It\u0027s like the effing ships have a mind of their own. SAS seems to be broken, especially if any RCS is in play. Sometimes the rate of closure approaches 0 meters per second, but it does not stay there and sometimes I swear the two vessels are actually accelerating away from one another with no imput. These are very simple craft I\u0027m trying to dock.\n\nI\u0027m tempted to load up the old version and see if it\u0027s me, or the game."},{"CreatedByName":"spacedoctor42","CreatedById":138696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T04:59:28Z","Content":"Got it!!! The ship was upside down which made the RCS controls a bit wonky."}]}
