This was a tough one.. tougher then i thought it would be. I messed up and had to slingshot around the sun to correct myself and at one point i was low enough to be registered as flying on the surface of the sun. To be honest i was worried id worried id burn up lol. but all was good. I noticed the lower i got the greater my speed was.... it was rocketing up once i went below 10k .... just wondering how low others had got to the sun and also how much speed you managed to boost out of it with? Im tempted to try useing this method to slingshot a heavy as hell science outpost to eeloo without dragging it there in parts lol\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-03T00:01:17Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2014 12:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by chenzo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T00:02:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WUNMatwl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WUNMatwl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done it before...it needs so much \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to happen with a Hohmann transfer.
