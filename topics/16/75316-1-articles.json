Unfortunately, I didn\u0027t have enough liquid fuel, so I had to use my RCS system to get back to Kerbin - and I had enough. I went into Munar orbit first then started my \u0022burn\u0022 to get back to Kerbin. As I was about to get into Kerbin orbit, using my full RCS forward thrusters, my ship blew up. Any idea why? I mean it was a simple craft at that point with a command module with solar panels, two RCS tanks, and four thrusters. Do they overheat? I didn\u0027t see anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T19:57:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERCS doesn\u0027t overheat, and a Pic of the craft in question would help. It sounds like a Kraken attack, but I can\u0027t understand why such a simple ship would summon the Kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asb3pe","CreatedById":112330,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T20:05:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis same exact thing happened to me just now. I was landing at Mun, I hit the M key to zoom out to orbital map, and suddenly a HUGE explosion happened and my lander was gone. I had no idea what exploded or why, although I think I narrowed it down because I almost always do an F5 quicksave unless I forget. In this case, I had a quicksave, so I loaded it up and I discovered my monopropellant tank (for the RCS thrusters) was almost empty. So what I think happened was that I was controlling my lander from the orbital map and made a correction that didn\u0027t execute properly because of the fuel running out. I must have impacted the surface. But wow did it ever scare me because it was a very loud explosion with a lot of bright flashes and, of course, I was not expecting it at all. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly this doesn\u0027t apply to the OP because it doesn\u0027t seem they were anywhere near the Mun surface.
