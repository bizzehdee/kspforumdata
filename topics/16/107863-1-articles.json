From what I\u0027ve read, the problem seems to be the centre of mass. When the centre of mass, due to fuel usage moves closer to the middle of your rocket, the more unstable your craft becomes. With my rockets, i am fine for a while, but then a slight nudge and it goes out of control. For this reason, i plan on building much heavier bottoms and taller rockets, to try and get the centre of mass as far down as i can. Might even add structural fuesale to act as a blocker to maintain the mass at the bottom as the fuel dissapears to make it more stable.\n\nNot tested these ideas out, but, hopefully we can find a solution together.

Then try to keep your centre of drag near your centre of mass. Having the centre of drag behind the centre of mass (with respect to velocity direction) will ensure the rocket is stable regardless of its attitude but if it is too far back you won\u0027t be able to steer at all. It is possible to maintain forward flight even in an unstable configuration so long as you keep the too aligned or have the attitude authority to overcome the drag torque. But if you turn too hard the drag applies a larger and larger torque (positive re-enforcement) and the rocket flips. Its a balance between the manuverability you want and the positive feedback."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T12:53:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You want to keep your centre of mass high not low.\n\nThis! ^^^ Remember that darts have the heavy bit forward and the feathers at the back; the fact that you have a self propelled dart doesn\u0027t change anything about the aerodynamics of it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nOne common issue during flight is if you\u0027ve used many short fuel tanks to build a long rocket.

On the next rocket I\u0027ll try fuel lines. Pumping from the bottom tank into the tank above, from there into the tank above, all the way up into the top tank. The payload on top is normally the heaviest piece, so that should keep CoM and CoL pretty close together and improve stability a lot.

Only the upper stages usually will be smaller, but that doesn\u0027t mean they have to be lighter compared to the relative size of the 1st stage.\n\nHowever, you only need a top heavy rocket until you are out of the dense lower atmosphere.
