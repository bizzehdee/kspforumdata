Got my Munar orbit just how I wanted it. Saved enough fuel in my final stage to get back to Kearth and deployed my landing gear and began my descent. I had myself slowed down to about 17m/s watching the altitude and making sure to keep my nose pointed in the opposite direction of my velocity vector, and when my altitude is 883m BOOM! I crashed. The Kerbilnauts survived and the capsule is intact, but there is no hope of a return to Kearth. I constructed the ship out of stock parts and have attached a picture of it.

Secondly, 17m/s is a bit fast. Anything over 10m/s and you risk damage to your ship. I actually try to keep it below 7m/s or so, to be on the safe side. Thirdly, some of us like to use RCS for last-minute extra-braking, but there\\\u0027s difference of opinion about that. Other than that, it just takes practice. And seriously, crashing a few times beforehand just makes you feel that much more triumphant the first time you pull it off. Take lots of celebratory screenshots.

You could get rid of those, and use the available mass for another lander leg or three. I like to have at least four legs, so that the touchdown shock is more distributed, and so that it stays upright if one leg breaks. If you have that fourth leg, touchdown at 5-7 m/s is quite reasonable. With six, you can hit even harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah: for even more sturdification, you can add two struts to each leg.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khrissetti","CreatedById":29557,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-05T15:13:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, your best bet is to utterly ignore the atimeter, I\\\u0027ve found it worse than useless below 5km (above that I use the map) just watch for shadows and the point when your exhaust sinks below the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eversion 0.16 needs to have a proper laser altimeter. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anachronda","CreatedById":23187,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-05T15:18:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to look past your ship on the main screen and watch the terrain rise up to meet you, because that\\\u0027s the only way to tell when you\\\u0027re about to touchdown. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my computer, there\\\u0027s a spot where the terrain behind the ship changes from fuzzy grey to a crisp field of boulders.

But it\\\u0027s part of the fun! \u003Cp\u003EI haven\\\u0027t made up my mind about the optimal number of landing legs. More does distribute the shock better, but I also found that more legs means more chances of springing back into the (lack of) air and more chances to snag on the surface and spin the ship around. My big problem when I was first landing is that I would touchdown gently, then go sproing-flip-boom. I found that my lander would \u0027stick the dismount\u0027 better when I reduced the number of legs to 3 or 4.
