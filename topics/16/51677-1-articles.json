However, things were not as I expected them to be. For instance: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) For some odd reason all my fuel gets used-up simultaniously although I have an asperge style motor lay-out. I\u0027ve done everything the youtubers explained how, but the results are, I end up with all tanks empty at the same time. What to do? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Does anybody know how to transfer fuel, say from the space station to a docked vehicel. Again I\u0027ve seen this on youtube, but when I dock, my fuel stay\u0027s where it is. I can\u0027t select anything that would make a transfer possible. Again; What to do? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Is it (or in my instance: schould it) even be possible to transfer fuel or electricity from one part of my ship to another? So, internal fuel transfer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) On youtube I saw that people have a very active SAS with even the motors and the finns participating. You see them switching and wabbeling all the time. Not with me. I only see some changes when I press the wsad key\u0027s. Is my SAS not working properly? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) On youtube I also saw that it is possible to have a look inside the cockpit. What is the key for that, because I coudn\u0027t find the command for it in the the settings, literally no key on my keyboard makes it happen and I can\u0027t select this option when I click on the module. What to do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help a fellow player out\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T09:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to Gameplay Questions \u0026amp; Tutorials. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow then... let\u0027s see...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Connecting the bottom of your first asparagus to the top of the second makes sure you have a straight line of tanks in order without any \u0027junctions\u0027 in your line. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the example of a 4 jumbo tank asparagus with small pancake tanks underneath. Say you have fuel flowing from one pancake tank to the other. Upon starting the engines, the jumbo in asparagus one will be the furthest from all engines, being at range 2 for stage one and at range 3 for stage two. Once that tank empties, stage one will burn the pancake tanks fuel. Here\u0027s where the change lies: stage two engines will have the pancake tank from stage one at range 2, and the jumbo tank from their own stage at range 2 as well. This makes that for a very short amount of time, you are drawing fuel for the two mainsails in stage two from both the pancake tank and the orange tank. This makes the pancake tank empty ever-so-sightly later, but since you still have 2 full and two half mainsails feeding off the pancake, it won\u0027t make much difference. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZEoCaJ3.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/ZEoCaJ3.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats how it goes for asparagus in my memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Nevermind, my explanation is invalid.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-04T08:51:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2013 08:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spyritdragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T13:16:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Evexx32- \u0022The lines should also go from the \u003Cem\u003Ebottom\u003C/em\u003E of the outer stacks to the \u003Cem\u003Etop\u003C/em\u003E of the inner ones.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel lines don\u0027t have to go the the top of the next tank, they can go on the bottom tank on the next stack too.

It might have been so in earlier versions of the game but now it is different. The distance of the tank does not play role. The set of rules how fuel is drawn is simple but a I have hard time putting them to words. In any case in phase 2 of your picture, the right engine draws fuel just from the pancake connected by the pipe. Only when left engine runs completely out of fuel, right engine starts drawing fuel from its own stack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T18:39:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eprof.paljas, pictures of your ship would help others diagnose question #1.
