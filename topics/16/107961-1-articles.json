How.\n\nThe answer(s) have been strewn in this thread already, but I\u0027ll try to roll it up into a single guide.\n\nThe basics:\n\n1. put a sufficient amount of chutes on the stage you want to recover.\n2. toggle the chutes together with the decoupler\n3. in a quiet moment, visit the tracking center\n4. by default, debris is not show. Mouse over the different icons to identify them, toggle debris on\n5. select any debris from the list (or click on the map), then \u0022recover\u0022\n6. PROFIT!\n7. if there is no probe core or other command module, you will get no recovery dialog (and if there is, the parts will not be \u0022debris\u0022, but a \u0022probe\u0022). But you still get money, justcheck your bank account before and after recovery.\n\nThe Problem:\n\nAny pieces that are a) sufficiently far away from your active vessel, and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) moving too deep in the atmosphere, WILL BE DESTROYED. That means:\n\n- You can easily recover the smaller solid rocket boosters that burn out early in your ascent. They can land safely before you get out of physics range.\n- You can also recover very late stages that almost made it to space: after your vessel has circularised, open map view and switch vessels to the debris you care about, then watch it land.\n- Any stages you detach in-between are pretty much impossible to recover.\n\nRecovering late stages is a lot of hassle; besides, those tend to fall on the far side of Kerbin for very little recovery value. It can be done, though, and if you\u0027re the kind of person who wants to do it just because, you may find it quite enjoyable. Hint: the task becomes much easier if you\u0027re launching into a 100km orbit rather than the usual 70-and-a-bit. Another hint: check the impact tolerance of the different engines, boosters and the likes -- some are quite resilient and don\u0027t need many chutes to land safely."},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T02:45:01Z","Content":"I use SSTO rockets with probes on them.

Even if you attach a parachute to a booster you discard at 500m, it is almost impossible it touches land safely before you travel too far and it is discarded.

Anyway watching a reentry and adding parachutes for an engine and a few tanks falling far away from the KSC seems hadly worth it).\n\nThe orbiting/trans-Munar stage is easily recoverable. If you separate once reentry trajectory, it wont fall too far away from the main vehicle.\n\nI even do not separate and use the 909 engine as a reentry shield and put the pod and the science between the engine and the fuel tanks.
