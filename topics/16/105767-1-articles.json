So after lots of trial and error, I\u0027ll resort to ask for some help trying to capture myself in orbits around Duna \u0026 Eve (Probably every other planet too.)\n\nI\u0027ve set up two missions, one to Duna, one to Eve to land a small probe. For the first mission to Duna, I followed the tutorials and used the mechjeb interplanetary porkchop maneauver planner to setup my burn to Duna.\n\nQue a few hundred days later, I arrive in the Duna system.\n\nBut where the tutorial mentions that aerobraking can be thrilling with speeds up to 2km/s, my probe happily dives to Duna at a good 8km/s. Even skimming the surface at just I ended up needing to go down to about 5km above the surface to slow down sufficiently.\n\nEve just about the same story, as my probe plunges towards the planet, it goes along at 8km/s, if not closer to 9km/s.\n\nSo far I\u0027ve dipped into the atmosphere to about 90km altitude, but with little effect on my speed, or my final orbit.\n\nI\u0027d go lower, but I understand that doing so would most likely result in rapid unplanned disassembly due to the thick atmosphere.\n\nAm I doing something wrong in my captures to get these speeds? Usually I leave notes of my missions, but unfortunately, I don\u0027t have anymore notes about my escape burn from Kerbin. An earlier safe did show my Duna Probe cruising in a Kerbol orbit towards Duna at 14,5km/s (If that helps.)\n\nMany thanks for any feedback !"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:06:13Z","Content":"Those are... really high speeds. Are you running a realism mod perchance? Failing that, can you show picture of your approach in map view? With stock KSP, those would be some seriously hyperbolic orbits. As for one last thing, what is the navball set to? (In terms of orbital/surface/target)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kip336","CreatedById":131629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:10:10Z","Content":"Hey UmbralRaptor, thanks for your post! Navbal has been set to Orbit (Though, surface shows a speed that\u0027s not too different (Less then 1k/s)) No realism mods that change orbital physics.\n\nImages attached.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Unless those tutorials/examples where done in 1.0 (which has only been out for a few days), then they were done in the old aerodynamics system which provided a lot more drag."},{"CreatedByName":"Kip336","CreatedById":131629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:45:37Z","Content":"But this is 0.25 with the old aerodynamics."},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:26:51Z","Content":"That\u0027s... ah... an interesting transfer. Why is your periapsis down at Moho?

Can you do a transfer to an airless body (i.e. Duna) using only within say 1000 dV of what is listed in a DeltaV map ([http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png)?](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png%29?)
