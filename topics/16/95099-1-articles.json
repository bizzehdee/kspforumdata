I haven\u0027t watched how much reputation my missions had given me so far, but when I checked my amount and found it to be a bit over 900, it sounded about right for how much I had been getting per mission on average, but could have been a bit low perhaps. Certainly not as low as the amount I was about to get...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I tried a new strategy: appreciation campaign 25%, 1 reputation for every 22.6 funds. My contracts were listing the correct reduction in funds pay and the correct gain in reputation (a VERY high amount), but upon completing two contracts which together should have yielded a total of around 1700 reputation, I come back to find that I have 935. I don\u0027t remember exactly how much it was immediately before, but it was over 900.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I watched more carefully, and did another contract. This time I started with 935 reputation and the contract claimed to be paying 627 reputation, with \u002B518 being from my appreciation campaign (109 base reputation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon completing the contract, I checked my reputation and it was listed at 941. Instead of gaining 518, I only gained 6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had no other active strategies when this happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have never checked reputation gain before but it always seemed out of whack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe method I have been using to check reputation: launch a capsule on the pad, and recover it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this bugged, or is there something I\u0027m missing? And furthermore, what is reputation even for? I have suspected it helps give you better contracts but upon closer scrutiny that seems to only happen from going places and unlocking new science technology. I was hoping to see what it does by dramatically increasing my reputation through a clearly overpowered strategy, but it actually seems like it backfired and reduced my reputation gain.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-31T07:39:28Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2014 07:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T07:10:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReputation is caped at 1000.
