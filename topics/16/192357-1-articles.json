I think I have a good approximation using excel (but not so much on the calculus). I modeled acceleration, thrust, weight, drag and have an approximation to drag through the sound barrier. I have assigned a drag coefficient that seems to work. My model works pretty good launch and through sound barrier. After \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E burnout I model a ballistic trajectory to descent back through the sound barrier as far as chutes out and my sim is over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProblem \u003C/strong\u003E: Ascent Velocity from immediately past sound barrier \u0026gt; 360m/s to engine burnout and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E isnt matching my model and is out buy about 5%.

I think it might be temperature. I read on the wiki that atmospheric temperature doesnt have much effect on the game but I think it does something. Its maybe nothing to do with comming out of the sound barrier its that the vessel is entering the stratospheric temperature gradient around 12500m, I\u0027m going to add atmo temp profile see if that helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pirate Roberts","CreatedById":203204,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-18T03:26:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes the\u00A0 RT-10 thrust change during the last 10 seconds or 10% of burn?

Indeed the thrust will rise along with the Isp as atmospheric pressure drops, in exactly the same manner as the other rocket engines. The \u0022flameout at 10%\u0022 thing in engine stats only applies to jet engine intake air. Once an air-breathing engine is only capable of 10% of its nominal max thrust (I think?) it stops working until it begins drawing enough air again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-19T19:21:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2020 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Rocket Witch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
