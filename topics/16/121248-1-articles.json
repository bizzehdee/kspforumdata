An indicator light would be a very small, \u0022massless\u0022 part that is surface-attachable and would be both cheap and very low in the tech tree. It doesn\u0027t actually cast any light, it just lights up (like the windows on the Mk2 cockpit). Color is tweakable. It has a toggle action that by default goes in the \u0022lights\u0022 action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, it would just be a cosmetic part, but I can think of lots of uses, mainly when grouped with some other piece of equipment in an action group. For example, an indicator to show when an engine or whatever is toggled on or off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nookos","CreatedById":144067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T07:09:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/16925-1-0-4-Aviation-Lights-v3-7-(16DEC14)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAviation lights\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57778-1-0-Surface-Mounted-Stock-Alike-Lights-for-Self-Illumination\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esurface lights\u003C/a\u003E mods would help you.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T07:21:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nookos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nookos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/16925-1-0-4-Aviation-Lights-v3-7-(16DEC14)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAviation lights\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57778-1-0-Surface-Mounted-Stock-Alike-Lights-for-Self-Illumination\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esurface lights\u003C/a\u003E mods would help you.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth of those have emissives.
