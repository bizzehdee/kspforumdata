How bout a \u0022space boat\u0022? I know from lurking around the forum, that you\u0027ve been around for a while, so you should have the know how. Just today I was working on craft built in the SPH, employing rapiers, (due to their high impact figures). I had a \u0022boat\u0022, launched off the runway, and slowly taxied down to the ( I call it the \u0022kerblantic ocean ). I slowly slipped it into the drink, and gradually increased the throttle. It drank jet fuel like crazy, but it ended up making it about 3/4 of the way to runway island, and reaching just about 19 MS., and then ran out of fuel. But in the mean time, I took some screen shots, because it was creating this fantastic rooster tail, which I didn\u0027t think the games graphics were capable of. It was awesome! I know this is not a \u0022spacecraft\u0022, and this is more down to \u0022Kerth\u0022, but the concept of Kerbal boating is intriguing to me.
