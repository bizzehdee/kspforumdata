Kerbin, while your probe still has power and is slowly descending into Jools abyss. The cheapest antenna will still be transmitting the thing (and the gravioli data. And the temperature. And the pressure) when it already sinks and is crushed by pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand in future those antennae will have a certain range. I mean, they do look like that. But for now, a speedy data transmission, especially the atmospheric (which is a lot to transmit), makes sence when your probe is entering the alien atmosphere with a 100 percent chance to die, and soon. Make sure you have plenty of batteries with you for that last stage though. 4000 electric units total should be enough to transmit everything you would want to, in the last minute of your probes life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGive it a thought : )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sunsparc","CreatedById":57309,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T23:27:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe real difference is seen for those of us who have RemoteTech2 installed.
