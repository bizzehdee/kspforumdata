I recently built an SSTO, which, when it goes supersonic, loses the ability to pitch up. This tends to go away once it\u0027s almost hypersonic, but some altitude is lost and it would probably save some fuel if this didn\u0027t happen. Is there a way to better deal with this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7vhQ17d.png\u0022 alt=\u00227vhQ17d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-17T21:01:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2014 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dizzle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T20:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake it less stable or add more pitch control. The problem is that the CoL is shifting backwards as you head into supersonic flight. This makes the plane more stable. When the plane becomes more stable, it takes more pitch authority to change its angle of attack. If you make it less stable you\u0027ll counteract that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem might just be that the relatively low sweep angle of your main wing is creating a lot of drag at supersonic speeds and that is enough to hurt your pitch authority. Sweeping the wings more or replacing them with delta wings might help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T21:01:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the quick reply, knowing what causes it really helps me out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T21:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only other problem I see is your intakes are mounted high on the craft, which is creating drag on the top and behind the CoM which is pulling your nose up.

The CoM is also probably further forward than it looks because the VAB counts the mass of the landing gear, but they\u0027re massless in actual flight. I don\u0027t envy you the task of trying to reenter and land it with empty tanks. As Ferram said, you need more pitch control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also notice you have B9 installed.
