While an orbit of Minmus at 70km might take a little over an hour and half of that orbit will be over the night\u00A0side\u00A0of\u00A0Minmus\u2018 surface (or any planet/moon), the time that the orbiting spacecraft is in Minmus\u2019 shadow is quite a bit less than half of an orbit. Minmus casts a conical shadow pointing directly away from the sun:\u00A0on the surface this means that sunlight and shadow are approximately equal but in space the extra altitude means that there\u2019s a longer arc before you enter the shadow on both sides of the orbit, reducing the time that the vessel is in shadow; with an inclined orbit- which you\u2019ll be using for SCANsat scanning- that number comes down even more as depending on the positions of Minmus and Kerbin you can have times where the shadow is perpendicular to your orbit so the vessel is in constant sunlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would try to draw a diagram, but I\u2019m not on my PC and it would probably be terrible anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-27T09:04:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the heads-up on that mod.

Can this be right or did I mess up somewhere?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s go through it step by step.\u00A0 There are certain assumptions and simplifications that we can (and should!) apply to this problem, but the overall result will still be close enough to correct.\u00A0 First, however, since your issue is more about your assumed expectations, let\u0027s look at the problem more abstractly and see what insights we get from it to correct your intuition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor one thing, your orbit radius is a bit over twice Minmus\u0027s radius (remember that an altitude of 70,000 metres is actually 130,000 metres from Minmus\u0027s centre).\u00A0 In terms of the abstraction, let\u0027s call it exactly twice and work from that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Minmus is at half of the orbital radius, what then?\u00A0 If we assume that the orbit is a unit circle,\u00A0that the sun shines from the left side of the graph, and that Minmus\u0027s shadow is a cylinder (projected to be a rectangle--the point is that it does not taper), then Minmus\u0027s bulk will cover the right side of the orbit to half of the orbit\u0027s maximum\u00A0height above the x-axis.\u00A0\u00A0Thus,\u00A0we want the angle that leads to a point y = .5 on the unit circle.\u00A0\u00A0 We can solve that with trigonometry:\u00A0 arcsin (.5 / 1) = 30\u00B0.\u00A0 Of course, Minmus covers a portion of the shadow below the x-axis, too, so we need to double the angle.\u00A0\u00A0The total included angle is therefore 60\u00B0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can get that value another way, courtesy of our abstraction:\u00A0 if the orbit is twice Minmus\u0027s radius, then the size of the shadow, which itself is twice Minmus\u0027s radius, will equal the orbit radius.\u00A0 Since the distance from the origin to the edge of the shaded part of the orbit is going to be one orbit\u00A0radius for both the upper and lower edges of the shadow, it altogether makes an equilateral triangle, so the included angle is definitely 60\u00B0.\u00A0 Since your actual orbit is slightly larger than double Minmus\u0027s radius, we can safely expect that the true included angle will be near\u00A0to but less than this value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of the fractional coverage of the larger orbit, 60\u00B0 is one sixth of the total orbit, and of course the total is the full circle at 360\u00B0.\u00A0 If you expect a darkness time of 30 - 45 minutes, then you expect an orbital period of 180 - 270 minutes, or 3 to 4.5 hours (actually slightly more).\u00A0 If you\u00A0find your orbital period in KSP, you\u0027ll see right away that that does not make sense.\u00A0 The reasons why are\u00A0less intuitive, but it\u0027s simple enough to check.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbital period is better to use, but your orbital speed is the first parameter that KSP displays, so let\u0027s work with that, instead.\u00A0 I\u0027ll show the calculation later, but for now let\u0027s assume that it is at or very near to 116.5 m/s.\u00A0 The circumference of a 130,000-metre circular orbit is 816,814 metres, so going around that orbit at that rate gives a period of 116.85 minutes.\u00A0 Thirty minutes of darkness is a little more than one quarter of that orbit.\u00A0 Forty-five minutes is closer to forty percent--and that should immediately feel absurd, because fifty percent coverage is what you get \u003Cem\u003Eat the surface\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Forty percent coverage requires you to be\u00A0so close to surface\u00A0altitude that to achieve it should have you crashing into the mountaintops.\u00A0 One sixth of the\u00A0orbit gives about 19.5 minutes, but again, we\u0027ve already shown that the actual value will be somewhat less than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow to the more precise calculations:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinmus has a standard gravitational parameter,\u00A0\u03BC, of 1.7658 x 10\u003Csup\u003E9\u003C/sup\u003E m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E and a radius, r, of 60,000 metres.\u00A0 A circular\u00A0orbit at 70,000 m altitude has a semimajor axis, a, of 130,000 metres, which is equal to the orbital radius at all points on the orbit.\u00A0 This orbit thus has an orbital speed, v, of:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv =\u00A0\u221A(\u03BC / a)\u003Cbr\u003E\nv =\u00A0\u221A(1.7658 x 10\u003Csup\u003E9\u003C/sup\u003E / 130000)\u003Cbr\u003E\nv =\u00A0\u221A(13583.1)\u003Cbr\u003E\nv = 116.5 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinmus\u0027s shadow cone technically ought to vary in length over the course of its orbit about Kerbin.\u00A0 Since neither Minmus\u0027s orbit nor Kerbin\u0027s have any eccentricity, the constraints on the variation, and thus also the variation in taper angle, should be relatively easy to determine.\u00A0 However, for one thing, this orbit is close enough to Minmus that approximating Minmus\u0027s shadow as a\u00A0cylinder with no taper will work more than adequately (it will slightly overestimate the darkness time, but not by a lot), and for another thing, I don\u0027t know how faithful KSP is to the realities of physics in this case.\u00A0 I would like to assume that it is accurate but I have neither tested it\u00A0nor seen anyone else do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder these assumptions, the included angle of the shadowed arc of the orbit, \u03B8, is given by twice the arcsine of the body radius, r, divided by the orbital radius, R:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u03B8 = 2 * arcsin (r / R)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u03B8 = 2 * arcsin (60000 / 130000)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u03B8 = 2 * .479729 rad\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u03B8 = .95946 rad or 54.97\u00B0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe arc length of the shadowed portion of the orbit, l, is given by the included angle multiplied by the orbital radius:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nl = R * \u03B8\u003Cbr\u003E\nl = 130000 * .95946\u003Cbr\u003E\nl = 124,729.4 m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the previously-calculated (constant) rate of speed, your vessel will cover this length in time
