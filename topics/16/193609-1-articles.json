Unless you\u0027re docking something else big and heavy it\u0027s going to be easier to move that docking craft\u00A0around the station to line it up with the docking port you want to dock to. The Docking Port Alignment Indicator (DPAI) mod is a great tool to help with docking, it shows you where you\u0027re pointing, where the target port is pointing and what direction you\u0027re going relative to that target port and makes docking a whole lot easier than doing it by eye. Another alternative is using MechJeb\u0027s docking autopilot which does all the hard work for you- using that with the DPAI turned on is a good way to learn how to dock manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re determined to rotate the entire station, you can still get them to line up at a range of over 2km by following these steps:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Once you get within 2200m or so, you\u0027re inside the game physics range. If you have a large station with a high part count, you\u0027ll probably notice the game pause for a little while (it can be almost unnoticeable or last for a few seconds) as it loads the station into the physics calculations. You can then switch between your craft and the station using the [ and ] keys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Switch to the station, right click the port you want to dock to and select \u0027Control from here\u0027. Assuming there\u0027s either a sufficiently skilled pilot or a drone core with level 3 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on it you can then double-click the ship you\u0027re trying to dock and then tell the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to point at the target. The station will (very slowly) rotate to point the docking port at the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Switch back to your ship, make sure your navball is displaying target velocity as opposed to surface or orbit. Point retrograde and fire engines or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters to keep your approach speed at a safe level- you don\u0027t want to crash into the station!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) When you\u0027ve slowed down and are reasonably close (300m or closer should be fine and ~5m/s is slow\u00A0enough) right-click the docking port you want to dock to the station with and click \u0027Control from here\u0027 Again, with a skilled pilot or level 3 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E you should be able to point to target the station itself. Keep getting closer to the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) When you\u0027re ~150m away from the station you should be able to right-click on the station\u0027s docking port and select \u0027Set as target\u0027. Switch to the station, target the other docking port\u00A0and TURN OFF target tracking- it can get a bit strange if you\u0027re controlling a station from a docking port at one end of a large ship or station which can cause a lot of unwanted rotation. Keep the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E switched on to keep the station steady. Switch off your main engines, you don\u0027t want to accidentally accelerate and crash into the station!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) Switch back to the ship, slow down gradually until you\u0027re about 20m away and going at 1m/s. Make sure your navball is still set to target mode and use the translation controls (HNIKJL)\u00A0try to keep the prograde marker\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:prograde:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/prograde3.png\u0022 title=\u0022:prograde:\u0022\u003E\u00A0right in the middle of the target marker\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:targetpro:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/TargetPro20px.png\u0022 title=\u0022:targetpro:\u0022\u003E\u00A0to stay on course. Once you\u0027re within 10m, turn off target tracking mode on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and just leave it in the default stability mode, guide the ship in the rest of the way SLOWLY using the translation controls to adjust the position of the prograde marker and the rotation controls to adjust the position of the target marker- both should stay aligned with the little dot in the middle of the navball \u0027wings\u0027 until it\u0027s within about a metre or so of docking. When you\u0027re that close, switch off \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E entirely and let the magnetic pull of the two docking ports pull them together- they might not dock perfectly and end up at a slight angle but they should be able to resolve it without any input from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.
