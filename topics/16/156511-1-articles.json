Novice kerbonaut here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been meaning to try my hand at efficient interplanetary travel for a while, and look on in awe as people continue to post their crazy trajectories to Eeloo and others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m looking to practice interplanetary gravity\u00A0assists , to get a better instinctive feel for planning future missions. Can anyone post some flight paths that would enable me to learn? For example: A braking gravity assist at Duna to get to Eve OR using an Eve gravity assist to change inclination to match Dres or Jool to drop back down to Duna. A series that would acclimate me to understanding what assist I should use to get where i want.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, I have a basic idea of how gravity assists work, but know nothing about planning them for efficient transfers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help is appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. I know this is a tall order, and my phrasing of the question may not be entirely accurate.

A mch better idea is to go to Jool and try to skip from moon to moon with the least amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E expenditure possible.

I started using Eve for gravity braking coming back from other planets to slow down. That way you arent screaming back from Moho or Jool at 5000\u002B m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-16T15:23:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best way to learn is from experimenting. Learn the basic rule: if you pass behind a planet (relative to the planet\u0027s orbit) you will speed up, and when you pass in front, you\u0027ll slow down. The closer your pass, the greater your effect. Then play around with maneuver nodes to set up encounters and see how moving your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E changes your final orbit. You\u0027ll get a hang for it soon enough. You can practice in the Kerbin system, for starters you can try boosting up to Minmus by using a Mun assist for example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
