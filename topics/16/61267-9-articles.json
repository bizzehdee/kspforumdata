MechJeb is an incredibly useful and time-saving tool - I use it all the time - but it is important to get to grips with at least basic orbital manoeuvring first. Why bother? Well sometimes MechJeb makes errors (e.g. putting you on a Kerbin escape trajectory that sends you through Kerbin XD) and when that happens you are gonna need to know how to fly by yourself.

Locking the gimbals on your first rocket stage can be extremely useful because it greatly reduces wobble (this mainly applied if you\u0027ve got a very powerful first stage or you have some potentially unstable connections in places). At the same time, it can be very helpful to have an action group set up which toggles the gimbals because - and this mainly applies if you\u0027re trying to push a lot of weight into orbit - the center of mass is going to shift as you drain fuel and lose weight. If you have a lot of weight at the top of the rocket, the directed rocket thrust from your main stage may be the only thing that stops it from spinning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

One can add an additional probe pod to any craft and flip it upside down, then during flight, you right click it and \u0022control from here\u0022 to flip your orientation. This allowed me to have some engines in some stages facing \u0022up\u0022 at launch and solves a lot of other tricky construction problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Matt\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"i like turtles","CreatedById":169426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T12:25:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, the best way to experience KSP fully is without any mods at all.

Also, learn to understand the NavBall and the map. It helps A LOT. Then, you should calculate the mass of your final plane/rocket , convert the total amount of thrust on your first stage to kg, and the final result should be your thrust being more than your plane/rocket\u0027s total mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-23T06:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing- always strut inwards from a booster.
