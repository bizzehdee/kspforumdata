Fuel Depot\u0027s are generally space stations that have lots of fuel in them. A ship docks to said station, gets fuel (via fuel transfer) and then undocks, it\u0027s speed unaffected. However, the weight of the extra fuel will lower the TWR (Thrust to Weight Ratio) but in space this is less of an issuethan it is on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InF3RNo","CreatedById":72307,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T12:56:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut how does an station gets refueled? I mean, if you set a fuel depot station in space it\u0027ll get empty after refueling some ships I guess? Or we\u0027re talking about a mod? I\u0027m not well informed about mods?

Complex stations that have refuelling as just a part of their role will typically be topped up, but if your depot is just a few big tanks with docking ports stuck on you may as well deorbit/terminate it when it\u0027s empty and launch a fresh one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InF3RNo","CreatedById":72307,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T20:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips, I set this to answered. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
