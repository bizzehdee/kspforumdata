Before I head over there, I\u0027d just like to know if they exist and if so where they are. Are they in the big, dark craters? And are there any other science areas on the Mun? Finally, do all planets and moons have their own science areas and do they all follow this format (i.e. lowlands, midlands highlands, poles)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sathurn","CreatedById":58040,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T03:03:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is an east crater, so I assume there is a north and a west.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awass","CreatedById":77431,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T03:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sathurn\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sathurn\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is an east crater, so I assume there is a north and a west.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, not sure what you mean. I\u0027m talking about the different areas where you can collect science. Each area (midlands, highlands, etc.) counts as a separate scientific experiment kinda thing where they all grant the same amount of science even if you have visited one of the other parts.
