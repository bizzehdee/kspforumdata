I\u0022m good and getting into that orbit, killing my horizontal speed, and coming in retrograde very close, but I just can\u0027t seem to nail the landing spot on! I think my problem is stemming from 3 things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) On the map, I can only zoom in so far, and can\u0027t tell exactly where my trajectory is hitting the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) When I am coming in close, I can\u0027t tell where\u00A0my target is on the navball, as when\u00A0navigation for it is activated, the target is somewhere below the navball horizon, and all I can see is the top since I am vertical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Once hovering, I have trouble keeping track of my orientation with regard to the camera angle and north, and can never seem to know which way to nose down.
