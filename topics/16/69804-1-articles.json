I\u0027m just right now trying to test both of them on different environments, on kerbin. However anytime I put either on a rocket, it immediately goes flying towards the direction of the wheels, and it ends how you would expect a giant vehicle with a rocket strapped to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s446.photobucket.com/user/locustdraco/media/screenshot6.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i446.photobucket.com/albums/qq181/locustdraco/screenshot6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s446.photobucket.com/user/locustdraco/media/screenshot13.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i446.photobucket.com/albums/qq181/locustdraco/screenshot13.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot13.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T01:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you build your rocket under the rover make sure you have a probe-core that faces \u0027up\u0027 and ensure you \u0027control from here\u0027 on that part when you launch so your navball is pointing in the direction you want to go.

Also, if you\u0027re trying to mount the rover with the long axis of it parallel to the long axis of the rocket, you\u0027re going to have one hell of a time trying to balance/correct for that much asymmetric mass. So build the rocket beneath the rover in the orientation that it sits on the ground in. Decoupler underneath the chassis, presumably a skycrane on top.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T02:19:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdd a reaction wheel to help stop the thing falling over, struts to keep it all stable and not wobbling around. Do you have \u003Cem\u003Etoo much\u003C/em\u003E thrust? Over about 2.5 TWR can cause all sorts of unpleasantness up to tearing the thing in half. You have cuploas on both those? That\u0027s a very heavy part so make sure that\u0027s at the bottom of the rover at launch or all its mass will be right at the end - which makes all my rockets flip as soon as they move from vertical.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
