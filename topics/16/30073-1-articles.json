That means that theoretically, I should be able to put a station in a place where it appears to be stationary from both Ike and Duna. It even says this is possible on the Kerbal Wiki. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering how to go about doing this. Every time I try, it works for a bit, but eventually gets capture by ike and thrown out of position.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T21:18:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell... NO, You can\u0027t put satellite on (stable) synchronous orbit near Ike. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke is very close to Duna synchronous orbit ,so faster or later any synchronous satellite will enter Ike Sphere of influence and it\u0027s orbit will be changed slightly by Ike gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETidal lock mean only that Ike is facing Duna aways with same side - like our Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T21:17:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnically it will be stationary if you \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eland\u003C/span\u003E on Ike, as they are tidally-locked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHypothetically you should be able to enter Geosynchronous orbit at the same altitude than Ike, but the problem stated above stay (because there\u0027s no Lagrange point).
