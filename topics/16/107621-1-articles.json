When you reach 10-15 km altitude (depending on speed), the rocket becomes completely unflyable, because the tank is almost empty.\n\nIn the VAB, empty the fuel tank and take a look at the CoM...

Stages tend to get smaller the further up the rocket you go.\n\nFor eyeballing it, I make every stage about 2/3rds for the rocket.

As you use it, you may find that repeatedly computing deltaV by hand gets a bit tedious once you\u0027ve got the hang of doing it. If so, there are at least a few mods to the game that automatically compute deltaV while you are constructing your rocket in the VAB, and also show you how much deltaV you have remaining during flight. MechJeb and Kerbal Engineer Redux are the first that come to mind.\n\nAlso worth noting is that the rocket equation can get a bit complicated if you have a rocket which uses two or more different engines/boosters at the same time, especially if they burn out at different times during flight. It\u0027s not so much that it\u0027s harder to compute, it\u0027s just that you need to keep track of more things in your equations, and thus it becomes prone to error."},{"CreatedByName":"Stephen Locksley","CreatedById":182846,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-07T05:08:48Z","Content":"If the rocket has a high amount of mass, and put up into the sky using VesselMover, then it will fall, probably killing everyone onboard the rocket."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-07T07:34:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Stephen Locksley said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If the rocket has a high amount of mass, and put up into the sky using VesselMover, then it will fall, probably killing everyone onboard the rocket.\n\u003E \n\nThank you for attempting to help, but by now the initiator of this thread has either solved the problem or moved on. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"}]}
