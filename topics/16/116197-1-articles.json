The second is a factor of thrust to drag. The final one is the application of the rocket equation and having enough extra LF for the earlier parts (and landing if you want powered landings).\n\nAdvice about tonnes per jet are a good guideline for you aerobic TWR. I think current advice is 13t a jet at takeoff. If you have problems climbing, you have too little wing; if you have trouble going supersonic you have too much drag (which could be because of too much wing!). I am recalibrating what my desired aerobic TWR is so I can\u0027t help there. I prefer using less aerobic engines than most and instead supplementing them with anaerobic engines to break the sound barrier.\n\nEdit: derp!

Airbrakes) and Retractable Wheels. Fuel tanks are OK, if used to mount an engine. RCS and Radiators may be needed. Everything else goes in a cargo or service bay.\n- As little control surface as is necessary. On many of my single Rapier designs i only have 2 control surfaces. Combined Roll and Pitch in a V-tail or Elevons.\n- I always mount wings with a little upward angle, so I can have positive lift, even with the craft at zero degrees pitch, at high enough speed.  \n\n    - I do it mostly to minimize drag around and right after Mach 1.\n    - Because it\u0027s better to have only the wings at an angle to the airflow, than the whole craft.\n    - I aim for neutral lift around 375 m/s, at sea-level. At 9 km this gives neutral lift around 600-800 m/s.\n\nOnce I\u0027ve built my SSTO, I evaluate it\u0027s performance using quick tests, that I\u0027ve found to work for me. It takes a maximum of 4 minutes to test the basic viability of a new SSTO. That is not to say, that an SSTO which fails my tests, can\u0027t get to orbit. But it will probably take much longer than it needs to and probably uses more fuel than needs.\n\nWhich brings me to the ascent profile. I don\u0027t use the standard, slow climb to 10 km. I fly pretty much level right off the runway and don\u0027t start climbing until I hit 450 m/s. I\u0027ve found this to be the most efficient ascent for my designs. Especially the heavier ones, many of which could not climb past 5 km with the standard ascent.\n\nI baked the tests into this album.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I find them to be much more efficient than pure Rapier. They use a very similar ascent profile. There\u0027s a bunch in the SSTL album in my signature. Mostly made from Mk1 parts, but there\u0027s a few made from Mk2 and Mk3 parts, also.\n\nHere\u0027s a proper Rapier/Nuke SSTO: [G\u002B post](https://plus.google.com/\u002BValDraaken/posts/B52TLEPJUER) (with craft files). Although that one is a bit overpowered. It doesn\u0027t need a sea-level acceleration. It can accelerate through a shallow climb.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-19T13:59:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2015 01:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Val**\n  \nAdded Vertical Stabilizer and Airbrakes"},{"CreatedByName":"CybSeth","CreatedById":150633,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T20:40:44Z","Content":"I did an analysis on several space plane designs and some of my own. There are some ratios i\u0027ve calculated out that i use as a rule of thumb.\n\n**total\\_mass \\* 35-60% = total\\_fuel\\_mass**\n\n \u003E\u003E Does not including dry mass of fuel tanks - keep ratio of LH to O2 at about 2:1 or 3:1\n\n**total\\_mass \\* 10-25% = combined\\_engine\\_mass**\n\n \u003E\u003E You need about 1 rapier per 16-20 tons of total mass - 20 tons per rapier makes for very shallow ascent profiles, 18 is a good spot, 16 tons per rapier usually means you can practically just aim at 20 degrees the whole way and you\u0027ll get to orbit\n\n**total\\_mass \\* 6% = fuel\\_tank\\_dry\\_mass**\n\n \u003E\u003E fuel\\_mass / 8 = fuel\\_tank\\_dry\\_mass (about the average weight of dry tanks)\n\n**total\\_mass \\* 4% = lift\\_body\\_mass**\n\n \u003E\u003E total\\_mass \\* 40% = lift\\_body\\_needed (I aim for about 40-45% lift units, if you have lots of TWR you can probably get away with less - e.g. 20t craft should have about 10 lift units total)\n\n \u003E\u003E lift\\_body\\_needed / 10 = lift\\_body\\_mass (average weight of most lift bodies is 1/10 the lift)\n\n**total\\_mass \\* 10-45% = other\\_parts\\_mass**\n\n \u003E\u003E \u0022other\u0022 variable fixed part mass costs like:\n\n \u003E\u003E cockpit, landing gear, airbrakes, tail fins, air intakes, batteries, solar panels, science equipment, radiators, filled ore tanks, etc.\n\nHow I apply it:\n\nI always start with **50% fuel ratio, 20% for engines, 10% dry tanks/wings, and other stuff to 20%**. That\u0027s what I expect for a reasonable flight profile (climb at about 20, level off at 10k, gain alt slowly, activate o2 around 25k, aim for AP of 75k\u0027ish, circularize).\n\nStep 1) I usually start with the number and types of engines first (say 2 rapier and a nuke - 7t of engines)\n\nStep 2) With a 20% engine ratio, this means my total mass should be around 7t engine / 20% = 35t\n\nStep 3) From there I figure about 50% fuel as a baseline expectation (17t fuel -- 3:1 ratio so that\u0027s about 12.75t lh and 4.25t o2)\n\nStep 4) I presume 10% of total mass goes toward wings/dry tanks\n\nStep 5) remainder goes toward other stuff, but i try and restrict this to 20% if at all possible (so 7t limit of cockpit and other stuff).\n\nI\u0027ll start building with these goals in mind, putting together fuel tanks, then engines, then wings (balancing CoL), then put on other accessories. As I build it, and it comes in UNDER 35t total, I know I can expect the flight profile to be more relaxed. If it comes in OVER 35t then i can expect the flight profile to be more finesse and shallow ascent. These rules work even for big birds - e.g. a 180t bird i\u0027m working on now.\n\nIf you want to have an even more lazy flight profile - go for more engines and more fuel and reduce your \u0027other\u0027 mass:\n\n**55% fuel, 25% engines, 10% dry tanks/wings, 10% other** - That will very likely do a 30 degree fire-and-forget style ascent profile."}]}
