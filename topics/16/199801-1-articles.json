Just have it there (these are usually called \u2018haul xxx into flight/orbit\u2019) or run a test (usually called \u2018test xxx in flight/orbit)? If it\u2019s the latter then you need to either right-click the part once all other criteria are met and then hit \u2018run test\u2019, or activate the part through the staging list.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhere? There\u2019s usually an altitude range e.g. between 3km and 10km or 200,000m-250,000m.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow fast?

Unlikely to be relevant but sometimes these contracts ask for old, deprecated versions of the parts which you can\u2019t access any more and are only kept for compatibility reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
