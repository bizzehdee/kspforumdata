I made a rocket with 4 stages, and all of them are jointed together with TR-38-D. The first stage and the second stage were OK when I decoupled them, but when I decoupled the third stage, it just exploded, and damaged the engine of the fourth stage. I do not know why it worked like this. Does somebody have any ideas?
