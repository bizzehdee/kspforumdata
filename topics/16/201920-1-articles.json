In its polar orbit it will cover the entire planet over time. Does it build a resource map of the surface that is saved so I can reference it later to decide good landing/mining locations? Or can you only access information on the surface it is currently moving over?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-23T00:59:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, the narrow band scanner does not save a resource map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the intended use for this device is to be monitoring the scanner interface in real time. When you are over a location you should observe the ore concentrations percentages that show when you drag its marker across the scanner map.

But, after running a surface analysis with the surface scanning module, the narrow band scanner will now show you the concentration of ore at any specific location within its field of view.

It is unlikely to be any higher.
