I\u0027ve seen some videos where people are able to burn once from an LKO and intercept with the planet of their choosing (albeit with minor corrections) but I have no idea when to time a maneuver like that. Normally I escape kerbin first and then set up a maneuver node but that is very delta-v intensive. If someone knows of a good launch window guide I\u0027d love to see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-02T01:22:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2014 01:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by dbmorpher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T02:02:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might try\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33023\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33023\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto get information when to burn for other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UyIX5Rl.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/UyIX5Rl.png\u003C/a\u003E is a nice chart about phase angles for departure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T02:32:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second of mhoram\u0027s links is quite good, since it also gives you a sense of how precise your timing needs to be.
