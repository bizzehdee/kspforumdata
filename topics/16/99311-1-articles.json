The tier 3 launch pad supposedly has no limit on the mass of your craft, but there needs to be some wiggle room to allow for the craft to settle when the physics kick in on ship load. Like figure out what the most mass you could possibly throw together in the VAB and then apply a gravity drop of a certain distance and make sure the launch pad can handle that (something like 15,000t dropped 20m, give or take). The launch pad should only blow up if a really massive ship falls from a significant height (50m\u002B) - something far higher than the amount that a ship settles on load. Otherwise it should hold strong and firm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other buildings and things near the launch pad can have lower tolerances for being destroyed, but the pad surface itself should be exceedingly strong if you have it fully upgraded.
