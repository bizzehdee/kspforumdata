It has 2 Hitchhikers (4 each), a Mk 1-2 command module (4), a lab (2) and a single Mk1 Lander can, attached via a docking port. But the \u0022crew capacity\u0022 part is still unfulfilled. Is having the pod attached with a docking port the reason? Does it not count if it is attached with a port?\n\nEdit: D\u0027oh! I thought the Mk1-2 held 4, it only holds three!\n\nNow I have to send another mission up there. Hopefully I can dock something that holds 2 kerbals (in place of the ship with 1) and it will work.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T06:52:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 06:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketBlam**"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T07:08:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Seats do not count for those contracts.\n\nActually, it does count *if* a kerbal occupies that seat.
