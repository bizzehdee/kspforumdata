It\u0027s also possible that the game just shows its orbit as highly elliptical when in fact the apoapsis leaves the sphere of influence."},{"CreatedByName":"whiterafter","CreatedById":66064,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T20:45:51Z","Content":"It was inclined so it didn\u0027t cross the Mun\u0027s orbit.
