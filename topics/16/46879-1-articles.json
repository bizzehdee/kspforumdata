If you\u0027re going for a reasonable time frame, it\u0027s best to go for orbits that give you close encounters (shortest distance between the vessels on their orbits) quite often. For example, if the orbits of the two vessels are only 5 km apart, it can take a long time to timewarp to a reasonable transfer window. I\u0027d recommend the target being at 200-250 km, and the docking vessel at a 100 km parking orbit (or vice versa.) Those orbits give plenty of transfer windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T15:00:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETez: I have, it\u0027s great, but apparently I\u0027m stupid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlizzy: Thanks for the support!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kulebron","CreatedById":80231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T15:33:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClick on orbit in map view and change the parameters. In two words, if you go higher, you go slower, and vice versa.

Good idea is to make it elliptical so it touches the station\u0027s orbit with one end and gives you approach distances. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example (assuming station at 150 km) - if you\u0027re behind, make orbit with PA at 75 km and AA at 150 km. If you\u0027re ahead, make the orbit with PA at 150 km and AA at 200 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case make sure the orbital planes match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you come at the station\u0027s height and pass the current approach mark, so the next approach appears, you can burn prograde or retrograde to adjust the orbit so you meet the station the next orbit. Or you can wait a few orbits if the distance is too great and it would require too much dv (or if you\u0027d need to reduce your PA below 70 km).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T12:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHigher to slow down, lower to speed up. Do so in as closely matching orbit as possible. Take your time, do small burns, switch to thrusters for fine tuning.
