I have two right now that are personal favorites. There\u0027s asparagus with slack tank staging and air lifter to asparagus combo. The first image below is one of my original designs for a SSTO interplanetary rocket ship with a all in one lander attached to it. The staging was capable of getting the entire craft into orbit minus the solid fuel boosters without ejecting anything else. Then the entire craft could be refueled and sent to it\u0027s destination. However, I believe the TWR of this thing is relatively low and of course inefficient, but I\u0027ve had this craft for a long time and haven\u0027t changed it until now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921278188476363463/B8961AEBEF5C00548CE3B702A15B50EB691D86D3/\u0022 alt=\u0022B8961AEBEF5C00548CE3B702A15B50EB691D86D3\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis image is of my new asparagus lifter design that uses slack tanks that asparagus off of the main craft before getting to the core engines. Since the outer tanks are slack, I\u0027m not loosing or maintaining my TWR, it\u0027s actually increasing at a linear rate as all of the slack tanks drop two by two. This means that I can power down the engines as I gain altitude and use less fuel to get an equalized TWR as when I launched. I think this saves fuel and you\u0027re not getting any deceleration at all when a tank runs out of fuel because there\u0027s no engine attached to it. This also helps the structural stability as it flies. This design has room for improvement, but it\u0027s not really necessary right now as the current lifter can get this 143 ton craft into orbit with half fuel to spare in the main tank at the end of the staging. Then I attach a engine configuration to the bottom to suit the crafts mission. The current craft can go to Moho and return to Kerban. It also went to Jool and made a successful landing on Lythe, but it is basically all out of fuel, however it was just the basic engine configuration with nothing on the lower docking port. It was a test flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/902138605379493746/A7EADB68633924C1DFD8A853A53CD007B1D875F7/\u0022 alt=\u0022A7EADB68633924C1DFD8A853A53CD007B1D875F7\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly there\u0027s my air lifter design. You can air lift a craft to about 22,000 meters, then fire the orbital engines at high altitude to achieve orbit. Shown here on my Duna Command Center below. I find this effective for lifting craft or stations into orbit with more than one main attachment point. I like using this whenever possible, but I do admit that it has some limitations on it\u0027s use and what kinds of craft can be fitted with it. But in some cases, this can be a very effective option to save on size if you\u0027re lifting oddly shaped craft or small craft into orbit that have multiple places to attach engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/1046252431481403252/5DE47A603EF31ADB7F83CF3AE078BF3605B1C689/\u0022 alt=\u00225DE47A603EF31ADB7F83CF3AE078BF3605B1C689\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Its a very efficient launch method, however I tend to have an engine on every tank that will drop, mainly to get it off the ground at kerbin. I tend not to use as much srb as you have there and drop some of my tanks on ascent. I have difficulties timing the srb seperations, if i have mainsails on all the tanks then my first LF tank drop comes before a large srb has burned, I can and do squeeze a few smaller srb\u0027s in for trickier payloads but it takes several launch runs to key the staging into the right order. Obviously the issue here is that you cant drop an empty tank if it has any kind of srb still running on it, it\u0027s TWR will rip past yours and so it tears up the side of the ship and causes problems. Neither do you want to wait out the srb, since you want rid of that empty tank (plus its mainsail)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do like that you are able to srb the first design all the way to orbit, very efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe air lifter is interesting. It seems to be carrying regular rocket engines so it is in effect a booster stage that then lets you launch from altitude. Highly efficient obviously, basically the same as an srb cluster that gets your launch craft high before igniting. The issue I have here is usually part count skyrocketing before I can get the lifter\u0027s TWR past 1 whilst carrying the rest of the gear. My solution to this is actually jet engines on my lifter. Since aircraft fuselage is very lightweight without oxidizer I build what amounts to a kerbin VTOL jet-skycrane. Deck the whole kit out in heavy air intakes and im usually able to get my launchers up around 15km with some serious eastward speed over ground. The main reason I started doing this was that it let me switch out some of my asparagus launch vehicle\u0027s rockets to aerospikes, which has led a couple of times to me having a considerable chunk of my mission\u0027s interplanetary dV still in the launcher stage after stable lko. Everytime this happens I redesign the mission profile, usually to something the payload is illfit for, but thats just me being stupid as a kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T10:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAsparagus staging is the most generic technique.

That covers both onion staging and bamboo staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaging using jet engines is just a sub-category of onion staging. You don\u0027t want to pump fuel from jet fuel tanks to rocket fuel tanks as you wouldn\u0027t have use for it there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince fuel lines and struts have 0 mass, and you already have a decoupler attached to hold the jet engine onto your spacecraft, you could stick a rocket fuel tank on your jet engine booster and have it feeding fuel to a rocket stage. That way, when you stage separate, you drop off the empty tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly tricky part is getting the size of the tank right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qm3ster","CreatedById":150338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T10:53:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022700NitroXpress\u0022 data-cite=\u0022700NitroXpress\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVery true, but here\u0027s the thing. If you choose to, you can throttle down as you drop the spent tanks. This allows you to maintain TWR while dropping the excess weight, without loosing the engines until the end. This also saves on fuel because the engines will use less fuel to maintain thrust as opposed to the other method. So if you throttle down as you stage slack tanks, you won\u0027t risk structural failure because you\u0027re manually maintaining the TWR and you\u0027re using less fuel to do so. Also there is that sudden deceleration jolt from engine flame out that can cause loss of velocity and potential structural failure if you have engines on all tanks.\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou only need those extra engines if you are underspeed and have low TWR. In which case you wouldn\u0027t throttle. If you carry 3 engines and burn at 66% you will burn fuel at the same rate, and get the same thrust, but due to the higher mass have lower Fuel kg/dV efficiency, and TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should ideally never have to throttle down on ascent. If you are going too fast in atmosphere - take more payload. If you run out of fuel before orbit - take more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T04:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOopsie.
