I spent a long time playing on pre 1.0 KSP and that\u0027s where I learned to reach and make orbit. Since 1.0 I\u0027ve finally gotten the hang of thew new gravity turn(I also took a couple months off until now, so that might explain it) but during orbital insertion I\u0027ve been getting these really lopsided orbits, with Perigee being around 70-80 K but Apogee pushing out to 150-200K. My attempts to circularize end up causing my Perigee to drop back down, sometime below the 70K threshold for a stable orbit. Burning Prograde directly towards the horizon at near my desired altitude creates much the same effect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESetting up a maneuver node at my 70-80K Apogee during ascent and coasting up to it doesn\u0027t seem to work as well as it used it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if I\u0027ve forgotten how to space or something in the new updates is messing me up.

But, with the right intakes, one per Rapier, I can get over 1400 m/s before the switch to rocket-mode, and not get too much heating. I watch the apoapsis (Kerbal Engineer is good for this) cutting power when it slightly exceeds the target height. Since I\u0027m still deep in atmosphere the apoapsis will drop during the coast upwards, and a short burn after leaving atmosphere will correct any undershoot, and incidentally raise the periapsis a little. The circularisation burn is locked to Prograde with the SAS and it can be done in two burns. Burn 1 raises the periapsis above the atmosphere, while Burn 2 on the next orbit\u0027s apoapsis completes the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceplanes essentially switch modes with the equivalent of a low gravity turn, dropping their nose at around 20km to get the most out of air-breathing mode.

If you are nose up after periapsis you are essentially burning a bit radial out, so you are shifting apoapsis higher but moving peri lower as well; vice versa for nose low.It\u0027s always cleaner with a high TWR stage at apo., otherwise just be very careful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.

I\u0027ve found that time to AP is the best number to look at and monitor. I use Kerbal Engineer to display my time to AP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I do this is as follows: launch normally, get my AP to about where I want it. Then when I get to about 30 seconds to AP, I point to prograde and fire up my engines. I make sure that my time to AP is slowly decreasing. If it is increasing, then I point slightly below prograde (slightly toward the ground). If it\u0027s still increasing, I lower or cut my thrust entirely (and wait until my time to AP is lower). If it\u0027s decreasing too quickly (or I somehow fly past it), then I point above prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you get closer to and closer to circularizing, the time to AP will have been decreasing the entire time, and should be down to 5-10 seconds. At this point it becomes increasingly sensitive, so make sure to use only low thrust. If you keep this process up as long as possible, your orbit should be very close to circular (\u0026lt;100m difference).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-01T18:48:50Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2015 06:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Empiro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T00:39:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- burn shallow and gently as you get high (no I mean literally), i.e. when the navball changes from Surface to Orbit mode, you should lower the thrust to about 1 G\u0027s worth and aim horizontally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- be going fast when you achieve apoapsis. When my apoapsis hits 70km, I\u0027m usually going between 1850 and 2050 m/s.

If you hit the \u0022magic\u0022 angle, you\u0027ll find that your Apoapsis itself remains unchanged. My circularization burns tend to start about 20 seconds before the Apoapsis with me angled down about 5 degrees, and end about 30 seconds after the Apoapsis with me angled up about 10 degrees. If you were already going fast as mentioned above, this burn will be small, so you can easily center it around the Apoapsis and precisely adjust your trajectory using low thrust without too much risk of sinking back into the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should probably make a video.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
