Launch your grabber ship, try to rendezvous with it, then try to deorbit it and put it back into a stable orbit. See if this feels safe and precise. Also take a look at how much RCS fuel you are burning. Learn from this, improve your ship, try again. Repeat this a couple of times until you are satisfied. Fortunately, when you discover Asteroids there are usually many days away from impact, so there is still some time to prepare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you want to intercept an asteroid, try to take a step back, and look at the bigger picture. The asteroid usually has a stable orbit around Kerbol, it just unfortunately happens to cross Kerbin. It is extremely unlikely that an asteroid hits Kerbin, and if you nudge it just a little early enough, it will miss Kerbin and probably never encounter it again. So, try to ignore the impact for a second, and think how you would rendez-vous with an object on a similar orbit around Kerbol. This works very similar like a rendezvous with Duna or Eve, just make sure that your rendez-vous happens BEFORE impact, and not after it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the ARM patch was released, I was kind of shocked. I knew that preventing an asteroid from hitting earth is difficult, but I never imagined that it might be next to impossible, depending on how \u0022benign\u0022 the asteroid\u0027s orbit is, and how early you can detect it. The problem is not nudging it somehow, but getting there in the first place. In KSP the asteroids are kind of designed so they can be captured easily, but in real life I could imagine trajectories where even detecting an asteroid a year in advance, even if you had your spaceship ready at launch it would not suffice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T10:10:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite is to intercept inside Kerbin SOI, perfectly you want launch in pretty much the same plane as the astroid and intercept it between minmus and Mun while falling towards kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t want too high intercept speed as it burns too much of your fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypical deep space intercept tend to be far more expensive, exception if you have long time to intercept, benefit is that its pretty easy to lower Pe and even change plane and this can save fuel later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
