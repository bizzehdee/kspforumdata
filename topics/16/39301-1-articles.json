All the parts that need to be reusable (suffer no damage upon landing, be it splashdown or touchdown) are capable of just that... but only if I follow them down. Simply ditching them and continuing to fly the main ship doesn\u0027t work. The stages simply... disappear. Can\u0027t be found anywhere in the tracking station, including under debris. Each one has a probe core on it, as I thought that would ensure that the parts wouldn\u0027t disappear. Obviously it didn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust wondering how I\u0027d go about having these parts basically land themselves while I continue to fly my ship, if that\u0027s possible. They don\u0027t need user input, the chutes deploy on decoupling and are more than enough to slow each stage to a safe landing velocity. They\u0027re also not falling over and being destroyed, I\u0027ve followed them down and unless they land in steep mountains they survive any impact, on land or sea, completely intact. Persistant debris is set to unlimited as well.
