IRL, thrust is NOT fixed, it is actually less the more dense the atmosphere is, and it is FUEL CONSUMPTION that is fixed. I\u0027m guessing that Squad has ion thrusters work in the atmosphere right now because they don\u0027t want you to accidentally activate your ion thrusters and instantly consume all your xenon (as the fuel consumption would be infinite due to the ISP being 0).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-24T22:35:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2013 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anton P.
