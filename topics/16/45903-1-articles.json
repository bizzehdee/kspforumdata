I\u0027ve taken the approach of deploying them whilst still in space, with the logic of: more time open in the atmosphere=more drag=profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find though that my ships are often cleft in two by the parachutes violently fully deploying. I\u0027m starting to think that i might have parachutes on different stages and deploying them sequencially to reduce that sudden tug at 500m (on kerbin).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else found a good strategy for chutes, or do you just release them in space as well?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-14T12:49:22Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2013 12:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by FirstyB\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T12:08:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I use the atmosphere to slow me down, and deploy the parachutes when my speed get under 200m/s if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t yet use the drogue chutes to slow down faster before that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketYeah","CreatedById":54474,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T12:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually deploy mine when I\u0027m below 2000m/s in the atmosphere or around 10,000m.

Every part that can take a load should take a load. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- i opened 1 set of eight shutes on the core of my craft, but above de COM, as soon as possible. (this reduces shock and also acts as a que for the next step)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- i opened all of the other shutes sequentially below 500m altitude (after full doployment of first set).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your craft survives the first shock, it is likely to survive the others. The first shock is minimal for only a few (eight in my case) shutes open which provide only a small amount of force but does slow your craft down after full deployment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next shocks will be smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FirstyB","CreatedById":64619,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T12:48:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea thats what i was thinking would work, only have a couple that are fully deployed so they dont cause too much of an initial tearing force, then keep opening more chutes so that you can land at a reasonable speed.
