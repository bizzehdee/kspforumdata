I finally decided to do them.\n\nI built 4 \u0022grabbers\u0022 (7 tons each) : I\u0027ve no pictures but their design is quite straight forward. A claw, a probe core (the best 1.25m), battery, fix solar, a 2.5m heat shield. Then an engine ministage with RCS, encounter and return fuel and a Terrier.\n\nThe 4 grabbers were stitched to a rocket. \n\nI decoupled each grabber manually (not using staging) because I wanted to handle them properly. Recoverable parts where on very different orbits and sometimes clockwise.\n\nBefore grabing the parts, there was something strange (Minmus encounter, rendez-vous...).\n\n- Most of sounds except musique (including engines) were absent. Even Chatterer background sounds was mute.\n\n- MechJeb wasn\u0027t able to warp and execute any node but was able to orient to nodes.\n\n3 of the 4 recoverables had a command unit (cuploa, cockpit). Sound and MechJeb control came back as I grabbed them., even when I reset the \u0022control from here\u0022 to the probe core.\n\nThe last part was a tank. Sound didn\u0027t come back on that one. \n\nI did launch quite some probes and didn\u0027t got that. It\u0027s the first time I used the Claw, though...\n\nHave you exeperienced that ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T11:35:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 11:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Warzouz**"}]}
