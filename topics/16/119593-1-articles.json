I just cannot reach the upper atmosphere of Kerbin. The I don\u0027t have enough science to unlock the next Box. Here are some pictures of the design that I found most useful. Any advice with BTSM will be appreciated. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bLnv3a0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bLnv3a0.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t4qKgD5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022t4qKgD5.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/M80BUWN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022M80BUWN.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JlCO7l7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JlCO7l7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T18:48:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery building of KSC is its own biome.

For starters, I\u0027m not even sure you can actually get science from KSC biomes in it at all. When I last tried it (back in .23.5 I think) it was all set to zero.

You could try using a Kestes 1 as a sustainer, with 2 Kestes 1.5\u0027s strapped on radially as boosters. Fire off the boosters from the pad, then light the sustainer after booster burnout, and hopefully you\u0027ll get up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also try cutting down on the fins too. The rocket I used to get high-altitude science (And a similar one for grinding out weather contracts) doesn\u0027t actually have any...
