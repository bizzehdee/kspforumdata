This will cause your SoI to switch over to the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave yourself some time and use the Warp to SoI feature of the Orbital Maneuver. Once your SoI is switched over to the Sun, the \u0022Transfer\u0022 function will now list the various planets, and using it will work exactly like you would to get to Mun or Minmus - wait for the SoI switch then wait to reach the periapsis. Your orbit at this point will most likely be hyperbolic around the destination body. Reduce your apoapsis (burn retrograde) until it falls into an elliptical orbit (or keep going and circularize).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to get to a moon instead, you need to first get into orbit around it\u0027s planet. If your final destination is one of the planet\u0027s moons, you can either correct from a hyperbolic orbit around the planet first and then transfer to it, or see if you can execute a transfer immediately from your hyperbolic orbit. If you can, this will probably save you some fuel. Be careful, because if you screw up you\u0027ll end up back on a solar orbit with a nasty inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-30T08:37:31Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2012 08:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by draeath\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
