It would almost be like having refueling operations on Kerbin (which people certainly do). It\u0027s entirely doable if you\u0027re good with spaceplanes (which I\u0027m not), but it would really only be useful at Laythe. However, it costs so much to operate around there (as \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/166502-spricigo/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022166502\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/166502-spricigo/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Spricigo\u003C/a\u003E mentioned) that it might be worth it if you end up spending a lot of time there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143587-bigcalm/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022143587\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143587-bigcalm/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bigcalm\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0said earlier, Vall is in a great spot, but it costs more to operate there. It leaves a choice a lot like at Kerbin. Kerbin itself (Laythe), Mun (Vall), or Minmus (Pol, Bop). With those choices, Pol, I really think, is the best option for your first base at Jool. You can launch a huge fuel shuttle off of Pol easily, and use it anywhere in the system. Even if it only has a little fuel left to transfer (subtracting what it needs to take off, get where it\u0027s going, and then get back), it still does the trick. When you\u0027re returning to Kerbin, you usually don\u0027t have much of a ship left. This means you don\u0027t need a lot of fuel, you just need a quick fill-up to get home. Combined with the free-capture at Jool, you can make your ships quite a bit smaller, and even make them \u0022one-way\u0022 so-to-speak, since they can refuel before heading home. If your ship has some fuel left (but not enough to get back to Kerbin), you can have it stop off at Pol on the way home to refuel. It also really provides a great safety net for your early Jool operations; when you\u0027re not too sure what you\u0027re going to need. I highly recommend beginning at Pol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll notice in my pic above that I also have an operation on Bop. It was built to complete contracts, of course, but also because I take a lot of contracts at Bop even now. The money is always good, but mostly because I just\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elike Bop\u003C/em\u003E. I wouldn\u0027t recommend it for your main operation, not just because of the inclination (as Bigcalm also mentioned), but because landings there happen in slow motion (a lot like Gilly) and can be infuriating if you\u0027re in a hurry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-27T13:03:44Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2017 01:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt Kerbalkrunch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-27T13:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223204513\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166889\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221509096620\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180617\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bjerrang\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, bjerrang said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo pol is the best option ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPol is a good option, yes.\u00A0 The only real drawback for me is that it has a small number of biomes; Vall has more variety, which sometimes gives better chances for higher concentrations of ore.\u00A0 However, you can scan both and pick the one that\u0027s best-suited to your purposes; it certainly doesn\u0027t cost much in the long-term.\u00A0 Pol\u0027s other problem is that it\u00A0is so far out, but that\u0027s less of a problem than many would think because transfer windows from Pol to the inner Jool system recur approximately every inner-moon orbit.\u00A0 Don\u0027t forget that Tylo gives many opportunities for\u00A0a lot of gravity assists to help adjust your transfers, too.\u00A0 However, that\u0027s not the only problem with Pol being so far out:\u00A0 every moon of Jool is tidally locked to it, which means that Pol\u0027s rotational period\u00A0is as long as its orbit.\u00A0 Since Pol\u0027s orbit around Jool is substantially less than Jool\u0027s orbit around the sun, this means that effectively, Pol\u0027s orbit\u00A0about Jool is approximately equivalent to its solar day.\u00A0 Pol has a 41-day sidereal rotation period, which means that if you\u0027re planning on using solar panels, think again.\u00A0 You\u0027ll need many, many tonnes of batteries to run your equipment through the 20-day night and at least three times as many solar panels as needed to run your equipment (one set for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and two sets to charge the batteries before the sun goes down again).\u00A0 Consider alternatives to solar power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe takes a lot of delta-V to take off from because it has an atmosphere.\u00A0 Also, I believe that ore does not appear in any ocean--though that may only be true of Kerbin\u0027s oceans--but if it\u0027s true of Laythe\u00A0as well, then there\u0027s simply no point to refining fuel there except to provide for a permanent Laythe-based aerodrome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo is as massive as Kerbin but it has\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eno\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0atmosphere; it\u0027s actually the most difficult place to land in the stock game because of this.\u00A0 Don\u0027t bother setting up a refinery there; any fuel tug you send will use most of its fuel to reach orbit and will have to keep most of what\u0027s left to get back down again.\u00A0 Worse than that is that if you start in Tylo orbit, you lose the gravity-assist advantage that Tylo offers, so you waste what little fuel is left.\u00A0 Seriously, don\u0027t bother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBop is too inclined with respect to the rest of the system and has the same low-number-of-biomes problem as Pol; you spend so much fuel realigning planes so that you can get anywhere that it cancels the advantage\u00A0of low gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVall is a very good choice: it has a lot of surface area, reasonable gravity, and a large number of biomes that offer a lot of chances for a good ore concentration.\u00A0 The gravity is .235 g, or about 1.4 times that of the Mun and .8 times that of Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigcalm","CreatedById":143587,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-27T21:10:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy landers on Vall with the base in the background.\u00A0 They can carry 1500 ore into orbit, dock to something, refuel it, and then land again before refuelling themselves again.\u00A0 They can also carry 8 crew, are powered by nuclear reactors rather than solar panels, and they can also take other resources to or from orbit using the lander leg tanks.\u00A0 Note:\u00A0 These are multi-purpose vehicles - a pure \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E \u002B drill \u002B ore and fuel tanks would be significantly smaller - it wouldn\u0027t need to carry supplies (which I need for MKS), or so much habitation, life support capabilities, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DaOj1eq.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022655\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DaOj1eq.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy refueller onLaythe - can transport 1500 ore back to Laythe orbit and then land again.\u00A0 As I\u0027m not that great on building \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E planes, it\u0027s terrifying to land but otherwise performs reasonably as a plane and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E generally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mFEQPeQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/mFEQPeQ.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough the next pictured vessel is on Dres, I have a clone on Vall as well.\u00A0 This is a more pure focused vessel without crew facilities, designed to mine ore and get it back to orbit ready for refuelling.\u00A0 Nuclear powered, and with a use-it-as-a-90-ton-rover and docking machine option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fanbTC1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fanbTC1.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-27T21:31:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223205096\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166889\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221509138616\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022143587\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bigcalm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 minutes ago, bigcalm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fanbTC1.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fanbTC1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fanbTC1.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like that Dres miner.
