They\u0027re dicey for me, too. Generally, if it\u0027s a multi-passenger contract, I suspect that you need to perform the service for all of them AT ONCE on the same flight for it to count (at least until you unlock docking nodes allowing you to move them around to different landers in orbit.)

One I loaded with Jeb, the other with the tourist. The contract is to ferry a SINGLE tourist to suborbital flight. I even played with the tourist\u0027s and Jeb\u0027s position in the craft, trying whether the tourist needs to be in the root pod or in the other... still no luck. No matter what I do the contract does not get completed. I even deleted all the mods that are incompatible with 1.0.2 so I should have a perfectly working game, but that\u0027s clearly not the case. Maybe I\u0027ll remove ALL the mods just to make sure, but I suspect it won\u0027t change anything...\n\nInteresting fact is that I have a similar problem with another contract - Return from orbit. I put a vessel into orbit, than deorbited and landed safely, but the contract was untouched. But other contracts work - speed/distance/altitude records worked fine, the pre-Return from orbit contracts (escape the atmosphere, launch the first ship...) were fine too, parts testing contracts work like a charm..."},{"CreatedByName":"Callmedave","CreatedById":62412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T09:39:29Z","Content":"I was lucky enough to get 2 tourist contracts exactly the same.
