It seems like there is an extremely narrow range of usefulness for heat shields. Most of the time they are not needed at all as other parts can handle heat reasonably well. 9 times out of 10 when I use a heat shield only about 5% of the ablator is ever used. Then there is the other extreme like in this case where the heat shield doesn\u0027t help at all, it just overheats and explodes before being able to burn off ablator.

Well, maybe think about heat this way. Instead of thinking of \u0022temperature\u0022 think of it as Energy. When an object passes through the atmosphere at high speed, the friction from the air passes energy into the object. Each object also radiates energy away. The rate that it adds energy is a matter of how fast that object is moving (i.e. more friction). The amount of energy that radiates off is more of a function of temperature differental between the object and the surroundings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you have an object that\u0027s passing through the atmosphere really fast, it heats up because it can\u0027t shed energy as fast as it\u0027s gaining it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAblator works on the same principle. It can only ablate so quickly, and hence can only shed energy so quickly...which is faster than shedding energy by pure radiation, but is still a finite rate. So, if you come in too steep, the heat shield can\u0027t shed energy fast enough to prevent an excessive energy build up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also true in real life. If you\u0027ve ever seen Apollo 13, there\u0027s a piece in there with news commentary showing a basketball and baseball , representing the Earth and the Moon. The commentator states that the capsule has to hit a reentry wedge as thick as a piece of paper. To shallow and the craft skips off and away. To steep and it\u0027ll burn up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that fun in KSP? Not wholly. KSP actually has a bit bigger of a window than that, but turns out that sub-orbitals can be dangerous if they come straight back down from too high up. The artificially small-kerbin size also means it has an equally small atmosphere. So the atmospheric density ramps up quicker than in real life, which doesn\u0027t allow as much time for the capsule to slow down and prevent excess energy buildup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kelderek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kelderek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for how heat shields work on Eve compared to Kerbin, I would expect heat shields to ALWAYS be required for any re-entry at Kerbin from \u0026gt;70km to sea level.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, heat shields aren\u0027t always required for one main reason...KSP parts have a slightly high heat tolerance. The reason being because you can use those parts on all manner of vessels, including planes. Because of the lego style of building, having lower temperature tolerant parts would make space planes nearly impossible, due to the amount of time they spend in the atmosphere while heading to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, all that being said, KSP is still a video game subject to game balance. So I\u0027m not trying to be dismissive of your feedback, but trying to first explain real world physics. I also used to do the \u0022launch straight up to 250km\u002B and obtain science\u0022 in my career games. That doesn\u0027t work as well anymore, especially early game. Even if the pod survives the heat, it often doesn\u0027t slow down fast enough to prevent impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give your profile a poke and see. I can\u0027t guess off hand what the safe reentry speeds are, but I see that you\u0027re hypersonic at 15/16km, which is pretty fast. The steep angle isn\u0027t giving much time for the ablator or energy to shed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-04T04:28:19Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2015 04:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T04:42:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I preferred the drag balance in 1.0.2 but even that was much slicker than FAR.
