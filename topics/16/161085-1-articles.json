Once maximum temp is exceeded by any amount, it immediately explodes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAblative heat shields\u00A0burn off ablator above a critical temperature (~1500K)\u00A0to stop heat conducting to the rest of the ship, and have a very high max temperature (3300K vs ~1500K or less).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA shallow re-entry has quite low drag, but very high heating, as the heat flux scales with the cube\u00A0of velocity, and air density\u00A0but drag only with velocity squared and air density, so max temperature rises much faster than drag. Total heat load is heat flux times time, So a shallow reentry gets a relatively low temperature for a very long time, resulting in very high heat loads. KSP doesn\u0027t model part overheating very well, so this doesn\u0027t have the same effects it would in real life (roasted astronauts and computers, probably exploded pressure tanks too).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA steep re-entry reaches denser air still travelling very fast, so it\u0027s exposed to *very* high temperatures, but not for long, since the high drag slows you down fast. This results in much higher G loads,and a much smaller total heat load. The lower total heat load means that much less heat soaks into the ship, and the interior stays relatively comfortable, despite the plasma filled hell just outside. In KSP, the big advantage is that a\u00A0heatshield\u0027s mass is dependent on how much ablator it has, so the steeper the re-entry the less ablator you need to get through it alive. If you know you\u0027re going to come in steep, and only need ~30 ablator, you can cut back to ~50(to leave a margin) and save some mass through the whole rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe steep re-entry is a bit like opening the oven door, a blast of extremely hot air, but not enough to seriously overheat you.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe shallow re-entry is more like climbing in to the oven (at minimum power)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-26T08:00:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2017 08:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Lelitu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-26T16:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ablative heatshields have such low drag that they simply won\u0027t slow you down much unless your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E is pretty deep in the atmosphere.
