I\u0027m now starting to look towards launching larger craft for making a space station. I\u0027ve been reviewing a number of guides but I still have a few questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. does a space station need thrust, like a liquid engine with fuel to maintain orbit? Is there an advised engine with fuel tank I should use?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. does an SAS module keep a larger in orbit without someone manually controlling it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: side note, is there a way to identify the components that a ship is build with while its flying in space? such as a key to hold down while clicking on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T23:26:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo answer the first question, there is no need for station-keeping in KSP because your station is put on rails when you are not controlling it or nearby it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ogre","CreatedById":61074,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T23:30:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. You don\u0027t need an engine to maintain orbit as long as you\u0027re out of the atmosphere. 70k is the line for that on Kerbin, so the lowest orbit you want for a station is probably about 75k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Not sure what you\u0027re asking. An ASAS module, if switched on, will keep a vessel pointed in the same direction, even when you\u0027re controlling a different ship. SAS modules just provide more torque for turning. ASAS will use SAS to maintain a heading, but all the command pods also provide some amount of torque, so SAS modules are often not needed. Neither does anything to keep you in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can right click on parts to get a popup with info about them, and buttons to control them for things like engines, gear, fuel tanks. I think structural only parts may not have popups, but most of the important stuff does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T00:40:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeday people will stop sharing misinformation about SAS, unfortunately today isn\u0027t that day. SAS does not provide any steering torque whatsoever, it only adds dampening torque to stop your ship or station from spinning or rotating when you activate it. Command Pod Torque is the only type of torque (including probe core but it uses the same type of torque) that will help you turn your ships or stations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to consider having a reaction control system installed on the station to make and small changes in rotation you wish to make a little quicker, but no you don\u0027t need and actual engines installed on it. (Once you have it launched to its desired altitude and inclination that is)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T02:54:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo add to/clarify what others have posted: 1) Orbits do not decay or mutate in KSP as long as you do not hit atmosphere or encounter the gravity of another body.

It does NOT need an SAS unit of any type either. the only thing that an SAS will do it stop your vessel from rotating when it\u0027s on. An ASAS unit will attempt to maintain current heading when active, as well as fight roll. When you are not in control of the station, it will automatically maintain its heading on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for engines. . . it depends on what you want to do with the station. I have some stations with engines on them so I can re position them as I want. If all you want your station to do is \u0022sit\u0022 in orbit, it doesn\u0027t need engines at all. It doesn\u0027t even need RCS if you don\u0027t plan on rotating it quickly either. If you stick a command pod on it to give it some torque, you can re orient most stations with that alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brok3n","CreatedById":65655,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T16:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the replies.
