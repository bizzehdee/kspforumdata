So far I believe I\u0027ve done it on 3 of 6 of my interplanetary insertions (I\u0027ve been getting better). Pro-tip; when transferring to a planet/moon/whatever in an orbit higher than your own, when you\u0027re doing your adjustments after leaving Kerbin/your starting point\u0027s sphere of influence, get your periapsis to the minimum, then burn a little more to get it higher again, because if you stop *before* the periapsis reaches the minimum you\u0027ll come in on the inside edge of the planet\u0027s SOI, and end up with a clockwise orbit, but if you burn a bit further you\u0027ll be on the far side upon reaching it and you\u0027ll get the right orbit. You\u0027ll still have to adjust inclination and things but that can save you a bit of delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait what was I gonna say?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh right, so recently after a 389 day journey to jool I now have a probe with something like 2600 delta-V flying around the giant in a stable orbit (and by the way, this being my first trip to jool, that aerobrake and the fire effects were TOTALLY worth the wait), except it\u0027s going in the wrong direction. This is more a thought experiment than anything else but I\u0027d just like to hear your ideas; how would you go about reversing the direction of your orbit? The simplest approach is burn retrograde until your retrograde magically becomes prograde but with limited fuel and a gravity well like Jool\u0027s for me I don\u0027t think that\u0027s an option. Gravity assist/steep aerobrake on laythe? Rotate the orbit in a big circle around Jool to get the inclination from 180 degrees to zero? Some other outlandish solution? What if you\u0027re around a body with no moon? What if Jool didn\u0027t have such a freakishly strong gravity well?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T06:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry for a gravity assist from Tylo?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T06:06:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAerobrake violently at Laythe, then leave Laythe orbit in the correct direction if desired?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d go with this one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brun","CreatedById":68293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T06:08:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EForgive me if this is offtopic, but why does it matter what direction your orbit is?
