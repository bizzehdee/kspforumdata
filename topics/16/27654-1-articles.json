Later you can attach it to another vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is important to know that the part you pickup will be the part that needs to attach to something later on. It\u0027s a good idea to build part collections with this in mind. An often used lifter vehicle would be a great thing to save and is exactly what you\u0027re looking for. Satellites or rovers can also be saved this way. So the anwser is yes but there will be some limitations to work around, usually minor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA known issue with Subassembly Saver is that it sometimes un-links struts and fuel lines, so check those by hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if you hate/refuse mods, get this. It\u0027s just too usefull and doesn\u0027t cheat in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sorcie","CreatedById":61164,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T02:15:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPayloader = Outside of KSP.
