You might get get too much vertical speed with the engines cut off; in this case, turn on a low throttle and tilt so the thrust is largely upwards. Keep turning your engine off whenever you see the opportunity, and turning it on to make corrections. You basically want to slow down as much as possible, without prematurely dropping out of the sky. If you have too much speed while approaching the runway, you can engage spoilers (if you have any on the craft) to give you drag. Lower the landing gear on your approach, and try to touch down with as little vertical speed as possible. Active the brakes to slow down to a stop, hopefully before you reach the end of the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
