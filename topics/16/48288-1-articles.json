But when building an SSTO, you have to consider how much fuel to total weight you want to have. TOO much fuel and you will be heavier, thus needing more Delta V to get into orbit. So the trick is to find that perfect balance where you can go fast... think a minimum of 1500m/s in atmosphere on air breathing engines before you even attempt to make orbit. The faster you can go and the higher you can go on air breathing engines the more fuel you will have once in orbit. So the trick is start small, then go BIG once you have the basics of the small design down perfect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of my big SSTOs can one trip it from ground to Mun. One of my smaller designs can. But I wouldn\u0027t be able to land it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cal\u0026#039;Mihe","CreatedById":65567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T00:10:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo OP: We need to see your design or know a bit more about your problems in order to help you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour issues might be in the launch stage, the flight profile, the craft design, the engine choice, etc etc. Hard to tell without seeing the basis you\u0027re comming from \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise what Hodo says is correct, start small, and then scale up from there.

(Yes, I\u0027ve succeeded at rocket jet SSTOs, but I\u0027m interested in the rocket plane as a challenge.) I\u0027ve gone through several designs and have come close to orbit, but no cigar, so to speak. Now I\u0027m closer than ever (and yes, practice and some kind of piloting skills help). I\u0027m very close to getting a craft that does the job. So you can get your craft up there as well. Please do put up pics of what you are working on and what your obstacles are.
