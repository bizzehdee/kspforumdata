They aren\u0027t magic. When you eject from Kerbin\u0027s gravity well to a certain destination there is an associated ejection trajectory angle relative to where you started the burn relative to prograde. For Duna the usual assumption is that you are doing a Hohmann transfer where your ejection is aligned with Kerbin\u0027s prograde motion (most efficient).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe extreme case of ejecting with infinite speed is the phase angle 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 case. You can imagine that when you are a quarter orbit from the planetary prograde position you are positioned so your orbital prograde is pointed in the same direction as Kerbin is moving about the Sun. Your path escaping Kerbin\u0027s well isn\u0027t going to be bent because of the extreme speed of your departure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs your transfer speed decreases the effect of Kerbin\u0027s gravity on your craft as you are leaving curves it more and more. If you started from the 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 position (progrades aligned) you\u0027ll find that during your escape gravity will bend your escape path in a partial orbit and your escape vector will be bent inward toward the Sun. To counter this undesirable path bending one burns earlier (greater than 90) so that the bending during the escape pulls your path aligned with Kerbin\u0027s prograde as desired for an efficient transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is easy-ish to verify with maneuver nodes, adjusting the position of your escape burn such that the resulting escape orbit is tangential to Kerbin\u0027s. There are web site calculators for this but they assume simple impulses and are only valid at the parking orbit assumed. With the proper deltaV one achieves a Hohmann transfer where the AP touches the orbit of Duna. It is another matter to time your ejection so the time at orbit intersection is one where Duna is actually there (around day 50-60 IIRC).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
