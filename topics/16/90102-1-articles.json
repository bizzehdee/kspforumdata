Curious if other people have ideas on how to improve the basic idea of this craft. The wings detach on first stage, i wonder if i should keep them on or not. Also not sure how this compares to a normal rocket design. It did get up to 20,000 kilometres before i engaged the rocket, was only designed to go up to 10,000. Just interested in your general ideas to this approach of putting stuff in orbit as a new type of launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s28.postimg.org/elcpcoh7x/rocketjetplane.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rocketjetplane.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-12T16:02:54Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2014 04:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Moonfrog\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T12:24:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHard to see what\u0027s going on in that tiny picture. Very generally speaking, it\u0027s not worth staging away wings as they\u0027re fairly low mass and quite useful for precision landing to get that tasty 100% recovery. Depends on what you\u0027re trying to accomplish, I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T12:57:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you have there is basically a cruise missile. I honestly can\u0027t see much use for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only exception that comes to mind is based on experience from the Ion Collier Trophy Challenge. That involves lifting a craft with a TWR\u0026lt;1 to orbit (Ion engines only), relying on wings to lift you up to where the atmosphere was thin and then just keep accelerating to orbit speed. If you were trying to deliver a heavy payload (like full fuel tanks) to orbit with minimum outlay in terms of the fuel used to get it there, then you could use a design like this... but then, as Crown says, there wouldn\u0027t be much point in jettisoning the wings. By the time they stop providing lift, they\u0027re already producing trace drag and weigh almost nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moonfrog","CreatedById":76295,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T16:02:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see. Idea was to build small booster section at the bottom of the rocket. Therefore cut down on costs for much larger payloads.

Well, booster sections are something I have used, but the other way around - attaching rocket boosters behind a Spaceplane\u0027s engines to get it into space faster with more fuel left for manoeuvres or transfers. Adding jet boosters to a rocket is also something I\u0027ve see done, tho not done myself. It can cut out a lot of heavy rocket fuel and keep your TWR up while you gain some altitude and effectively launch through a thinner, shallower atmosphere - again, a big advantage for heavy payloads. The obvious drawbacks are the loss of expensive jet engines and the need for a lot of air intakes. This also wouldn\u0027t really be a winged craft, more like a really massive jet-powered VTOL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
