But traction has always been an issue. What I\u0027ve done in the past is use RCS thrusters; have thrusters that point up and a couple pointing forwards which you can fire (and some facing backwards if you like speed). \n\nIt used to be that the controls for docking mode where set up perfectly for this by default, but since 1.0 I\u0027ve had to reconfigure key bindings bit to keep this working. You need to enable the wheel steering keys to work in Docking(translation) mode, and disable pitch and yaw controls in Docking(translation). Then set W and S to be translate forward and back and Lctrl and LShift to translate up and down (respectively) in Docking(translation) mode. \n\nThen when you drive in docking mode if you switch on RCS while holding W your rear facing RCS will give you a boost, or while decelerating (S) will fire you forward facing ones and to increase your traction hold down Lcrtl to fire the upward facing ones."},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T09:51:10Z","Content":"Duna has a reasonable gravity, a little more weight should do the trick.

Which is the kind I suppose KSP is simulating. Once elasticity in the form of tire and terrain deformations come into play, however, higher mass starts to increase your energy losses. I believe that is why people think adding mass to rovers would increase drag. Because it seems to in the real world.

Maybe you just given an explanation to my previous question ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif), in a way...\n\nthe truck i drive on minmus is, actually, NOT rigid... It has a midsection that tends to bend when I brake and it increases enormously the braking power. It was an unintended effect, since i had the midsection designed that way in order to refuel small probes that moved below it to access a docking port. On high gravity environments I have to brake slowly or the whole thing flips over from stored elastic forces sudden release.\n\nnow this just gave the idea of a catterpillar-like truck, moving like a snake...
