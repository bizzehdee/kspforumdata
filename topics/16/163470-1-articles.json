It\u0027s usually a very small penalty (and nothing compared to accepting one and then failing). If you keep getting a certain type of contract that you find uninteresting or just gotten bored of, with the weighed contract system, you only need to decline one or two and you\u0027ll be much less likely to get similar ones in the future. It can be a good way to ensure you receive contract offers you find fun and actually want to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
