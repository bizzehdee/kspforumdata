Of course, they also have TWRs of 100\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, IRL, methane has a MAXIMUM Isp of around 380 seconds. Space-X\u0027s new Raptor engine will have an Isp of about that and will have 2940 kN of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all RP-1 rocket engines are dramatically less efficient. Space-x\u0027s Merlin 1-D engines only have an Isp of 311 and 720 kN of thrust. Granted, that is pretty good for an engine weighing less than an LV-909, but still, not nearly as high Isp as the Skipper, the obvious Kerbal equivalent to this engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only chemical fuel with better performance than that is LH2-LO2 fuel. This was used for all but the first stage of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://xkcd.com/1133/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe U.S. Space Team\u0027s Up Goer Five\u003C/a\u003E, but the problem is that it isn\u0027t very dense and requires immensely low temperatures to store. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECold wet sky bag air used for burning is very good at escaping its can by jumping between the bits of the can and needs a strong cooler to keep wet. still, it moves ten and five times ten hundred feet in a second out of the place where all of the fire comes out. This is two tens and a three parts in a hundred better than air for burning that is taken out of the ground and smells like really bad flying animal baby boxes at your house or when you break wind. Normal places where all of the fire comes out of that use sky bag air are four tens and a six parts in a hundred better than those that use the stuff they burned in lights before houses had power. So over all, this game has a pretty good form of how well the places where all of the fire comes out of work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mmmmyum","CreatedById":85231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T08:40:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been looking for a mod that increased the thrust for RSS (I\u0027m looking at you, mod devs). I\u0027d just edit configs but I like the game to be balanced. All of it points to the lander being too heavy and the CSM being overkill. I\u0027ll try using less oxygen (have no idea how much they\u0027d use in the trip so I brought extra), and a lighter lander (the 2.5m fuel tank was chosen to help balance, but a 1.25m tank will do) along with lighter tanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
