All this without easy circular parking orbits. And how can I plan this hundreds of days in advance?

Then you take Ike\u0027s orbit altitude, more or less. In-game mod Transfer window planner is a bit better because it actually shows ejection angle in map view. So with that you are very close to perfect transfer. Almost like you were starting from Duna orbit.
