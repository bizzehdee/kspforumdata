All the tutorials I\u0027ve found only go into the basics.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I am assembling a space station comprised of 26 large orange tanks arranged in a hexagonal trefoil. Each tank has a large port on each end and nine small ports in sets of three on the sides. I am having difficulty getting them all to connect properly. Here is an illustration of the situation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vrqv9tA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vrqv9tA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure how to approach this problem. I\u0027m trying to resolve it by detaching the bottom half and then trying to get all the small ports resolved before reattaching the entire thing to the top half, and this is the closest I\u0027ve gotten. If this is the best way to do it, then by the time the station is done, the final docking maneuver will involve matching up 13 pairs of large ports, and that sounds dreadful. Is there a better way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, I am willing to install mods that facilitate docking so that maneuvers like this aren\u0027t as finicky.
