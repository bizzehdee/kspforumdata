Now this might have something to do with the plane im flying but i really think im doing something wrong XD. I go in at about 130ms and everytime it just explodes and the pilot is no more. So far everything eles in this game i have goten down but landing a plane is harder then rocket science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plane \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1153.photobucket.com/albums/p518/imaus1/ship.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ship.png\u0022\u003E Flys like a dream, most of the time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DomAzaris1996","CreatedById":25990,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T09:48:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums Imaus!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I\\\u0027d like to say that I have only landed planes on terrain, not the runway, so I am not that accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to business:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, your horizontal speed should not matter (as long as you arent going like crazy), as opposed to your vertical speed.. You only want to decrease a meter or two a second... You can do this but reducing thrust and angling the plane up a bit, so the lift slows the plane down...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDont get me wrong, horizontal speed does matter, but it is mainly the vertical...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes you are correct, the planes are much harder to fly than rockets!! Just remember, vertical speed is the main thing!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps you!!

I find the landing gear often sinks into terrain up the wheel housing and rips pieces off. And the faster you land, the harder it is on the wheel mounts, even if your vertical speed is close to zero. Watch the mounts while you\\\u0027re rolling, and they shudder and flex in a terrifying way. I find struts are necessary even on small planes, and even then might not be enough. Then when you hit brakes, the plane tries its damnedest to snap over and slam its nose into the ground. In short, I agree, landing a plane is one of the harder parts of the game now. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chillayy","CreatedById":33455,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T16:03:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t find landings to be any more difficult than they were in .15.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust approach slowly and watch some tutorials from youtube.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it quite hard to stop on the runway if I\\\u0027m going faster than 50m/s\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadownailshot","CreatedById":32828,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T16:12:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy single stage to orbit planes are exceedingly difficult to land because I found that the best way to get them into orbit results in a very far back center of gravity on re-entry. However, the large plane that I launch similar to Space Ship Two can glide almost perfectly level with very little downward speed at between 60-120 m/s depending on altitude.
