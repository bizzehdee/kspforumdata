I want this thing to do everything. One rover that can easily and safely traverse all planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/577867469587066638/11987FF89E98215A10E3355A7BCBE27DDDE6D265/\u0022 alt=\u002211987FF89E98215A10E3355A7BCBE27DDDE6D265\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this one here is the best one out of the.. three that I made. And Im quite proud of it. Its fast and very durable. Four Kerbals aboard and it can hit 25m/s. But if im going to be going this fast that presents a problem. Flipping a rover isn\u0027t a matter of if its a matter of when. Now.. at 20 or so m/s the four kerbals survived. I don\u0027t know if I got lucky, but I hope not because then that makes all this pointless. The rover explodes when it flips over. Violently I might add.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere some more views. ( Disregard the probe and decupler they are for the upper stage ) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/577867469587071674/B30C0AFACCFD62C0D1714E2D09E9A3BBD60AA82C/\u0022 alt=\u0022B30C0AFACCFD62C0D1714E2D09E9A3BBD60AA82C\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines you see poking through are roll over jets. They work perfectly. I have two of the small radial mono tanks slightly clipped into the craft which are also supplying two rcs ports on the side if you can see them. I angle them up slightly for stability and it gives me a 10m/s boost. Which can possibly knock off hours of travel for long trips. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd heres a top and bottom view. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/577867469587067774/C02077467A9FDBCCBF6D0A03E0FE3753304F6C9A/\u0022 alt=\u0022C02077467A9FDBCCBF6D0A03E0FE3753304F6C9A\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/577867469587068920/BA463D30B88CB70E84D11682B2F7549CC12F926B/\u0022 alt=\u0022BA463D30B88CB70E84D11682B2F7549CC12F926B\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put the control probe on the bottom.. For the longest time the probe was the first to go when it flipped. This worked significantly, but now if I bottom out im screwed. Im going to chance that seeing is how there is pretty much nothing to bottom out on. ( Haven\u0027t been to Minmus though that terrain could be a rough. ) Yet despite all this the damn thing still falls apart if it rolls over at speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe longest Ive traveled is 33km. And it was terrifying. One wrong move and an hour was lost. Quicksave only works when your stopped which sucks, but it does present a nice challenge. So every 5 km or so i have to come to a stop, save and move on. And the less gravity there is the longer that takes. On the mun it took me over 2km to bring my other rover to a halt from 20m/s. That rover is a crane, but I imagine this rover will be traveling close to its wheels max speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if im going to have any power issues. I have no idea where i can squeeze in a generator so im just going to add more panels and hope for the best. ( It has two small batteries. ) I need this rover to be efficient and safe as possible. It has asas and sas so flipping this thing should be hard to do, but as the late and great Forest Gump said \u0022**** happens.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Let me know if you guys cant see the images.. steams library isn\u0027t the easiest to navigate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"suzin.felipe","CreatedById":67820,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T04:04:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E25 m/s are, if I\u0027m correct, 90 km/h.
