Docking has always given me issues:sealed: but come the update i wanted to learn it and get it down. So I\u0027ve got a space station going right now. I\u0027ve managed to get a fuel stage, \u0022living quarters stage\u0022, and two rescue pods docked together. The part I\u0027m trying to dock now is what I\u0027m calling the \u0022Command Deck\u0022 it has the largest docking module to connect to. For some reason it won\u0027t connect, I am at a loss, the other \u0022Docks\u0022 I\u0027ve done have worked fine. Even the other large docking part I used on my fuel stage. I guess my question is does anybody know what I\u0027m doing wrong? It\u0027s really frustrating \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E as I\u0027m sure most of you know! ...and just so you know when I come in to dock its at .1 m/s and lined up perfect... it\u0027s like the magnets don\u0027t pull it together. Anyways thanks for the help and KSP is AWESOME!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"painking","CreatedById":69085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T05:34:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1: Make sure you\u0027re docking the same size of docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Make sure what you\u0027re actually trying to dock to is a port, this happens more often than I\u0027d care to admit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Pictures, to help better alleviate the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T08:58:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso make sure, if you are using the senior docking ports, that they are fitted the right way round.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T09:06:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso make sure, if you are using the senior docking ports, that they are fitted the right way round.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup.
