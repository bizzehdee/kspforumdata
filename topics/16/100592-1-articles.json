So I set up a Mun lander that uses drop tanks (with the landing gear legs on the tanks). These tanks feed into a larger central tank, using the yellow fuel pipes. The central tank is the only one with an engine.\n\nDo I have it set up correctly? Will it actually use all the fuel in the drop tanks first? If so, how do I know when the drop tanks are empty and ready to be discarded? It\u0027s easy when they have an engine on them, eg, onion/asparagus staging. When the engine shuts down, the tank is empty. But when the tanks don\u0027t have engines on them, the game doesn\u0027t give a fuel meter for them. Is there a way to do this without plugins, or a way to tell from the fuel meter for the single engine? Thanks guys!\n\nScreenshots of the craft in question:\n\n![di6tZt3.png](http://i.imgur.com/di6tZt3.png)![04FDgoh.png](http://i.imgur.com/04FDgoh.png)![09nEoCY.png](http://i.imgur.com/09nEoCY.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T00:12:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 12:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cjmdjm**\n  \nSet prefix to answered"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T08:08:59Z","Content":"In stock right now, right click them in flight to see current level of resources."},{"CreatedByName":"cjmdjm","CreatedById":138593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T08:12:48Z","Content":"Ok thanks.

I consume 1 of those tanks so my fuel guage reads half because it is a percentage and I have 50% fuel left. However, when staging, it becomes interesting. I have 2 tanks 100% fuel, I consume 1 tank and stage it off my craft... at this point, I still have 100% fuel because it doesn\u0027t factor the tank I dropped.\n\nThis is why in asparagus staging it looks like tanks are magically \u0022refilling\u0022 when you drop stages. They aren\u0027t actually refilling, they never emptied, but your total possible fuel containment went down when you dropped the tanks so the percentage adjusted back up to 100%."},{"CreatedByName":"cjmdjm","CreatedById":138593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T22:09:42Z","Content":"Wow thanks for all the quick responses.
