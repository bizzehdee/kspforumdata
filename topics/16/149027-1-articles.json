Now, after researching all the data in the science lab, I want to get them back. I had som fuel left in the station, so I tried to get an encounter with Kerbin. Instead I ended up with an encounter with Jool, and I figured I go past it to get some more science. This however left me in a more or less polar orbit around the sun (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E 43,500,000,000m and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E 25,900,000,000m roughly), and no fuel left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now I\u00B4m planning a rescue mission.

Then make the same adjustments as you would normally do (match planes, hohmann\u00A0maneuver, etc).\u00A0But to be entirely truthful, it just may be easier to brute force the plane change (after all, getting deflected into a polar orbit by Jool isn\u0027t all that useful if the resulting orbit is 90 degree out of plane of the research station.

Assuming that you always want the same phase angle for a transfer from Kerbin to Jool, then you\u0027ll have a window for Jool approximately every 1.096 Kerbin years. Now assuming that you are willing to accept a 5 degree error on the intercept, that means you need a possible intercept every 10 degrees (that will get you with 5 degrees worse case since you can accept the intercept either in front of or behind the desired point. Worse case is if both possible intercepts have\u00A0exactly 5 degree\u00A0errors). So running the calculations, you have a wait of anywhere between 0 and 69 years to get the desired intercept. The largest angular distance between adjacent possible intercepts is 8.9 degrees for a worse case of 4.45 degrees. The average error from the best case of the 63 potential intercepts is 1.73 degrees. So if you go the Jool intercept to use gravity to swing into a polar orbit for the rescue, you\u0027ll have a good window sometime within the next 69 Kerbin years. When I don\u0027t know, but I will tell you that between adjacent intercepts Jool will advance on average 34.71 degrees each time (won\u0027t be exactly that amount since Jool\u0027s orbit is a bit eccentric.
