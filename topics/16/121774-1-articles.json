IPET for short. Essentially its mission is to visit every body in the system and return to Kerbin. Its doable, except for maybe Eve. Eve may be a one way trip, regardless. The problem is that unlike stock, Real Fuels tends to handle ISP a bit more like RL.... as the atmosphere gets thinner and ISP improves, so does thrust, not how much the engine consumes fuel. This isnt bad for Kerbin, as its pressure is 1 Atmosphere. Eve is like 5 times that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatching Scott Manley\u0027s ISQ episode on a shuttle that landed on EVE got out by flying up. But can I do it without KSPI? Or should I look into getting KSPI now and learning how it works for future Eve missions, or just ignore getting off Eve all together and not bothering with KSPI..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough...
