It is only a visual indication to give the player a general idea what that part is designed to connect too. Otherwise, it does not effect any of the physics of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny apparent weakness it might appear to have is only because of how light the tank is.. and how heavy of a part you\u0027re connecting to it, along with the weight on top of it. In fact, many of the light 2.5m parts tend to have the problem of being weak or getting crushed in-between much heavier fuel tanks. Like the 2.5m rocket probe, Large ASAS, and Large SAS. In my experience, its never a good idea to stick these parts in the middle of your rocket, (Like at the top of your lifter, but just under your payload.) unless you use struts along the sides to strengthen them. Otherwise, they either cause alot of wobble or they get crushed during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
