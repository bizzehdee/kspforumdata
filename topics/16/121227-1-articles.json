Now, it flies really well, being able to pull many Gs at any speed, but it has one major issue. At a dynamic pressure of about 37kPa the roll controls get reversed. Basically, I can see the ailerons moving like they\u0027re supposed to, but the result of that movement is the plane rolling the wrong way. I press E, the left aileron goes down, right aileron goes up... and the plane rolls left. Well, in the first version of this plane I fixed the issue by disabling said ailerons at that pressure using dynamic deflection and enabling the roll control on flaps, which I set up as reverse ailerons, basically. That fixed the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I didn\u0027t like some other things about that particular plane so I decided to overhaul it a bit. The current version is better in every way, but the roll issue became a lot more severe. After a lot of fiddling around I still haven\u0027t managed to get it working as supposed to. I have reached a point where it won\u0027t roll left when I press E or vice versa, but at 32kPa to 41kPa it has very little roll control, with the worst point being at around 36kPa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what could possibly cause the roll control to become reversed like that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe relevant mods I\u0027m using are: FAR, AJE, Infernal Robotics, B9 Proc Wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some pics.

This is a bit before transsonic, it\u0027s mostly fine when I\u0027m already going above 300m/s. But just below that is where the problem occurs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current hypothesis is that it\u0027s due to how easily the IR parts bend. When the control surface is supposed to push the wing down, it only pushes the rear part of the wing down while the front part of the wing stays where it is and as a result the wing produces more upwards lift, not less. And the opposite would be happening with the other wing. I figured I could test that, and if I\u0027m right, fix it using quantum struts, but after installing them they don\u0027t appear under any category so I\u0027m looking for another way to reinforce these wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
