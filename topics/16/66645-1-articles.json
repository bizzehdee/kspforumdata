On a tidally locked body with no atmosphere it makes no (or ridiculously little) difference which way you go. When introducing interplanetary orbits the gain/loss by orbiting kerbin in the correct/wrong direction makes so little difference that it doesn\u0027t really matter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut one very important thing to consider, if you plan on docking two craft together, make sure they\u0027re both orbiting the same way otherwise it can be a pain getting them to, Yknow, not explode into a million pieces at 4500m/s \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T16:45:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MrAnonymous\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MrAnonymous\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do you determine the direction of your orbit around a planet ie: prograde, retrograde orbit?
