I am running Kerbal Joint Reinforcement. I am building a rover with Kerbal Foundries Inverting Tracks (They are lick tank or bulldozer tracks if you are not familiar). I am attempting to use these on a gantry rail from Magic Smoke Industries: Infernal Robotics. The Gantry rails had to be put on separately to get them to adjust the pair of tracks together in the correct direction. Attaching the tracks to the gantry, one side is completely stable while the other is very wobbly. Nothing breaks but I am wondering if there is a way to increase the tracks attachment strength or whetever is necessary to reduce the wobble? I have checked and it looks to be the track and not the gantry wobbling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T07:50:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this applies here because your description is vague (try pictures!), but remember that you cannot attach a part to more than one parent part at once.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
