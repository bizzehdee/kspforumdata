The new system of torque means you don\u0027t have to worry too much about balancing everything up. Last night I sent a tug down to LKO from GEO carrying a 3.7 ton tender on one side and it flew just fine. The tug is 160 tons and has 8 large ASAS, which I think is overly torquey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, mount them on the front of side mounted fuel tanks and when you launch one of a pair, shift some fuel or monopropellant to counterbalance the lost weight. So if you launch a single 1 ton probe from a pair, for example, shift 125l of monopropellant from the side with the probe to the side without to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real problem I find with carrying lots of probes is that they increase the part count very quickly, I launched a ship to Jool a few nights ago with six probes as well as a large mothership and it lagged horrendously. That ship had a dedicated probe carrier on the nose - a central gantry with six small RCS tanks arranged around it on the ends of girders. Each RCS tank has a clamp-o-tron junior on the front and a probe docked to that. When the probes are gone I\u0027ll dump the carrier into Jool where it will perform important scientific monitoring on its way down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Free Trader Beowulf","CreatedById":62689,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T21:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is my carrier on the front of the mothership\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lOpNJ2k.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lOpNJ2k.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry it\u0027s not a great picture, the probes are built around the custom red tanks on the left.

Depending on the amount of fuel you are hauling out on your grand tour of the outer planets, if you bring out 3 of those Rockomax Jumbo 64 tanks in a rough equilateral triangle, with a truss running along a side with the appropriate number of docking ports for your probes. If it\u0027s built right, you ought to be able to place the truss close to being inline the center of thrust, so that even if you launch a probe, the center of thrust/mass won\u0027t become unbalanced. Of course, these tanks might be far enough apart, you could put the probes so that they could launch from between the tanks from each side...
