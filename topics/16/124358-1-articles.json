When those rockets stopped responding directly upon achieving a stabile orbit, I added an extra battery because that *could* have been the problem. Those later models, however, stopped at EXACTLY the same moment: as I come out of the retrograde burn to circularize my orbit around the Mun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could see if I can get some light on my solar panels \u003Cstrong\u003Ebefore\u003C/strong\u003E reaching Mun, but I doubt that charge is the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI currently have three mods, - HyperEdit, MechJeb \u0026amp; KerbalAlarmClock - which I installed \u003Cstrong\u003E*because*\u003C/strong\u003E I was having problems.

Yet when I come out of this burn, control is lost immediately and completely! But since I agree with some of you that pilot error (time warp being on) is the only possibility that seems to remain, I\u0027ll check that and make sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for your fast responses.

When this model reached the Mun, the previous probe was still there. I made sure to be out of time warp, switched control to the old probe, and have NO control of it. Then I switched back to the new one, which was still controllable. I brought that into a stabile orbit without any issues. It is still accessible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefor, regardless how unlikely it is that a single SAS unit drains TWO 1k batteries in the same time as it drains a single 1k bettery, that seems to be what must have happened. Right-clicking the batteries on the old probe does not do anything (so I can\u0027t see their charge), but the batteries on the new probe are full! So maybe it *is* a charge issue after all!
