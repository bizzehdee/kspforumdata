But this adds cost and part count, and can still be tricky to get right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy solution to this is to induce a small roll in the craft, holding Q or E will rotate the craft around its centre, the centrifugal force will naturally make the side engines fall away from the craft better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not sure if this has been covered before, but i searched and could not find it.

If you do so, it even does not matter, if the boosters are aligned correctly with the horizon. Throttling down a bit, when using LFO Boosters and throttling back up after separation perfects this process. However you will loose some delta V, but its a fair trade off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luis","CreatedById":55075,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T10:58:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy hunch is that you will lose more dV by staging early or throttling back before staging, than you would from the extra mass of a few separatrons.
