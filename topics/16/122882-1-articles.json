What I\u0027m having trouble with is HOW to do it in the SPH editor interface. Or rather, how to do it predictably and with the minimum of fiddling around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, I can easily mount one large wing with a 5-degree positive angle. All I have to to is select the wing part, press shift-WASD --- I can never remember which is which until I press it, and I\u0027m at work w/o KSP right now --- to tilt the part by 5 degrees, and place it back on the fuselage. This method works fine for 10 degrees or any other multiple of 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if I want to use some angle that is not a multiple of 5 degrees, the only tool I know of is the rotation mode gizmo, and I have two difficulties: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt\u0027s very sensitive to the point that it\u0027s very hard to tell how many \u0027clicks\u0027 of rotation I\u0027ve applied and to reliably release the mouse button without changing the angle. Given that I\u0027ll want to apply the same incidence to the main wing and to the canard/tailplane, I really need to be sure I know how much I\u0027m applying. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI have no idea how much rotation I\u0027m getting per \u0027click\u0027 anyway. So if I\u0027m trying to follow a recipe that prescribes, say, 2 degrees of incidence, I\u0027m pretty much lost. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a better way to set very small angles than the rotation gizmo? Or some way of controlling the gizmo with the keyboard (so I can count clicks)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is compounded if the wing consists of multiple parts that mount to the fuselage. If I rotate, say, three separate parts that are each on the side of a plane, each part rotates about its own center, creating a saw-tooth effect. To get the wing nice and smooth, I need to translate up the front part (to match up its rear edge with the front edge of the center part) and translate down the rear part (to match up its front edge with the rear edge of the center part). Again, is there a better way? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for all advice.
