As they are connected with struts to a center point, I want to do as much as I can do to prevent others from summoning the kraken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually ran a test where the lack of symmetry only prevent it from rotating to the full degree, but had not tried to attempt it with mismatch target\u00A0angle, shift PoV to somewhere else, and then either shift back to the in-orbit craft or load it from that savepoint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-12T17:32:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2019 05:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Jestersage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
