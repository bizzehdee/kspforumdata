Or maybe the tank in the lower stage explodes from the nuke\u0027s exhaust and takes the side tanks with it. So I suggest 2 things. First, add MOAR struts between the side tanks so they can\u0027t flex. Next, put the nuke and the stack decoupler on different stages so you can let the lower stage get clear before the nuke lights. Even if it doesn\u0027t explode from fire, the fire can still toss it sideways into a side tank and blow it up that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m 100% certain, however, that it\u0027s not heat build-up from the nuke.

Someone forgot the LV-N fairing logic. The LV-N fairing, once separated, acts as debris themselves (unlike most in-game fairings), so if you place something that blocks the direction the fairings separate, in most cases the fairings went off to destroy the things blocking their direction. If this is the case, you have to place the fuel tanks in a place so that when fairings separate, it does not cause damage to ships.

Designed to go lko-duna surface-kerbin surface as seen in the OP screenshot. Idea was to use the chutes on the radials to help the landing there, then ditch those sub-assemblies completely on ascent from Duna and use the main pod chute for Kerbin return. (It\u0027s a career ship. The monoprop tanks are actually goo, and the central body below the pod is 2x materials bays and a 400 tank, it\u0027s a sci-ship with no transmitters)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm aware the nuke alone wont do twr\u0026gt;1 on duna, but was hoping the 48-7S\u0027s on the radials would give me enough grunt to get off duna (then drop em empty and nuke back to kerbin). That said I havent actually crunched the numbers, I tend to fire it and see, then plan a glorious rescue if/when it all goes wahoonie-shaped.
