I think there\u0027s an issue with the wheel collider so it doesn\u0027t work upside-down, though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do know, however, that Squad is working on a whole new set of modules for wheels, (hoping they\u0027re in the next update, but I have no idea if they will be) which should make them significantly more user-friendly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure what would happen if you put them all around the probe core, I\u0027m assuming facing different directions. I\u0027ve had the idea before of having a regular set of wheels, then a perpendicular set that could be lowered (using IR or KAS maybe) so it\u0027s could kinda \u0022crab-walk\u0022 if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am curious, though, what the intended outcome is?
