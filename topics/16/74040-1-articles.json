Just enough to make a slow docking maneuver annoying? If so, then there is nothing you can do about this.

However, as soon as you time warp or leave the object, rotation will stop. So you could do it short term. I think there is also a mod that will restart rotation for you after warp, and someone is working on a mod that will maintain rotation through warp and while you are away from the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I think all that is maybe straying off the thread\u0027s topic. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
