For a while I have been using a design(Below) where I rotate Mk2 fuselage until they blend together to form an almost perfect shaped lifting body. Is the shape being calculated to give me wing type lift or is it just giving me generic body lift based on the amount of fuselages I have?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mVbRHAA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mVbRHAA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SuQwW9J.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SuQwW9J.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the body is blended together to make an almost perfect lifting body. Is this accurately calculated or am I just making my plane blunt and more susceptible to drag?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s. This craft in question doesn\u0027t want to stay nose first. When re-entering the atmosphere, at around mach 6, the nose either pitches up or down violently and goes engine first and it\u0027s impossible to get it going nose first after that. No matter where I move the CoL too, it always flips over engine first. Is it the gull wings or is it the body? I included the FAR analysis if someone more familiar with aircraft/spaceplane design could give me some advice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heagar","CreatedById":67859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T09:19:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used FAR with deadly reentry only once to test a plane for an contest several times under different conditions, discovering it was mutch easyer to make an pinpoint landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that experance i assume, that FAR changes the atmospheric layer and - to an certain extend - the impact of control surfaces at an given altitude.

Because of that it would make nearly no sense to tell them to act only as pitch/roll/yaw control. Especially for roll/yaw, because they acting - when used - as yaw/roll control at the same time, witch lessens their value for a desired movement.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]The drag isn\u0027t displayed in the editor, but important. It has nearly the same impact as an engine placed out of the CoW (in flight direction). Because of that your plane with its gullwings on top will most likely tend to pitch up, witch means:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWith activated SAS your control surfaces will try to counteract - as usual in KSP at the outermost range of their movement.

Your plane will perpendicular widen it\u0027s pitch down and up movement.
