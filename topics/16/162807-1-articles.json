By that I mean if you click on a strut or cockpit or Kerball and then try to click the follow up button for say \u0027Crew report\u0027 or Take sample, etc, then the button freezes. You can click close no problem, just the action buttons. Now if you save and reload the buttons all work fine. I am using the latest version. Not a big issue as you can save and reload, but anyone know why it is happening?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeith\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-02T16:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you use the Enter key when you create quicksaves?
