I thought you were trying to match the orbit, as in the Ap/Pe etc... which would be insane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t *have* to match the orbit\u0027s inclination, but it makes it much easier sure. From a (preferably high) Eve orbit - for reasons Radhazard mentioned - set Gilly as the target and note the Ascending/Descending nodes. Thing of these as a \u0022pivot\u0022 between the orbits - that\u0027s where you want to make your burn to adjust inclination for max efficiency. Set a node and tweak it until the ascending/descending nodes get to as close to 0.0 as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want to use the least amount of fuel with the greatest accuracy, do multiple small burns (two per orbit) to gradually wrench your inclination to match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you could just go for it and end up in a non-equatorial orbit over Gilly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Smidge=\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
