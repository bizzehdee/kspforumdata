Even staging is not well integrated into the stock calculation (KER and MJ have better calculation though). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the burn durations don\u0027t change de needed dV. So if you burn slowly (for example, during a full orbit, which is stupid), your trajectory will be a mess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone did calculation of dV loss for extended burns.
