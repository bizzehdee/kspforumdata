Why on Kerbin would you do that? One drill will fill any amount of tankage just as surely as 2 or a dozen, with way less mass to get out there so is way cheaper to move, has a lower part count, and produces way less heat while consuming way less power (both of which require more parts and an even bigger lifter). The only thing 1 drill costs more of is gametime, which is never an issue unless you use life support, and a few days isn\u0026#39;t much of an issue even then.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are several key facts to keep in mind when designing any ore system:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. If you\u0026#39;re drilling and refining with the same vessel, you only need 1 of the smallest ore tanks. This is because you\u0026#39;re drilling and refining simultaneously, so basically the ore goes straight into finished product without needing to stockpile any. So all your tankage (except for 1 small radial ore tank) should be for finished product. You only need mondo ore tankage if you\u0026#39;re drilling with 1 vessel and refining in another.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. The ore production rate of drills and the ore consumption rate of the ISRU don\u0026#39;t quite balance. With all parts the same size, 2 drills will produce ore slightly faster than 1 ISRU can consume it if making LFO, but the ISRU is slightly faster than 2 drills when making either LF or O individually. The difference either way is less than the output of 1 drill, so there\u0026#39;s no point in having more than 2 drills per ISRU.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. The only thing you gain from having more than 1 ISRU \u002B 2 drills per ship is less gametime to complete the job. Which is nothing to you personally if you use warp, and doesn\u0026#39;t matter enough to bother with in game terms like missing transfer windows and consuming life support. OTOH, the more ore parts you have, the more power you need, the more cooling you need, the bigger the rocket you need to get it all somewhere, and the more it all costs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, for the big parts, 1 ISRU \u002B 2 drills requires 60 EC/sec and (IIRC) 400kW cooling. The 6-pack fuel cell makes 18 EC/sec so you need 4 of them to keep this running. And either 8 small or 2 medium retractable radiators to keep everything cool. For each set of 2 drills \u002B 1 ISRU you add, you need the same amount of power and cooling.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sardia","CreatedById":149922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T05:56:36Z","Content":"\nAre you assuming a level 3 engineer because the 4 drills certainly isn\u0026#39;t enough to keep up with a ISRU.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T06:23:33Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Geschosskopf\u0027]\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.

It is true when you\u0026#39;re parked over a 100% ore patch (which a lucky asteroid might be close to). A rich landing site chosen from the M700 orbital survey map may be lucky to be 10%. Then engineer skill also modifies it (as do thermal effects, in 1.0.5). \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn practice, on my usual 9.51% patch on Mimmus with a level 3 engineer (likely to be true around the time you unlock ISRU), six drills is about the same output as one large ISRU. Regardless, I agree with you 100% on the rest. Making the payload lighter is much cheaper all things considered, than a bit of extra time on high warp. I haven\u0026#39;t played with life support, but I\u0026#39;d think that a few days more snacks have to be much, much lighter than even a single drill.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nback to the OP: are you staffing that ship with an engineer? 3% is pretty low, are you sure you can\u0026#39;t find a better spot? Did you do a survey first or just land it wherever? And with that many drills consuming power, causing your fuel cells to consume your LF/O output, I\u0026#39;m not surprised you\u0026#39;re barely breaking even. When you right click on the ISRU and drills, what does it say? In 1.0.5 you need to pay close attention to thermal effects, and maybe heat isn\u0026#39;t really conducting to that giant radiator?\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-24T06:34:00Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2015 06:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fourfa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sardia","CreatedById":149922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T18:17:53Z","Content":"\n3% is what\u0026#39;s on the runway. 6% is just outside KSC but I\u0026#39;m just testing it for now. \u003Cbr\u003E\nAll rover versions have radiators and gigantic solar panels, they still barely make any fuel without time warp.
