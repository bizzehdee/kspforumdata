Keeping in mind that the idea is to use the station as a lab to reset the experiments on a lander. An equatorial orbit will make it really easy to build, since all the parts are going to be coming from the same angle, but that means that if you go to the poles with the lander, you will then have to use a lot of fuel to get into the same orbit, and most of the times that fuel is needed on the lander for other things. I have tried two times (on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and on Minmus) to build stations on a polar/high inclination orbit, and it works really well with the lander: no matter where I have landed, it\u0027s really easy to get back (just have to wait for the rotation to bring me under the station before taking off), but bringing new parts to the station is a nightmare. I am either very lucky and come into the moon\u0027s SOI with the right angle, or I come in with a 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA difference and have to kill all my speed to get into the right orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy latter experiments seem to indicate that I can adjust the angle of entry by putting my Kerbin apoapsis over the orbit of the moon, wait for it there and burn a little, prograde or retro, to come in from the front or the side of the SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-22T20:02:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2014 08:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Musil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T13:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour best bet is probably to use a polar orbit, yeah.

So here is the way to generally match a desired inclined munar orbit (also works for contracts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you send a spacecraft to the mun and establish a polar orbit around the mun, you maybe have noticed that, just after the orbit is made, it should be roughly facing Kerbin, ie from any point of the orbit, you can see Kerbin (if you have not, launch a probe to see!). That is because the mun has a nice circular orbit and you intercept it at your apoapsis (-\u0026gt; no radial velocity relatively to kerbin).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not so, your probably overshooting, or the time to circularize make that your obrit have already changed. Anyway, the position relative to Kerbin/ parent body should be the same for similar launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you have to make sure that when your vessel will intercept the moon\u0027s SOI, the target orbit will be facing Kerbin. You can figure that out by yourself, or follow these steps :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) look the plane that curently contains the target orbit. It won\u0027t change orientation, it will only translate as the mun goes. Eyeball the position of the moon for which this plane will be tangent to the mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) this position will be your intersect. Set up a manoeuver node to have an intercept with the moon orbit (don\u0027t bother the normal burn for now). The moon should not be there at the good time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Timing. Right click your manoeuver node, and set it several orbits later, until you have a good intersect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) Focus view on the moon, your predicted trajectory is coherent with the present target trajectory. Set the normal burn to have a ppolar orbit with no inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(5) Fine tunes your nodes : would it be better if I wait one more orbit? one less? If I have an intercept slightly sooner/later (draging node)? Is my PE close enough to those of my target?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a good definition of \u0022facing Kerbin\u0022, this method apply to any inclined orbit around a moon you want to catch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO, this is the most efficient way to catch an orbit, but also restrcit you to 2 launches / moon\u0027s revolution. For the mun, 3 days are not that much to wait and if you have big playload to deliver, it may worth optimize the path and transfer vahecle, but for Minmus or distant small Muns, it maybe simpler to orbit at SOI edge, then change plane \u002B lower PE, then lower AP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any questions, or need pictures, feel free to ask \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may put that in a tuto, if it does not already exist.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T15:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kesa\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kesa\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEstablishing orbit at the edge of the moon then changing plane is reasonable, but you can be much more efficient by directely getting the good orbit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re talking a matter of 200m/s deltaV tops - for a full orbit reversal.

KSP simply doesn\u0027t offer that level of granularity in the tanks. Sure you can always take some out before launching, but why bother? Fuel is dirt cheap. If you\u0027re making a reusable transfer stage, chances are it\u0027ll have nuclear engines, which means 2 things: 1) you don\u0027t need as big a margin - the lower thrust means you\u0027re much less likely to screw up in a big way, never mind the fact 300 m/s of margin is mainly for getting to orbit - there\u0027s a huge amount of variance in delta-v requirement for getting to orbit depending on subtle variations in your flight path. 2) 2-300m/s of delta-v with a nuclear engine, even for quite substantial loads, is not a lot of fuel.
