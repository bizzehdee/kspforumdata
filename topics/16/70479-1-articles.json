The bottom has jet engines and the top has nukes. I have it connected by docking ports instead of a decoupler. Every time I get high enough to ditch my jet stage and do so, the game thinks I should follow the useless jet stage. I know that I should redesign, but I\u0027m already on Laythe. It was hard to get here.
