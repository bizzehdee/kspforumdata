What am I doing wrong? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking maybe it\u0027s because I\u0027m using the wrong \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC. I know that \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC = GM, with g being the gravitational constant and M being the mass of the planet. So, if the constant of gravity at Kerbin\u0027s surface is 9.81, perhaps I should send a probe up to 100,000m and re-measure the gravitational constant so that I can recalculate the new, lower \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC and get a more accurate delta/V equations?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
