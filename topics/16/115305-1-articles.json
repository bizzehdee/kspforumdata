Crossfeed only applies to rocket engines (other than the Rapier and Puff). If you want to keep certain tanks full you can disable them in the right click menu either in the editor or in flight."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T17:34:40Z","Content":"Hi Capt.

This behavior is really useful for vessels where you don\u0027t want the CoM changing dramatically, mostly planes (which is why it is only airbreathers that have this property). If you are staging it should only drain from the tanks in the lower stages, assuming the root part is in an upper stage. More specifically, it determines which stage a tank is in by counting the number of decouplers between the tank and the root part."},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T17:22:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E but if i lock the fuel, ill have to stage and unlock at the same time, pretty stupid =/\n\nYou don\u0027t have to lockout oxidizer on any of the tanks since jets don\u0027t use it. Also, you could unlock only one tank\u0027s LF, stage, and then unlock the rest when you have time. If SAS is engaged you should be able to start unlocking the rest of the tanks right after you stage. Not the best fix but it\u0027s doable."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T17:28:13Z","Content":"Careful there, a Rapier in closed cycle mode will happily drain oxidizer from tanks in the same way a jet draws liquid fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T17:39:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Careful there, a Rapier in closed cycle mode will happily drain oxidizer from tanks in the same way a jet draws liquid fuel.\n\nTrue, but from his pic, he\u0027s using turbo jets and aerospikes.
