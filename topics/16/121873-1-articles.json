This was probably in 0.25. If I remember right, the whole thing weighed around 10,000 tons and had many, many stages.

It is like giving you a lot of sand and make you build a sand castle. Saturn V weighted 3k tons, it is the heaviest. So, I take it as a basis for construction. So, I have to use at least 334 of these. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApollos space craft weighted around 50 tons: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/specs/apollo.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.braeunig.us/space/specs/apollo.htm\u003C/a\u003E. So you\u0027d need 60 apollo rockets to push another Apollo rocket. If we use a first layer of 300 of these, we would have a second layer of 5 rockets. That\u0027s short of 29 of the minimum for 1MT. So, it\u0027s better than to surpass 1MT slightly, using a further 60 in the first layer, so we have 6 apollo rockets in the second layer.
