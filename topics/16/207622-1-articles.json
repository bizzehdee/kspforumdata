With \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E it is important to get on an ascent profile that allows you to get as high and fast as possible using your jet engines, continually accelerating, before kicking over to rockets. Lugging too much fuel can really hinder your ability to do this. When done right, you can actually get to orbit using a surprisingly small amount of fuel, which should fit comfortably in a single fuselage design. You probably won\u0027t go interplanetary using this method (without orbital refueling), but honestly \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is not a very practical concept (but still fun to play with \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E makes the above method a bit easier, as it makes the atmosphere a bit more \u0022slippery\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022192697\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3995184910\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/179445-18-112-ferram-aerospace-research-continued-v01605-mader-030422/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:197px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n"}]}
