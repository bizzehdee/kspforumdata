I haven\u0027t actually thought seriously about an Eve attempt since 0.19, but I remember the basic delta-V requirement being about 12,000 or so and the trick being to have sufficient TWR all the way up. Lately there\u0027s been some talk about Eve ascents on the forums, and one thing I kept hearing over and over is \u0022don\u0027t take along unnecessary mass\u0022, \u0022don\u0027t take along unnecessary mass\u0022, \u0022don\u0027t take along unnecessary mass\u0022...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I calculated a craft that could potentially do the job - except for one little snag, that being the fact that the first stage (dependent on a pair of Skipper engines) had a TWR of 0.99. Frustrated to be so close and yet so far, I thought \u0022I wonder if I could replace the Skippers with an engine cluster that would give me slightly better performance\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn hour later, I had written down the basic idea for what I called the Skipjack Cluster (names are really not my thing): using an X200-16 as a structural base (because my calculations called for an X200-32 and X200-16 in each stage), I attached a total of 25 48-7S engines onto the bottom. The end result - 2.5 tonnes of engines, 750 kN of thrust and the same specific impulse characteristics as a Skipper, a lighter and more powerful substitute; only downside is a vastly increased part count. Tonight I built the booster craft I calcuated.

The basic design is what I indicated in a post yesterday (and I wish I\u0027d taken screenies of its tests) - an upside-down rockomax decoupler with a quad adapter attached to it, with two drogue chutes and two big chutes in each space. I\u0027ve also attached two radial chutes and four seperatrons to the sides of the decoupler. Seperatrons fire at the same time the decoupler fires, blowing the whole thing clear of the ship. Had pretty good range on Kerbin, though I might\u0027ve liked a straighter flight path (I suspect the center of thrust of the assembly is too far below the center of mass). The plan is to stick one of these on each of the booster tanks, giving me 24 drogues, 24 radials, and 24 big chutes. I\u0027ve plugged the craft\u0027s mass into the parachute calculator and had it calculate landing velocities for various elevations with that configuration of chutes.

Lv-909s(?) - no cross feeding to improve the TWR of the core (since when its the core alone thrusting, it won\u0027t have a full fuel load).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know 48-7s are more efficient than LV-909s for low masses (its better to push around a lot less mass at a little less ISP, than to push around a lot of mass with higher ISP), but I\u0027d think with the stage above it, that 48-7s wouldn\u0027t be what I\u0027d want here.... but if I only lose 4 m/s, its not such a big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis suggestion, and the OP\u0027s engine cluster, illustrate one thing that sort of bugs me about KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor gameplay considerations, bigger doesn\u0027t have to be better, but it certainly shouldn\u0027t be worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy this I mean that using multiple small parts shouldn\u0027t be better than using one large part - if for nothing else than to reduce part count. I\u0027m very tempted to go non-stock, and just do very simple mods using the rescale factor (and mass and thrust) to make proportionately larer \u0022small parts\u0022 ie scale up the aerospike to be larger so I can use 1 large aerospike instead of a quad adaptor and 4 of them. Doing this with the 48-7S would improve computer performance even more, as all those cubic struts would be gone too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut a scaled up 48-7s (to the large size) would completely replace the mainsail....\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
