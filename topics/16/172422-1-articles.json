So yes, one answer is docking mode. It allows you to toggle between linear \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E controls and rotational controls. It defaults to linear, which is what you want anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo linear and rotational use the same basic control, which is the left stick (for WASD and IJKL). The additional control is the left and right trigger, for H/N = Up/Down, which is exactly the same as for your EVA \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E translational controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternately (at least in Radial preset) -- when you are in Flight mode,\u00A0holding down the Right bumper while \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is active will toggle the left stick and triggers into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E translation instead of rotation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-16T14:13:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2018 02:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-21T04:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
