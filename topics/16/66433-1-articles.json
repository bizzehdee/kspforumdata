The science is then transferred to a return ship which goes back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Mun stations look exceedingly cool.

Create a reliable SSTO that can make it to the station and back to Kerbin. Then, create a ship that can travel between Spirion Station II and Mun. There will be a secondary station there, with a lander that can go to the Mun\u0027s surface and return to the station. And then it gets more complicated, like so...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Lander leaves station and lands on Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
