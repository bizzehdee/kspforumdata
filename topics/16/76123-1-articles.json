The specific orbital energy or both transfers is the same, but the difference between the initial energy state and the transfer state is not necessarily the same. Again, this may or may not be true when you consider the energy it takes to \u003Cem\u003Ecapture\u003C/em\u003E a body into an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy perspective on this comes from Kerbin-Duna transfers and the respective returns. In my experience, the latter seems to require much less energy than the former. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen going from Kerbin to Duna, there\u0027s a large energy investment to break out of Kerbin\u0027s relatively large gravity well (relative to Duna), the transfer, and then another relatively larger investment to slow down enough for capture in Duna\u0027s relatively weak gravity. Going the \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E way at least seems easier because I don\u0027t have to speed up as much to break out of Duna\u0027s well to initiate the transfer, and I don\u0027t have to slow down as much to be captured in Kerbin\u0027s SoI. This may only be my perception since I can more effectively aerobreak at Kerbin than at Duna, leading to the illusion that the return takes less energy, but I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I agree that the energy of the transfer is the same, but I think it\u0027s possible that the energy required to start and end the transfer may be different in reciprocal directions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd even if that\u0027s not the case, it doesn\u0027t change the fact that \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E the information required to effectively make an efficient transfer is not always, or even frequently, presented in the dV maps. So lets not derail the thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Ugh, sorry, but I just thought of a more compelling counter-point. I swear I\u0027ll let it go after this. You pointed out, and I agree, that the energy of the transfers in both directions must be the same. However, orbital energy is dependent on the velocity \u003Cem\u003Esquared\u003C/em\u003E, while dV costs are simply dependent on the linear velocity term. This asymmetry is the reason that orbital states with identical energy states can be reached using maneuvers with different dV costs, and similarly, why we can \u0027exploit\u0027 the Oberth Effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo even if the \u003Cem\u003Eenergy\u003C/em\u003E of the reciprocal transfer is identical, the dV costs associated with the reciprocal transfers are \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E necessarily identical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, leaving it alone now, going to bed.
