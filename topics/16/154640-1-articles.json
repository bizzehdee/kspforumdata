So your station will have and keep the name it should, and as you undock any taxis, crew return vehicles, and probes, they will take the name you gave that probe core/command module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbital","CreatedById":170602,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-25T17:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027s the name of the target ship.
