I wanted to post some screen shots of my spacecraft to make sure that it\u0027s not my spacecraft and my bad skills that make landings hard. In another thread, I_Killed_Jeb, asked if it was my rockets that might be the problem. I know I over-engineer them to bring lots of fuel to the party, so I don\u0027t think it is that. I figured, I would post some pics of my latest design to see what the expert pilots think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in career mode and have reached the 300 science level of parts. I have the Skipper LFE, but the 7 LV-T30\u0027s on the outside asparagus tanks work fine. I have 7 LV-T45\u0027s on the inner tank. The lander has 4 LV-909\u0027s and I swapped out two Science Jr\u0027s for more fuel (FL-T200\u0027s). I also put a FL-T400 under the capsule to supplement the outside FL-T400\u0027s. I haven\u0027t used this lander to try land on the Mun yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually, I get into orbit around the Mun and then burn retrograde to make the orbit path straight up and down. I then burn to slow down and land with very little drift as I am falling straight down. When I tried to burn retrograde and then zero out the drift as I landed, I ended up swanning all over the place before landing. So, what do you think? My guess is the experts would take this overpowered rocket all over the Kerbolar System without refueling. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVAB pic with Kerbal Engineer data (craft files below pic)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7xZB7OH.png\u0022 alt=\u00227xZB7OH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to stick the pic in a spoiler tag, but it would not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the files for both the Mercury IV and the upgraded Mercury V that is in the pic above to make them easier to find.

The bigger stability issue imo is the lander that wobbles. It makes it hard to target a manouever node accurately. I would add some struts for this.

One for \u0022in space near\u0022 and one for touchdown. You\u0027re also set to take them home, and packing a series of parachutes to make that happen.

One for \u0022in space near\u0022 and one for touchdown. You\u0027re also set to take them home, and packing a series of parachutes to make that happen.
