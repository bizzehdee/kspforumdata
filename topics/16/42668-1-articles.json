I\u0027ve done this once to prevent RCS spamming on a station so it wouldnt destroy itself (but that was a 1-time use probe tug). Build the tug to the payload (only really works if your payloads are the same diameter always) and build a framework of girders (quantum struts advised to prevent flexing, but there are other ways) that cover either 2 sides (easier to dock to payload) or that cover 4 (more strut options, better stength). Try to imagine a forklift. Your tug should have these two arms coming off it in radial symmetry that straddle the payload and these arms should have RCS on either side to allow translation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is hard to build and even harder to dock without payload.
