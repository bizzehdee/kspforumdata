Sorry if this has been asked before, but I seem to have found an inconsistency in the units of measure for rocket fuel, if it is assumed to be liters. I found this while I was playing around with creating my first mods (very large xenon tanks), and was trying to figure out how much xenon I should put in them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, by comparing dry mass and empty mass of the stock xenon tank and its fuel capacity, I saw that one unit of xenon fuel is actually 0.1 kg. A little odd, but whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, fine. So now I wanted to figure out how much xenon fuel I should put in a modified Jumbo 64 tank. The Jumbo 64 supposedly, by my understanding, holds 6400 liters of rocket fuel. The number of liquid fuel units and oxidizer units certainly add up to 6400.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, rocket fuel is like, maybe on average (if using kerosine and liquid O2), *roughly* around the density of water, about 1000 kg/m^3, which is the same as 1 kg/L. I noticed that the difference between the dry weight and the full weight of the Jumbo 64 is in fact 32 metric tons, or 32000 kg. Thus, the Jumbo 64 actually should hold about 32000 liters of fuel (using the 1 liter = 1 kg approximation), NOT 6400 liters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final nail in the coffin against liters being the unit of rocket fuel was when I measured the dimensions of the Jumbo 64- they are 2.5 meters by 7.5 meters. That is a volume of pi*1.25^2*7.5 = 36.8 m^3. 36.8 m^3 is 36800 liters. This agrees VERY CLOSELY with my predicted volume of 32000 liters based on the density of rocket fuel and the mass difference between a full and empty tank, especially if you allow for a bit of dead space inside the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo using two completely different approaches, one based on density and weight and one based on volume, we arrive at the conclusion that the unit of measure for rocket fuel is NOT, in fact, liters. It is something else. It would appear that the volume of rocket fuel in game is actually around 5 liters per unit (32000 L / 6400 units = 5 L/unit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what in the heck is going on? Anybody know? Am I just doing something incredibly stupid? Or are the units of rocket fuel actually GALLONS?!?! If so, it would agree closely with the numbers then (1 gallon = 4.5 liters).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-08T17:06:35Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2013 05:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T21:18:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has indeed been asked about and discussed before.

I know the wiki SAYS that, but that\u0027s ridiculous and makes no sense considering the entirety of the facts. It would imply that only a small amount of a fuel tank is actually used to store fuel, and the rest is just empty, wasted space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said in my initial post, a Jumbo 64 is 1.25m in radius, and 7.5m long. This gives it a volume of 36.8 m^3. At the same time, we know that the Jumbo 64 has a fuel mass of 32000 kg. At a density of 5000 kg/m^3, you only need 32000 kg/ 5000 kg/m^3 = 6.4 m^3 to hold 32000 kg of fuel. So, if fuel is really 5000 kg/m^3, then the Jumbo 64 only uses 6.4/36.8*100 = 17.3% of its volume to hold fuel. The rest of it is just empty, wasted space. I don\u0027t believe that likely; the simplest explanation is just that liters are NOT, in fact, liters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither meters are not really meters, liters are not really liters, or full fuel tanks are almost entirely empty space. Liters not actually being liters only invalidates the numbers you see when you\u0027re fueling fuel tanks, as that\u0027s the only place that liters are ever counted. And hell, where does it actually SAY those are liters? I only see it in the wiki. No fuel tank descriptions say liters. However, meters are clearly intended to be meters. And if fuel density is \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E 5000 kg/m^3, then you NOT ONLY have to account for why fuel tanks are almost entirely empty space, but ALSO the \u0022odd\u0022 coincidence that when you use a REALISTIC density for fuel, the mass of the fuel in the fuel tanks exactly matches what you would expect if the fuel tanks are, in fact, mostly filled with fuel like they SHOULD be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, the simplest explanation I see is that liters are not liters. I think I\u0027m just gonna call them \u0022kerbal gallons\u0022 (kals) due to the fact that the value of 1 kal being close to the actual value of the gallon, and also due to the similarity that gallons are an inconvenient and confusing unit, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-08T01:04:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2013 01:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T01:19:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a massive problem with your math.

We know that the fuel in the X200-16 tank consists of 720 units of liquid fuel and 880 units of oxidizer; this is totally consistent with the 9:11 fuel to oxidizer ratio that the game utilizes. 1600 total units (720 \u002B 880 = 1600) between the two = 8,000,000 milliliters, so therefore a single unit equals 5000 milliliters (8,000,000/1600 = 5000), or 5 liters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s your answer: \u003Cstrong\u003Eone unit equals five liters\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also think of it as one unit equals 0.5 decaliters, though I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s a common unit of measure in practice in countries that practice the metric system (such as Mexico, where Squad is based) or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose by extension, one unit has a mass of five kilograms and represents a volume of .005 cubic meters.
