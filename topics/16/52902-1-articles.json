I\u0027ve ironed out almost all the issues except for the fact that around the 17km point in the atmosphere the plane uncontrollably pitches up and goes into a death spiral.

If you hover the mouse over \u0027resources\u0027 where fuel is displayed you will see intakeair dropping as you climb. A spaceplane design needs to switch to a liquid-fuelled rocket by around the 17km point (can stretch it with more intakes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe beauty of spaceplanes is that by the time you have to kill the jets and close the intakes in favour of the rocket, you can already have a good 80% of your orbital velocity, you just light a rocket and pull the nose up to pop the apoapsis clear of the atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm guessing the pitching is an asymmetrical flameout of the jets or something. You want to manually kill them before they choke (use action groups for that and open/close intakes)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nasakev","CreatedById":72681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T00:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a plane is at high altitude and intake air runs out, the jet engines don\u0027t all cut off at once. One will cut, then another, then a third, etc, causing uneven thrust. Could this be your issue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T00:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing I notice is that the net thrust of your engines is below the centerline, which produces a bit of nose-up torque. That\u0027s a good thing, and helps the plane get off the runway. But your control surfaces are counter-acting it until you reach an altitude where the air grows too thin to apply much force to the control surfaces, and then the torque gets out of control. Try shutting off the lower 2 engines with an action group when you get close to that. This will have the additional benefit of channeling their intake air to keep the other engines running at higher altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dekkars","CreatedById":92704,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T00:26:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVanamonde - Nailed it.

What is that central body/tank? Not sure I recognise the part.
