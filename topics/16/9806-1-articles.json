I just started playing KSP this weekend (even payed $15 for a pre-order and downloaded version .14).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in using some of the mods (ie the Nova Launch parts) my vehicle becomes extremely unstable even when it is just sitting on the pad. I know I can use struts and stuff to make boosters more stable when they are attached to the side, but my main concern is that 1.75, 2, or 3m wide tanks become extremely unstable when stacked on top of each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-22T19:25:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s a general problem with excessively tall rockets in this game.

The way that aerodynamic drag is calculated in the game gives no bonus to skinny rockets over flat pancake rockets (unlike real life) so you might want to try building your rockets squatter first. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, even if you want to build tall rockets, making wider rockets is the first step towards fixing your problem: make the base wider and use struts to connect the wider lower stages to the thinner upper stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I think 1.75m, 2m, and 3m parts aren\\\u0027t actually less prone to wobbling than the 1m ones.
