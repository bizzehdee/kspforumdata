I have no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E firing, no engines running, nothing. I then checked the map view, and lo and behold, the orbit was shifting all on its own. I have no clue what\u0027s causing this, and I\u0027m going to lose the mission if I can\u0027t figure this out, and fast.
