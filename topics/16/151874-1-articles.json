harder for the wheel to move in any direction, even the one you\u0027re trying to drive in, so decreases speed and increase the EC/sec draw of the wheel. \u00A0Increased friction also increases wheel stress, which makes it more likely you\u0027ll get a flat. \u00A0HOWEVER, increasing friction is often necessary to climb steep slopes and also to stop on steep slopes without sliding down.

changed to reflect the gravity of other planets. \u00A0Also, if your rover is very heavy or light for the type of wheel, you might change them. \u00A0Normally, you want spring and damper to have the same value so they balance each other, but there are some really strange situations (such as 500m/s dragsters) where you need them very different. \u00A0In general, however, I would leave these alone
