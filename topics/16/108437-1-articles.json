Landing at KSC is just a matter of choosing where in your orbit to do your deorbit burn (if you\u0027re in a circular orbit, above the giant crater you can\u0027t miss is a good place to start, although I haven\u0027t quite managed to nail it reliably in 1.0\u0027s atmosphere yet). With a bit of practice (and quicksaves!) you should be able to do it.\n\nIt\u0027ll also save you some fuel if you use the atmosphere to aerobrake when returning from Mun; aim for around a 40-45km periapsis for that. Don\u0027t expect the engine you have to be useful in the atmosphere though; because of changes in 1.0, engines\u0027 thrust varies with atmosphere density instead of just using more fuel; the terrier in particular is nearly completely useless at sea level. Instead just decouple it once you\u0027ve committed to reentry.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T19:02:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 07:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by armagheddonsgw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Telesto","CreatedById":139819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:17:09Z","Content":"Are you suggesting that prior to re-entry I \u0022dip into\u0022 Kerbins atmosphere on an elliptical orbit at a periapsis of 30-40km over a number of orbits then just before my orbit becomes a terminal decline I then adjust my final re-entry to coincide with the exact thickness of atmosphere that I land safely back at the KSC?

With practice (as you say) and managing to avoid the Westerly mountains and the sea to the East could be a good marker.\n\nIt\u0027s very tough to estimate the rotation of Kerbin on the long return journey to time it right though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T19:36:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 07:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Telesto**"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:31:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are you suggesting that prior to re-entry I \u0022dip into\u0022 Kerbins atmosphere on an elliptical orbit at a periapsis of 30-40km over a number of orbits then just before my orbit becomes a terminal decline I then adjust my final re-entry to coincide with the exact thickness of atmosphere that I land safely back at the KSC?

I think the tutorial requires you to raise your periapsis out of the atmosphere though so it\u0027s a full orbit before you go for reentry.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve never managed to recover a craft back into stable orbit after hitting Kerbins atmosphere.

Quicksave (F5) just after leaving Mun\u0027s sphere of influence and then just quickload (F9) if it turns out you went too deep. You\u0027ll probably want to raise your periapsis when you get to apoapsis after each pass though - periapsis drops a little during an aerobrake."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:33:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve never managed to recover a craft back into stable orbit after hitting Kerbins atmosphere.
