Just wondering if anyone of you managed to re-enter Kerbal and land successfully in the training scenario To The Mun: Part 2?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter reading a few of other people\u0027s forum quips, I\u0027ve tried low orbits, shallow angle re-entries, re-orienting the capsule to have the tip pointing away from the heat, however every time the result is the same: The parachute burns up from heat whether I deploy it or not. Also it seems in the earlier versions of the Kerbal, the heat did not really start until 35,000m above ground, whereas in my version the heat already starts at 55,000m above ground. The parachute also seems to deploy automatically sometimes even without me pressing any buttons...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t quite understand what I\u0027m doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any hints!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vim Razz","CreatedById":43764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T00:01:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving just tried it out to make sure I knew what it asks you to do, the first thing I\u0027d recommend would be to right-click on the parachute and set the altitude it opens at to 1000m or so. The 500m it\u0027s set at was fine for the pre-release atmospheric model, but it\u0027s a little low for the current game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, are you trying to steer the capsule manually while passing through the atmosphere? It can be a bit twitchy, so I suspect you might be over-steering it and exposing the parachute to re-entry heat as a result, but I have no way to be sure with the information available. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt happens to be designed to fall correctly if it\u0027s on it\u0027s own and unpowered, so try switching SAS off (by pressing \u0022T\u0022 so the light on the navball goes out) and let it orient itself on the way down.

The good news is, at this altitude you\u0027re shedding velocity without getting too hot. As you get lower things get hotter, and that\u0027s where you have issues of fire and death, especially below 20km, and very especially below 10km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you follow my advice at the top, you should slow down more gently and avoid overheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022enthusiast\u0022 data-cite=\u0022enthusiast\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe parachute also seems to deploy automatically sometimes even without me pressing any buttons...\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t quite understand what I\u0027m doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re approaching Kerbin and you separate your fuel tank and engine, is the parachute set to the same stage as the stack separator? If so, when you press space to get rid of the rest, it will also \u0027arm\u0027 the parachute. Then as soon as the air pressure is high enough, the parachute will self-deploy, even if you\u0027re still going too fast. To avoid this you can set the parachute to its own stage by clicking the little \u0027plus\u0027 button by the stage indicators on the left and dragging the parachute icon onto the new stage tab. Then drag parachute stage to the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the parachute is already on its own stage, just be careful not to press space again after you\u0027ve separated the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it\u0027s possible you\u0027re not doing anything wrong at all - KSP is still carrying around a fair few bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022enthusiast\u0022 data-cite=\u0022enthusiast\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe parachute burns up from heat whether I deploy it or not.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the parachute part exploding, or is the chute envelope being destroyed after deployment? These are different things with different implications:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the parachute is exploding, that means it\u0027s getting too hot, so my advice at the top should solve this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s being destroyed after deployment, that means it\u0027s deploying too soon. That\u0027s partly covered by my other advice, but it\u0027s also important not to deploy the parachute when you\u0027re still going too fast. The safe-limit is around 250m/s - if you\u0027re going faster than this, that\u0027s too fast to use the chute. If your re-entry is shallow enough to not explode but not shallow enough to slow down for chute-deployment, you might need to tweak your re-entry periapsis. Which way (higher/lower) depends a bit on exactly what\u0027s happening - if you\u0027re slowing down horizontally but then falling too fast vertically, your periapsis is too high, so you need to lower it. On the other hand, if you\u0027re still travelling horizontally/diagonally too quickly, your periapsis was too low - you need to raise it up so you slow down a bit more a bit higher. An ideal re-entry will check your horizontal speed at just the right altitude to deploy the parachute before you accelerate into a vertical fall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: note that any re-entry should start at near-horizontal and end at near-vertical. If you\u0027re beginning re-entry on a near-vertical trajectory, you\u0027re always going to die.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clear Air Turbulence","CreatedById":149987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T07:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EN00b here too. But I have found (I think!!) that one way of making sure parachute does not overheat / burn up is to make sure that I am pointing retrograde as I enter the atmosphere. I seem to be able to remain quite stable in the air for the first 40 000 metres of descent or so. My theory is that this protects the parachute, and so far it has worked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Highguard","CreatedById":150696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T16:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can confirm that the parachute in that tutorial has not been corrected for the new aerodynamics and will fail to brake the capsule unless you change its settings as suggested by Vim.
