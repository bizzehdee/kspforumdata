The fuel from the central tank is fed to these small tanks using the crossfeed tubes. It\u0027s been all done using 4x symmetry, and it worked fine until earlier yesterday.\n\nThen it seems one of the pipes somehow switched orientation. Now one of the tiny tanks gets drained extremely fast as soon as I start the engines (and its engine dies), and meanwhile the three other engines don\u0027t pull fuel out of their own tanks or the central one.\n\nThe craft is a little too far to just go to VAB and send another one. I need to fix it by editing the save. How can I go about it?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T17:08:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 05:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T14:10:48Z","Content":"I think you\u0027re just gonna have to edit up a new ship. Since a fuel line is a compound part rather than structured, this would be a really hard thing to do and would take a long time. It\u0027d also run the risk of further damaging other parts."},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T14:15:57Z","Content":"If you\u0027re not against installing mods, you could try [TAC Fuel Balancer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25823-1-0-2-TAC-Fuel-Balancer-v2-5-1-2May), it has the option to balance all tanks, could avoid uneven drain with it."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T16:43:20Z","Content":"Also, if you are willing to edit save files, you could send a fixed version of your probe to the launch pad then do a quicksave. (Keep a backup in case something goes wrong.)\n\nEdit the save file with a plain text editor (like notepad) and find the old probe. Copy the vessel header info that contains the situation Orbit info. Copy that info into the new probe\u0027s header. Then, copy the new probe\u0027s lat/long/alt info to the old probe.\n\nFor both probes, you\u0027ll also need swap the state info (I forget the name of the variable off hand), but on the new probe, it\u0027ll be set to PRELAUNCH. You might also have to set the old probe\u0027s \u0022Landed = True\u0022 variable. After you swap that, save the file and ALT\u002BF9 load it. This should effectively swap the two vessels, and you can recover the broken one.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
