Somebody kindly commented in one of my posts that the weight of your rocket is a very large factor in these sorts of things (Specifically mine was with engines breaking off at a 0.4m/s landing on the mun without landing gear).\n\nIf you have a very large rocket, even 7m/s is a huge amount of momentum for your legs to absorb, and they will break. I almost always go for a landing under 1m/s wherever possible. Then again, lately, the rockets I have been landing on the mun are for attempted double munar return missions and so are rather large."},{"CreatedByName":"Letum","CreatedById":4227,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T15:07:47Z","Content":"I usually land below 1m/s.\n\nTry using directional RCS to fine-tune your descent."},{"CreatedByName":"dnleek","CreatedById":24215,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T21:36:09Z","Content":"If you\\\u0027re using the struts, a safe limit is 4 m/s, with as little lateral velocity as possible.
