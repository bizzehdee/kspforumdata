IRL probes and mapping satellites would give a great picture of the surface to use to identify areas of interest. I know there is the mapsat mod but that looks to be dying and I don\u0027t want something that says go here with a big arrow. Should I just plan on driving around all the celestial bodies in a rover or is there a better way?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xzxvrx","CreatedById":57321,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T20:54:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have been doing, I send a probe orbiter/lander. I get into a circular orbit then just look around for interesting places. If you want to try the Lazor Mod, with cameras that zoom in, but getting focus on an area while in orbit may be hard. But when you spot a place that looks worth checking out, I send an lander probe to scout the area. You could attach a small rover to the lander, or possibly design the lander to get back up to orbit and rock with the orbiter and continue scouting. Hope this helped a little.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmenia","CreatedById":83343,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T21:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose are good ideas.
