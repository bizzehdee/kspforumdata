Placing the drop ship in orbit and docking the 4 Munar landers went without a hitch (note that I did not use the Munar lander engines before docking). I moved all of the Munar lander engines to their own stage (Stage 3), as all of parts in staging got jumbled after docking, and then proceeded to the Mun using the drop ship engine (Stage 4). All of the Mun landers were undocked, landed on the Mun, and returned to the drop ship. I re-organized the parts staging again and tried to fire up the only the drop ship engine. Unfortunately, all of the engines fire up at the same time now. I tried stage locking with no luck. I know I can shut down each engine individually. With enough forethought, I could set up action groups, but I\u0027m not certain how they would act after docking. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EIs there any way to shut down an entire stage of engines?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/02ZN9ve\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/02ZN9ve.png\u0022 alt=\u002202ZN9ve.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-27T15:02:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2013 03:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NinpoFox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T18:43:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAction groups should work fine with docking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbonautical","CreatedById":75532,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T18:43:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell you can right click on the individual engines and select deactivate one by one.

I found that once I restarted my PC, everything worked as expected with the unwanted engines moved to an inactive stage. Not sure if this is a PC related issue or a bug. As a footnote, I found I could recover more science in less time by flying 4 individual missions as opposed to transporting 4 landers at once (and landing them one at a time).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
