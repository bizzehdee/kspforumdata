I wonder why.\n\nI\u0027m not overly concerned about lauch clamps, but I\u0027d like to recover some boosters. If they burn out early enough, that ought to be easy... and indeed I see them land, I can still see them from map view while I\u0027m about to leave the atmosphere, then suddenly they\u0027re gone. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen them vanish... I think it happens while switching to and from the map.\n\nThose boosters tend to drop on the launchpad, or at least the hexagon that surrounds it. I wonder if the mechanism that spirits them away is the one that\u0027s responsible for cleaning up the clamps."},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T22:03:59Z","Content":"Launch clamps and any other debris landed at KSC is automatically recovered when it leaves the physics range (when you go more than 22.5 km away from it)"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T22:15:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Launch clamps and any other debris landed at KSC is automatically recovered when it leaves the physics range (when you go more than 22.5 km away from it)\n\nDoesn\u0027t work for me.
