On the other hand, it does explain why you were so dismissive of general arguments, since the sort of scenario you\u0027re talking about is incredibly locally specific. I had thought of the deep pits near the Munar north pole as a possible location to test whether vertical ascent could ever be better, but apart from the fact that they probably aren\u0027t deep enough for that to work anyway, there\u0027s still no reason I can think of why you would ever want to launch into an escape trajectory perpendicular to the ecliptic plane!
