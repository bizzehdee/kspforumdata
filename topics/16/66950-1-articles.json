Since science experiments can only be performed once why bother trying to obtain an orbit with a probe or satellite that you don\u0027t plan on landing?

Let me give you an example with Mun missions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could do a bunch of separate launches with a lander to get EVA/Crew reports from multiple biomes, and similarly, get fly-over science with separate probe launches on different inclinations...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...OR...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could launch one orbital station with a mobile lab, set in a polar orbit. Then, I send up a rover, land it and collect my EVA/CRs. Then I dock with my orbital station, refuel, and then drop back down to the surface at a different spot. Rinse and repeat. Once I\u0027m all done collecting science, I dock the rover to the station and fly the whole thing back to Kerbin. It takes significantly less time and effort to visit the surface from an orbital platform than Kerbin.
