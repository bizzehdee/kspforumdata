Need for keeping a reign on your thrust and ascent velocity (and G\u0027s) is also an issue. Fins do help.

Seriously read it, love it, understand, then read it again.\n\nHere is the main reasons your finless rocket flips over:\n\nCenter of Mass is near the tail.\n\nThus any Drag on the Nose has more Leverage than Drag on the (finless) tail.\n\nAlso, the greater your speed, the more air-resistance - hence more drag - hence more flippiness.\n\nHere are the solid recommendations for those who are allergic to fins. Get an epee pin, and stop being alergic.\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t work, then do this instead - go slower. Speed = Drag = Torque = Flip.\n\nIf you must launch a rocket without fins, because it\u0027s \u0022National Don\u0027t Use Fins Day\u0022 where you live, then you must follow this procedure:\n\nTurn down your thrusters. Going too fast will kill you so don\u0027t.\n\nKeep yourself nice and slow-ish about 350m/s until you are way up there (like 30km way up there)\n\nOn the way up, do your gravity turn very very gently. If your nose deviates more than about 5degrees from our flight-path you will flip.\n\nAnd here\u0027s a big tip on speed - going slower at first, actually helps you have a more efficient gravity turn.\n\nYour goal is to aim for 45degrees by 15km. So go slow enough to give your rocket time to arc over.\n\nOnce at 45 degrees and 15km and climbing you can throttle up. But make sure you keep your nose pointed strait at that Surface Mode Prograde Marker!\n\nLaunching a finless rocket on \u0022National Don\u0027t Use Fins Day\u0022 requires precise control. Good luck!\n\n(I prefer to call in sick on \u0022National Don\u0027t Use Fins Day\u0022 and stay home until the next day, so I can use fins to keep my rockets stable.)\n\nAlso:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pA1y5a5rnk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T05:03:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 05:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EtherDragon**"},{"CreatedByName":"SessoSaidSo","CreatedById":111600,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T13:18:41Z","Content":"The point is, how many modern launch vehicles actually use fins?

If the aero is supposed to me realistic, why do realistic launch vehicles not work?\n\nReal launch vehicles don\u0027t have fins because they have very good control algorithms that monitor angle of attack more precisely than you or I can. They are also flying ascent profiles that were exhaustively studied, modeled and simmed long before the rocket was ever assembled. Real launch vehicles are also flown in the same configuration over and over, building up a huge database of performance that feeds back into the algorithms.\n\nWhen you and I throw something together in the VAB and toss a Kerbal on top and put it on the pad 15 minutes later, we haven\u0027t done any of that. I spend a couple of minutes doing \u0022trade studies\u0022 in KER sometimes, but often I just fly the darn thing. We don\u0027t have a fancy guidance computer, or carefully calculated thrust profiles or anything. If SpaceX or ULA or Roscosmos or Arianespace did that, they\u0027d be just as flip-happy.\n\nEtherDragon\u0027s advice to keep initial velocity low is good. We have the luxury of extremely deep-throttling engines (an advantage none of the real rockets have).\n\nI\u0027m happy to see the new tiny fins.

You can\u0027t see where that is in the editor, but it seems to generally be roughly in the middle of the ship. Thus rockets that drain their fuel from the top are doomed unless they have some pretty powerful fins. But rockets that drain their fuel from the *bottom* have a much easier time of things, or in other words, you have to block fuel flow to the engines and then run a fuel duct to them from the top of the ship. It\u0027s hard to make ships this way that aren\u0027t ugly, but once I started getting the hang of it my launches immediately became significantly easier.
