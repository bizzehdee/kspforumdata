Obviously this is impossible, but for most cases where burn time is less than 45 seconds or so (depending on orbit shape and semi-major axis when the burn is started) this is a pretty close approximation. Close enough that you don\u0027t notice the difference. For vehicles with such a low TWR, it\u0027s not uncommon that maneuvers take much much longer. The problem with this is the loss of advantage gained from the oberth effect... as you burn, you raise your apoapse... and the periapse will move with the vehicle (meaning that you pretty much stay at the fastest point in the changing orbit, burning more efficiently). If your TWR is very low, you will pass your periapse (and maneuver node) while burning... and more of the fuel will have to be spent constantly correcting for your ship being where it\u0027s not supposed to be (if you\u0027d completed the burn in an instant you\u0027d be much higher than you currently are). In effect, you\u0027re fighting against orbital mechanics instead of working with them.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAs noted earlier, the only real solution to this is to implement the maneuver in increments... maybe 30seconds to 1 minute per burn. In my opinion, the best solution is to simply have enough TWR to complete maneuvers in \\*no more than\\* two \u0022kicks\u0022... it gets a bit tedious otherwise. You also have to consider the potential fuel cost for correcting mistakes (more kicks = more chances to mess up)."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T16:18:48Z","Content":"Any TWR is workable if you are patient enough, it\u0027s more a matter of personal tolerance.

The rule of thumb I remember is that the initial Kerbin-TWR when going to Jool should be about 0.2; any more than that is convenient but not really necessary. If TWR drops below 0.15, adding more (nuclear) engines will usually save fuel despite the higher weight.\n\nI also found that maneuver nodes aren\u0027t straight pointers. I haven\u0027t figured out the algorithm behind them, but they are updated during the burn and change direction and size to make up for errors. My attempts to outsmart the maneuver node have been inconclusive (the outcome was all wrong and I couldn\u0027t figure out any relationship between my doings and what happened).\n\nTo rephrase what Impyre said: what really matters isn\u0027t how much time you take, but how much your trajectory bends while doing the burn. If your maneuver is prograde only, but the maneuver marker on the navball is 30 degrees off from prograde for most of the burn, you will have severe losses.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T17:15:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 05:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"},{"CreatedByName":"1of6Billion","CreatedById":46191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T17:27:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E snip...\n\u003E Gotta ask - how many engines do you have and how much mass are they pushing?\n\nUpgraded to 4 LV-N\u0027s pushing 305T, TWR =0.08\n\nLaunch to 600KM for maximum time warp.

If carefully planned, it\u0027s almost as efficient as using one large vehicle. Basically, send several modules instead of just one. Good TWR\u0027s will be easier to obtain, payloads will be easier to control in terms of attitude, smaller launches are more manageable, and failure of a single module doesn\u0027t wreck the mission (assuming you send spares). The overall fuel cost is still related primarily to TWR (which is itself often related to engine mass), payload mass, and destination. These can be kept the same regardless of how many launches you use. On my last mission to Duna, I basically sent up everything I needed to build a large orbital station around Duna, with some spares. Refuelling, life support, science, return capability, etc. I plan on leaving everything else (including spares) for future missions... I\u0027ve even considered refuelling all the modules and sending them on to Jool direct from Duna.

But 600x600 will be more forgiving for low TWR.\n\nHowever, this is only interesting IF you have refueled your ship once you\u0027ve parked it at 600x600. Else, stay lower (see oberth effect).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I rely on Mechjeb for launch windows, doing multiple burns will be quite tricky. I think I\u0027ll just rethink my Grand Tour strategy.\n\nShouldn\u0027t be a problem. Periapsis kick is really your only option here, though a multi kick like in [Red Iron Crown](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/12867-Red-Iron-Crown) signature might sound complex. You could start with a simple two part burn (1 kick, then the final burn) :\n\nI\u0027m assuming mechJeb tells you when to burn / places the burn node for you?\n\nSo pick that departure node, right click, and hit 6 times the \u0022-\u0022 button. This should move your burn 6 orbits (6 x 1h13mn18s) earlier. Remember what the **burn dV value** is.\n\nThen change this node so that it is only making your orbit a 600x6123 km orbit (it should only be a prograde burn, nothing else, and it should require about 519 dV : that\u0027s 11mn at 0.08 TWR)\n\nDo this burn. At the end of the burn, focus on the Ap Value rather than the node details. Try to hit 6123 km\\*.\n\nThen this burn is over, create a new node at your Pe, and make it the **initial value** - 519 (which you\u0027ve already done). Fiddle around with the Blue component, and you should get your encounter back. This new burn should be also in the 500ish range, which means if you made the first one, you\u0027ll make this one.\n\nSo that\u0027s a very rought way of doing a single Pe kick (I\u0027d be more careful of restoring the normal component of the initial burn, but i\u0027m assuming ejection inclinaison angle is very small). It gives you the concept, but uses tricks to make it simple to execute. Namely:\n\n- The intermediary orbit period is a multiple of your parking orbit, so you can just use the \u0022-\u0022 button. That\u0027s why I picked 600x6123, it\u0027s (7:19:46 which is very close to 6 x 1h13mn18s). (I use this tool to come up with orbital periods: [http://files.arklyffe.com/orbcalc.html](http://files.arklyffe.com/orbcalc.html))\n\n- A 600 x 6123 orbit takes around 7h, which means the Pe you\u0027re setting 7h in advance will only be 1 degrees off compared to the one required for your final maneuver node. That\u0027s close enough.\n\nWith a .08 TWR, there\u0027s no real way around Pe Kicks, but once you\u0027ve made this crude version, you\u0027ll probably feel more comfortable making a \u0022real\u0022 one.\n\n\\* Actually, as indicated by Red Iron Crown in his thread, try to make the sum of your Pe \u002B Ap be 600 \u002B 6321. But that\u0027s hard to do in real time in the final second of the burn.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T18:25:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 06:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Captain H@dock**"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T18:31:38Z","Content":"![burn-timing.png](http://flyonbudget.one-giant-leap.info/_images/burn-timing.png)\n\nI thought this image was a good illustration of the fact that how much fuel you burn and which way you\u0027re pointing aren\u0027t the only important things... where you are in your orbit is very important.
