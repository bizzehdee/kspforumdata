It occurs to me that if I\u0027m going to say, Duna, it seems more efficient to just burn straight up until my trajectory is leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI, without bothering to orbit first. However, I don\u0027t actually understand any of the principles behind efficient rocketry (I\u0027ve sort of just been cribbing from youtube videos and memorizing the practices), so I thought I\u0027d ask the forums: Is that the right way to go about it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T22:43:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on how much thrust to weight your rocket can put out. Since we\u0027re probably talking realistically here, it is generally more efficient to insert into low Kerbin orbit first. An exception would be if you time your launch in such a way that you will be accomplishing your interplanetary burn before where you would normally be doing your first engine cutoff for inserting into low orbit. The reason for this is that we want to do all of our burn as low as possible to minimize gravity losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you travel from 40km in altitude to 70km, a specific amount of energy is taken away from your kinetic energy. While that is constant and doesn\u0027t change, what we can change is how much velocity is lost through that altitude transition. If you double your velocity, you increase your kinetic energy by a factor of 4. If you think about it a little, you will realize that less velocity is lost when you are traveling faster and subtracting the set amount of energy loss from altitude change than if you were traveling slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing straight up with a rocket, you pass through all that altitude while not travelling as fast as you would be by getting some horizontal speed going.

Burning straight up all the way is not the most efficient trajectory. You are fighting gravity drag throughout the burn. What needs to be done is to accelerate perpendicular to gravity, and also low enough into the gravity well to take advantage of the Oberth effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe optimal trajectory to do so is to launch, do a gravity turn, turn almost horizontal (when appropriate) and burn directly into a hyperbolic escape trajectory. This burn doesn\u0027t suffer from gravity drag, and since your altitude remains low throughout (since you\u0027re burning horizontally), you take advantage of the Oberth effect for the maximum amount of time possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this is only theory of course, in that it doesn\u0027t account for everything. For instance, the ease of a straight up burn might make the dV loss acceptable, in fact i\u0027ve launched most of my interplanetary satellites like that. Similarly, the actual way that you fly will change the numbers dramatically. If your gravity turn introduces high steering or atmospheric drag losses, you\u0027ve already lost any benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best option for most cases is, thus, the middle ground, i.e. a parking orbit. You lose a small amount of dV for shaping the orbit correctly and for starting the escape burn higher up, but on the other hand orbits are easy to make, you don\u0027t need to worry about launch timing, you can set up your maneuver with plenty of time to spare etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, i would advise the following. If you have an overpowered rocket and you care about convenience over efficiency (which is totally legitimate on occasion), just launch straight up. In any other situation just get in a low orbit first, you\u0027re going to be saving some fuel this way. And finally, this is KSP so money and lives are not at stake.
