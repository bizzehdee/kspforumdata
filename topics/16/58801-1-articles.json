Have a Kerbal inside the cockpit turn his head so that you\u0027ve got a good view of the RAD ALT, then when you think you\u0027re getting close, switch to IVA and check it. If it\u0027s a night landing, you can pretty much stay in IVA mode until you\u0027re at about 150 Meters up. At that point switch and come back out to the outside view, and your lights on the lander should just be picking up the ground at about that time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my procedures for night landings is to expect to land at a higher altitude than the plot shows. try and come to a near stop and hover right about where you think you\u0027re going to start picking up the radar at 3000 meters. Check and then start final descent once you have \u0022acquired\u0022 the ground via the RAD ALT.
