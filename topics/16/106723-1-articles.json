If you are turning too hard, as mentioned, it will lose control.\n\n2. If you are going too fast low in the atmosphere you may have trouble turning (though usually this actually makes it harder to turn, rather than turning too much).\n\n3. If the center of thrust is not in-line with the center of mass, it will push the shuttle around (That is why the real one has angled engines, to offset the power of the boosters)."},{"CreatedByName":"royying","CreatedById":20591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:39:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ok, well there are a lot of things that can cause this.\n\u003E 1.
