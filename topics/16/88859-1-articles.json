As mentioned by others, you can download a mod (which is actually a patch) that solves the problem. Or you can just work around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo work around the problem with radial decouplers, there are a few underlying assumptions and other things to bear in mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe main problem is the top end of the radial booster swinging into the central stack, so you want to keep that from happening\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe radial boosters, except for the smallest SRBs, generally need struts to hold them on during use. However, no matter how big your radial boosters are (including tall 3.75m liquid stacks), you only need at most 2 struts per booster, 1 at the top and 1 at the bottom, connected to the central stacl.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt\u0027s important to keep the number of struts at a minimum because the root cause of the problem seems to be a screw-up in how decouplers break struts. The more struts they have to break, the less well the decouplers work and the less predictable the results.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWorking around this issue requires putting Sepratrons on the radial boosters but you have to be careful there. You don\u0027t want too many Septratrons blowing fire on the central stack for too long or they\u0027ll explode the central stack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe radial boosters will always have 1 end or the other swing in somewhat no matter what you do, so you need some stand-off distance between them and the central stack. This means you should only use the TT-70 radial decouplers for anything bigger than the small SRB. The TT-70 is the one with the diagonal bracing holding it out from the central stack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, you now have 2 main options depending on your rocket design. The easiest method solves the underlying problem (tops of boosters swinging in) by using Sepratrons to swing the boosters in the opposite direction, so their lower ends swing in. To keep them from colliding with the central stack, you want their lower ends to miss just behind the engine of the central stack. This requires you build the rocket as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe radial decouplers must be mounted as low on the central stack as possible, so the pivot point is as low as possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBuild the radial boosters so their lower ends are no higher than about even with the bottom end of the central stack. If they stick down below the central stack, so much the better.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPut 2 Sepratrons mounted in the horizontal plane at the top ends of each radial booster. While keeping them in the horizontal plane, drag them out outboard around the curve of the radial booster so their nozzles don\u0027t point straight back at the central stack. This minimizes Sepratron flame impingement on the central stack down to safe levels.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOPTIONAL: tweak the amount of fuel in the Sepratrons down to a very small amount while leaving their thrust alone. You need their full thrust to counter the inward swing of the top ends of the boosters but the longer they burn, the more they swing the bottom end of the booster inwards.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing this approach, often the lower ends of the boosters will collide with each other just behind the central stack, resulting in harmless and entertaining explosions to make your launch more fun, while the central stack continues on undisturbed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf mounting the radial boosters as above isn\u0027t possible, then you also need Sepratrons on their bottom ends. This makes 4 Sepratrons per booster. Usually, mounting (and optionally tweaking) the Sepratrons exactly the same way at top and bottom is sufficient. Then the boosters will fly out sideways while remaining more or less parallel with the central stack. But this is boring because you don\u0027t get to enjoy the harmless explosions when they collide with each other \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T17:59:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E[*]It\u0027s important to keep the number of struts at a minimum because the root cause of the problem seems to be a screw-up in how decouplers break struts.

I just wanted to point out that while this statement is true, it\u0027s not how struts break off that are at the root cause. It\u0027s actually a different problem, and struts are a symptom of that problem. Even without struts, if you decouple liquid fueled boosters consisting of FL-T800s at speeds between 700-750 m/s, the results are catastrophic. If you can manage to keep the decoupled boosters from colliding with the core, the decoupler heads (the part that\u0027s ejected) will still break off from the jettisoned LFBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally found a way to fix all that within stock\u0027s ability, and decouplers seem to work now with the same abilities as pre-v0.24.2. For people who prefer to go without add-ons, there are still other design workarounds that can get the job done (as Geschosskopf so deftly pointed out.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T21:13:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFWIW, I dealt with this issue by putting a little roll on my ship as I hit the staging button.
