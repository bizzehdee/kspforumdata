That should help you get a nice kick to boost your AP, if that is required, and they are really cheap ^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from that, go light, as light as possible. You might want to try something using only a singe jet and a few .625m rocket engines (if oyu have any of those unlocked) since they are really light and some of them get quite good specific impulse for amazing (engine-) TWR. Rocket engines are bloody heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
