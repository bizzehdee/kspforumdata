I have a goal in mind that i have had since I first started playing KSP about a month ago, and have slowly been working towards it ever since. before I get to my questions, let me outline what I want to do to make it easier to understand;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, to build a Satellite orbiting kerbin that is also a good sized refueling station. From this, i want to attach several other crafts. once I have it all assembled in orbit, I want to fly the entire station, and the attached crafts, to each and every celestial body, land, refuel using kethane, and then head on to the next. I intend it to be one long trip around the entire solar system, before returning safely to Kerbin, with all Kerbals safe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso first, question I have; does Center of Mass affect thrust in space? think i worded that right. if not, what i mean is does the station have to be balanced for interplanetary travel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecond question; Not sure if this has been done before, but I have gone through the Delta-V map and figured that the highest Delta-V that the station would need to go from one planet to the next before it could refuel is 9250 m/s. that is figuring about 100m m/s for aerobraking when possible and such. I just calculated this over an hour or two so not sure just how accurate it is, I don\u0027t have any experience with interplanetary travel atm, so if someone that has more experience could look over my numbers for me? thanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso this is the route I figured quickly, and the delta-v for it;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekerbin \u0026gt; Gilly = 3000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGilly \u0026gt; Moho = 4630\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho \u0026gt; Duna \u002B Ike = 3500\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke \u0026gt; Dres = 1500\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres \u0026gt; Pol = 3400\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPol \u0026gt; Bop = 6800\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBop \u0026gt; Tylo = 6600\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo \u0026gt; Vall = 5900\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVall \u0026gt; Laythe = 4500\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe \u0026gt; Eeloo = 9250\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEeloo \u0026gt; Kerbin = 3400\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso thats what i figure so far, if anyone has any tips or anything to add, it would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-24T00:11:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2013 12:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by vildar87\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T12:25:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, yes it does.
