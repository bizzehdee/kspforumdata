The jet engines run on liquid fuel and intake air. You\u0027ve added circular intakes to provide intake air, so you\u0027ve got that covered. The large rocket tanks have both liquid fuel and oxidizer, so the oxidizer is dead weight that the jet engines can\u0027t use. You might be running out of electric charge, those new RGU probes need a bit more electricity than the smaller probes. Try some solar panels or an RTG, and maybe a battery for good measure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Therion_Prime","CreatedById":68700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T20:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, it should run just fine with that tank.

The thing is, that the air intakes do provide only a bit of intake air when you are standing vertical. If you turn a engine on the game gives you more intake for some reason (they suck air in maybe?). But if you activate all engines at the same time there isn\u0027t enough air in that timeframe so you get a flameout. Not starting all engines at once is indeed the only way to go safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBug in my opinion, the game should calculate the air that you get before the air that you spend and not vice versa like it seems to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the people who comment about the electrical power: The large probe can run 5 minutes on it\u0027s own power.
