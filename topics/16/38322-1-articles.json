Docking ports on their own are not nearly as stable as struts. Personally, I\u0027ve been known to do this with space station modules (I use a quad-coupler with 0.5m ports), but I usually need to strut the bejesus out of it to make it stable enough to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Sokar: The best way I\u0027ve found to make the struts aesthetically pleasing is the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/H0tY0CD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H0tY0CD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022H0tY0CD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set the symmetry to however many tanks or whatever I have and grab a strut. In this case I hold it over the outer tank so as it lines up with the opposite side (notice the two nubs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/bYXdZWi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bYXdZWi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bYXdZWi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, instead of clicking on the centre tank with the other end, I click on the nub on the opposite tank. This way the pathing automatically connects it to the centre tank, but it\u0027s \u0027aimed\u0027 at the other nub, leaving you with nearly perfect looking struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/2k5eFmz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2k5eFmz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222k5eFmz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis method works with any symmetry other than 3x (and 1x, obviously).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to strutting your outer tanks to each other however (as opposed to the centre tank), you still have to do it by eye.
