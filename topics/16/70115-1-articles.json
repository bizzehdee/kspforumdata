Straight download of the Mac version from just a few days ago. The batteries (and the Stayputnik) were turned on.

Your probe core will drop 10 power in the same amount of time each battery does. They should all be at 90 when it\u0027s empty. It shouldn\u0027t cause any lapse in functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had an issue a few versions back in which engines would sometimes be unable to get power from the rest of the ship, and sometimes it would start during a flight in which they had previously been working. It would prevent me from raising the throttle. Scott Manly experienced this in one of his early episodes of his reusable space program series. But I haven\u0027t seen it happen at least since career mode was released, so either I learned how to avoid it or it got fixed, not sure which.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T18:49:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tested the behavior and in I don\u0027t see any problem, it seems to work as intended.
