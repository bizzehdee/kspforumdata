You notice that the two docking ports that were connected in the VAB are still connected here and evidenced by the fact that they have the unique \u0022Decouple Node\u0022 action that you cannot get from docking two docking ports together outside of the VAB. However the inline docking port of the payload and the floor docking port on the cargo hold has become stuck together and hard docked, as evidenced by the \u0022Undock\u0022 function.
