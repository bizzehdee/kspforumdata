How do you fly them into space most efficiently? What factors, if changed on a plane, change how it\\\u0027s flown into space?\n\nThis is probably not answerable in complete depth, but anything you can tell me would be most appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"Oggula","CreatedById":10927,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T19:51:09Z","Content":"Very interesting question, I wouldn\\\u0027t mind knowing\n\nI\\\u0027d guess it looks kind of like a tan curve on its side. You go flat to get up to speed, pitch up to 45 degrees at the center of the atmosphere so you climb rapidly, then level out near the top so you an use the remaining air to gain horizontal speed before climbing to orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"theflyingfish","CreatedById":17741,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T02:00:13Z","Content":"Oggula has it right. I remember ascending using that profile on the XR-2 in Orbiter, with the scrams and everything.\n\nHowever, I found that with current KSP engines, this doesn\\\u0027t really work. The \u0027High Altitude\u0027 engines are most efficient at sea-level, and as you gain speed they don\\\u0027t really increase thrust enough to continue accelerating, and in order to really go into space with auxiliary rocket engines you need to get to a speed far higher and faster than what the engines can currently do. I think (and I am not sure about this) that the drag v. speed curves on KSP are all out of whack. There is far too little drag at low speeds and far too much at high speed. IN order for the space planes to be effective, they must be able to reach extremely high speeds at extremely high altitudes, which is impossible with the current engine efficiency curves and drag v. speed curves.\n\nIt doesn\\\u0027t really matter, anyway, because the rumor is that KSP is due for a aerodynamics engine upgrade in the near future that will render anything I say here completely moot.\n\nPS: I\\\u0027ve come close to achieving orbit with a spaceplane turbine/rocket hybrid by modifying some cfg. values, but am currently plagued by staging problems."},{"CreatedByName":"hebdomad","CreatedById":16474,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T04:55:50Z","Content":"Hopefully your right on that one. I\\\u0027ve also heard that aerodynamics are in for an overhaul, so for now I\\\u0027m going to stay clear of the Space Plane Hanger until it\\\u0027s fixed. This also includes putting space planes on rockets in the VAB... Because that\\\u0027s even more messed up."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T07:00:07Z","Content":"It\\\u0027s not as bad as you might think. It seems to me that the drag model is not the issue (other than the way it\\\u0027s always been). The problem is the engine parts are still basically placeholders. The ramjet should be utterly helpless while sitting still on the runway, but it gets full efficiency. \n\nRegarding trajectories: it really depends on engine performance, so everything will change as the new features in version 15 get improved. My strategy for now is to use engines in stages according to their \u0027sweet spot\u0027 or performance envelope. A good example is Oggula\\\u0027s and theflyingfish\\\u0027s experience with Orbiter\\\u0027s Delta Glider XR-2. (In that ship, I would take off horizontally with the rockets. Once the ship reached the scramjet\\\u0027s performance envelope, it would be used for much better efficiency. Then it shuts down and back to the rockets to finish the ascent.)\n\nAnother example: just today, I visited Minmus using four ramjet engines as *vertical* first stage boosters. (That probably won\\\u0027t work for long.) I launched straight up, then gradually tipped over until nearing the ceiling for those engines. At the end of the performance envelope, I was flying horizontally as high and fast as those engines allow. Ran them out of fuel, then jettisoned and fired the rocket stage to finish the ascent."},{"CreatedByName":"Stevenator1","CreatedById":10892,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T12:50:58Z","Content":"Indeed the RAM jet physics are nowhere near complete. For now, I\\\u0027ve completely gotten rid of my first stage solid boosters on the bottom, favoring usually about 8 jets. The minimal fuel use is easily outperforming a solid booster, and I can get a good horizontal velocity before running out of fuel and firing up the main liquids."},{"CreatedByName":"antbin","CreatedById":22389,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T02:21:38Z","Content":"My hunch at an ideal profile for my [KPS Delivery IV](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12837.msg199724#msg199724) craft, as far as I can tell in 0.15:\n\n[list type=decimal]\n\n[li]If using jet engines, take off at 100% thrust, climb ASAP as steeply as possible[/li]\n\n[li]As turbojets approach 100/200 intake boost, let nose fall until plane is barely climbing at just 10m/s or so (which depending on weight / lift will be with nose up ~30 degrees).

Any time spent going straight up is wasted fuel, as you\\\u0027re just fighting against gravity until you pitch over.\n\nOnce your apoapsis is out of the atmosphere, either continue burning slowly until you reach it and then throttle up, or cut engines and drift to apo, then reignite them and finish your orbital burn."},{"CreatedByName":"antbin","CreatedById":22389,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T01:00:15Z","Content":"[Androsynth](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=7167) tells me that my profile isn\\\u0027t the best - he\\\u0027s found that a steady 50 degree climb is more fuel-efficient.\n\nUseful tip: Atmospheric engines are more efficient than rockets down to 8%."}]}
