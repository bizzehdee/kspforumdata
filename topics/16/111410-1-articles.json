Kerbin\u0027s rotation gives you a \u0022free\u0022 100\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153200m/s (can\u0027t remember just how much) velocity in an eastward direction, before you even leave the pad. In the early stages of the ascent, that\u0027s very significant in relation to the magnitude of your prograde vector. On anything other than east and west launches, you need to compensate for it with your heading (not a huge amount, just a little, correcting it over the full duration of your ascent thrust). I can\u0027t recommend a specific heading to correct to, as I personally just launch heading directly north or south, then eyeball the correction once established in stable flight. (And obviously it\u0027s helping you if you launch eastwards, and hurting you if you launch westwards, but won\u0027t change your course, just dV required to orbit.)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T21:02:05Z","Content":"Not really getting it Quantum\\_Matter, can you provide pics?

In the very early stages of your flight, the horizontal component of your prograde is tiny, so that 174.5m/s horizontal east vector dwarfs it, and your achieved course will be mostly east despite heading directly north. As you gain speed, the achieved vector (the red one in the pic) starts to correct itself (but will still need some actual correction by putting a little of the dV slightly towards west of north, to fully cancel the starting 174.5 east). Even at orbital speed of a bit more than 2000m/s, that\u0027s just a little bit less than 9% of 2000, so significant overall unless corrected."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T03:17:24Z","Content":"Quantum Matter, do you mean \u0022I\u0027m heading due north all nice and fine, but at about 25-30ish km, my prograde marker jumps suddenly about 8-12 degrees to the right on the navball\u0022?
