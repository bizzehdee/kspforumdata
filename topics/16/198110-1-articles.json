Every module you attach shifts the station\u0027s center of mass and makes it wobble to an increasingly greater degree if you try to change its orientation, so consider the station to be un-movable beyond small orbital correction maneuvers once you start putting it together. You can, however, work around this by packing the station up via\u00A0attaching every module end-to-end in a straight line to minimize thruster torque before moving the station, then unpacking it once you arrive. And for the sake of whatever deity the kerbals worship, use autostruts!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor docking, you need one docking port on each module (obviously).

As docking is a very precise and low-speed/low-acceleration maneuver, you don\u0027t need a lot of delta-V for it; most of the time, 20 units of monopropellant is more than enough for a docking maneuver with a 1.25m ship.
