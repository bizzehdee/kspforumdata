Vertically means the front end of the rover is pointing up when on the rocket. Horizontally means the rover\u0027s nose is pointing at the horizon when on the rocket (although the rover could be upside down with the wheels pointing up instead of down). This is a matter of personal taste. Horizontally attached rovers are easier to land at the destination although they often look ridiculous on the Launchpad due to their blantant disregard for aerodynamics. So some folks prefer to do vertical attachment, which complicates the descent somewhat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, it\u0027s usually best to build and save the rover in the SPH because this allows putting the wheels symmetrically on both sides. Then exit the game and copy the rover\u0027s file from the SPH to the VAB folder. In the process, edit the 4th line of the craft file from \u0022type = SPH\u0022 to \u0022type = VAB\u0022. This makes it so when you revert the flight, it goes to the VAB instead of the SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you want a horizontally attached rover, the rocket required obviously depends on the size of the rover and what else you want to send there in the same mission. If the rover is fairly small, you can put it under a lander and bring them down as a unit with the rover between the lander\u0027s legs. Once at the destination, you can release the rover and drive it out from under the lander. OTOH, if the rover is too big for that, or is itself a mobile lander, then stick it on the nose of the rocket. Big landers like this can be mounted wheels up atop the rocket, but this means all its command parts (capsules or probe cores) will be upside down during launch, which results in explosions. To avoid that, put a probe core in the last booster stage that\u0027s facing up and remember to set \u0022control from here\u0022 to that probe core before launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith vertical rovers, you also need a \u0022control from here\u0022 probe core in the rocket itself. But the real issue with vertically attached rovers is getting them balanced for the rocket\u0027s thrust. The rover\u0027s CoM needs to be at or very close to the centerline of where the rocket will attach to it or the rocket won\u0027t fly straight when pushing the rover up. Rovers are inherently imbalanced this way due to having wheels on the bottom, so you sometimes have to finagle parts (or the attachment position of the rocket) around to get the CoM where it needs to be. A little offset isn\u0027t that big a deal because during flight, control surfaces, torque, and RCS can correct for that, but try to make it as small as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the rover isn\u0027t going down attached to a lander, you now have the issue of how to get it down by itself. For this, the rover needs rockets and/or parachutes. The main question here is whether you want these descent devises to remain on the rover once it lands, so it can take off again. If you don\u0027t want to keep them, then attach them with separators or decouplers. It\u0027s safer to drop these parts once you\u0027re safely on the ground but it\u0027s more dramatic and entertaining to drop them just barely above the ground with the rockets still burning so they fly off and crash skycrane-style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, however, one of the most important things about landing rovers is protecting the wheels. If the rover hits the ground on its wheels and is falling too fast, 1 or more of the tires will pop. So, you either need enough rockets/parachutes to land like a feather, have a Kerbal ride the rover down to fix any flats, or put lander legs on the rover, land on them, then retract them once down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dwight_js","CreatedById":83255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T16:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI personally like to make my rovers modular so that they pack nicely on the rocket and then assemble them at the destination.
