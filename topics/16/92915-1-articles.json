A properly engineered SSTO spaceplane allows you to launch, perform a mission, and land back at KSC. This allows you to recover your entire craft for nearly the full amount it cost. You only lose money on the fuel. When rockets start costing $100,000\u002B, and 95% of it gets dumped into atmosphere to burn up, spaceplanes can be a major savings that allows you to spend your money on other things.

As for complexity, you are correct, anything that needs to be aerodynamically viable takes alot more work to get working, and is arguably harder to fly (\u002B it takes a little more time then a classical brute-force rocket).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a almost exclusive SSTO designer (only thing i touch rockets for are capital ship sized stuff, as well gl trying to FLY a 500 part massive ship). Reasons i like SSTOs (and to a certain extent spaceplanes with jettisioned stuff), are their looks (aside form some capital ships, conventuional rockets just arent my thing aesthetically), their efficiency and range, reuseability (i find any fuel anywhere and im more or less starting out with a brand new craft), and the fact that i can use a single design to do more or less any mission to any location (provided i have the dV needed to get there). I also enjoy the higher difficulties with making a SSTO (rockets outside of forgetting struts or not having enough fuel/engines, and just a joke in terms of difficulty to make/use). But yeah, SSTOs from a pure efficiency standpoint arent all that great if you have no intentions to use atmosphere for gliding/abusing lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are very new to the game, i recommend starting with rockets (i went right to teh hardest thing, SSTOs and well took me a while to learn what works/doesnt work). if you are at all interested in spaceplanes though, start playing with atmospheric jets. if you like to fly those, SSTOs/spaceplanes are the same thing with some added complexity (although rapiers can give your SSTO an integrated engine). 90% of all spaceplanes/SSTOs are basically a conventional atmospheric jet with either an extra engine and fuel for it, or rapiers instead of turbojets and some LFO as well. RCS and monoprop is obviously needed for docking, and it is strongly reccomended to add at least 1-2 extra reaction wheels (cockpit is rarely enough). The reaction wheels help with both atmo flight, as well as in space (you need either RCS or reactionwheels to be able to turn in space (unless u use engine gimballing which is rather useless unless you dont care about being thrown off course during teh turning phase).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing, just try every style, and stick to what you like. When i got the game, i played with rockets, i played with jets, and i found i liked aircraft alot more, so i decided to stick to aircraft, and then that led to me getting into SSTOs. I also developed a rather particular taste for certain looks (compact, micro fliers with stubby wings, dont know why i dislike massive wings), and thats what i stuck to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"seaces","CreatedById":131939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T18:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk so I got that that from economical standpoint space plane I better at it becosue it is reusable.
