Everything else is \u0022on rails,\u0022 meaning it only moves along Keplerian conic orbits, just as if you engage standard time warp. This reduces processor load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it also means only gravitational accelerations apply to these other objects. No engine thrust is obvious, but also no aerodynamics are applied either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t a problem with airless bodies; the vessel continues on rails forever unless it impacts the surface. Atmospheres, however, are a problem, because drag and lift are significant forces and have to be actively simulated. So the devs decided that an atmosphere pressure less than 1% Kerbin sea level pressure could be ignored under certain conditions. But anything leaving the simulation \u0022bubble\u0022 in an atmosphere greater than that (or entering such an atmosphere) is assumed to experience \u0022significant aerodynamic forces,\u0022 and burn up, or lose control and crash. The game simply deletes the object to save processor effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Kerbin 1% atmosphere is anything below 23 km. By exiting the flight scene before landing, you\u0027re telling the game that you don\u0027t care what happens to that vessel, and it can safely assume it will be destroyed. Mods such as StageRecovery can override this behavior, so if you want to recover the vessel you need to either install such a mod or ride it all the way down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crawforc3","CreatedById":177950,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-22T16:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223062624\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160870\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221495312551\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022144187\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ForScience6686\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/20/2017 at 1:35 PM, ForScience6686 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m wandering why you are leaving it to it\u0027s fate or trying to watch from the tracking center? \u00A0Why not just watch it descend to the ground?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was trying to do this to get through my contracts faster.
