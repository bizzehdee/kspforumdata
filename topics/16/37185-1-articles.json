It looks promising but I think it would be better if angles were replaced with times. It assumes a circular equatorial starting orbit anyway, why not time the de-orbit burn off an overflight of KSC? That\u0027s how I do it when I use my own re-entry prediction program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, assuming:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. alterbaron\u0027s calculations take Kerbin\u0027s rotation into account\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You are orbiting prograde (i.e. in the same direction as Kerbin\u0027s rotation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. you are in a circular equatorial starting orbit at 100 km altitude\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KXA089Z.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KXA089Z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u003Csub\u003Esurface\u003C/sub\u003E is the rate (in degrees per second) that your spacecraft is moving across Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only limitation that I can foresee with using alterbaron\u0027s plot is that it doesn\u0027t account for differences in spacecraft drag.
