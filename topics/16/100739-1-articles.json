I sent a vessel which had been docked at my old station for a while over to the new station. So I\u0027m not sure if the game is counting from the time I actually launched it (two hundred-odd game days ago) or when I undocked from the old station (after the new station had been built and named). In either case, the new station has retained its name.\n\nI don\u0027t really have an older ship I can dock with it until I get my crew back from Moho. But this subject will be dead and gone by the time they get back.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T01:28:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 01:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Barefoot Friar**\n  \nadded )"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T20:20:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think it matters what order you launched then in.

It also look as the vessel classification.\n\nIf you want to dig, then look at your docking ports in the save file, you will see that when you dock the ship, it stores the vessel name (prior to the docking) in the docking port\u0027s attributes."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T21:21:32Z","Content":"It is, in fact, more complex than just launch order.
