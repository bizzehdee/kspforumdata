So, here there is what is happening: I need someone to calculate an absurd amount of Delta-V. And with absurd I mean a grand tour (actually not really \u0022grand\u0022) of the kerbol system: a flyby of Dres, Moho, Kerbin, maybe Eeloo, and maybe maybe maybe a Moho lander. All in one. Without mining. I know, it is crazy, but what I just need the Delta-V, the craft I\u0027ll do it. Well, if you ask the reason I can tell you that is a long story. Well I hope someone answers...

We can use math to find out how much it would take to travel all these distances. To flyby Moho, and approach at its apoapsis (which is possible due to its argument of perigee), we can use a delta v map to find an intercept with moho takes 1690 m/s from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Then, if we assume that Moho and Dres are on the same plane (which they are not) and that you will hit Dres\u0027 trajectory at periapsis (you probably won\u0027t), we can use vis viva to find that that takes 1806 m/s in an absolutely perfect world. Using the same assumptions as last time, we find that an Oberth to Eeloo takes 1444 m/s.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is needless to say that this arrangement is impossible due to the way the planets are laid out in the game.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdding the numbers gives 4940m/s. Even though that may sound relatively small, basically ALL of these planets are on different planes, so much say that it is easily safe to say that you may need a 80% margin for orbital maneuvers, boosting it up to 8500m/s. Another cost you will have to pay dearly for is time. You are going to waste so much time, both real time and game time to go to a few different planets, that it is LITERALLY easier to build a completely new rocket.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe d/v may sound like chicken scraps; afterall, that is how much is needed for a duna mission.

If you do it when Mun is pointing towards the sun, you will lose orbital speed compared to the sun, and will save fuel for visiting the inner planets.

And if you want to come out from your gravity assist lined up with a planet so you can get a gravity assist from it and reach exactly another planet... well, that\u0027s why we have rocket scientists. even with some course correction manuevers, it still requires the planets to be roughly in certain positions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut performing a basic gravity assist is very simple indeed. try it for a \u0022i am a rocket scientist\u0022 feel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
