The chute got ripped off on Eve, and I had no lander stage to land on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is that I give myself a head start by storing a lot of energy in my parking orbit. My launcher can easily put a 3 man pod \u002B big tank \u002B nuclear engine on a 10 000 km parking orbit, I can then slingshot on mun and minmus up to an orbit just on the limit of escaping Kermin. (With such a wide orbit, the period is so long that you have to plan your launch to be at the ejection angle in time before the phase angle is off). The launcher can also put my lander on a 5 000 km parking orbit. (even a retrograde one) Also, even the last stage of the launcher stays on an sub-orbital trajectory, which means all debris are supposed to fall back down on Kerbin. (But it doesn\u0027t happen because apparently the debris don\u0027t get atmospheric drag unless you\u0027re looking at them... and by some bizarre glitch there is now a belt of debris going in retrograde orbit around the sun, between Kerbin and Eve...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KevinTMC","CreatedById":28909,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T22:20:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow to get a 3 maned pod to another planet?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, figure out how to get three lions into the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grizzlol","CreatedById":40170,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T23:00:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell you kind of answered your own question. The whole thing needs to be bigger and more powerful. There is no way around that so you will just have to keep experimenting and improving designs to make them more effective and keep reading the forums about techniques that can save fuel, there is quite a lot of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
