There\u0027ll be a blue button with a radar dish on it. Hit that and you\u0027re tracking that roid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: If you track every roid, the space around Kerbin\u0027s orbit will become choked with their tracks so if you don\u0027t want to mess with a roid once you\u0027ve tracked it, select it again and hit the X button to stop tracking it. Its track will go away and eventually the untracked roid will despawn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphox","CreatedById":32691,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T04:31:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYay you figured it out!
