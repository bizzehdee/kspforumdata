Both of them generally move about 45 degrees in the time it takes to intercept them (so if you are looking at the north pole of Kerbin in map view, you want them between one and 2 o\u0027clock if you are planning to start your burn at 6 o\u0027clock. Minmus is easiest to get to if you intercept at the ascending/descending node, so zoom out on map view, past its orbit, with the camera on the equatorial plane, and you will see where the orbits cross (pan round until you see both orbits as two intersecting lines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must have been playing for about a month before I learnt how to use manoeuvre nodes. I hadn\u0027t anticipated how useful they would be and so didn\u0027t bother using them. You can only imagine the horror one feels when they are trying to cowboy a transfer to Duna and don\u0027t get the intercept (\u0022obviously\u0022 I wasn\u0027t setting objects as targets either, so I had no idea how far away I was).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shiva","CreatedById":42474,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T23:18:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs is mentioned here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103034\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103034\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou actually need to upgrade the Mission Control center to lv2 to be able to use maneuver nodes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, no wonder I did not get the maneuver node, I thought patched conics were the same thing and spent all my funds on the tracking station, haha.
