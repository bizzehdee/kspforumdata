I would guess it is because the base of the tower goes into the floor farther than it needs to. I ended up cheating it by putting my craft through the floor as well and it let me launch but this is something the devs ought to address. No reason to penalize somebody for stabilizing before launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T21:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI exploit the hell out of that.
