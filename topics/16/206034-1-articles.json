on purpose.\u00A0 There was a bug in 1.8.0, for example, where lots of parts lost most of their drag, so different parts would overheat than before; they repaired that in

but not the alarm clock, so I guess those images are from version 1.11.\u00A0 For me, in stock KSP, the heat shield barely survives a 7km/s re-entry of the 3-kerbal pod.\u00A0 I don\u0027t use ablator because it doesn\u0027t help much; the T\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E radiative cooling of a 3300K heatshield (hotter than incandescent light bulbs) is enough to cool it.\u00A0 \u003Cu\u003EIf you

heating, and in KSP if part of the skin overheats the whole part gets the warning thermometer and is destroyed.\u00A0 The skin of the pod has a 2400K temperature

you\u00A0to\u00A0 the cause.\u00A0 The shield might be offset up so that the pod peeks through (KSP gives you some margin here).\u00A0 Maybe you attached it inverted, and then rotated it, fooling simple KSP into thinking the pod is connected to the ablator side.\u00A0 Maybe your later trajectory spends much longer in the upper atmosphere than I was able to
