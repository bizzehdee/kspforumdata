I had part of the ship on the runway testing converters. I went full 4x time warp to see if it would speed it up wth the engines on. Longish story short, the bottom is not stable at 4x without it on the missing part of the ship(for testing purposes/parts count issue) and it pushed down on itself and stuff started exploding. Next thing I knew I saw the center of the vehicle still alive and though I would watch it explode for fun after the more superficial stuff stopped blowing up. Then I see it moving upwards...... It kept moving upwards and is still moving upwards. I\u0027m waiting to get a max height on it actually. But the weird thing is when I go into the solar system map mode it says I\u0027m landed.... I had a previous explosion up at around 60k(purposely created) that made my ship parts fly out of the kerbin influence and made me wonder this same thing. Is it possible I just moved the planet a microfraction? The other ship obviously wasn\u0027t landed as it had taken off. But this one exploded on the runway. So what could this be? A glitch(known or unknown), a feature, or a new launch method waiting to be abused to it\u0027s fullest!?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, It\u0027s 2600\u002Btons of stuff flying upwards from an explosion. So no small feat. And currently at 3km altitude and rising. With a slowly falling 2.8m/s. This started with only 3.8m/s. So, it\u0027s not far off the original velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding pics here once my pic loader is working properly:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Screenshot%20from%202015-12-14%2023-43-5\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/Screenshot%20from%202015-12-14%2023-43-51_zpsaxfngsm0.png~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Screenshot%20from%202015-12-14%2023-44-0\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/Screenshot%20from%202015-12-14%2023-44-00_zpsoufzrpwg.png~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-17T04:34:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2015 04:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T05:29:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYoutube video is automatically embedded if you press enter after putting in the link.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for what happened, looks like you got krakened by the high part count and some invisible force happened.
