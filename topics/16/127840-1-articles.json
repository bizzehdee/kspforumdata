Ascent engine = high TWR, good atmospheric Isp. Interplanetary transfer engine = low TWR, high vacuum Isp. So I just design my mission so that the interplanetary transfer stage has just enough dV to get to the destination, and discard it as soon as I hit atmosphere. (Or I skip the mass of a decoupler and just let it burn off.) Then I let the heatshield slow me down to a safe speed, and then decouple it before landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I have a somewhat awkward lander (e.g. with radial bits sticking out that are at risk of getting burned off), I may use a heatshield one size up (e.g. a 3.75m shield on a 2.5m stack) for a little extra \u0022buffer zone\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-14T15:28:33Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2015 03:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T15:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve recently tried aerobraking on Laythe and Jool, and decided that gravity assist was the better choice.
