It\u0027s the modeling of all the independent parts. Thus you would still have this problem even without the explosions.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Tiddles","CreatedById":124560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T23:41:27Z","Content":"CALL THE KERBAL SPACE MARINES, WE HAVE A HERETIC!\n\nNah, but I think you may need to change settings, or if you have a desktop CPU, maybe find some parts to make it better:)"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T01:48:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E CALL THE KERBAL SPACE MARINES, WE HAVE A HERETIC!\n\nKerbal inquisitors maybe? But they\u0027d be heretics themselves if they devoted so much effort towards \\*not\\* producing their own explosions. o.0\n\nSeriously though, the explosions\u0027 only significant effect on FPS/stability should be the particle effects produced when they happen. I\u0027m guessing if you turn down some graphics settings that problem should be reduced."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T07:25:22Z","Content":"Thanks for the suggestions. Its not my PC though. Its a top-spec gaming PC. Everything else about KSP runs fine, even at max detail. \n\nIts just that I have noticed that if a craft that I\u0027m prototyping has a tendency to explode then after four or five returns to the VAB/SPH the game might crash. If I\u0027m doing the same with a craft that I\u0027m just tweaking and it stays in one piece then I don\u0027t get the problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T20:26:09Z","Content":"Sure you can turn off explosions.
