Anywhere you see bold green lines in the alt map, this means a sharp variation in terrain slopes at that location. However, even the best ScanSat maps don\u0027t have a whole lot of resolution even when you zoom in further on these maps, so the best recommendation is still aim for a \u0027dark\u0027 area on the alt map, and carry enough fuel to seek for an optimal landing site. Other than that, the only good way (in my experience) is to have a small prospector probe that you can swing down into an ultra-low-altitude flight over the desired area, and design your lander to be as stable as possible on an uneven slope -- because you\u0027re pretty much guaranteed to be landing on at least a few degrees of slope anywhere but Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gilph","CreatedById":150861,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-12T16:49:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have discussed this briefly with DMagic on the scansat forums. The short answer is there is no easy way. I played with the colors and cutoff limit in the slope map and picked some target candidates and then zoomed in over 100x\u00A0 and move my mouse pointer over sections to see the slope. It can be very tedious. I\u0027ve recently used Game Mode in recording in Win10 to record my mouse movements over promising sites and watch them at .2x speed to see if there was a small value that I missed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-18T14:15:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best I was ever able to do was find areas that held\u00A0ore according to the scan and also\u00A0looked like they were\u00A0relatively flat according to some height map I found online.\u00A0\u00A0I\u00A0then launched a series of unmanned rovers to drive around looking for area with very little slope and relatively high levels of ore.
