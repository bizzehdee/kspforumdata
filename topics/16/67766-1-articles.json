Is it possible to get science from asteroids? I thought this would be the next big thing, however after grabbing hold of an asteroid I can\u0027t think of any way to do science on/with it. Does it have to be in Kerbin orbit? I am puzzled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T00:39:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEVA your pilot. You can then collect a report from the asteroid, just like you can transfer reports between your science modules and your command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Othuyeg","CreatedById":105454,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T00:57:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, I shall try that immediately. Very kind of you to instruct me. I did EVA my kerbal onto it once, but I couldn\u0027t get an option for studying it. I will retry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Othuyeg","CreatedById":105454,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T01:07:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt worked this time. Thank you.

I\u0027ve just arrived at my first asteroid with this huge science lab with all kinda of science instruments..... and all I can get is a surface sample!!! No Gravity Reading... No Seismic reading... No Mystery Goo... No Materials bay... No temperature... No Crew Report...?!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seriously think this would be valuable science. Oh well, I guess I\u0027ll have to change my playing strategy over to goofing off instead of visiting lots of asteroids in the name of science: Next time I\u0027m not bringing the lab, the primary objective will be to target the VAB with the asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
