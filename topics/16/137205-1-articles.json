I too find some parts of the system confusing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally only started with strategies once I maxed out the science tree, so that I could get maximum cash for science points. And now I\u0027m tying to get maximum reputation for science and money, since I have oodles of cash in my career save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said, I dabbled with Leadership Initiative but I regretted it - it was too late in career to start, my rep was probably too high to make it worthwhile, and it was messing up the returns on contracts badly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I would say - tread warily : D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou seem to have as good a grasp of the ins and outs of it as anyone, now, so you might be right avoid strategies until you raise your rep more. I\u0027d suggest concentrating on science: do a couple of science-gathering trips, unlock science experiments in the tech tree, spend some of that 500k funds on more science trips to use those new experiments and complete Minmus biomes (for example). That may be a good time to just quit the strategies until you start running a surplus of something you don\u0027t need (rather than using them to make up for a \u003Cem\u003Edeficit\u003C/em\u003E of something you do need...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, 500k funds is enough for about 15 manned trips to Minmus. If you\u0027re spending more than about 25k on your rockets before adding science experiments, you\u0027re doing something very inefficiently. However, since you say you\u0027ve designed a 4-person orbiting craft for 20k, I don\u0027t think that over-designing is a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it\u0027s middling for a contract but sometimes it\u0027s worth doing these things just to get a reason to get some practice in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022

It only has one drogue and one Mk16 parachute, so the engine is discarded shortly after re-entering the atmosphere. Remaining fuel is used to burn midway between retrograde and radial out, to reduce speed while maintaining a shallow descent profile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn both cases, that\u0027s a Reliant under the cowling after the Fleas burn out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t tried making a 4-tourist orbiter. It seems to me that the added hastle and danger of re-entry, plus the need to expand the launchpad, makes it far simpler and cheaper to do two orbital trips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-23T10:41:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2016 10:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jpinard","CreatedById":89401,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T13:29:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee I had never even considered\u00A0stacking two 2 tourist tubes on top of each other. \u00A0Not having to go with the fatter heftier components could have saved a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mentioned earlier saving Kerbal in space. \u00A0I\u00A0have been terrified of the rescue Kerbal contracts. \u00A02 years ago when I played I could barely rendezvous in space let alone dock. \u00A0I watched all of Scott Manley\u0027s new video tutorial series and he did a rescue...
