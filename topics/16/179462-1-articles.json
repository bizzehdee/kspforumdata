applies.\u00A0 However, there is one \u0027exception\u0027:\u00A0 if you split the interplanetary transfer burn so that the first burn\u00A0establishes

Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, then you get some of the advantage of the Oberth effect even though you\u0027re starting from low orbit, but this is actually a different technique called \u003Ci\u003Eperiapsis kicking\u003C/i\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll put the details in a spoiler:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022

speeds:\u00A0 this is the basic notion behind the Oberth effect.\u00A0 I\u0027m actually skipping a lot of the underlying mathematical subtlety of the Oberth effect but let\u0027s assume that this is an approximation.\u00A0 The important part is that when we\u0027re discussing orbits, an object in circular orbit at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E has a lower speed than an object in an elliptical orbit passing through a\u00A0periapsis at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E--this may seem counter-intuitive, but remember that you need a \u003Cem\u003Ebraking\u003C/em\u003E burn to circularise at low orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time, a lot of interplanetary rockets use low-thrust vacuum stages, which means long interplanetary ejection burns.\u00A0 When completing such burns, naturally the final speed is high--it has to reach escape velocity, after all--but after you pass the periapsis, you\u0027re climbing out of the gravity well, which means losing speed.\u00A0 With a low-thrust\u00A0transfer stage, the last seconds of that burn are usually so far from periapsis that the Oberth effect savings are minimal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it is precisely the last seconds of the burn that finally kick the apoapsis out of the sphere of influence and to an interplanetary destination:\u00A0 everything before that only sends your rocket to a progressively higher elliptical orbit, which means that if you stop your burn early, you\u0027ll come back to the same periapsis.\u00A0 You can use this fact, you can split your burn over multiple passes,\u00A0have each one centred on the most effective portion of the orbit at and very near to the periapsis, and the only cost is the time spent going round those high elliptical orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe important bit is that\u00A0you start at low circular orbit, but you limit the burn time at periapsis to about a minute (perhaps up to two minutes, if you have especially weak engines and don\u0027t want to leave completing the manoeuvre to your grandchildren)\u00A0because anything not at the periapsis\u00A0wastes the Oberth effect.\u00A0 Then, on the next pass, you burn for a minute centred on the periapsis again, and again after that.\u00A0\u00A0Each of these burns at the periapsis \u0027kicks\u0027 the apoapsis higher and higher\u00A0until you raise it to nearly the boundary of the sphere of influence.\u00A0 The next and final burn is the one that sets up the final interplanetary transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlanning for this kind of departure is not difficult:\u00A0 set up the interplanetary manoeuvre as you normally would, but set it up well in advance:\u00A0 two \u0027minths\u0027 of lead time should be your minimum time and you may need more.\u00A0 The node will be in the same place as your eventual periapsis (that should make sense), but remember that each kick will change the orbit and thus also change the positioning of the final burn node, but we can use that for timing later.\u00A0\u00A0The second-to-last burn will be less than a minute because this is what we will call the \u0027timing burn\u0027:\u00A0 burn so that your orbit brings\u00A0the node and the periapsis together.\u00A0 In other words, you want the time-to-periapsis and the time-to-node values to match.\u00A0 This may leave your apoapsis a little short of Minmus\u0027s orbit, or you may get the timing slightly off, but that\u0027s okay:\u00A0\u00A0transfer windows to other planets are within acceptable tolerances\u00A0for a week or more, so don\u0027t fixate\u00A0on the \u0027perfect\u0027 transfer.\u00A0 You can use MechJeb\u0027s node editor to figure a lot of this part, but it isn\u0027t necessary.\u00A0 There\u00A0\u003Ca

Therefore, starting at the Mun for those destinations is no benefit, other than the obvious benefit of having full tanks before you leave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, for Duna you need to burn for about 1100 m/s from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, but only under 700 m/s from a 12,000 km circular orbit. Of course, from Mun orbit you need to escape the Mun\u0027s gravity, which will increase that figure a bit, but you also benefit from the Mun\u0027s contribution to the Oberth effect.

But I can say that minmus low gravity and inclination may train your skills and thanks to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E refueling possibility, I\u0027m less stressed with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E efficiency and more open to exploration. I\u0027m sure I will end up checking the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and maneuver efficiency in the end, but meanwhile I\u0027m getting lots of fun this way. I can say that at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis thread is very interesting. Regards!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
