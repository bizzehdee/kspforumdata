For context: I\u0027m playing on pretty hard settings, and I only have a ground comm station at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E itself, not anywhere else on the planet. This pretty much means that I need a comm network local to Kerbin itself. I\u0027m at the point in the tech tree where I only have the 5M relay antennas. For various reasons it would be really nice to be able to launch and control probes around Kerbin (and due to settings I don\u0027t have probe control unless I have a comm-link). In case it\u0027s relevant I\u0027m using the Kerbal Engineer plugin (automatic suicide burn and \u0394v calculations FTW!) and the latest KSP available for download.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy plan was a three-relay-sat constellation at 2.15Mm altitude (so a 2.75Mm orbital radius). Since the three comsats will form a equilateral triangle, that means by the law of sines the side length between any two comsats will be 2.75Mm * sin(3\u03C0/2) / sin(\u03C0/6) = 4.76Mm. This was based on the understanding that since the 5M relay antennas have a comm rating of 5M, that means the maximum distance two relays can talk with each other is \u221A(5e6 * 5e6) = 5Mm. Since 4.76Mm \u0026lt; 5Mm, they should be in (low-signal-strength) contact with each other. However, I\u0027ve placed two of the three relay sats (launching 2 at a time, for redundancy) and despite being almost exactly 4.76Mm apart from each other, there\u0027s no comm link. They can both talk with the ground station just fine, but not with each other --- the \u0022network\u0022 and \u0022vessel link\u0022 views don\u0027t show a link, nor can I control the one with an occluded link to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat am I misunderstanding?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- ethereal\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-22T19:47:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHard mode reduces antenna ranges by a percentage.
