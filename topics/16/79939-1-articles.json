Just wasn\u0027t terribly interested them relative to other things I was doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause a C-class rock came into the Kerbin system with a nice periapsis, I figured I\u0027d take a break from playing with bases and catch it. Everything goes fine and and I end up with a less-than-pretty orbit, but the orbit is low enough to keep out of the Mun\u0027s SoI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few days later I send a second ARM probe with more fuel and better engines with the intention of transferring a little fuel to the first probe, deorbiting it, then tweaking the asteroid\u0027s orbit with the second, better probe. Everything goes fine again. Except that after transferring a little fuel and monoprop to the first probe, I go to release it from the rock and my screen falls a few hundred meters behind the asteroid, focused on seemingly empty space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first probe *did* detach, drifting a couple meters from the asteroid, but I can\u0027t switch to it either via keys or the map view. The *name* of the original probe is in the map view, but when I switch focus to it, I end up looking at the empty spot trailing the asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can detach the second probe from the asteroid perfectly fine. Of course this means that I could just transfer most of the fuel to the first probe and do my orbital tweaking that way, but that doesn\u0027t fix my detachment problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me like for whatever reason, the game isn\u0027t handling the separating of the asteroid and the original probe properly and it\u0027s behaving as though there was some lag in the process and the craft ended up trailing the asteroid. So it thinks the CoM of the probe is in empty space when it\u0027s actually right beside the asteroid. This leaves me with \u0027three\u0027 crafts: the asteroid, attached to the second probe; the original probe, detached beside the asteroid and upon which I cannot focus; and then a phantom craft trailing the other two, where the game *thinks* the original probe ought to be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, my question is essentially whether this sort of buggy behavior is still to be expected with the claw, or if perhaps there\u0027s something I\u0027ve done to trigger the problem. I\u0027ve got ways of working around the issue and honestly I\u0027ll just terminate all the flights and delete the asteroid from my save file if it\u0027s going to be a serious problem, but I\u0027m curious.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-29T05:46:52Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2014 05:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Boomerang\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T05:05:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way the problem appears to be behaving doesn\u0027t appear to have an origin with the Klaw, but a simple random chance bug. My suggestion would be to backup the save file, then use your second probe to go and take back the fuel from the first probe, reattach to the asteroid, and then terminate the first probe from the Tracking Station. If you can still switch to a \u0022phantom craft\u0022, we can work from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you using any mods? If so, what are they?

And embarrassingly enough, after going back to check on what you inquired about (the fourth time I\u0027ve reloaded this save to check on the problem) I was able to detach the problematic probe fairly normally. The staging icons still showed the two engine from the second probe that it was no longer attached to, but otherwise I was able to control and deorbit it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll chalk it up to a random bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T08:51:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, that\u0027s happened before on seperation of accents from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly you\u0027re looking at a spot 200 meters below the rocket\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
