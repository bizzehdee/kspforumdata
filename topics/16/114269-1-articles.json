Even the large one, although there is plenty room, they can\u0027t seem to be able to get inside. If you have a seat inside, you can right click and \u0022board\u0022 it, and he will sit there, but this makes the service bay behave weird, start wobbling, sometimes blowing up. And even stranger if you then make him EVA, he will pop out from the top pod, I guess because that\u0027s the only accessible hatch."}]}
