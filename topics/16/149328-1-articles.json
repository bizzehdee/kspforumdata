Playing a \u003Cu\u003Escience game\u003C/u\u003E, I do not yet have the Tech Tree unlocked for the Mk1-2 pod, so I\u0027m using 2 Mk1 cans stacked on top of each other. The top-most Mk1 can has twin Comm 16-S antennas. There is an MPL-LG-2 lab incorporated into the ship. Both Kerbals sent on the mission are scientists. Orbiting Mun along with this \u0027science station\u0027 are 3 Comm relay ships with twin HG-5 antennas (500km orbit)... so comm path isn\u0027t an issue. Power isn\u0027t an issue either, as adequate battery and solar are present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe odd behavior I\u0027m seeing is when I put both scientists into the lab; I lose Comm link. If I put one of the crew back into the lander can with the antennas, Comm link is restored. IMO, this shouldn\u0027t be. I\u0027m wondering now, what if the antenna were on the lab itself? (something I\u0027ll have to try)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else noticed antenna behavior like this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
