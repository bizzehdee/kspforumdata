I think shifting focus is going to be what I need, I didn\u0027t know the keyboard shortcuts. My focus is on my ship, always, and I\u0027m trying to chart an orbit out to Minimus and I tend to angle my view so I can see my ship and Minimus at the same time. Does that make sense? So Minimus is just a little tiny few pixels out there, and I can\u0027t distinguish the peri marker from the apo marker, that sorta thing. By being able to easily change focus between ship and Minimus, that should resolve this issue for me (I hope!). But then the adjustment marker icons will be way back at the other end of the focus near my ship, so... let me try it out and see.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-07T17:45:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2014 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by asb3pe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
