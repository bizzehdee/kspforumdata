Many guys assemble stuff and put heavy engines at it and make it work without disassembling itself. That\u0027s probably the best thing you can do to learn yourself and get some design inspiration. Sometimes it\u0027s just better to see things then people trying to explain things to you. Maybe I\u0027ll link such a playthrough if I find a proper channel.
