So, what you want basically is an orbit around Kerbin that has the same period as Kerbin\u0027s orbit around the sun. (This way, your ship makes one orbit around for each orbit or kerbin around the sun, thus keeping all three in the same relative position). I just tried solving the orbital period equation for that period, and assuming that a) the data in the ksp wiki for the mass of Kerbol and Kerbin and Kerbin\u0027s orbital period is all correct, and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E the gravitational constant is the same in game as it is in the real world, and c) I did all my math correctly, then you would need a circular orbit at about 4,342,000,000 m around Kerbin, which is well outside of its sphere of influence. So, the best approximation you can hope for is what others here have suggested: take them into a Kerbol-centric orbit that matches Kerbin\u0027s orbit, just ahead of and behind it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T02:23:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed. Not going to happen in a patched-conics system, I\u0027m afraid. As noted the best option would be to go into the Sun\u0027s SoI, and set-up an orbit that\u0027s the same as Kerbin\u0027s, ahead and behind it. The only way to put the satellites anywhere else would be to put it on the Kerbol-Kerbin L1, which won\u0027t happen because it\u0027s not modeled, and would require n-body math to do. In short, not gonna happen (as cool as that would be; there are very good development reasons to not add Lagrange points, as Harv explained...somewhere).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"djnekkid","CreatedById":36328,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T05:22:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes...
