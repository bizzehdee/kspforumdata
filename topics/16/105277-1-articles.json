I can see radius, height and weight mattering but why the number of parts? Could you launch a mun rocket from the barn launchpad? No probably not. But a small rocket with 50 parts is still a small rocket. I have overbuilt rockets where I have had to take lights and science parts like thermometers and antennae off because I exceeded the part amount. I mean, really? That one light is going to over-strain the launch pad? When I can take two lights off and add another full fuel tank?\n\nMy suggestion would be to have certain parts not count towards the part count. Small things like batteries, lights, solar panels, small science parts (like goo or thermometers), antennas .etc. I think total weight should matter a lot more than something as arbitrary as \u0022part count\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T07:16:39Z","Content":"Yeah, the barn didn\u0027t make it into the 1.0 release. However, I agree with the need for more tier upgrades (or even intermediate ones that don\u0027t change the models) to increment the steps a bit more. I find that I need to upgrade the launch pad almost immediately, then the VAB not long after. Then it\u0027s quite a long time before either one receives another upgrade.\n\nJust my two funds.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
