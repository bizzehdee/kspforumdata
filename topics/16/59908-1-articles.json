Burning at the closest approach, the periapsis, is most efficient. It doesn\u0027t make a big difference if the periapsis is high, but you can lower it by burning 90 degrees from your flight path in the direction of the planet. And yeah, don\u0027t warp so fast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Many of the planets have SOIs so large that the planet is just a distant speck.

While burning at periapsis is best, Duna has an atmosphere. This means that the most efficient way to slow down is to aerobrake - lower your periapsis into Duna\u0027s atmosphere to something like 15km-17km (but don\u0027t use parachutes) while still far away from Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. See what Vanamonde wrote.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You have enough time to burn that you should definitely use the LV-N; it is more than twice as efficient as the next best engines.

Aerobraking is efficient but it\u0027s very risky and will probably take a few quicksaves to get a satisfactory result (for realists like me it would also result in unsurvivable G-forces and temperatures almost certainly causing your Kerbanauts to turn into char-grilled green smoosh on the dashboard of your Command Module). The truth is, your approach to Duna (or any planetary body) is much more complicated than just hitting the sphere of influence (SOI) and making a burn to slow down. Let me try to give you an idea what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen docking two spacecrafts in orbit of Kerbin, you probably already know that you need to create an intercept - a point where you pass close to your target. That\u0027s basically what hitting the SOI of another planet is - an intercept. Obviously there is more to docking than just passing close your target. You probably realise that when you get close to the target, matching your speeds is very important, because otherwise you\u0027ll smash right into it or drift right past and never achieve a dock. To match speeds, you thrust with your engines or RCS to slow down relative to your target (which might mean actually speeding up in your orbit). Based on your question, you\u0027ve also realised all this is also true of intercepting another planet - you make an intercept, passing close to the target, and then slow down so you travel with it instead of leaving it behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference here is your orbit is almost certainly not going to be anything like Duna\u0027s. You will be climbing steeply away from Kerbol (and Kerbin\u0027s lower orbit) to extend your Apoapsis out to Duna\u0027s orbit, and timing this so that Duna will be there when you climb high enough. When you get to Duna\u0027s orbit, your orbital speed will be way, way lower than Duna\u0027s because you\u0027re coming from below Duna\u0027s orbit and are close to your apoapsis, the point of your orbit where your speed is lowest. To look at it another way, when your ship shoots through Duna\u0027s SOI, it\u0027s actually Duna that shoots past you at a much higher speed than yours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ebefore you reach Duna\u0027s SOI\u003C/span\u003E get your speed up to as close to Duna\u0027s as possible without throwing out your intercept. That means burning prograde (green vector on navball) to speed up, and radial-in (towards the brown half of the navball) to keep your apoapsis at the same altitude above Kerbol (of course if you were heading to Eve, or \u003Cstrong\u003Ecoming back to Kerbin from Duna\u003C/strong\u003E, you\u0027d need to do the \u003Cstrong\u003Eopposite\u003C/strong\u003E to match speed with the lower orbit planet - burn radial-out and retrograde). This obviously uses fuel, but this is fuel that you would have to burn anyway if you timed your burn to your Duna periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour speed is about right when Duna\u0027s gravity causes a 45 degree change in your trajectory (based on your planned orbit periapsis - for Duna I suggest 80,000-100,000m). Alternatively, when you get near Duna\u0027s orbital altitude compare your orbital speed with Duna\u0027s - aim to be within about 2500m/s of Duna\u0027s speed as you enter Duna\u0027s SOI (you can get Duna\u0027s speed in map-mode while still in Kerbol orbit, or on the wiki). If you can manage either of these, you should have no trouble adjusting your Duna periapsis to make a retrograde burn into a nice low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease PM me if any of this is unclear!
