easier to \u003Cstrong\u003Efly the stranded pilot across the 40 km on EVA\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal EVA packs are ridiculously overpowered-- they have like 600 m/s of

craft as his \u0022target\u0022 (so you can see it on the navball), and then just take off by thrusting forward and upward until you\u0027ve got a forward speed of, say, 100 m/s and a good strong vertical boost, then you can just cruise to the target pretty easily (thrusting upwards as needed to keep you \u0022airborne\u0022, and then braking when you get to the destination.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTakes zero fuel, is pretty easy to get there.\u00A0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

mind the approximate bearing that you figured out in step 1, note which direction that is.\u00A0 If you draw a line from the zenith (straight up) direction to that bearing, which way is it pointing on your screen on the navball?\u00A0 Up, down, left, right?\u00A0 This is the \u003Cstrong\u003Edirection you\u0027ll need to rotate after

you\u0027ll be pretty close, and even if you\u0027re a few hundred meters away (or even a kilometer), you\u0027re still way closer than you were, and it should be really easy to EVA-fly the stranded
