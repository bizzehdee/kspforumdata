MechJeb can additionally show you your landing point on the surface based on your current trajectory. This might help you land near a target more reliably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-12T07:08:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also click on the your velocitybox, so you can change between surface, orbital and target. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
