Some of my rockets have an annoying bug. When I decouple a stage, camera focus is on debris, but that\u0027s not a problem until I switch the stage and my ship does not work properly. In tracking station it is a new ship and when I 0ress \u0022space\u0022 to turn Engines on, they decouple.

The part you place first in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E is the \u0022root\u0022 of the ship, and as you decouple various stages the active ship stays with the designated root. You can use the Re-Root tool in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to change the root part; in most cases you\u0027ll want the root to be the Pod part on the upper-most stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) KSP will mark a craft as \u0022Debris\u0022 if it does not have a Pod on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, if you decouple and the camera stays with the section marked \u0022Debris\u0022, it is because a) the designated root part was on that half of the craft, and b) that half of the craft has no Pod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
