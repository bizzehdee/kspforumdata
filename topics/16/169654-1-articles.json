It says that to achieve low kerbin orbit you would need 3400 in delta v. So I tried to calculate that by hand, here\u0027s how: the increase in potential energy equals mgh (I\u0027m assuming constant g, in fact it would be even lower). The increase in kinetic energy is 0.5*mv^2. Assuming we are trying to achieve low orbit at 75km, the total delta v (calculated by sqrt(2*E/m)) would be about 2850m/s, and I didn\u0027t even use the rotation of kerbin itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn reality I was able to send rockets in low orbit with slightly less\u00A0than 3400, but still way more than 2850. Granted that I didn\u0027t consider aerodynamic forces but how much could that be? So what am I missing? (And if it is air resistance, I\u0027d appreciate if you could provide some calculation on that)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-16T16:56:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have to include the gravity losses for the time it takes to reach a significant fraction of orbital velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-16T17:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nxlm,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s the atmosphere that makes it impossible to calculate precisely. For an airless body the process is much more straightforward: Calculate Vorb at sea level, add the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to transfer to desired orbital altitude, and subtract the planet\u0027s rotational velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor an airless Kerbin, sea level Vorb is 2,426 m/sec.
