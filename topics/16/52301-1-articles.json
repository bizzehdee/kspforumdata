Most folks start off with a design like that - a Mk16 Chute, a Mk1 Pod, an FL-T400, an LV-909, three or four lander legs and a ladder (with panels and batts later as they started to be required). With that design, your \u0022bingo fuel\u0022 level is 80 Liquid Fuel Units remaining; once you\u0027re there, hit space or plan on not returning from the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t start a steady burn until you\u0027re around 5,000 meters.

Go with 125% of the values listed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd plan your mission backwards. Let\u0027s say you want to do a Duna landing. So you need to design a lander that can go down and come back up again, minimum. Will it need also need to transfer back to Kerbin, or are you going to include a dedicated tug that does the transfer that the lander will dock to? You pick out the pieces of what you\u0027re going to need for the craft - command part, chutes for return, panels/batteries or RTGs, lights, lander legs, decouplers, engines, RCS and docking ports if you\u0027re going to dock it to the transfer stage - add sum up the mass of all that, \u003Cem\u003Eeverything but the fuel tanks\u003C/em\u003E. You\u0027ve got a delta-V target for your craft, and you\u0027ve got a \u0022deadmass\u0022 of all the necessary equipment. You then work Tsiolkovsky \u003Cstrong\u003Ebackwards\u003C/strong\u003E, adding that dead mass to both mass terms in the equation. You can make the assumption that M=9Md, because the way all but two of the liquid fuel tanks in KSP are designed (the exceptions being the Oscar B and the Round 8), the full-to-dry ratio is 9:1. Solve the equation for dry mass, then use that same relationship (M=9Md) to determine how much fuel you need to include for the delta-V you want that part of the mission to have. And then you pick out a combination of tanks that gives you roughly that amount. Just keep on doing that for each stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf and if that sounds like too much mass, wing it; many KSP players just do it and pray for the best.
