During the design process of this rover I discovered something weird:\n\n**A tiny rover weighs more than a big rover with more parts.** Almost twice as much on top of that.\n\nI don\u0027t know if this is something weird with KSP or if I\u0027m missing something trivial, but I\u0027m attaching images and .craft files if anyone\u0027s interested.\n\nSo as you can see, this rover\n\n![SKAGdPc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SKAGdPc.jpg)\n\nweighs almost five tons, much more than this one\n\n![W6kjQaZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/W6kjQaZ.jpg)\n\nwhich only weights slightly under three tons.\n\n[Big rover craft file](http://www./download/4h6vlsoe3cpilas/Duna_Transport_Rover.craft)\n\n[Tiny rover craft file](http://www./download/7tigx5adr6p1gzn/Duna_Transport_Rover_Mini_MkII.craft)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T13:24:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 01:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vincekerbonaut**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T13:08:18Z","Content":"The small rover is using heavy struts (strutConnectorHeavy) from a mod instead of the standard ones.

Oddly enough, the heavy struts weights were listed as N/A. But it sure solved my problem! Thank you very much for the quick reply!"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T13:19:26Z","Content":"You may want to list which mods you use if you want anyone to help.\n\nThe small Rover uses a part StrutConnectorHeavy. if that is the heavy strut from KW Rocketry then they weigh 1t each. replace those with normal struts\n\nNinjad\n\nAlot of the smaller parts do have odd mass though. Those wheels now weigh the same as the mini ones for example"}]}
