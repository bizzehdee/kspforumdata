Generally below 50,000m you want to stay above 1.5, higher than that you can go lower but the higher you can keep it without compromising your craft the better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have mechjeb or kerbal engineer installed to keep track of your dV and TWR?

I believe if you add an extra half tank to each of the 5 orange tanks and configure it for asparagus staging it will get you into orbit a little bit easier.

Just started the the game a few days ago. don\u0027t have any mods installed on the base game right now either. Still from what i can gather i might need to add an extra stage to get it higher before decoupling the cube. Right now i decouple the launch stage at about 15km which i though was quite high. but we an go higher i figure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
