But in normal situations these sorts of things can almost always be solved with struts. I can only assume that because you have boosted the thrust to 100X normal, you have exceeded the struts ability to helpful. Have you tried separating parts with Cubic Octagonal Struts, and then added strut connectors? Heck, maybe try adding a 650 I-Beam in there, those are ridiculously sturdy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T15:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELOL, you just made ion engines OP.

It has incredibly high ISP but very low thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I misunderstood your OP since you didn\u0027t say you were editing the .cfg file to increase thrust. I thought you were just throttling up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re increasing thrust, then sure, it has a higher chance to break off whatever you\u0027re attaching it to. Especially since standard xenon tanks are meant to work with standard ion engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you don\u0027t want to provide a picture of your craft, I tried exactly what you said. I went to the .cfg file and raised the thrust to 50. I restarted KSP and added a xenon tank, engine, and 4 struts. I used an OTK probe core and 8k battery since you didn\u0027t specify. I throttled up to 100% and it didn\u0027t break. I tried it without struts, and with more struts. Still no breakage. So without a picture of your craft, I\u0027m not really sure how else to help you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIF it\u0027s the xenon tank that\u0027s breaking, you can try editing the breakingForce \u0026amp; breakingTorque values in the xenon tank .cfg, but it could be something else that\u0027s breaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
