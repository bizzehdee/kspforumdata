Especially since the one big flaw of this game is the lack of explanations about controls. So, let\u0027s start\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) I am currently trying to recover a stone from Mun. After realizing that just collecting a sample won\u0027t do, I discovered by looking on the internet that there are stones scattered on the terrain, and you should be able to pick them up with your astronauts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have found one such stone. I have my astronaut on top of it. But I cannot figure out how I am supposed to pick up the stone. Is this something that I can only do with a rover and appropriate robotic parts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) i would like to make a rover. I know I want a big flat surface on top of which I can attach parts. Too bad I can\u0027t find any such part among everything I unlocked (which includes all technologies with a cost less than 90). I tried to look up tutorials on the internet, but they all either give basic tips that I already know [yes, I know I want to keep my rover low and flat to keep a stable baricenter, I would be happy to oblige \u003Cem\u003Eif only I could find appropriate parts\u003C/em\u003E] or they start with pieces that I can\u0027t seem to find. I even tried to use regular rocket parts and rotate them horizontally, but the wheels won\u0027t align correctly after that. What are some good flat surfaces that I can use as a base for a rover to strap things on top?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) I tried to make a plane. Unfortunately, it won\u0027t keep a radial simmetry if i attach one single piece. specifically, a plane needs one tail rudder (is this the proper term? anyway, the sort of fin that goes upwards from the back of the fuselage) that\u0027s perpendicular to the fuselage. but i can\u0027t place one. the game insists in placing it leaning on one side or the other. I tried to fix it by rotating it manually, but clearly I can\u0027t get enough accuracy there, as the plane keeps capsizing. Same problem with the front wheel, or any other part that must be aligned carefully. How do I fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) orbital rendez-vous. getting close enough is simple, if time-consuming. rescuing a stranded astronaut is a long, difficult process. I would like to make space stations, or to leave part of the ship in orbit to make landing more efficient. But then I\u0027d need to make an orbital rendez-vous with the various parts, every single time, and the idea is putting me off. Is there a simpler way to do it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks to everyone who will contribute.

The game doesn\u0027t compute the physics of craft outside the physics range, so it doesn\u0027t know if the part will crash or if it has enough parachutes to land softly or whatever. So to keep things simple anything below the magic altitude is just assumed to be destroyed. In a similar fashion: craft in an orbit that dips into the atmosphere (but not low enough to be deleted) will not have their orbits decay if they are outside physics range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I do regularly is to recover the last stage of my rockets that was on a suborbital trajectory and still high enough when the payload finished circularizing into orbit.
