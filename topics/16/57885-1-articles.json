I just sent a refueling mission to Eeloo and put it into its parking orbit. I kicked its cruise stage off and turned off its probe core, and shut down all other electronics on it. I went to check my resources thingy in the upper right of my screen and I saw it said it was STILL drawing 0.06 current. Is there a way to make it draw 0.00 current with out draining batteries to death? the only thing on this stupid tank that has power left is the probe core, but I turned access to ITS power to OFF so I can have SOME power when my manned mission finally arrives at eeloo. am I crazy and just missed something in my 200 or so hours of playing?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-28T07:34:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2013 07:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by AlamoVampire\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T12:00:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReaction wheels disabled?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe battery will only drain when the ship is active, so you might be ok if you just leave it alone.
