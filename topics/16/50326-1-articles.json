I saw something peculiar when I tested it. The TR-18 stack decoupler worked, as did the MK-16 parachute on multiple tests, but, the TT-38K radials did NOT decouple. They stayed with the rocket. I did not experience the catastrophic explosion you show, but, in my last test, the one in which I photographed for my response, I lost my chute from the G Forces involved. I would recommend using sepratrons to shove the capsule in some direction away from the body of the craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried this for you in many configurations, with sepratrons. However, it is my conclusion, that this setup, while a GOOD lifting setup, has inherent fatal flaws to the capsule. Even with Sepratrons on the capsule, the failure of the abort sequence \u0026lt;on all stock decouplers\u0026gt; to cut the boosters off this particular rocket during abort sequences is ultimately fatal to the occupant. I do not know why this is so, as with OUT them, the capsule comes off just fine, save for the loss of a parachute on my test at least. There IS something inherently fatal in this design when sepratrons are included in the mix, while in flight. An abort FROM the launch pad, however, is completely safe, as you see in one the of the below pictures.
