Due to a design flaw (currently under litigation...) my spaceplane was found to not be rated for water landings; I now have two very neat, Very expensive piles of separated parts floating in two widely separated spots around Kerbin. They do not have probe-cores, and so do not show up in the Tracking Station for recovery. I would estimate these two piles of plane parts to value approximately $250k F. This is enough money to make me begin to consider whether it would be possible and/or economically viable to recover them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone constructed a sailing Salvage craft, and would it recover more Funds than I expended in the attempt?
