That really isn\u0027t too hard. That is a nice thing though, so thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really am looking for a way such that I don\u0027t have to do it by eye and can be much more precise. When you\u0027re on a tight fuel budget or just want things to be more precise that\u0027s nice. And some of us are better at judging angles by eye than others haha. I\u0027m pretty bad at it, as I\u0027m sure some other people are too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I really don\u0027t want an autopilot or calculator to do the work for me necessarily. I like being able to do the work on my own, but measuring the angle is another thing. The best I can do is put a protractor up to the screen, but that\u0027s really annoying and of limited use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I want is something to tell me what angle 2 interplanetary bodies are from each other at any given moment. I suppose that mod does that, so I may use that, but I don\u0027t really want the autopilot or the other information that is calculated per se. All I want is the measurement. I can do calculations from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T15:20:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022glasstabels2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022glasstabels2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I want is something to tell me what angle 2 interplanetary bodies are from each other at any given moment.
