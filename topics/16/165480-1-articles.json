I know all this is absolutely nothing to compare to what some of you guys have done, so I want to ask you guys a question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to build a space ship capable of reaching every planet in the solar system and get a surface sample from each, and all of that good stuff, then return back to Kerbin to collect all the science points from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I\u0027ve realized a few things from that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. I will have to build a rocket in orbit around Kerbin. I simply can\u0027t get that much fuel and cargo up in 1 go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. This mission will take days, possibly weeks(Real life weeks. Decades in game). And I will have to save often. I\u0027m prepared to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. I will need a way to land on every planet and return. For the non atmosphere planet\u0027s I feel like I can do this. For the planets with atmospheres, I\u0027m thinking I will need a space plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. I will need solar panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. This will cost me millions if I do it in career, which I plan to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I want, is tips. \u00A0Do I need something to store surface samples? If I get the surface samples on different landers, can I move them all back to a space plane to land on kerbin again for recovery? General tips for things so that I don\u0027t realize I\u0027ve forgotten something very important during the building stage?

I plan to do it later after getting much better at the game. But if I can start working on important things I\u0027ll need to have right now, I\u0027d like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, first question if you could answer, is if this is even possible.

A manned landing and return from Eve is pretty much the pinnacle of the stock game. Any experienced player can do so. It\u0027s your mission profile that will dictate how difficult it is.

Meaning, no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, no command seats or any kind of part clipping? This will again up the difficulty. Now do so from sea level and it\u0027s going to be that much tougher. At this point, you\u0027ll find the toughest part is not building a ship that can leave the surface and make orbit but, because the ship has now gotten so large, can it actually land safely to begin with. Not to mention that you\u0027ll have to launch it from Kerbin and get it to Eve in the first place. This can all be done, and it\u0027s a lot of fun. Your first mission will teach you quite a bit. My first Eve ship was a spectacular failure. As were the next few. However, the failures were incredibly informative and, when I was finally successful (with 2 Kerbals), it was a feeling akin to your first Mun landing.

it is possible.\u00A0 However, there is a hard limit to how low it can be and still make orbit; I believe it started at 6.9 km and made orbit with 11 m/s still in the tanks--and this was back in v1.0.4, as well.\u00A0 For v1.3, all I can say is that it is still theoretically possible to make orbit by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E from Eve\u00A0if you start above 6 km, but the only engines that can do it are the Vector and Mammoth.\u00A0 They\u0027re the only ones with enough atmospheric I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E to make the trip with a wet/dry mass ratio under 9, which is the mass ratio of the fuel tanks--and that\u0027s assuming massless everything else.\u00A0 I believe the required I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E (using the Kerbin sea level rating for the engine) is about 290s; this technically includes the Dart but the Dart lacks needed thrust and leaves \u003Cem\u003Ezero\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0room for other equipment, including itself.\u00A0 The Vector and Mammoth have 295s and that extra five seconds is all the margin you have for everything else on
