You could probably find a design that is VERY extremely large that might make SOI. The thing is an SSTO is essentially stretching the limits of the first stage by not shedding any non critical components/tabks. The only reason they are cost effective is that they can get to orbit cheaper by using airbreathing engines and wings for lift. Once you get into orbit, you are being very wastful to get any further.\n\nI usually get my payload to orbit then use another SSTO to deliver fuel for a tug that pushes the payload to SOI.

Airbrakes) and Retractable Wheels. Fuel tanks are OK, if used to mount an engine and intake. RCS may be needed. Everything else goes in a cargo or service bay. I even put Radiators in the cargo bay.\n\u003E - As little control surface as is necessary. On many of my single Rapier designs i only have 2 control surfaces. Combined Roll and Pitch in a V-tail or Elevons.\n\u003E - I always mount wings with a little upward angle, so I can have positive lift, even with the craft at zero degrees pitch, at high enough speed.  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - I do it mostly to minimize drag around and right after Mach 1.\n\u003E     - Because it\u0027s better to have only the wings at an angle to the airflow, than the whole craft.\n\u003E     - I aim for neutral lift around 375 m/s, at sea-level. At 9 km this gives neutral lift around 600-800 m/s.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Once I\u0027ve built my SSTO, I evaluate it\u0027s performance using quick tests, that I\u0027ve found to work for me. It takes a maximum of 4 minutes to test the basic viability of a new SSTO. That is not to say, that an SSTO which fails my tests, can\u0027t get to orbit. But it will probably take much longer than it needs to and probably uses more fuel than needs.\n\u003E \n\u003E Which brings me to the ascent profile. I don\u0027t use the standard, slow climb to 10 km. I fly pretty much level right off the runway and don\u0027t start climbing until I hit 450 m/s. I\u0027ve found this to be the most efficient ascent for my designs. Especially the heavier ones, many of which could not climb past 5 km with the standard ascent.\n\u003E \n\u003E I baked the tests into this album.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/3Sg6v](http://imgur.com/a/3Sg6v)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Craft file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B34u1G2080ndaGNmczUxMi04Ukk/view?usp=docslist_api)\n\u003E \n\u003E In general I prefer combined Rapier/Nuke SSTOs. I find them to be much more efficient than pure Rapier. They use a very similar ascent profile. There\u0027s a bunch in the SSTL album in my signature. Mostly made from Mk1 parts, but there\u0027s a few made from Mk2 and Mk3 parts, also.\n\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s a proper Rapier/Nuke SSTO: [G\u002B post](https://plus.google.com/\u002BValDraaken/posts/B52TLEPJUER) (with craft files). Although that one is a bit overpowered. It doesn\u0027t need a sea-level acceleration. It can accelerate through a shallow climb.\n\nHope it helps.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Actually, no; interplanetary Mk3\u0027s aren\u0027t that hard to do.\n\u003E Basically, you want enough RAPIERs to get off the runway, enough oxidiser to lift the apoapsis, an LV-N or two and as much LF as you can carry.
