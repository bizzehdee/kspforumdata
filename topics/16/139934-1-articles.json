This limits you to one single EVA report and one single surface sample, per trip. This is really not a problem for Gilly since there are not many biomes, and gravity is so low it is very cheap to make multiple trips to and from your orbiting ship. You can do multiple trips with your jetpack alone if you wish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other \u0022surprise\u0022 that comes with the seat is that when you leave the seat, the game tries to put you \u0022on top\u0022 of it. This is fine when landed on the surface, but back in orbit and docked to your mothership, this can be a problem. So I\u0027d recommend quicksaving before leaving the seat in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor SAS, if it\u0027s a pilot you\u0027re fine (but be very careful about getting the command chair straight on your lander, facing the direction of travel - TEST IT on Kerbin before you go). Personally, I always add a probe core, and always \u0022control from\u0022 the core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SteveD80","CreatedById":160995,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T08:27:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need a reaction wheel on it and in all likelihood want sas. I do this on my utility skiffs by putting on the .625 wheel with the control gizmo on top.

Put one on a jet and fly it to some Kerbin lake and take some data. It\u0027s the surface sample limit that\u0027s really harsh, because that one is usually worth more science points than all the rest -- so if you can only take one per trip that\u0027s sad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are ways around the limitations, but they all require having a 2nd crewmember\u00A0in a command pod. That way you can get both a scientist and a pilot, though. Doing that actually gets you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0capability than just having two pods -- the external crewmember can actually carry an unlimited number of duplicates of all experiments. One for a science lab, and two or three to take back to Kerbin. But the external crewmember has to stay in the\u00A0external seat all the way back to some station where they can dump off all the duplicates into an MPL, or into multiple pods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
