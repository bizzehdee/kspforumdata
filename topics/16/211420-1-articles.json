E.g. the storage part from where the e.g. small solar panel has to be pulled is for me always out of reach, when the kerbal is near the place, where it should be sticked. This results in an annoying \u0022place part, move kerbal, move part, move kerbal, move part, move kerbal\u0022 - gameplay. It is not fun, when you do it the 20th time, because of this very short radius restriction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan I increase this radius permanently, without breaking the game? Is there a mod, that does this? Or is there a game variable, that I could change in the files?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThx in advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-10T13:48:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2023 01:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Rakete\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-10T12:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to gameplay questions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakete","CreatedById":208801,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-10T13:46:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is not a gameplay-question, since it might require changing game-files or installing a mod.
