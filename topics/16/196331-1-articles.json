I can understand with very complex ships with hundreds of parts, but now i coupled two small things with less than 100 parts total and still the game screws me\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NbahRyF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002251.17\u0022 height=\u0022568\u0022 width=\u00221110\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NbahRyF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis is a mechanism to load/unload a rover into a cargo bay, should be rather simple with just two hinges. as i\u0027m still experimenting on the launchpad, there is nothing else above the cargo bay, just a fuel tank to act as counterweight. in the upper image you can see the hinge properly connected. in the lower image you can see that after i dock the rover, when i tell the hinge to bend, the part attached to the rover stand still, and the part attached to the cargo bay moves freely. interestingly, they still count as attached; if i move the other hinge it still carries that hinge along, even if they are disconnected in the visual. I tried using a claw instead of docking port, same result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis is getting very annoying. when i try to make very complex stuff i can blame myself for overloading the pc with too many parts, but this system is simple enough that it should work. and it doesn\u0027t happen occasionally so i can just save the game before docking and reloading if needed. no, it happens every single time, effectively preventing me from ever trying to dock ships with robotic parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nis there anything i can do to fix
