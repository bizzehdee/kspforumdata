I\u0027m working on the space station, providing (this time) with safety for the kerbals (Sorry for that!!!). I\u0027ve included a few emergency capsules to return back to kerbin, I tried them and then.. well.. :\u0027( POOR KERBALS!!!!\n\nI tested one pod.. Decoupled, throttled retrograde.. atmosphere reentry was ok, parachute worked. Good. CHECK! Tried the same while focused on other vessel resulted in a dead kerbal. From my understanding the physics and parachute will only work if the vessel is the \u0027active\u0027 one, right? Otherwise it will just entry the atmosphere and crash into kerbin without hesitation.\n\nIf this is the case, what is the best approach to surpass this situation? On an emergency I\u0027d like to send all pods back to kerbin, but I think it will not be safe to send all of them at the same time, right?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T08:28:43Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 08:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ilo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T08:14:32Z","Content":"Only the active vessel is actually simulated.\n\nAll other vessels are considered \u0022on rails\u0022 - the same thing that happens when you timewarp. Ships that are on rails do not interact with anything and do not execute any actions.\n\nIn addition, on-rails ships that get too close to a planet\u0027s surface get deleted outright. For Kerbin, that happens somewhere around 20km altitude. So your unfocused pod didn\u0027t even crash... it was simply removed before it got that far."},{"CreatedByName":"Snarfster","CreatedById":80347,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T08:18:03Z","Content":"If the vessels stay within 2.5 km of each other they will be simulated.\n\nI deployed by Laythe base that way. 4 modules with a parachute each all connected to a frame via decouplers.\n\nAt 5000 meters I popped all chutes and hit the decouplers, all 4 modules landed safely.\n\nEDIT: If you do this too high up and they drift beyond 2.5 km, they will be lost."},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T08:20:17Z","Content":"This is a function of how the game handles non-focused craft.\n\nAny craft outside the \u0027physics bubble\u0027, a sphere of about 2.5 km radius centered on the currently controlled craft, is deleted completely if it goes below 23 km altitude on Kerbin (other heights on other atmospheric bodies). This represents it either burning up in the atmosphere or crashing, which is fine, but it doesn\u0027t take into account whether the craft *could* be controlled, or whether it has activated parachutes.\n\nTo work around it, you have two options - stagger the deorbit burns on your rescue craft so that craft 1 lands before craft 2 reaches 23 km, and so on down the track; alternatively, make sure that no more than 2.5 km separates all escape pods on the way down (this is the harder of the two).\n\nAlternatively, if you don\u0027t mind mods, there are mods that expand the physics bubble (at the cost of performance) which would alleviate the issue."},{"CreatedByName":"ilo","CreatedById":130783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T08:27:05Z","Content":"Thank you!! problem \u0022solved\u0022.. sort of! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNext steps:\n\n- find those mods\n\n- find more information about the \u0022physics bubble\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Snarfster","CreatedById":80347,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T08:45:44Z","Content":"You could make a stack of escape pods and de-orbit the stack.
