I\u0027ve had designs where i could literally add huge booster rocket sections, then after some fiddling, remove them. It would travel exact same distance into space. Its designed to make sure that each section is useful and adding to the range. I feel i often add useless booster sections that don\u0027t actually add any distance to its ability to travel, i originally thought that they did. after hours of experimenting and rearranging fuel tanks and stuff on a single rocket made of 3 rockmax fuel tanks. i Came up with that based on what i learned. Also learned that 3 rockmax fuel tanks with skipper engine, travel same distance roughly as 2 rockmax fuel engines and a skipper engine. I figured out theres this weird relation between fuel weight, thrust, between each decoupled section as fuel is routed towards central one. I discovered that by having 1 rockmax fuel tank and 1 skipper engine. Then attached 2 identical rockets to the side. It went same distance as just one rocket. Even if u used the special fuel system it still goes same distance makes no difference. But if u remove the engines, then drop the two side fuel tanks when there empty, by looking at its fuel manually. It goes much further on one engine then having 3 engines draining from 3 fuel tanks. Learning that helped a lot. Little point in duplicating rockets except for balance purposes. They need to be bigger to go further. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext experiment is trying to figure out if using small booster rockets helps increase distance travelled. How to make small ones work well if they do. SO far everything is getting bigger i imagine u could use small rockets to help as well, but i have a feeling from my experiments that smaller rockets should not be linked by fuel. Only larger rockets should have fuel lines going inwards. Guess experimetns find out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you guys build your rockets btw?
