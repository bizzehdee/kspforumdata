This gives you two options....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) A pair of the normal fairing bases (one above \u0026amp; inverted, one below) will build a fairing cover for everything in between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Use the Interstage Fairing above \u0026amp; inverted which gives you a hollow space you can fill with stuff and makes the fairing walls the actual structural support so blowing the fairings acts as a decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally for what you are doing I would recommend #2... Even though you have \u0022reversed\u0022 a quad mount the physics will only be connected to 1 of the 4 nodes, not all 4 of them. So if you don\u0027t strut that beast up just so the thing will flail miserably at some point. Using the Interstage you can fill the inside like you would a cargo bay and it controls both the upper \u0026amp; lower nodes so you don\u0027t have to try and shrink it back down. When you blow the fairings it will auto decouple whatever was attached only to the fairings but still retains the structural stability of a single column stack. By inverting the interstage you are essentially dangling the quad stack inside it (so use some struts to stabilize) but it has no direct connection to whats below that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T04:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you prefer stock,you can also use structural panels as a sort of makeshift fairing.

Or some people use clamp-o-trons on the quad adapter and on the decouplers attached to the engines. When you build it, only 1 docking port will actually be attached.
