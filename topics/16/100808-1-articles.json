Parts such as the cubic octagonal strut and the static solar panel are well known to being over used due to them not having any mass, however if they truly did not have any mass wouldn\u0027t any force that applied to them give infinite acceleration? Do they actually have a small mass?"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T21:12:06Z","Content":"They are mass-less in that physics are not applied to them during flight."},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T21:14:50Z","Content":"You can\u0027t build a controllable craft of only massless parts, so you can\u0027t get infinite acceleration (all pods and probes have mass, as does a kerbal in a command seat)"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T21:18:56Z","Content":"What Taki says is true. I believe they are also given a small mass when they end up on their own (such as during disassembly) to help prevent physics problems like infinite acceleration.

They may still bend and wobble if there is a weight attached to them (end even if not, the game does the wobble calculation and comes up empty).\n\nDepending on the part, there may be more. Every ox-stat has it\u0027s angle to the sun / power generation calculated individually, for example.\n\nNote that I do not \\*know\\* whether the above is true. But I do know that my part count where the clock starts going yellow is very similar between craft, regardless of whether it\u0027s a ion glider (where like 90% of all parts are physicsless) or a heavy SSTO (where no more than 5% are physicsless). If anything, the ion glider lags more at lower part count. Therefore I presume that physicsless parts are not so physicsless after all.\n\nThat they can bend is an observation; that ox-stats need to trace the sun is common sense.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T21:58:51Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 09:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T22:07:30Z","Content":"So i wonder what would happen if you edited the part file of say, the monopropelant booster so that it had a probe core within and electricity supply, and then you turned on infinite fuel, what would happen?"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T22:12:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So i wonder what would happen if you edited the part file of say, the monopropelant booster so that it had a probe core within and electricity supply, and then you turned on infinite fuel, what would happen?\n\nI know what I\u0027d expect (the same as you), but you won\u0027t know until you tried.
