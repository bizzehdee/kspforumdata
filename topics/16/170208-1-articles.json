In general, spaceplanes will try to bring their nose prograde, which is a great way to wind up overheating your craft coming back from space; I prefer to fly with a 45 degree or better angle of attack. There are several ways to do this, and doing it purely aerodynamically is somewhat challenging. Higher control deflections (especially on control surfaces that are not all-moving), use of all-moving control surfaces for larger CoP shifts for the same control deflections, a flap system to move the CoP forward, etc all help. I tend to prefer canards over conventional tails, since they put more mass towards the nose of the plane, usually require less control surface for the same control authority, are less vulnerable to colliding with terrain, are more likely to be lined up vertically with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E (reducing inertial coupling), and have no chance of interfering with or being destroyed by engine exhaust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd while lots of people will say a fixed vertical stabilizer is enough, in my experience that\u0027s only really true of small craft, where pod torque is enough.

design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a common misconception.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you look at the designs for a lot of free-flight model aircraft, they\u0027re set up so the tailplane produces lift, and all canards are (it\u0027s common for a canard craft to have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E foward of the leading edge of the wing, where with conventional layouts it\u0027s usually 30-50% of the way from the leading to trailing edge, not counting sweep).\u00A0 The critical point, for both canards and conventional layouts, is that the forward wing must fly at a higher coefficient of lift than the rear.\u00A0 This produces a tendency to pitch up as speed increases, or pitch down as speed decreases; this gives what\u0027s known as longitudinal stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the \u003Cem\u003Eeasiest\u003C/em\u003E way to do this is with decalage -- a little difference in incidence between the front and rear wings (whether that\u0027s canard pitched up relative to the wing, or tailplane pitched down).\u00A0 However, with high performance free flight (which spend most of their time aloft gliding, so L/D is very important, as well as minimum sink) it has often been the case that different airfoils would be used, so that with zero decalage the tailplane would develop less lift, relative to speed, than the wing -- not \u003Cem\u003Eno\u003C/em\u003E lift, certainly not \u003Cem\u003Enegative\u003C/em\u003E lift (because that requires the wing to generate more lift, which increases drag), just \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E lift.\u00A0 This way, the nose will rise and fall as needed with small changes in speed, but the tailplane is helping hold the tail up, rather than pushing it down.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re mainly flying straight and level, a canard is actually easier to make stable than a conventional -- put your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E just ahead of the leading edge of the wing, then adjust the canard incidence to get a stable glide and use pitch trim to set level flight speed.\u00A0 Unlike a conventional, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E location isn\u0027t very critical at all, and the canard will always be in a lifting mode (unlike conventional with decalage).\u00A0 For high-G maneuvering, a three-surface is a very good choice, if the surfaces are sized correctly relative to each other -- the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E can be exactly on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E, and with both canard and tailplane contributing, the craft can maneuver like, well, a jet fighter.\u00A0 Stability, however, is likely to depend on a computer doing the actual flying, while the pilot just tells the computer where to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-30T08:41:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

things a bit and allowed the margins to be reduced a lot, but in order to have stable flight the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center

the resultant torque will pitch the aircraft up or down.\u00A0 Passive/static\u00A0stability means having the tailplane set up such that an increase in angle of attack causes the tail to pitch the nose back down, and a decrease causes it to pitch it back up.\u00A0 The usually way to do this is to have the tailplane set to provide downforce , which counters the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E being ahead of the wings \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Increasing angle of attack decreases the downforce and forces the nose down, decreasing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E increases the downforce and pushes it back up.\u00A0 As an added bonus it helps ensure the wing stalls before the tail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can achieve the same effect by having the tail set at a lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E than the wing but still producing lift, but there\u0027s less margin for error, I\u0027m guessing low speeds and fixed weights in models means this is doable.\u00A0 In order to do that of course means the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is behind the wings \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll

Less of an issue with light aircraft, which have a nice heavy engine up front and\u00A0just set a weight limit for the pilot/passengers, but gliders often\u00A0carry ballast as it is possible to be under weight, eg with a single pilot in a 2 seater.\u00A0 Presumably you need the ballast\u00A0models pretty carefully, but the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0then isn\u0027t going to shift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a further complication the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E moves with speed and angle of attack.\u00A0\u00A0Not much of an issue\u00A0for a high aspect ratio\u00A0low speed aircraft like a glider, but becomes a big issue when you go supersonic.\u00A0 Concorde pumped it\u0027s fuel around to move it\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E as it\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E moved back something like 6 feet at cruise from it\u0027s position at takeoff speed\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis explains the torque bit reasonable well, the diagram\u0027s a bit shonky though \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/trim.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/trim.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course a lot of military aircraft are designed to be inherently unstable as it\u0027s lower drag and\u00A0higher manoeuvrability, but I wouldn\u0027t fancy flying on of them on the WASD keys \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-30T08:49:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223281137\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170208\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517301685\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022123362\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RizzoTheRat\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, RizzoTheRat said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course a lot of military aircraft are designed to be inherently unstable as it\u0027s lower drag and\u00A0higher manoeuvrability, but I wouldn\u0027t fancy flying on of them on the WASD keys \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a dynamically unstable multi-hundred ton plane.
