I landed it, missed the target a bit (a probe I had already landed), and decided to try to fly it a bit closer. One of the landing legs hit the ground on the way over which sent me spinning. This is where it got a bit strange. I set the time warp to the infamous 4x (I can\u0027t remember why I did that) while I was spinning just a meter or so above the ground, not really losing altitude much, and then I set warp back to 1x, and I turned on ASAS and I suddenley began to fall. I went straight through the ground at around 2 m/s and my ship was destroyed. After that, my camera\u0027s focus kept moving downward into Minmus. This was quite annoying. I was able to revert the flight, and the save was fine. I heard that there two new major \u0022Kraken\u0022 like bugs in 0.22, so I was just wondering if this could be another and if there are any fixes. Is it a Kraken bug, and are there any fixes?

Whenever possible, avoid using it. Otherwise I had a Kerbal fall through a planet because he got out of his pod, dropped to the ground and then things exploded, the camera shook, and then the game crashed and a message said Oops...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the ships go, I believe it\u0027s because in regular time warp, all physics calculations for the most part are stopped and the craft cant be moved because it makes it one object. However, in physical time warp, the physics are still being calculated on all of the parts and movement is amplified so certain parts will collapse into each other. Then when you come out of time warp, the parts expand and things fail, then everything falls apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
