As soon as i go back into flying mode and switch off \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, the orbit in map mode turns blue and i have the advanced options available.

If you do have the Tracking Station and Mission Control both upgraded to level 2 then you should have blue orbit lines visible for any ship you are in control of in map view. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E should not affect it in any way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is one possible reason that you might not have the ability to operate maneuver nodes, however. Since the introduction of CommNet you have to have a communications link to Kerbin to set maneuver nodes if you don\u0027t have a pilot on board. Since you put \u0022pilot\u0022 in quotation marks this suggests to me that you might mean any Kerbal, but if you don\u0027t have a com-link to Kerbin then you have to have an actual Pilot on board to make maneuver nodes -- not just engineers or scientists. If you are close enough to Kerbin you will automatically have a comm-link with just your regular command pod, but it has limited range. A probe core and decent antenna are required if don\u0027t want to bring a pilot and are going out past the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s easy to see if this is your problem. While you are in the flight view press ESC to bring up the menu. Choose SETTINGS and then go into the DIFFICULTY OPTIONS tab at the top of the box. In the second column there is a button marked \u0022Enable Comm Network\u0022. Uncheck that button and accept the changes. Are you able to use maneuver nodes again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes any of that seem to apply to your craft? Are you using an actual pilot? How far from Kerbin are you? Are there any green lines connecting your ship to Kerbin in the map view? Do you have a probe core on your ship? Any antennas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s hard to tell right now just what your circumstances are.
