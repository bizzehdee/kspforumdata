It flies around Kerbin fine, gets to orbit fine, and with the assistance with a little extra boost after an orbit refueling my spaceplane can make it to Laythe with fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am have lots of difficulties, however, trying to land the blasted thing on Laythe. I am sure I could go back to the drawing board and try to make a more stable lander, but this plane is at Laythe now so I want to do it with this one. Some of the biggest difficulty I am having is finding flat ground to land. I have tested landing on this thing multiple times on Kerbin (areas near the runway), and while not the easiest craft to land I can manage it. Granted I am probably a piss poor pilot when it comes to spaceplanes. I have tried well over 25 times (each time requiring me to load from a save far back). So needless to say I have spent many frustrated hours trying to land this spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you guys have any tips? I come in for landing under 100m/s total. I try to keep my vertical descent less than 10m/s if not 5m/s. But every time I touch down, an engine falls off, or a wing, or a wheel, and before I know it the plane is tumbling and exploding into tiny bits on Laythe\u0027s sandy surface. I don\u0027t get it because I land fine on Kerbin (flatter ground though). My roommate can testify that my cursing has ramped up in the last few hours.

Moar wings never hurts (so long as you have struts and don\u0027t use Ferram Aerospace). I also reccommend sending a series of probes to Lathe to scout out landing zones. Or use a manned lander with orbital ship (with plenty of excess fuel for multiple landings) to seek out a good location for an air base and set a flag there as a marker. Once the location is marked, you can use the flag as landing guidance.
