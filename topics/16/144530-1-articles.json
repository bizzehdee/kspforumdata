I use a lot of space tugs, so generally that\u0027s what I design the satellites to be after they are done being satellites. Even if you cannot make spacetugs out of them, an orbiting fuel tank is still a very useful thing. If you launch a station hub, then all your orbiting fuel tanks can dock with it, and you end up with a giant fuel station almost for free.
