I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t have a link to a picture handy but if your prograde is to the left of the target, for instance, you want to burn the other side (to the right) of the target to bring them together - hence you are \u0027pulling\u0027 the prograde market towards your vehicle\u0027s heading. On the other hand, when reversing and braking towards a target, if the retrograde (backwards) marker is to the left of the target you want to point your heading *even more* towards the left and burn there to \u0027push\u0027 the retrograde marker towards the target."},{"CreatedByName":"mckamx","CreatedById":116032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T23:29:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There are two meanings - the obvious one not being the one you want ...\n\u003E i) \u0027Pull\u0027 vehicles, usually space-tugs or similar have the engines attached radially towards the front, with the mass of the payload/structure behind and between them.

Press R to activate RCS, then use the keys H, N, J, K, L, I to control various thrusters. In particular observe how the prograde and retrograde markers behave: when you accelerate, the prograde marker moves towards the reticle (is getting pulled by it). The opposite happens to the retrograde marker - it\u0027s pushed away. And IJKL just move it up, down, left, right.\n\nThis is very useful for docking, as if you manage to overlap the prograde marker with the target marker, you\u0027re on the perfect course to dock."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T07:10:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_rocket_fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_rocket_fallacy) for problems with the \u0022pull is more stable\u0022 hypothesis.\n\nAs RIC said, the pendulum fallacy is not about the same at all. Pull is more stable in KSP because if you pull a piece of string it straightens out rather than collapsing. The pendulum fallacy, on the other hand, refers to directional stability; the fallacy being that the \u0027train\u0027 of parts behind the engine will help it point in the right direction."},{"CreatedByName":"GeorgePauley","CreatedById":124690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T00:41:45Z","Content":"Interesting. The example using the RCS makes sense. But I never really think about pushing or pulling the have marker. I just think about rotating my ship along one of the axis. Is there some sort of benefit to using the push-pull metaphor?"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T13:54:27Z","Content":"Like any mnemonic, it\u0027s only useful to the extent it works for you.\n\nOnce you\u0027ve practiced docking a few times the chances are you won\u0027t need to think it through at all, it becomes pretty instinctive quite quickly - however hard it is to learn in the first place ^^."}]}
