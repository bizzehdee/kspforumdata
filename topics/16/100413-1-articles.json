There are both radial and stack decouplers. The stack ones should be placed in between the fuel tank and the part above it. The radial ones should be put on the side of parts and then fuel tanks mounted on them. They can be activated through staging once your fuel has run out.\n\nWhere is my cookie?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bloody_looser","CreatedById":95664,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T11:37:41Z","Content":"Or you just can slam \u0027em hard enough into something.
