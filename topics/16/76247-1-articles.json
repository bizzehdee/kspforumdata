Basically, the control surfaces and wings apply \u003Cem\u003Ethrust\u003C/em\u003E to simulate lift. Control surfaces and canards can exploit this, intentionally or unintentionally, to create phantom forces. They can be as subtle as a craft that never seems to want to slow down for landing, or as blatant as a canard or winglet getting thrown off a crashed plane, accelerating to 2 kilometers per second, and leaving the atmosphere entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Although if that \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E using FAR, my congratulations.
