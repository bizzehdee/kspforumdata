My goal is to simply get a surface sample back to Kerbin. Now im not in it for the challenge of building a 500 part, lag-fest lander. Instead im going about it the practical way. Air balloons via HL Airships. So.. from the top of EVE\u0027s atmosphere ( As high as I can get anyway.. ). How much Dv would a rocket need to reach orbit? And.. at this point would it make more sense for the same rocket to be the return vessel as well? ( if the Dv gain from balloons is enough ) Or.. even with balloons should I still have the craft rendezvous with an orbiter? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one more thing that comes to mind... is it possible to return TWO surface samples?

I figured if I could launch from the top of the atmosphere that would save me SO MUCH that it\u0027d just be easier to then go home with the same craft. But either way on that one.. How much Dv do you figure I can save launching from 80km ( Is what im hoping for )?

If you apply some horizontal thrust as your using the balloons to carry you up you should be fine. but I would ditch the balloons once they are no longer useful, this way you can cut down on some weight. The key here is to build up horizontal velocity as you increase your altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T05:09:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm.. I suppose I will try and incorporate an engine that can boost me sideways during ascent. But basically all I planned was doing is floating a rocket up as far as these balloons can take me ( still working on which ones to use ) and then treating it as any other launch.. but from the top of the atmosphere. Soon as the vertical speeds drops with the balloon ill detach it and fire engines maybe only pitching over to 10 degrees then accordingly as speed increases. The air should be thin so Im hoping a high TWR can do the trick. Which brings me to another question. .. Whats a good TWR for Eve? I use 1.3 for Kerbin and that keeps the rocket nice and close to the prograde marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I need to know.. what Dv number should I shoot for when designing this thing?
