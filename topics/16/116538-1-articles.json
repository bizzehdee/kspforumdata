When you click on the pod the option presented is to take *all* the data currently in the pod. There is no way to just take individual items. Similar, having taken the data, when you click on a pod the option is to store the data, meaning all of it that the Kerbal is carrying."},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T04:28:46Z","Content":"Erm no, you do have to click through each science device / experiment separately to get the science out of them, everything gets moved in one go only when using a kerbal to retrieve from or put them in a pod."},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T08:17:23Z","Content":"A long time ago there was a mod to do just that.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54998-FScience-Science-Data-Transfer-v0-1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54998-FScience-Science-Data-Transfer-v0-1)\n\nCurrently my method is to put the experiments near to each other so that they can be reached from a single ladder, so that I can access them without having to fly around with my Kerbal."},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T09:18:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, if it is manned.
