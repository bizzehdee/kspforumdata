Forget about your orbit, just make sure your speed is low enough that you will be able to stop before you overrun. My rule of thumb is speed about 1% of the distance, i.e. 100 m/s at 10 km, 10 m/s at 1 km, 1 m/s at 100 m.

By killing relative velocity you\u0027re getting on very similar orbit as your target. It\u0027s not perfectly the same orbit as you are in different place, but if you close the distance fast enough, you\u0027ll not notice any difference to what would happen if you were just floating in space without any orbital mechanics intrusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this \u0022fast enough\u0022 is definitely nothing like \u0022very fast\u0022.

This reduces the drift from your target, allows you to alter your orbit without intersecting the atmosphere, and it also increases framerate. Alternatively, you can try to keep Kerbin out of the camera view when docking. Because of the shorter orbital periods, docking in Low Kerbin Orbit is probably harder than docking in orbit around many other celestial bodies, such as the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T17:15:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet NavyFish\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901-0-22-Docking-Port-Alignment-Indicator-(Version-2-2-Updated-10-27-13)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDocking Port Alignment Indicator\u003C/a\u003E.

This way when you get close enough, you get the targets relative speed and your Nav-ball goes into target mode. Now, here is the part that seems to me it has not been mentioned. It might be that i\u0027m too impatient, but i have never killed my relative speed until 100 meters from target. I usually just \u0022pull\u0022 my prograde marker or \u0022push\u0022 the retrograde. why?
