I understand that for an aerobreaking maneuver I\u0027ve got to come in at below 40km. I set the flight path accordingly, but end up at a very different position once I get close to the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lo7ZpSI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lo7ZpSI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The craft is 3 days away, maneuver node set to a 24km Periapsis \u0022in front\u0022 of Duna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Maneuver performed (well enough)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Craft arrives with a 464km Periapsis \u0022behind\u0022 Duna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m obviously missing something. I guess flying to Duna is different from flying to Minimus or the Mun, but in terms of projected flight path my ships always ended up exactly where they were supposed to. So I dont quite understand why that is not the case now. Hopefully some nice Kerbal with experience in interplanetary navigation can give me a hint.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-09T21:39:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2014 09:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by EeeLee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Esolved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T20:18:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you are timewarping when you enter the SoI it can have an effect on your orbit. also, because of rounding errors the farther you are from your target the more your orbit will shift.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T20:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI should mention that you\u0027re going to want to come in closer - much closer - to Duna\u0027s surface than 25,000 if you want a successful aerobraking.
