properly.\u00A0 First off, you need to know where the biomes are in the game (as opposed to looking at a paper map).\u00A0 For this, you need either the SCANsat mod to map the planet yourself, or CTRL-ALT-F12 to open the cheat menu and enable visible biomes.\u00A0 Then draw a path between them all that starts and ends near the equator.\u00A0 So that\u0027s your route.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo follow this route, you need a lander with sufficient fuel, starting from it being on the ground after its 1st landing.\u00A0 The fuel required depends on if the lander itself is also the crew return vehicle or whether you\u0027re doing this \u0022Apollo-style\u0022.\u00A0 If not Apollo, then the lander will need to arrive on the surface of Minmus the 1st time with about 3500m/s still in the tanks.\u00A0 That\u0027s enough to hit all the biomes and come home using several high, gentle, safe aerobraking passes at Kerbin prior to landing.\u00A0 Make if 4000m/s if you expect to waste fuel with imprecise hopping around Minmus.\u00A0 If you\u0027re doing it Apollo-style, then the lander can get by with about 1000m/s less than if it returns itself, although it will need the ability to dock (a port \u002B RCS \u002B balanced RCS thrust) which doesn\u0027t make it really any cheaper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lander also needs 1 (and only 1) of every science instrument you have, plus a scientist, an antenna,\u00A0batteries, and solar panels.\u00A0 To maximize the science haul, use mods that add more experiments, like DMagic\u0027s Orbital Science.\u00A0 If you\u0027re only sending down the scientist, then the lander also needs an OKTO probe core so it can use SAS even without a pilot aboard.\u00A0 If you have a pilot, you don\u0027t need the probe core, but the only reason to send extra Kerbals is to level them up---they have no effect on the science gained.\u00A0 But if you have the Field Experience mod, you don\u0027t need to make special trips just to level up Kerbals.\u00A0 Yay!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo those are your basic desing parameters.\u00A0 Use MJ\u0027s dV display or KER to make sure the payload part (crew \u002B science) has enough dV for the job.\u00A0 Then stick however much transfer stage and lifter you need under that to get to Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce at Minmus, you need an in-game biome map (see above) to know where to land.\u00A0 At each landing site, run all the experiments and have the scientist EVA to gather all the data and stuff them in the capsule, plus reset the Goo and Materials and take a surface sample.\u00A0 Also plant a flag and include the name of the biome in the plaque, which helps keep track of where you\u0027ve been already.\u00A0 Don\u0027t forget to do crew reports and EVA reports as well.\u00A0 You can do 2 EVA reports each landing, 1 on the ladder (\u0022from space just above BiomeName\u0022) and on the surface (\u0022from BiomeName\u0022).\u00A0 This will require 2 EVAs because a Kerbal can only carry 1 EVA report at a time (unless you have Antenna Range, which allows Kerbals to transmit their own EVA reports).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe capsule can only store 1 experiment data set per experiment per location.\u00A0 This is why you only need 1 Goo and 1 Material Bay.\u00A0 The capsule can only hold 1 crew report in total, no matter where it\u0027s from, however.\u00A0 This means you must always transmit crew reports, so the space is open to record another at the next biome.\u00A0 This is why you need an antenna, batteries, and solar panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood
