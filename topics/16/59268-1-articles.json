Once done, un-grab it with the claws and back your rescue ship a way a few meters then match velocity. Then execute your time warp. Once back inside Kerbin\u0027s SoI, exit time warp, re-grab the science ship, and put the science ship on a low orbit (like 30km or so) to aerobrake it, or alternatively just de-orbit it from whatever orbit you manage to push it into (assuming you\u0027re not using mods that affect re-entry like FAR or Deadly Re-Entry). Because of the way time warp works, doing this in stages is the only way I can think of; just keep your relative velocity to the target at 0 so you don\u0027t drift (too far) apart. If you\u0027re having trouble matching velocity, set the sci ship as your target and click on the speed indicator on your Navball until it says \u0022Target\u0022 (which it should by default when you set a target) now, the indicators on your navball show your prograde and retrograde velocity RELATIVE to the target, so you can use RCS to 0 it out. If you start to drift too far apart during time warp, just un-warp and maneuver back closer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps, and kudos for the creative rescue!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T07:20:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is the way I do these sort of recoveries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you hold shift (or is it alt) and hit the timewarp hotkey, you can do up to a 4x timewarp with physics enabled. But there are concequences. The best thing you can do is get your burn for escape, release your captured ship, timewarp and end timewarp a bit before you need to do your next burn. Re-capture then do your next burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T07:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat they said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) grab\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E correct\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) release\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed) time warp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee) go to step a)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ef) post pics or it never happened.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ISmokeThis","CreatedById":98831,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T21:52:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, thanks guys.
