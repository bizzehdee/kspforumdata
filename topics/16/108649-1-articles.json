Is that correct?\n\nI\u0027ve recently started a MK3 spaceplane (first one ever) and found that there seems to be more drag along the center line of the craft that I\u0027d expect. Didn\u0027t 1.0.1 address an issue with MK3 occlusion? \n\nMore drag lines than I\u0027d expect;\n\n[![BB7nNoBl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BB7nNoBl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/BB7nNoB)\n\nLooking inside the fuel tank (in front of which is another fuel tank, the mk3 passenger module, mk3 cockpit and nose cone)\n\n[![0BZMtZ8l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0BZMtZ8l.jpg)](http://imgur.com/0BZMtZ8)\n\nIt seems like all the inline parts are generating drag.

When two parts are connected by stacknodes, the area of occlusion is the minimum of the facing areas, and that\u0027s applied only to the appropriate faces of the cube, too.\n\nExample: an Oscar on top of an FL-T800. The bottom of the Oscar would be completely occluded (result: 0 area for the down face of the cube). The top face of the FL-T800 would have one quarter of its area occluded. And that\u0027s it."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T08:35:17Z","Content":"Does this occlusion apply if parts aren\u0027t totally connected.\n\nFor example : I have a Rockamax tank then a small probe core, then a rockamax size heatshield.\n\nDoes the heatshield protect the tank as it would do it it have been fixed on the tank itself ?"}]}
