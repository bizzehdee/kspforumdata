Compare to this (at work so I can\u0026#39;t do it, myself):\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn a circular orbit of mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUse a maneuver node to make a burn at prograde at a point near between mun and kerb. Note, near, not directly in between. Just make a nav point with a nice prograde burn applied that puts you just outside mun SOI and drag it around until the hugely eliptical orbit has where you are about, now, at the furthest point out on the eliptical orbit of kerb. The closest point will be incredibly close to kerb. Once out of mun SOI, you can burn just a tad more to fine tune your eliptical orbit into the kerb atmosphere. If you do it delicately enough, you can enter kerb without burning retro to slow down since orbit of mun is not too distant as to cause high speed re-entry.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis was a bad explanation, so in essence, you burn prograde when around the mun until your new, kerb SOI orbit is eliptical with one end at mun distance and the other nearly in the kerb atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSample (kinda): [URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXIV7Nfj3_Q[/URL] at 18:00 min, you see him setting up a node. While he reaches kerb atmosphere, this is a little less efficient than I do. BUT, at 18:00 exactly, look where his ship is. (looking downward), at a counter-clockwise orbit, where his ship is is about where the maneuver node should be that i explain above. you burn there, you will get his results, but with less delta-v used.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[I]Ultimately[/I], it is good practice to avoid large burn maneuvers with multiple burn stages. This applies everywhere. Say you want to go to Eve from Kerb. It is hugely inefficient to first leave Kerb and have a matched kerb orbit of kerbol then burn to hit Eve. Instead, you want to burn from inside kerb until your outside Kerb orbit is where you want it to be...meeting Eve. Similar idea here. You don\u0026#39;t want to leave Mun then adjust. Burn inside Mun so that your outside Mun orbit is where you want it.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T15:44:31Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 03:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Friend Bear\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T15:44:08Z","Content":"\nBrainlord Mesomorph,\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0026#39;s the approach Cantab\u0026#39;s talking about:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/MunRetro_zpsoiss32ck.jpg[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbout 270 m/sec straight to reentry.

In the attached album I show my lowest-dv path ever from Kerbin to Mun and back. I did it in back in KSP version 0.23.5, when the Kerbal-X simply could not do a Mun-and-return mission, I was seeing how close I could come without refueling. (Then I refueled to get it home). You can see that starting from an 9x9km orbit around Mun a 207m/s burn takes you out to a 58,000km Kerbin apoapsis where a 20m/s retrograde burn give you a low flyby of Mun that flings you all the way to Kerbin\u0026#39;s atmosphere with no further burns necessary. I did need a little correction burn so my total from LKO to Kerbin was 229m/s total. For comparison I had the rescue craft run a standard Mun-and-return so you can see a direct path cost 273m/s, as Slashy says above.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe path you showed doesn\u0026#39;t go out far enough, so the flyby of Mun doesn\u0026#39;t lower your periapsis to Kerbin\u0026#39;s atmosphere, I think you\u0026#39;ll find adding just a couple more m/s will get you there, since just an extra 1m/s burn in LMO will add thousands of Km to your Kerbin apoapsis. There are very delicate adjustments of the burn sizes though, for those trying it a node editor will help a lot. And take care to aim for encountering Mun after Kerbin periapsis, not before, as I detail in the album, the path predictor gives a false solution otherwise! \u003Cbr\u003E\nThe album is rather large, sorry about that, I also detail a very low cost bielliptic way of getting from LKO to LMO using numerous Mun flybys to reduce both the LKO departure dV (from the standard 857 down to 845m/s) and the Mun orbit insertion burn (from the standard 273m/s to 208\u002B13=221m/s).

On your first encounter your ap is higher than the mun so you\u0026#39;re travelling faster than the mun at encounter. That means you enter the SOI prograde and leave retrograde which slows you down. Now that your orbit is inside the mun you\u0026#39;re travelling slower at encounter i.e. It is catching up with you which means that you enter its SOI travelling kerbin retrograde relative to the mun.
