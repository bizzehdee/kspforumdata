The points that this line passes through the body (prograde and retrograde) will always be at the body\u0027s equator, since KSP doesn\u0027t model axial tilt of objects. This can give you two reference points with which to visually judge the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb can also help, as you can use the maneuver planner to generate a node to zero the inclination at the equatorial ascending or descending nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ODaily","CreatedById":98717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T00:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cashen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cashen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E KSP doesn\u0027t model axial tilt of objects. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s interesting, definitely something I didn\u0027t know.
