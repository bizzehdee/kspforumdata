I have 3 geostationary satellites around Kerban (and 1 in a polar orbit at 2,868,750 ish). Each Comsat has one antenna dedicated to \u0022active vessel\u0022 and one or more antennas pointed to the other Comsats. The satellites will communicate if they are specifically targeting each other, but if they are set to \u0022Active Vessel\u0022 they will not synch up. I thought you could just set these things to \u0022Active Vessel\u0022 and it would auto synch to any active antenna in range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I tried sending a probe to Minus after my Comsats where in place in the hopes of constant communication. After I left the range of the space station the probe locked onto one of the Comsats, but I still lost communication to the space station. The map showed a communication line from the Minus Probe to the Comsat, but I had no control because it was not routing the signal back to the Space Station. I thought this was just a bug or glitch so I reload and re launched with the same results. The Comsat in question shows that it has a signal from itself to the space station, but it wont rout the Probes signal to the Space Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I dont know what to do anymore. I didn\u0027t think that setting up satellites would be this difficult. I am using all the mods Scott Manley is using in his Interstellar Quest videos, that that matters any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help you guys can offer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T01:53:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this is for remotetech 2, then it belongs in add-on support. Active vessel causes the sats to point at the active vessel. If the sat that connects to mission control can\u0027t connect to the active vessel, then you won\u0027t have connection. To solve this either use the long range omnidirectional antenna or add two more dishes to each craft so that each sat will have one dish pointed at its neighbors and one at the active vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: The problem mentioned in the second paragraph may be a bug and it would be helpful to the developer of the mod if your made a post in the mod\u0027s forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-12T02:03:56Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2014 02:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Redjoker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T22:11:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify the point made above, active vessel means whatever ship you are currently controlling. Since a dish can only point at one target at a time, you need dedicated dishes for each linkage you want to make.

Typically, I release a probe from a mothership, have them point to each other, and control the probe.
