If you had a cannon on the surface of the moon and pointed it straight upwards, the cannonball would return to the surface at the same velocity that it left. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt only gets a little bit tricky when landing because you usually can\u0027t pull off a perfect landing with a single full-power burn. Most people need several small, gentle burns to keep their speed within a safe range as they approach the surface. This is less efficient than just taking off at full throttle and burning until you\u0027ve used up all of the fuel allocated for takeoff. This is why you\u0027d need some extra fuel for landing. However, if you\u0027re using some program which will let you land with a single full-power burn, then I wouldn\u0027t worry about that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fyrem","CreatedById":57131,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T22:43:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe straight up=straight down I understood would be the same.

You should budget extra for landings, though.

For landing I just continue decelerating at full power along the horizon, only pointing my nose up enough to keep my vertical velocity near zero. Once I have no velocity at all I do a controlled slow descent the last 5000 feet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is especially useful since I often use a pair of low power high ISP atomic engines to land. For a vertical descent they would have to start slowing down very very early due to low T/W ratio. But by using a tight periapsis they can easily do most of their decelerating maneuver at low altitude and high speed without splatting my lander into the mun. Saves me the trouble of having to bring an extra rocket engine along just for the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget some downward facing lights if you want to land on any dark areas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-24T00:52:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2013 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Alistone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
