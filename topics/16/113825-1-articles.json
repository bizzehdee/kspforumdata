So if your controlling part is pointing upwards(which for most Mun lander designs it will), your Navball will not be particularly useful. Alternatively, you can slap on a docking port on the front of your rover and control it from there(right-click the part and select \u0022control from here\u0022). You should get the correct heading then. You can, and probably should, test it on the launch pad during the assembly."},{"CreatedByName":"Pinchy","CreatedById":143038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T10:08:41Z","Content":"Yes Melfice - I understand the directions on the navball as you state - the issue is that there is no way as far as I can tell which way you are facing relative to the Navball directions - ie you want to go 90degrees East but you don\u0027t know if you need to push WASD keys to get there...."},{"CreatedByName":"Umcookies","CreatedById":144324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T10:40:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes Melfice - I understand the directions on the navball as you state - the issue is that there is no way as far as I can tell which way you are facing relative to the Navball directions - ie you want to go 90degrees East but you don\u0027t know if you need to push WASD keys to get there....\n\nThere sure is, you\u0027ve never noticed that reticle that\u0027s always in the middle of the navball? You can always orient yourself like this.\n\nIf the numbers are slightly hard to read you can use that slightly orange line as that\u0027s north.

I think you are after the rotation of the craft, the direction is straight up. The craft is rotated so that North is on the right, Soth Left, East is Up and West down.\n\n\u0022Ahh - thanks Dilli - so even if my navball is straight down vertical with the dot on the centre the line indicates which way I am facing\u0022\n\nYour command pod (and probably rocket) would be pointed at the center of the body it is on / around.\n\nThe level indicator is however rotated according the rotation of the part you are controlling from; that why it can change when you use the \u0022control from here\u0022 toggle as other parts my be rotated differently (by default they will all be rotated the same if placed in line and not flipped or rotated when being placed IIRC).\n\nFor ease of reference lets just say its one command pod (or they all in the same rotation) -\u003E\n\nIf pointing straight down WASD will still move the rocket down, left, right and up (relative to the level indicator) By moving the level indicator onto the North line until level with the horizon (on the nav ball) your craft will be pointed north, likewise with moving it onto 90 -E, 180 - S or 270 - W. \n\nYou can use the V on the level indicator to find your rotation.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T12:07:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 12:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dilli**"},{"CreatedByName":"Umcookies","CreatedById":144324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T12:22:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E umcookies - so I may be confused - but how do you know which direction you are facing from your example.

So, if you were sitting at KSC and slowly lifted off of the launch pad but rotated your craft 180 degrees pressing D will now take you West rather than East.\n\nLikewise if you rotated exactly 90 degrees pressing D will now lean your craft to the North.\n\nRotating -90 degrees then pressing D will lean your craft South\n\nEDIT: as Dilli said, the orientation of the part you\u0027re \u0022control from here\u0022 will effect the navball as well. \n\nIt\u0027s considerably easier to pay attention to the navball exclusively, you can entirely ignore your craft as the camera\u0027s orientation will change your perception of what the controls do.\n\nTo keep with using the D key as an example, pressing it will always rotate the navball (and thus your craft) to the right of the navball.\n\n![XshVQIJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/XshVQIJ.png)\n\n![ygUIaXU.png](http://i.imgur.com/ygUIaXU.png)\n\nIn the above pictures I\u0027ve rotated my lander (poorly) 90 degrees but pressing D will always rotate the navball (thus your craft) to the right.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T12:26:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 12:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Umcookies**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T20:39:56Z","Content":"By the way: I find that this gets a lot easier if I design my rovers \u0022axially\u0022.\n\nThat is, design the rover the same way you\u0027d design a rocket, as a central stack of parts that has some radial attachments. The wheels would be one of the more important radial attachments in this case. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nThis also makes it easy to have a \u0022self-landing\u0022 rover: the back of the rover has a small fuel tank with inline small engine (like a Spark). You can fly the rover just like you\u0027d fly a rocket. Landing is simple, you just back down on your tail, just like you\u0027d land a rocket.\n\nWhen you drive, your command pod is lined up just as you\u0027d expect (with the top of the pod pointing forward, not up), so your navball has an accurate horizon indicator and you can easily and intuitively see which direction you\u0027re pointing.\n\n(Yes, you can also have the upward-pointing pod and put a docking port on the front to \u0022control from here\u0022. But this way just seems to make the design simpler.)\n\nIt also makes it easier to fit the rover in an aero shell (like a fairing), since the long, skinny axis of the rover is along the axis of the launching rocket rather than perpendicular to it. The only awkward sticky-out pieces are the wheels themselves."}]}
