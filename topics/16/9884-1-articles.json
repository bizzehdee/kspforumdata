However, if you find yourself with a large lateral velocity as you head towards the Mun, I suggest you click on the velocity display to change it to surface, then burn on the horizon in the direction of your retrograde in order to kill the majority of the lateral velocity whilst you\\\u0027re still high-up. Then, when you get closer to the ground, make corrections using RCS translation keys -- J,L,I,K or left, right, forward, back respectively and H/N for up/down.

Remember that it\\\u0027s on a logarithmic scale: Each \u0027notch\u0027 accounts for more units as the gauge moves further and further in either direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe number displayed over the nav ball is your absolute speed. So, for ballparking it.. your absolute speed minus your vertical speed will give you a rough idea of how much horizontal speed you have. (It\\\u0027s actually a square root sum, more complicated).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy method of landing is that I try to kill off as much \u0027horizontal\u0027 speed when I start my descent as soon as possible. If the x on the nav ball that shows the opposite of which direction I\\\u0027m going (i.e. when you\\\u0027re facing \\\u0027backwards\\\u0027. I\\\u0027ll call it the anti-path), I try to get that centered on 90 degrees (or as close to) as soon as possible. Once I have it just about there, I center my ship on the anti-path marker and decelerate. My general rule is speed=(Altitude-3000)/100 as you descend. So if you\\\u0027re between 10k and 9k, try to shoot for coming down no faster than 90m/s. This will leave you just about stopped when you get to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you have more and more vertical speed killed off, the anti-path marker will start to \u0027drift\u0027 towards one side. I always burn at twice the angle it is away from the nav ball (sometimes more) to re-center it back on top of the ball. If the anti-path is at 80 deg, I\\\u0027ll do a deceleration burn at about 70 deg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the final little bit of the path, I tend to lock on my SAS unit and then \u0027helicopter\u0027 down; using the same method as above, I\\\u0027ll leave the SAS on but still try to point the ship towards twice the angle of my anti-path. I get the throttle adjusted to the point where my rockets are having me maintain speed, and then I\\\u0027ll increase or decrease throttle as needed to adjust my speed. The RCS units tend to come in handy for killing off any remaining horizontal speed when you get down into the \u0026gt;20m/s range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get really good with the throttle control, you can get it adjusted so that the main engines are pushing just hard enough to maintain your current height. I\\\u0027ve gotten to the point that I usually do this, and then use the RCS thrusters to \u0027push\u0027 me down to the surface.
