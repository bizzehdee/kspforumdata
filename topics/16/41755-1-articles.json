Previously, when your RCS ports were not symmetrically placed around the centre of mass, all would fire at full power when asking for linear motion, which would put your ship into a spin. SAS would subsequently use large amounts of monopropellant to try and counter this rotation and it annoyed me to no end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tip (the indicators you\u0027re talking about are the ones in the bottom-left of the screen, right?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T14:49:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyes, they are the ones in that corner \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T15:48:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpyritdragon: thanks for asking this.
