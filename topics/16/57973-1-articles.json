I usually do one at the ascending or descending node to do a plane shift; sometimes that\u0027s a good time to go ahead and do prograde/retrograde and radial course corrections as well. Of course, the earlier you correct, the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I usually do is zoom way out and note the distance to closest intercept. I then set up a maneuver node; usually a couple of days ahead. I pull one direction and see what that\u0027s done to the approach - if the distance has increased, I pull the opposing direction. If the distance has decreased, I continue slow pulls until the distance starts increasing again. Don\u0027t be afraid to pull radially; yes it\u0027s not the most efficient way of travelling, but it often makes the difference between getting where you\u0027re going and spending a long time in Kerbol orbit. Once you\u0027ve got an encounter indicated, make \u003Cem\u003Every slow\u003C/em\u003E pulls - you want to get as close as you can, especially if you can aerobrake at the target. If you can\u0027t get close with a single correction, go ahead and make the indicated burn when necessary and try again later. Ideally you\u0027ll get your desired encounter periapsis in a single, early correction burn, but if it takes more than one it takes more than one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T15:17:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Commissioner Tadpole\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Commissioner Tadpole\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEvery time, when I am heading for another planet, my periapsis ends up several kilometers away from the destination.

Yes, prepare your maneuver and execute it, but as soon as you get an intercept, delete the maneuver and perform corrections right where you are (e.g. still in Kerbin SOI). RCS is your good friend as you can thrust in any direction there and that way you may bring your intercept periapsis rather low still in the SOI. Zoom into your target system and watch what various RCS directions do with your periapsis. If it moves in the right direction but too slowly, place a new maneuver node ahead of your ship and applying just tenths of m/s you can fine-tune your approach. Do not trust that maneuver - orient your ship along it, then delete the maneuver and apply thrust while watching your real trajectory change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule number 2: Do not trust SOI changes. Lower your time warp every time you change SOI and check your intercept after the change. Apply corrections if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule number 3: No fuel pumping around the ship while in interplanetary space.
