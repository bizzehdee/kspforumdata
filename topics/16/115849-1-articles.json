I get up there, switch to the ship. Much to my surprise I find that it is a HECKS probe core with a kerbal stuffed inside (He must have been really desperate). Can not EVA him due to no exit. Any ideas on finding a can opener to get him out?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T02:37:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 02:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by icedown**"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T01:10:17Z","Content":"Only things I can think of are capturing the probe in a bay (not a great idea but it might possibly maybe work?) \n\nOr use your rescue ship to give it a few little nudges until it goes suborbital and hope for a lucky bounce."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T01:43:22Z","Content":"This is a bug that can happen with certain mods (UKS does this). Some people advise using a klaw to bring the whole thing down, but I avoid that like the plague because the klaw\u0027s so buggy-- it seems like it always screws up my save and I have to revert.\n\nI generally just resort to editing the save file to turn the craft into a Mk1 lander can. It\u0027s a simple one-line edit; just go into the save file (make a backup copy in case you mess something up), search for the \u0022Fredbert\u0027s Wreck\u0022 (or whatever it\u0027s called) to find the vessel, find the first PART in the VESSEL section, find the \u0022part = \u0022 line where it says it\u0027s a HECS or whatever, and replace that so that it says \u0022landerCabinSmall\u0022 instead. Then load the save and you\u0027re good to go."},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T02:37:29Z","Content":"I ended up editing the save. I wasn\u0027t sure if just changing the part would work.
