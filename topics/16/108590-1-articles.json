Thanks!\n\nWith that tech the best you can do is orbit reaching high space. It is difficult to do without the next rocketry tech however.\n\nAs sal says, the radial parachute is likely the problem, its introducing a mass and drag imbalance which will cause the rocket to turn over. I suspect having the antenna sticking out to the side is having a similar, albeit smaller effect too."},{"CreatedByName":"Arran","CreatedById":64656,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T15:21:58Z","Content":"Maybe its the angle of the screenshot, or my eyes taking the ..... on me, but it seems to me on that picture the fins are off-centre too, what could result in a off-balance creating a spin.\n\nAlso SRB\u0027s directly attached to a other SRB sometimes causes them not beeing perfectly aligned deadcentre, and can create also a spin.\n\nFrom what i can tell of that screenshot its one of those two things that causing the biggest effect, combined with the Antenna sticking out and the unbalance of the paracute location, and all these in a combination can result in a disasterous spin."},{"CreatedByName":"daniel1234","CreatedById":143642,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T15:51:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E combined with the Antenna sticking out and the unbalance of the paracute location, and all these in a combination can result in a disasterous spin.\n\nIs there a recommended location to stick an antenna to stop it causing drag problems?"},{"CreatedByName":"ghpstage","CreatedById":129622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T16:20:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there a recommended location to stick an antenna to stop it causing drag problems?\n\nYou ideally want it inline with centremass, so on top of the parachute on the pod is one good location, or you could place them in one of the new service bays."},{"CreatedByName":"PetrGasparik","CreatedById":143649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T16:33:33Z","Content":"Thank you for al your quotes!\n\nI try my best to stick to them.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hi PetrGasparik, I suggest swapping the radial parachute that you have on your capsule for a normal parachute, the same as you have on our boosters.\n\u003E The weight of that parachute can be enough to make the rocket want to fall over.\n\u003E \n\u003E I would also add more fins to the base to you have some in two directions, so they form an X\n\nI always had parachute on top, but now in 1.0.2 I once (and only once) reached over 25km and it was chopped off my heat, so I switched to this. \n\nDoes anyone has similar probem with tip parachute MK-16?"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T16:35:22Z","Content":"You have enough science to unlock the heavier rockets which would allow you to build this to reach low orbit and return.\n\n![M9z0X59.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/M9z0X59.jpg)\n\nThe RT-10 are now badly under performing to be of much use.

Get your point of thrust over your point of mass which will pull the rocket up instead of pushing it up creating a more stable ascent.
