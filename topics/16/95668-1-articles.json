While the specific rocket seemed impractical (I\u0027d rather add two more SRBs in explosive staging than deal with the recovery issues for something that far away. Something tells me it won\u0027t cover the ~650 root cost of the SRBs), it shows at least some way to build a \u0022space-X style\u0022 launcher in .90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I have concentrated on single-liquid-stage\u002Bexpendable SRBs to orbit. So to get to the Mun or something, I would dump a bunch of SRBs in the sea, get to orbit, de-orbit my booster as close to KSC as I can (hopefully around 95% recovery without mechjeb), and then go on my mission with the lander (which I might not be patient enough to bother aiming at KSC from the Mun). SSTOs might be more glamerous, but simply aren\u0027t going to go anywhere until you remove the weight restrictions on the launchpad (full disclosure: I have. My \u0022bring more fuel for those stupid surveys\u0022 rocket just wouldn\u0027t quite work with the weight limitations, and I pretty much put every root into the buyout\u002Brocket).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter watching the video (and failing to find the probe/debris with my copying attempts), I have to wonder how you go about \u0022stay within 2.5km\u0022 are. Is a late gravity turn (to keep the booster closer to KSC) an option (I\u0027m assuming you have to gravity turn with it to avoid a quick 2.5km distance). It looks like you *have* to take your booster above some [unclear, 30km?] altitude to keep theb parachutes from popping on the way up. After a few tries (mostly trying to make a medium lifter with a single asparagased pair of boosters) I checked the video again and the first [liquid] stage has 3000m/s deltaV (including 500m/s from the expendable SRB). This seems a long way from orbit (another 50% isn\u0027t \u0022just a little more deltaV) but going to land a long haul from KSC (reason I want multiplayer: to hand this over to mechjeb with a small fraction of fuel and tell it to land on KSC. See how far it can go without a payload).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how efficient is it to dump a liquid stage a significant fraction of Kerbin\u0027s radius away from KSC? A rough guess of my recovery seems to be slightly more than half the cost of my rocket (the other half being SRBs and the lander). Anyone know how much you recover from the first stage when doing this? Scott Manley cut out the recovery screen, and it seems to be the critical number in determing if you want to recover as much as possible from a big booster or split the costs and lose a big chunk of a smaller booster (don\u0027t forget, a big low-tech and weight limited booster will have way too many SRBs hanging off of it. You don\u0027t get anything back from them).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-05T22:41:28Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2015 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wumpus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclick answered.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr-Drunk","CreatedById":132802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T21:55:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I did enjoy watching Scott\u0027s video as usual I deffinitly wouldn\u0027t do it that way. For one you can design rockets to be even cheaper then his that perform most contracts just fine without worrying over recovery costs. My satellite launcher for example only costs about 10k or so and with contracts paying around 100k for around kerbin orbits money isn\u0027t an issue. Also.. There\u0027s a mod I believe called \u0022Stage Recovery\u0022 or something (someone correct me on that if I\u0027m wrong) but that allows you to recover stages as long as they had enough parachutes attached to the stage to prevent them from blowing up. The mod calculates this and basically gives you the money back as soon as the part unloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a more technical note in regards to your question though... I believe the recovery rate at that distance from KSC would be around 85% of the cost of the tank minus the fuel. That can ofcourse be increased a bit with the administration office strategy but this also makes launches cost a bit more so yea.. But looking at where he decoupled the tank and it\u0027s last known trajectory it really didn\u0027t go that far away from KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick edit on the post here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThought I\u0027d put up the link to that mod I mentioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-0-90-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-3-%2812-22-14%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-0-90-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-3-%2812-22-14%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-05T00:31:38Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2015 12:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dr-Drunk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T23:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESSTOs are easy - although LethalDose may be along to make it harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe T30 and Mk1 command pod, given 10-12 fuel tanks (tech-0) will be able to SSTO and land back at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to the moon there\u0027s really no point in taking all that stuff with you so, yes, you want to stage.
