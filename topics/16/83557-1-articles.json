When struts are disconnected, the first point of them (the start/from point) stays around after the strut vanishes. If they start on the launcher, the payload will be left clean of strut anchor blocks (but after next reload, not instantly, if memory serves).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eataTREE","CreatedById":116601,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T19:03:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStruts are the greatest invention of Kerbalkind.
