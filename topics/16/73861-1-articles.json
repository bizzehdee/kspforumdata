You can also grab the white part of your maneuver node (the white ring part) and drag it around your orbit. That can help fine tune the closest approach. Hover your mouse over the intercept tags and they will show you how close you\u0027ll get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you get close to the rendezvous, burn a little like you have been to get the markers lined up. However, don\u0027t burn off all the speed right away. Let the rendezvous happen until you get a few km apart. As I approach, I usually try to leave my speed up at around 50 m/s at 1km. That should allow enough time to slow down as you approach, but it will depend on your thrust to weight ratio. Always burn to keep the markers aligned, but make sure you don\u0027t run over the target. I\u0027m not usually down to 10 m/s until I get around 100-200 m from the target, but it depends on how much practice you\u0027ve had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also drop another maneuver node right where the rendezvous will happen and pull on the prograde marker until the orbits are pretty closely aligned. That will give you a countdown to the closest approach and give you some idea of how much you\u0027ll have to burn. However, don\u0027t wait until you hit this node to start the burn or the target will zip past you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-02T01:19:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2014 01:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T05:03:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E2 points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1 the target doesn\u0027t fly along a straight path and neither do you. you each fly a circle from apogee to descending node to perigee to ascending node and the circles add together.
