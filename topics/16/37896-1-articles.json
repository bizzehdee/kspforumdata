If you want it to move forward in relation to the other two, then lower the orbit slightly, wait a couple rotations, Then raise the orbit back up to geostat altitude. Conversely, if you want it to move backwards, in relation, to the other two, raise it\u0027s orbit slightly for a couple rotations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AnalogAddict","CreatedById":59758,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T15:38:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d be really convenient to have some Engineer mod or such so you can easily view your period. You want it to be 6 hours, with 2 hours between you and the next craft since you have three total, therefore if you are 15 minutes off, then change your period by 15 minutes for one orbit, or 7.5 minutes for 2 orbits, 5 for 3, etc... how much delta-v do you have for corrections and how far off are your other satellites I suppose is where this factor comes into play. I find it easy to adjust if I establish one satellite in good GeoSync orbit then use that data to modify the others to match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI presume your satellites are already in a good orbit with 6hr periods, so basically the adjustment of time is for their position relative to your other satellites and only for the number of orbits you determine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I\u0027ve also drawn a circle with lines at each 120 degree interval to hold to my monitor and make sure my satellites are in order.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"draeath","CreatedById":25709,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T17:24:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo calculate your period, you just need to figure out the circumference of your orbit and then use your orbital velocity \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you are in a nearly (or perfectly, ideally) circular orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC = 2 * \u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC * r\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC = pi (just in case it won\u0027t render for you)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Er = radius (apoapsis \u002B periapsis / 2, to take care of any minor skew)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have the circumference, divide it by your orbital velocity.

A 6 hour rotational period means 1 degree every minute. So if you need to move a geostationary satellite 5 degrees forward (i.e. West) burn at apokee to bring your orbital period up by five minutes, and you\u0027ll be right in position the next time you get back there, then burn the other way to recircularize. If you need to save fuel and need to make a big change, set up so you cover the distance in several orbits, that minimizes the delta-v. So if you need to move back 30 degrees, change your period by 10 minutes, wait three orbits, then change back. You\u0027ll use a third of the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
