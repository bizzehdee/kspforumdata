The key thing is not necessarily to have big wings (although that does help) but to land on a flat place, and most importantly, kill a ton of speed before you land. On Duna, retrorockets may be a better way to do this. Check out the link in my sig for more info.\n\n--Edit--\n\nUse that dropping out of the sky as an advantage, find a hill that slopes downwards not too steep and flare right before you land, the downwards slope had the effect of slowing down your vertical speed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T14:52:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by peachoftree**"}]}
