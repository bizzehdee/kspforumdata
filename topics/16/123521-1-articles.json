I installed mostly for fuel tank size tweaking, but soon i realized that i can for example, downsize a nuclear engine. It will have less trhust, less weight, but retains its ISP. The TWR stays the same, but i can easily get around the fact that the 3 tons it weighs make it unviable for smaller craft. I have also used it to make 2.5m SRBs, upscaling a 1,25m SRB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think? am i cheating?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T00:58:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere we go again.
