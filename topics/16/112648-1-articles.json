Sometimes I left-click on a maneuver to edit it and it gives me the delete options instead. Other times I right-click and it will only give me the edit options, so I have to drag the maneuver off of the orbit to delete it. (This is less of a problem, but still annoying.) I checked my mouse settings, and nothing seems to be off. Also, left and right-clicking work as they should in every other program and game. \n\nHas anyone else encountered left and right-clicking difficulties or had trouble switching between edit and delete options for maneuvers? Or, could anyone give me more detail on how to edit and delete nodes? Please and thank you."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T08:17:03Z","Content":"right-click *expanded* node switches between the two modes of 3-axis adjustment and delete/-1period/\u002B1period buttons.\n\nAlso, if you want to delete the first maneuver node, you can click the x on the deltaV display on the right of nav ball."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T22:40:15Z","Content":"Install Precise Node mod, use it to edit/delete/whatever maneuver nodes.
