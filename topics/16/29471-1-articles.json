You could also try disabling motors and locking the steering from rear/front wheels. 4 wheels driving is a bit overkill for most places but can come handy in extreme slopes. One thing I\u0027ve also done is apply some downward thrust by adding an ion engine on the roof. It really helps especially on low gravity world like Minmus and also makes high speed rides on Mun a bit more safe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blipser","CreatedById":67923,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T10:48:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActivating docking mode (the little Easter-egg in the bottom left) will stop any torque acting on it like it does when you fly so your only controlling the rover wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panzerbeard","CreatedById":66380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T10:56:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, as people have said, in normal staging mode, WASD also controls your rotational torque in addition to your wheels. Most people suggest using docking mode, which disables the torque, but I actually prefer to rebind it to IJKL, that way if I suddenly go into a big flip I can use WASD to right myself so I land correctly; as long as you land on your wheels and they don\u0027t actually fall off, you should be ok, since your Kerbal can fix them on EVA\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
