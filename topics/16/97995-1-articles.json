If I want to burn prograde it burns retrograde. Its the opposite for every other node also. I did a node to match inclination of Minmus and lining up on the maneuver node it starts ADDING velocity instead of subtracting it. Whats going on???

If it decides to do damage, it will do damage to itself.
