I have a few questions if you don\u0027t mind helping me out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I have done some research on editing the textures and land masses on Kerbin but I\u0027m unsure of a couple of things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I use a gray scale map that I exported from Simcity 4 and use it for Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can use the map from SC4 how hard is it to overlay the pictures of my cities from SC4 on Kerbin? I know it won\u0027t look all that great but I would prefer to see something other than green grass. Plus I have pretty much created my own universe and it would be cool to incorporate it into this awesome game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I saw a MOD on here the adds city lights to Kerbin so it looks like lit up cities on the night side. If I download that can I \u0022paint\u0022 where I want the lights to be or is does it just put lights somewhere random?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Let\u0027s say I create an airplane that I want to test or something. Do I have to take off from KSC or can I place the plane anywhere and fly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Can I rename plantets easily?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Can I remove planets easily? I want to remove the second moon around Kerbin. No real reason but it bothers me lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sorry if these questions are foolish but I am still learning.

The mod is gorgeous and professional-quality.
