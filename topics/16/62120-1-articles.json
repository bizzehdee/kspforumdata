I\u0027ve noticed large increases to requisite dV after leaving planetary SOI, a function i assume of the oberth effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo heres my question. Lets say I leave vall orbit and slingshot off tylo for a nice kick to high jool orbit. Now I wait. and wait, and wait, and pop heres the return window. Unfortunately, as luck would have it, I\u0027ve ended up 50 days from the correct point in orbit for an ideal ejection angle. Last time this happened, I overbuilt the mission so I had 4k dV I was returning with. This time its going to be a nail biter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does one really want to do in this situation? Go ahead and go solar orbit and then hohmann down to kerbin? Set up a return from the complete wrong side of the orbit? I\u0027ve heard of people parking beyond pol for cheap returns, but I imagine this happening every time.

When you cross Kerbin\u0027s orbit, burn pro- or retrograde to get a Kerbin encounter after one orbit (or a few orbits later, if you need to wait to bring it around). This maneuver can be done at any time and is only more expensive than a direct transfer by the adjustment you need to do to get intercept, which can be very little if you have the patience to wait several orbits. Because Jool\u0027s orbital period is so long compared to Kerbin\u0027s (about 12x longer), you should be able to get the intercept in just one or two orbits with only a small adjustment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut a gravity assist could get you lined up to return at an actual transfer window and that will be faster in most cases. If you can do that, I would recommend it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thiosk","CreatedById":81242,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T19:49:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was the method I stumbled upon quite by accident.
