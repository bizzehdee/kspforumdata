But that isn\u0027t a mathematical way of doing it, so I can\u0027t translate that into getting to Duna or any other planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I need someone to tell me in very, very simple terms how to get to another planet. I need to know what bits of the navball to look at, and what my heading is (and what the heading even measures itself up against), and some way to know when Kerbin\u0027s position is appropriate for the manouevre. If there is any maths involved (which I\u0027m sure there is) then I need someone to explain it to me extremely simply, because I\u0027m a foolish Kerbal who can\u0027t do numbers. For instance, I have no idea what any of the letters stand for in equations. I studied physics at GCSE, but that\u0027s it. End of knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I put too much in posts.
