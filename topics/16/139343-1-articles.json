I noticed that it became a lot harder to land vehicles but it didn\u0027t really start to cause problems until I tried going into a low orbit and reentering into the atmosphere. I figured it wouldn\u0027t be much different from vanilla, so I tried coming in at about a 30,000m\u00A0periapsis and turned my nose retrograde so my heatshield would protect my capsule, but I wasn\u0027t slowing down at all and my apoapsis wasn\u0027t dropping. I reverted to launch and tried again with a periapsis of about 17000m, but I still have the same problem. I\u0027ve tried to find an answer, but most reentry problems seem to come from SSTO spaceplanes, and all I\u0027m trying to land is a capsule with a heatshield and a couple parachutes attached. Am I doing something wrong or is something borked?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nFrhZZ0.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nFrhZZ0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a picture showing my reentry angle and the fact that even after burning my entire heatshield my apoapsis is still about 98,700m. I\u0027ve also tried pointing the nose toward the planet during reentry but this is the only angle that doesn\u0027t result in overheating and explosions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the full list of installed mods:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP: 1.1.2 (Win64) - Unity: 5.2.4f1 - OS: Windows 10 \u00A0(10.0.0) 64bit\u003Cbr\u003E\nFilter Extensions - 2.5.2\u003Cbr\u003E\nToolbar - 1.7.12\u003Cbr\u003E\nCommunity Resource Pack - 0.5.1.1\u003Cbr\u003E\nCrowd Sourced Science - 3.0.2\u003Cbr\u003E\nFerram Aerospace Research - 0.15.6.3\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbal Attachment System - 0.5.7\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbal Engineer Redux - 1.1.1\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbal Inventory System - 1.2.9\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP-AVC Plugin - 1.1.6.1\u003Cbr\u003E\nKWRocketryRedux - 3.0.4\u003Cbr\u003E\nModularFlightIntegrator - 1.1.2\u003Cbr\u003E\nRCS Sounds - 5.0\u003Cbr\u003E\nTweakScale - 2.2.10\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP Interstellar Extended - 1.8.15\u003Cbr\u003E\nMinAmbience\u003Cbr\u003E\nMakeItSmall\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-08T22:25:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2016 10:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JokingJames2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T23:28:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s almost certainly caused by some sort of mod conflict or bad mod install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy recommendation would be to nuke the entire KSP directory, and then start installing mods (manually, don\u0027t use CKAN) one by one, starting with FAR and making sure that it always works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T05:27:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have the wrong version of Modular Flight Integrator installed.
