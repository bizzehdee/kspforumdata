And if not, usefull tips you guys use? For now I\u0027ve a extra install for testing with everything on it\u0027s lowest so it runs quite fast, but still, if you could reload just a single or few files a time, it would save so much time \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
