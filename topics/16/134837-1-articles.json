For example, turning a thermometer on to display its temperature in the rightclick menu will cause it to consume a small amount of Ec.

It consumes 3 electricity per minute. That is 0.05 electricity per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach single OX-STAT - if directly facing the sun - will produce about one twenty-fifth of its nominal power out at Jool. That means about 0.015 electricity per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you can only ever keep a single panel facing directly sunwards, you will necessarily be losing 0.035 electricity per second. No other way about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way to save that ship is to shut off one battery, transfer the maximum possible charge to it, and only re-enable it just before firing your engines (which will produce more than enough electricity to power all your systems).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T16:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess I should have chosen my parts more carefully. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Still, I think I can get it to Tylo safely.
