In either case, you cannot just point in the general direction of your target, thrust on full, and hope for the best. You need to wait for your window of opportunity to come up before you start if you expect to make it with a minimum of fuel. Starting with bad timing will expend literally tons of fuel just trying to make the right corrections. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case rendezvous with an object in equatorial low-Kerbin orbit (which is probably where you will do most of your rendezvous and get the most practice at rendezvous in general) you want to wait to launch until the target is passing above the Kerbal Space Center. Likewise, make sure your gravity turn is in the direction the target is orbiting so that you do not end up orbiting the opposite direction (which is a huge pain to change once you are in it.) If you can start from an orbit and position close to the orbit and position of your target, rendezvous becomes much easier to manage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same goes for parking an interplanetary transition module around a target planet and recovering a lander. Be sure to leave the transition module in a good orbit (preferably equatorial) and put the lander down somewhere that the orbit passes approximately above it. Then wait for the right window to come along before blasting off the lander to return to the transition module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther, this practice will serve you well. Taking from my own experience, I have never been able to get to Duna in a way that leaves me enough fuel to get completely back to Kerbin. I always end up stuck in a high-Kerbin orbit. I do still recover the Duna craft, but I need to send a refueling drone out to rendezvous with the parked Duna craft to give it just enough juice to bring its orbit within Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. If I could not do that rendezvous, I would have lost all Kerbals and plenty of valuable scientific data from that mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
