These discs seem to have only 2 dimensions, they are circular, seem to be of metal (no colors) and if one tries to use the ship in any\u00A0 way strange things may happen. One ship desintegrated into several parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is not reproducable - it simply sometimes happens and If one restarts the game everything is ok again, if one could control oneself and has not touched/done something with that ship. I had it in both ver. 1.2.2 and\u00A0 1.3.1 about 4-5 times in the 8 month since I play KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs that a known problem ?
