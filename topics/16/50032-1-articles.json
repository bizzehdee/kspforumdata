After landing on the Mun and Minmus, I went to Duna, Eve, Jool and Dres. But I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m doing everything right. The way I go to Duna now is by waiting for the correct phase angle (somewhere between 40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA and 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA). So, I launch a ship into Kerbin orbit, time warp until I get the right phase angle and shoot it in a trajectory to Kerbin escape. From there I can plot my voyage to Duna...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy questions is: is there another more efficient (quick) way of doing this without waiting for the right angle? Or am doing everything right and do I HAVE to wait and time warp each time for the right phase angle in order to go to another planet? Is there a way I can launch a rocket to Duna without waiting forever or by using time warp?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T11:30:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the farther away you are from the \u0027perfect\u0027 angle, the more dV (and therefore, fuel) you need to get where you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T11:31:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMOAR BOOSTAHS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, if you can built a ship powerful enough to get an encounter, you can start whenever you want - it is just not very efficient and maybe more difficult when it comes to designing the craft - also the voyage may take much much longer, hence again lots of time warping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T11:33:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe phase angle is needed if you want to do a hohmann transfer, since if your transfer orbit exactly touches the destination orbit, theres only one time you can launch and have the target planet be there when you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you are willing to burn more deltaV, you can launch anytime.

You also don\u0027t want to wait around in *high* orbit, because your burn will be less efficient if you do it in high orbit. But if you\u0027re in low orbit you can only warp at 50x! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasy solution follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter putting your interplanetary ship in low orbit, go to the VAB, grab a probe (don\u0027t bother making a rocket), and launch it. Now you go to maximum warp while sitting on the pad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen things look good, you don\u0027t have to go all the way to the tracking station to switch vessels either. Just go into map view and click on your main ship. You will be presented with the option to \u0022switch to\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf things still aren\u0027t quite right, just switch back to the probe on the pad and warp some more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, just some extra bonus info for you on why we wait for launch windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re going interplanetary, then you no doubt already know how orbits basically work. To go higher, thrust prograde, to go lower, thrust retrograde. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, so, now think about how the planet Kerbin is moving around the Sun. The direction of Kerbin\u0027s orbit is \u0022prograde\u0022. You therefore want to be accelerating in this direction in order to raise the apopasis on the other side of the sun to intersect with Duna. Clearly, this is going to require specific timing, just like intercepting with another ship in orbit around Kerbin requires specific timing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, don\u0027t go yet! There\u0027s slightly more to know about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you burn your engines in Kerbin orbit, Kerbin\u0027s gravity is going to bend your trajectory. But you want to thrust prograde relative to your *solar* orbit! How can we do this if kerbin keeps changing which way is forward?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the trick is this: What we want is for our *\u003Cem\u003EKerbin escape trajectory\u003C/em\u003E* to be parallel with the orbit of Kerbin. In order to do this you actually take advantage of Kerbin\u0027s gravity, and start firing your engines when you are about 150 degrees (for duna) away from prograde. IE, you fire your engines about 30 degrees after passing the terminator and entering the night side of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same is true to go to any \u0022higher\u0022 planets, but since they are, of course, further away, the angles will vary slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-22T12:08:54Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2013 12:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T12:08:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.
