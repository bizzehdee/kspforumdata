But not quite. But what is happening now, is puzzling me to no end. \n\nTake one spaceplane. Load it up with 36 tonnes of ballast fuel tank to simulate heavy cargo. Won\u0027t quite make it. No sweat, I won\u0027t often be launching loads that heavy anyway. Let\u0027s be generous, I had to use slightly less than one third of the orange tank\u0027s fuel supply to circularise at 75km. So, if I take an 18 tonne tank, it should get up there no problem right?\n\nWell, erm... no... Despite me dropping 18 tonnes of cargo... this thing flies almost the same?! I don\u0027t get this. Sure, the orange tank flight was one of my better flights, and I\u0027m still learning on how to exactly put spaceplanes in orbit on the piloting bit, but still, that margin should be caught easily with EIGHTEEN tonnes of cargo weight dropped. I would have thought that with the cargo reduction, I\u0027d be putting it up there, and then merrily flying back. I\u0027ve been tweaking this thing for hours, and while there definitely are differences in behaviour, the differences maybe amount to a 200-400 m/s difference in dV. That\u0027s not what you would expect of a 15% weight reduction \u003C.\u003C\n\nClearly I\u0027m missing something, any Spaceplane guru\u0027s here with brilliant ideas on how to make this thing haul it\u0027s cargo up there? I would like it to be able to take at least 18 tonnes up, and get back down while in powered flight. It\u0027s \u0027almost there\u0027 but that almost bit is a brain-cracker.\n\n((note, CoL is a little bit behind the CoM, almost touching it)\n\n![4KHxcCh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4KHxcCh.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T15:28:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 03:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Merandix**"},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T12:44:27Z","Content":"Hmmm... it looks like you should have plenty of thrust.

I\u0027d especially like to know when you swap over to rocket mode.\n\nAlso can you describe exactly what you mean by not being \u0022quite able to make it\u0022? Are you getting suborbital?

Holy crap that thing gets off planet quick... faster than most rockets \u003C.\u003C I believe I had circularised in under 4 minutes. Has plenty of manoeuvring fuel left. Not a lot, but enough to get from 75 to 150 km circular orbit, and back, plus a powered landing. That\u0027s the sort of difference you expect from an 18 tonne weight difference. Though admittedly, going from 75 km to 150 and back was about 300 dV... so I may be underestimating the difference 300 dV makes. So that answers part of my question... \n\n@Blu\\_C\n\nI usually have to grab the fuel from the cargo-tank to finish circularisation. Though admittedly with 36 tonnes it was true suborbital before I grabbed the fuel from the orange can to get there, and ended up with 2/3rds of said fuel left... Which obviously does not take into account that I would otherwise also need to get back to kerbin ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I honestly think I\u0027ve been underestimating the difference a rather small dV number makes.\n\nNow, for part two of the question, can this thing ferry the intended 18 tonnes up? Or do I need a full redesign?"},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T13:16:24Z","Content":"I\u0027d have to fly it myself to be sure, but I came up with several ideas:\n\n1) You are over-thrusting while under a lighter load. I sort of doubt this is the problem, though, as under the new aerodynamic model it is much less significant than it used to be.\n\n2) With those heavier loads you have a TWR of around 1.5, which is what I tend to build my rockets with. In that case the effective payload of your space plane is probably going to be similar to that of a rocket (you know, 90% of the mass needs to be lost on the way up). I\u0027m going to guess that the plane as a whole weighs something on the order of 80 tonnes with no payload (judging by the screenshot). How much of that is fuel? Any weight you can cut from the craft\u0027s total weight will probably help you a ton in the long run. I might even go so far as to try and take smaller wings (you will be MUCH lighter when landing so it may be ok). If necessary any weight savings can maybe even be put into fuel.\n\n3) It may be a fundamental flaw with the design. I don\u0027t SEE anything wrong, but I tend to favor smaller space planes using the MK2 parts, so this is a bit outside my usual scheme. If that happens to be the case I might recommend taking more RAPIERS and fuel with the base craft, maybe even pushing the TWR up as high to a maximum of 2.5 with sufficient deltaV to reach orbit and then some."},{"CreatedByName":"Merandix","CreatedById":135352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T15:28:08Z","Content":"I simply want too much I guess.

You\u0027ve got an eighteen tonne payload in your screenie - from that I gather the unloaded weight of the plane is around eighty tonnes, right? In old FAR, I\u0027d have planned for a payload fraction of 15% (about the same you\u0027d see from the SR-71 or Concorde), so for eighteen tonne payload, I\u0027d have planned to build a 18/0.15 = **120 tonne** plane. Then with RAPIERs for engines, I\u0027d have planned for 9.5 tonnes per RAPIER and round up - 13 RAPIERs. Lastly I\u0027d have planned for 40 units of Oxidizer and an **equal** amount of Liquid Fuel per tonne - 120 tonnes \\* 40 = 4800 units. I\u0027d have then built a main fuselage designed to handle the payload, distributed the fuel in a \u0022fuel fuselage\u0022 along the sides, and then used a bunch of equations to try and guess a \u0022best fit\u0022 wing geometry that would give me low wing loading and a moderate aspect ratio - the details of that aren\u0027t terribly important.\n\nFor the orange tank - double all those numbers...\n\nWith this design, since your plane is eighty tonnes in the SPH, I\u0027d expect it to lift not much more than twelve tonnes (80 \\* 0.15 = 12) of payload. I\u0027m guessing you\u0027ve got an excess of thrust leading to excess drag at altitude, and not enough fuel to lift the kinds of payloads you want to lift with the plane.\n\nCaveat: In all my FAR testing, I never got a plane into orbit with a payload of more than six tonnes, though I was in the initial stages of planning to lift an orange tank to orbit immediately prior to the 1.0 release. So take my advice with a grain of salt.\n\nI did, however, get an orange tank to orbit intact with the old stock aero...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![shTk6cq.png](http://i.imgur.com/shTk6cq.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T16:12:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 04:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Merandix","CreatedById":135352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T16:39:55Z","Content":"Yeah, this was the bit where have to get used to the new aero... However, the old aero kind of brutally said \u0027no\u0027 if you went too heavy on the load, taking off too heavy = fireball at the end of runway. So it sort of surprises me that it still takes off with 36 tonnes in there no problem ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nLast variant like this in 0.90 put 27 tonnes into orbit with less fuel, but would hardly get off the ground with 36 tonnes in it. This one is, as you say, is more fit to carry 12 tonnes max into orbit... but gets 36 tonnes of payload off the ground (and in a suborbital flight path) no problem (just not in an orbit).That\u0027s where the confusion was coming from. Because if it NEARLY makes it to the intended altitude, circularising shouldn\u0027t be that big of an issue, right? Well, that was where my assumption went haywire. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAnyway, to answer your questions: Takeoff speed is in the 90-120 m/s range, about halfway down the runway. But I\u0027m generally quite gentle on pulling up, she\u0027ll likely fly earlier if I push her. RAPIERS switch over to closed cycle at about 950-1120 m/s and between 23-25 km in altitude. My piloting is a major factor in how well it performs.\n\nTo be brutally honest, I usually just sort of eyeball it and then start tweaking it till it works ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:12:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E To be brutally honest, I usually just sort of eyeball it and then start tweaking it till it works ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nPerfectly viable way to play the game.

I would think that you\u0027d want to be going higher and faster before switching over to closed cycle, though; don\u0027t know if the new stock will let RAPIERs get going faster or not.\n\nAnyways, 950-1120 m/s at switchover gives you a requirement of somewhere around ~1250-1450 m/s of delta-V to make it into space. Your plane is a rocket at that point, so Tsiolkovsky will be able to tell you how much fuel you need once you\u0027re up at that point. Long and the short of it - your plane needs more gas, IMHO."}]}
