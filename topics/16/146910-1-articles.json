I\u0027m playing on computer and I\u0027m trying to build different things to send to my bases on different celestial bodies. One of them is a battery pack, as science costs a lot of electricity to be sent. This battery pack needs to be a rover, so I\u0027m using a Probo QBE with some struts around and some docking prts and, well, here a \u00A0screenshot of it without the wheels yet and missing a few things, just dev time...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qVXuu.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://puu.sh/qVXuu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will attach to the docking ports I have on my different bases. Well, as soon as they reach the planets that is... I just can\u0027t save that as a subassembly to add it to my launchers... Why? It keeps telling me: \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe selected part is not attachable\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did understand that it is actually the commandpart that is not attachable, but the entire thing is though. And to save the whole as an assembly, I need to drag it selecting the probo, but the probo has no attachement slot left, so, what, how do I do that???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, double post, I know... But I just found out that I should start building my subassemblies with an attachable part. So I restarted using the top docking port as first part, meaning the parent so I could drag the whole assembly by it..... Well, I guess this is learning uh....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-01T06:47:14Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2016 06:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Psychokiller1888\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-01T07:18:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi!
