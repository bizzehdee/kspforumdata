Going out really far is often the second-best option. \u00A0But since just getting out to Minmus costs 900\u002B m/s, even if the plane change ends up effectively free, you\u0027re still better off just launching into the inclined orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Now I understand. \u00A0Disregard below unless you\u0027re interested in going to Minmus..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, assuming you\u0027re in an equatorial Kerbin orbit, how best to match planes with Minmus? \u00A0Ideally you want to do this at the same time you do your ejection burn. \u00A0But if this only works if your ejection point is at the same place as your ascending or descending node with respect to Minmus (since that\u0027s the only time you\u0027re IN the same plane as Minmus, that\u0027s the only time you can match completely). \u00A0Sadly, that doesn\u0027t happen too often - just twice per orbital period of Minmus. \u00A0Failing that, you\u0027re right, it works pretty well to just set a node about halfway and align your plane there. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*You can also combine the two approaches by doing some normal/antinormal burn during your ejection, to get the plane closer to correct, then finish off later. \u00A0The closer you are to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E you are, the closer you can get to a zero inclination. \u00A0I find the best way to tell whether it\u0027s as close as possible is: you want the new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E to be equidistant\u00A0from your maneuver node. \u00A0This is not a big savings for Minmus, but can be a useful trick for going interplanetary. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-08T03:39:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2017 03:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Aegolius13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-08T13:49:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s what I figured.

To expand to the general case: For launches where the launch site might not be equatorial, you must launch when the site is directly underneath the desired trajectory, whether that is under a node or not. This is handy to know for Apollo-style missions where you want to launch to a rendezvous with a craft in an inclined orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
