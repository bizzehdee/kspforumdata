But, things are difficult since this is my first flight and I want a decent comm network to get my unmanned working everywhere on the Kerbin system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I watched Scott Manley making a 3-sat launcher with a 120\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0-spaced constellation of sats on geostationary orbit. And I reproduced his craft with my own GeoSat satellites (thanks Subassembly for that). 5600 m/s of dV buget, my KSP dV chart tells me 5250 m/s for a geostationary orbit, since I want to go 2/3 of it, it\u0027s more than enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut (there is always one); because there is no other satellites, I rapidly get out of contact and can\u0027t circularise the satellites\u0027 orbits.
