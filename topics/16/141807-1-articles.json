They offer little authority in those axis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe exception is when you combine ailerons and elevators to make a elevon (common in Delta wing designs). Even then, KSP flight control often struggles to make good use of any surface granted authority over more than one axis. Better to split into two surfaces with singular axis authority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to the low pitch authority, ailerons do make excellent flaps.
