Also, you have too many intakes! One standard intake on the front of each engine nacelle will service each engine for its entire practical operating envelope. That, or even just two radial intakes in the rear, similar to what you have now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother alternative, if it fits your budget, is to add another fuselage section in the center, in front of the tailboom, thus extending the overall length of your ship, and moving the CoL a bit further back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T16:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty cool looking thing, but yes, yoru centre of lift needs to be further behind your centre of mass. Either move the wings back, or add some more mass to the front. Command pods obviously have a lot of mass, a bunch of RTG\u0027s will work too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as Hodo mentioned, be careful about where the fuel is. As the fuel drains out of the tanks they will get lighter, and the centre of mass will shift as a result. To see how it shifts you can right click on the fuel tanks in the hanger and drag the fuel level bar all the way to the left. You can then see position of the centre of mass when the tanks are empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing: It looks like you might have asymmetric drag at the back. Air intakes create a lot more drag than most parts, so you want to be sure you have good symmetry. From the picture it looks like you have two intakes on the top of the craft that are not matched by intakes on the bottom (because they\u0027d scrape on takeoff I suppose). This means you will have additional drag high on the fueselage, creating a torque that will tend to pitch the plane up. But you\u0027re only using basic jets, not turbojets, so there\u0027s no need to spam intakes. You can probably get away with just one, or you could stick circular intakes on the front of your engine tanks, or stick an engine nacelle in the middle where you have the fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, just thought of something else. I\u0027m not sure if this still applies, but as I recall, in past versions of KSP the game would decide which way control surfaces should move based on where they were mounted to the fuselage. This includes (I think) the vectoring of engines. Your engine nozzles are behind the CoM, so to pitch up you\u0027d want them to point upwards, but because they are attached to a wing, and the wing is mounted to the fuselage in *front* of the CoM, they will actually do the opposite. I haven\u0027t checked this recently so I\u0027m not sure if this behaviour still applies in more recent versions, but if it does you can just right click on the engine to disable the thrust vectoring.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-02T16:58:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2014 04:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T16:46:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYour CoL is to close to the center of the CoM, odds are your fuel is draining and causing the crafts CoM to shift forward.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.

Adding the tail assembly will shift the centre of lift backwards. So if you follow the tutorial, with the centre of lift *just* ahead of the centre of mass when you put the wings on, and then you put the tail assembly (including elevators, etc) on, the CoL will in most cases shift back behind the CoM into a correct alignment.

Typo on their part. And as I said upstream, you should not use your horizontal tail to generate lift, so even if they were shooting for what allmhuran is figuring, it would still fly funny. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep #1 is to balance your aircraft longitudinally without the wings. Ideally, the center of mass should be in the middle of the fuel tanks. Then you balance everything else around it like a balance beam. In fact... I *actually* balance beam my aircraft on the runway to ensure that this is happening. A light mass far away can counterbalance a heavier mass in- close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep #2, add the wings. Preferably slightly low with dihedral. You don\u0027t want the wings touching or you\u0027ll have no roll stability, as wings produce lift and drag where they\u0027re attached, *not* in their center. They should attach slightly- behind the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep #3, add control surfaces. It\u0027s ok to have a vertical tail (move it back to give it leverage), but you don\u0027t want horizontal tailplanes adding lift, so use ctrl surfaces for that and ignore how they move your center of lift (it\u0027s misleading).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep #4, balance- beam it again at the center of the fuel tank (both empty and full) juggling your dead weight until it\u0027s perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Voila!
