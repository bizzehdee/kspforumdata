Started a new career and discover to my chagrin that declining contracts now costs you rep. Personally, I think this is ridiculous and really breaks career mode for me. I have been one of the biggest supporters of career mode since it was introduced (despite the many flaws with it), but I now find my enthusiasm for playing it to be pretty much gone. I see no reason why I should take a reputation hit because I want to pick and choose the contracts I want. Who runs a business this way? \u0022I\u0027m sorry, but we don\u0027t like your company because you explicitly turn down contracts that you don\u0027t want to do instead of ignoring them for days/weeks/months and letting them expire.\u0022 This is a really dumb gameplay feature and I\u0027m not sure what Squad was trying to accomplish with this; you\u0027re punishing the user for wanting to play the game their way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like the tech tree, the contract system is a good idea with a very poor implementation.

No way am I doing that! You probably lost some rep after that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore seriously though, I think the idea here is to reflect that each of the contracts SHOULD be doable and that if you can\u0027t or won\u0027t do them then that reflects poorly on your reputation. It also encourages players to try completing contracts they might have otherwise just ignored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve yet to try the new system myself as I spent the last 20 hours exploring the wasteland of Boston, but when I do come back for 1.1 my guess is I\u0027ll probably still all but ignore the contract system. It was always too random for my tastes, and the difficulty level of the missions went through the roof after you make it to the Mun/Minmus. I love worrying about funds, and collecting science.. but hate being limited in what parts I use and having to deal with contracts. So, I play with the Science Funding mod that gives funds for science points gained, and topple the tech tree at the start of the game. That lets me play the perfect combo of sandbox/career/science for my personal tastes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T21:30:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, IMHO this is a bad...simply because there is a way to avoid those rep hits scot free: just wait for the contracts you don\u0027t want to expire.
