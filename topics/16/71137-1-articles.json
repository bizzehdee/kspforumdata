However (using Rockomax parts) the most I could fit on would have been 6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo instead of attaching radial decouplers to the main rocket and attaching the boosters to the decouplers (the normal way), I\u0027ve attached decouplers to the main rocket, girders to the decouplers (to get some extra spacing) and the boosters to the girders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the rocket is unstable and so I also had to use struts to connect the boosters to the main rocket to make them less wobbly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem: normally when a decoupler between strutted-together parts is fired, the struts disconnect (disappear) and the affected stage falls apart beautifully. In this case, however, the girders between the decouplers and the boosters apparently prevent KSP from noticing that the struts should disconnect, and so they stay put - they are broken apart a split second later as the booster tries to fall away, but this puts a spin on the booster and it crashes into its brother boosters, making the entire ship tear itself apart in a magnificent display of fireworks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve put hours of work into this project (3-ring Asparagus staged ship containing 32 boosters) and I\u0027d really hate to abandon it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid anyone else encounter this issue?

The game first explodes the decoupler, simulates one physics frame while struts are still in place, then removes struts. And what exactly happens with the decoupled part depends on how flexible the decoupled part is, and on the way how struts are drawn between the decoupled part and the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.23.5, part connections got a significant boost. That means you can have a lot of space between the decoupler and the place where you need to put a strut. That allows at least part of the decoupler\u0027s explosive force to be utilized in pushing the stage away from the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to get rid of struts effect completely, you need to use another set of decouplers as anchors for struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/bZHLR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I mounted 8 booster stages radially (as asparagus pairs), using girders on decouplers, and struts at various positions to keep it stable.

I haven\u0027t seen this so much in 0.23.5, but frequently with larger designs in 0.23, I would see joints break in the center stack, and it wouldn\u0027t be immediately obvious. The struts would still be there, and since I wasn\u0027t throttling back the engine anyway (until it ran out of fuel on its own), I wouldn\u0027t notice that I could no longer control current stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using gimbal-engines, you should still be able to see it wiggle when you tap the controls, even after it\u0027s spent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just wondering if a joint is breaking, but as far as the struts are concerned, it\u0027s still part of the vessel?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
