There is next to zero shudder or shake in the ship when it happens. Only the middle engine has gimbal on, and everything is symmetric. The entire structure is linked with struts in such a method as to prevent any oscillation. The tank that persistently falls off is only on one side of the ship, and falls off later in the launch, when nearing space (I\u0027ve seen when the struts break), which is odd because all the engines are turned \u0026lt;66% maximum power to prevent overheating, unlike the rather violent takeoff. It\u0027s as if the connection and all the struts for that one tank only just say \u0022I\u0027m done\u0022 and break. None of the other tanks fall off, no matter how much stress I put them under.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there\u0027s no way to fix this, it has to be in the engine, but are there any other tips and tricks to keep parts from falling off like this?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-06T21:20:41Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2013 09:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by thepackett\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrPopcup","CreatedById":75533,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T19:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis happened to me a while back in .20, I was experiencing this problem when I wanted to put a huge part of space station into orbit ( 100~ tons ) in one launch to 400 km, I was on 90% throttle all time and it kept breaking AFTER quitting from the first layer of the atmosphere, I put more struts from the lower tank to the upper one, then from the upper to the middle and did the X shape around every tank, still, problem occours after exiting, I found the fix is just lower your throttle down until you reach 1.20 TWR, TWR is how much your rocket produces thrust to lift itself , anything above 1 CAN lift it, so lower it until it barely adds speed, then after reaching 15 km or 20 km throttle up to your normal acceleration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is by far the best solution, If this didn\u0027t work with you ( also with struts and stuff like that ) then you might want to re-install the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T19:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eas you\u0027re nearing space you\u0027ve burned so much fuel (and therefore mass) that your TWR is much higher than at takeoff. press F3 at that point and see what max Gs you\u0027ve sustained. Because you\u0027re at the point in your flight when you need to have throttled back alot.
