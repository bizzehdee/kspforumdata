All have regular docking ports on the sides (all 4 tanks are identical) and senior docking ports on the ends. There is a temporary station keeping core on one end (the one with the solar panels) and a set of assembly drones randomly parked on 4 of the docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/dk2pjkzuv/Tank_Core.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Tank_Core.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you think this would be structurally sound enough to use as the basis for an interplanetary ship (I\u0027d send up nuclear engines, solar panels, crew modules and some kind of detachable lander), or is it only of use as a stationary fuel depot / space station? I don\u0027t intend to ever use it in an atmosphere, going up it needed structs to prevent those senior docking port joints from buckling under the strain of the main sail engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-01T12:13:47Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2013 12:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dave Kerbin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lumpman2","CreatedById":77718,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T21:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that considering how many docking ports there are, it could probably stay together and still carry tons of fuel to wherever, you just need a bunch of nukes.

Like lumpman2 said, you could stick some engines on the back, a cargo up front (or the other way around, if you really like), and send it off to wherever you want to go.
