I noticed that it kept driving off to the right whenever I tried to move forwards. It also wanted to tip, shake all over the place. After 3 hours of slow driving to dock and many crashes I arrived. When I couldn\u0027t dock properly due to it always going right or left essitineally pushing corner of the wheel up, I decided to switch to docking mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen all the tipping stopped, it moved perfectly. I also messed about with invert steering turning motor off on back engines and lotsof other stuff, it went all smooth when I switched to docking mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, is using docking mode for Land based wheel vehicles what your supposed to do? or is it actually also supposed to work in staging mode?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWant to know if this is a fluke or whether using all my rover designs I should use docking mode?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-30T17:39:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2013 05:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Moonfrog\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Echanging to answered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T11:27:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking mode does seem to work better, as it doesn\u0027t evoke the torque reaction you get in staging mode that tries to either steer the vehicle or turn it over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T11:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you press W to move, you\u0027re actually trying to pitch the rover.
