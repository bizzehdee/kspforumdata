Oh sure, you can drive them some, but the way that I cover most of the distance, especially on really small bodies, is to take low altitude, sub-orbital hops across the surface.

I created it for exploring low gravity worlds.

The LGRN is capable of many, many suborbital hops on small worlds like Minimus. Don\u0027t let people tell you that the NTR engine is useless for lander designs- they are just FLAT OUT wrong for worlds with low gravity, where the TWR is so much higher. The downsides of the LGRN is mainly that the center of gravity is a bit higher than the LGR\u0027s center of gravity, but that is more than made up for by the super-high delta-V which allows many suborbital hops, giving the LGRN much more exploratory potential. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LvrAx8q.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LvrAx8q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice that on all my landers, I like to have a forward-facing AI core. When controlling the rover from this forward-facing component, sub-orbital flying becomes more intuitive. For example, if I want to fly low at suborbital speeds, I just control from the forward-facing AI core and keep bumping the engines when the velocity vector dips below the horizon line. I can maintain sort-of level flight. With the forward-facing AI core, it\u0027s also easier to see which direction the rover needs to point during rolling landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some more screenshots from the LGRN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xn3rbtT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xn3rbtT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4DXEbyQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224DXEbyQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-30T22:59:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2013 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VBlackshadow","CreatedById":83540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T02:41:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketPilot573\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RocketPilot573\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou know what, the OP is probably trying to use the \u0022ruggedized wheels\u0022...
