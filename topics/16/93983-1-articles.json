I assume you can since you only need mission control upgraded, not the tracking station which allows that IIRC. Also that should show you your intersection and AN/DN nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hard part is getting close to the target. If you see intersections and target position at intersection this one is easy. Put the intersection at your apoapsis or periapsis. Burn retrograde (if the target will be in front of you at the intersection) or prograde (if it will be behind you) at that point until closest approach at intersection is close enough for final approach. This is fast orbital rendezvous for the impatient 101.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do not have intersection indicators it gets hard, you need enough delta-v and thrust, the solution is to get as close as you can (can be even 50km). I recommend going from a lower orbit and \u0022catching up\u0022 to the Kerbal. See the pink marker showing the target\u0027s prograde vector? Burn so that your prograde and the kerbals overlap, not too much. When it does it means you will intersect the kerbal\u0027s orbit eventually, oat a point which should be closer to the target than your current distance. Depending on the distance/impatience burn prograde some more if you are far away to catch up a bit faster. Just don\u0027t burn too much or you\u0027ll find yourself needing to seriously decelerate or on a suborbital trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou wait until you get closest again and repeat.
