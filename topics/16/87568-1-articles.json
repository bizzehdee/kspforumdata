Generally, with discrete stages, I follow the rule of thumb of having a TWR of 1.3 at ignition, as suggested by several people, including Ferram, which works reasonably well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I\u0027m really interested in optimizing launch parameters. As the mass of the rocket decreases with fuel consumption, and specific impulse increases with altitude*, TWR rises. I\u0027m wondering if I should set the limiter for the main engine to provide a TWR of 1.3 at the time the boosters have been jettisoned, and increase the thrust of the SRBs in kind to set the launch TWR?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E * of course in KSP this is only an issue with RealFuels.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T19:22:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it depends on whether your boosters are SRBs or liquid.
