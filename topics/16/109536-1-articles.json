F3 reveals the crew has been killed.\n\nI don\u0027t currently have any photos, but I\u0027ll try again and see if I can add some.\n\nEDIT: Problem seemed to have fixed itself, so marking thread as answered.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T21:05:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 09:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by emaier138**"}]}
