I know that it needs 3 RoveMax Model M1 wheels. I got the wheels to the Mun and got it next to the buggy. If I activate Construction Mode I can pick up and manipulate the wheel but I cannot get it to match up with where it needs to go and I cannot get it to attach. I have tried every combination of key strokes to try to turn it into the correct position but no luck.\u00A0It is like it cannot find an attachment point. One thing is that the rover only has one wheel so it is not level nut I don\u0027t know if that is the issue. What am I missing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have also noticed that it has two command chairs but no probe core so even if I get the wheels on I don\u0027t know if I can drive it to the navigation point. If I canpt drive it then I have to start over but I want to try attaching the wheels before I restart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-09T12:26:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat seems a weird contract; needing to fit 3 wheels?
