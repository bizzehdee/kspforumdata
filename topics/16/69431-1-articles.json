The new four-engine cluster has a relatively small difference between its performance in vacuum and its sea-level performance compared to most older engines, which will result in using less vacuum delta-V, which is probably what you\u0027re reckoning things off. By contrast the KR-2L has a very large difference in performance depending on atmospheric pressure, so if you use it as a first-stage engine (which it\u0027s not meant for, but it looks the part for many rockets) you\u0027ll use more vacuum dV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T14:28:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t noticed this myself.

Another possibility is that you\u0027re simply better at piloting the craft now. Did you have framerate issues before the update? Because if you did and if they were fixed by the new optimisation (mostly of the water) you may be performing better and the game may actually be rendering the physics more accurately. The update itself did not, however, tweak how easy it is to reach orbit (with the exception of new parts and improved parts). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheScareCake!","CreatedById":103641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T15:49:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECrap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zSJLbN9.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022zSJLbN9.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI lifted my transfer stage using my first stage, what should i do? :|\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, in 0.23 it required more dv to get into the orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T15:59:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse your second stage as your transfer stage, I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T16:00:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome parts such as battery packs, RCS ports, or lights are now massless.
