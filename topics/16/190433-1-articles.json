I.e. instead of right-clicking on a dozen different solar panels and unfolding them one by one, you can assign that to an action group and unfold all of them at once with the push of a single button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you delete a piece of debris by right-clicking on it and selecting an action in the window that pops up? So: No! You cannot create an action group to \u0022delete debris\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI deal with your problem in two ways: One is that I don\u0027t use stack separators, only decouplers or docking ports. (You can also stage the initial decoupling action of a docking port with the staging system.) That way I don\u0027t have single stack separators floating around. Sometimes this leads to KSP-style hot-staging, when a rocket engine stays attached to a decoupler and blows its exhaust onto it until said decoupler gets hot enough to blow up. The other is that I only move a vessel after separation (staiging ot undocking) when it is clear of the other vessel. Often enough this means giving it a push with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and then waiting for them to drift apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strider3","CreatedById":199830,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-17T20:14:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use stack separators because I don\u0027t want a decoupler hanging out on my parts...especially when station building...I need the part separated from both ends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s rare that a debris part hits my station while constructing it so I think the best remedy, for me, is to just go to the Tracking Station and delete the debris as it\u0027s created.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-17T20:23:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re building stations, then just use the docking ports as the separators.\u00A0 The docking port has an attach node in the editor, then you can decouple it either by staging it or by right-clicking on it and hitting decouple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
