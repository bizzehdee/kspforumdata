The only way to adjust the \u0022zero\u0022 point is through Windows calibration. But since KSP uses Unity, and Unity uses RawInput, this does not change anything in the game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis throttle setup is used in the excellent \u0022Lunar Flight\u0022 game, and proved to be efficient.
