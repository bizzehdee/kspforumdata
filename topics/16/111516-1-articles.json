Just give it some time.\n\nThis time you got lucky with a great answer in just over an hour. Motokid is correct. You\u0027ll have to rescale individually. Just keep in mind things like weight, fuel, thrust and cost not always rescale properly. Blindly rescaling does not guarantee similar behaviour."},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T00:53:02Z","Content":"IIRC you can\u0027t scale the root part, but I don\u0027t remember whether they disallowed it or if it just invoked the Kraken. So I\u0027d suggest your actual root be a probe core you offset to hide."}]}
