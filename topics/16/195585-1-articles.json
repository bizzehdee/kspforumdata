Have a question about robotics. I was playing in 1.7.3 really long time. The updated to 1.9 and now 1.10. My question is how to lock hinge. I mean, i cant do it in any ways. I am activating lock the hinge, cutting power anything. But it not stays stable (cause of this, i had to de-orbit an single launch station that launching was total retard). I want help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-13T11:22:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello and welcome to the forum\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/206193-udkwum/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022206193\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/206193-udkwum/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@udkwum\u003C/a\u003E, your question has been moved to gameplay questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"udkwum","CreatedById":206193,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-13T11:23:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223819907\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195585\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221594639331\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160462\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022James Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, James Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello and welcome to the forum\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/206193-udkwum/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022206193\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/206193-udkwum/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@udkwum\u003C/a\u003E, your question has been moved to gameplay questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nooh.

In my experience activating the locks is an issue if the game thinks that the part in question is still moving, e.g. because the whole structure is still oscillating a bit after changing configuration. In that situation you will get a message and the lock will just not set. When you want to set the locks on multiple parts, then it will usually set on some of them but not on others, that makes using the \u0022toggle lock\u0022 functionality an exercise in frustration. So what I do is to put \u0022engage lock\u0022 for all robotics parts on one action group, that way I can hit that button as often as needed until all the locks are set\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other issue is that the robotics parts are rather weak and prone to permanent deformation, even when they are locked. There is no magic bullet to solve that so you\u0027ll have to engineer around that. The best tool here are struts, autostruts and regular struts. IMHO the biggest advantage of locking a robotic part is that this will allow autostruts to traverse the robotic part. So if you place a hinge or so between two sturdy parts and then set autostrut to \u0022grantparent\u0022 on the downstream part then this will transfer a lot of the forces around the hinge and thus make the whole structure so much more sturdy. (You can also use the other types of autostruts, but they have problems of their own that are unrelated to robotic parts.) Regular struts can help you keep your craft together during launch before it has to move. I often place dedicated decouplers on my craft that then only have struts attached to them that connect to different parts of the craft. While these struts are in place the robotics parts cannot move, but once the launch is over - and thus the main stress on the craft is over - I can fire the decouplers, get rid of the struts, and allow the robotics parts to move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this answer your question(s)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
