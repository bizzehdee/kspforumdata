As mentioned, lower thrust means a longer burn time. If your boosters are giving more thrust than you need, you\u0027ll get more out of them by reducing it, just the same as if you\u0027re using liquid engines. If they\u0027re overheating, taking the thrust limiter down a bit can stop that too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, it\u0027s probably more useful on SRBs than on liquid engines, since it\u0027s the ONLY way to control the behaviour of SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T13:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can actually design a proper, efficient launch profile using just tuned SRBs. Say, for a small satellite launch:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES1: A small RT-10 at full thrust, but only half fuel quantity. It gives a lot of thrust to get you up to speed quickly, but burns out rapidly so that you don\u0027t get pushed way past terminal velocity (or into dangerous atmospheric heating if DRE is installed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES2: A big Rockomax BACC at 30% thrust and full of fuel. It provides a long-burning moderate thrust to lift you up out of the atmosphere and build most of your horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES3: A ring of several Sepratron pairs mounted around a stack decoupler.
