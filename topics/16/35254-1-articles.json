If anyone can give suggestions on how to design a rocket, or build a rocket for me that\u0027ll be great! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E (i have no mods so only stock parts if possible please)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ispnqhuzsygk0e7/Q1jpLJRtak\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/ispnqhuzsygk0e7/Q1jpLJRtak\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T12:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a look at the pictures, I\u0027d advice you to just sort out your CoM really. The ASAS and adapter in the rear are no match for the cupola in the front masswise, so I\u0027d say either remove your small RCS tanks (unless you want em for looks) and put a large RCS tank in the rear, or stick a rockomax x200-8 fuel tank before the ASAS. Both options should balance it out nicely enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for landing it, there are heaps of ways. I personally prefer having smaller engines distributed around the payload at the CoM level. Here\u0027s a picture of when I landed my Kethane Rover, you could do something similar but stick the tanks/engines onto the sides with decouplers and ditch them once you\u0027ve landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i818.photobucket.com/albums/zz102/Johnno17/Kerbal/KethaneRover_zps6cd5e4c0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KethaneRover_zps6cd5e4c0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
