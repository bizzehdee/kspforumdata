The whole thing was launched on one rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I successfully got it up into orbit bit stupid me, I kept burning and ended up ruining the orbit, and sending it away from the earth. It\u0027s only a matter of time before I lose my chance to save my kerbals! Please help me, I know nothing about docking, so it\u0027ll be hard for me to build a rocket to get out there and push it back to earth. And I forgot to mention, the space station is out of fuel.

Otherwise, docking is \u003Cem\u003Ekind\u003C/em\u003E of moot and you\u0027ll need to park your rescue ship close by and send the kerbals to safety by EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027ve said docking is kind of moot because with the last update, you can use the Claw to dock ships. Still, you\u0027ll need to transfer the kerbals by EVA unless you have a mod to do it whose name escapes me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, how long before the station leaves Kerbin\u0027s SOI? I\u0027m not sure if you can build a ship fast enough to RV with your station before it escapes Kerbin. It seems you\u0027ll have to RV with your station when the station is already in solar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: just saw the pictures. I\u0027m not sure if docking is a good idea. The docks are close to the pod so you may crash into it if you aren\u0027t careful. It can be done, though. Me thinks the Claw is a better approach.

Build it light with lots of fuel to maneuver, or perhaps build/launch more than one rescue capsule. If you can manage to save some of their EVA fuel during the retro burn, then it\u0027ll be easier to get them back to the rescue ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yes, make absolutely certain that your rescue ship has all the stuff it needs (power, solar panels, probe core, etc). Also make sure no kerbals stow away on your craft when you launch.

Simplest would be to claw it, refuel its own tank (Alt-Click the tanks in turn and you can transfer fuel between them), declaw it, and have it burn back into Kerbin orbit. However if its own fuel tank isn\u0027t big enough to do the task in one go repeated refuels may be a nuisance. An alternative would be to dock a pair of drop tanks to the station\u0027s docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tortoise","CreatedById":68002,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T01:57:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, I\u0027ve built an emergency pod.
