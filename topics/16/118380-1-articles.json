I\u0027ve got capsules in late re-entry (\u003C5000m) falling at terminal velocity trailing Prandtl-Glauert singularities, I\u0027ve got rockets going UP shrouded in plasma! Is there a config setting somewhere?"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T13:51:31Z","Content":"There is a whole new thermal system in the game that heats up parts as you move fast in an atmosphere, or get closer to the sun. It also make aerobraking ridiculous.\n\nParts heating up on the launchpad...? Are you clipping any parts? This is a strange bug.\n\nAlthough the new settings are meant to be taken into account when building, you can use the new Debug menu to alter thermal settings; Either toning them down, or just removing them. There\u0027s also the \u0022ignore max temperature\u0022 cheat which just has every part ignore their maximum thermal tolerance.\n\nThis is supposed to be worked around through engine throttling, just like in real life, but with the powers of the Debug menu, you can do anything."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T13:56:56Z","Content":"If you\u0027re just trying to get rid of the visual effects, open the settings, go to the graphics tab, then slide the Aerodynamic FX Quality slider all the way down."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T14:06:21Z","Content":"Usually either clipping or too efficient cooling causes parts to overheat for no good reason.

My launches aren\u0027t that aggressive, basically 2Gs all the way.\n\nFor the anomalous heating, on loading the launchpad, my engine is glowing red and fins at the rear register a temperature spike. There is no part clipping (possibly some clipping with the ground, Im not using clamps yet).\n\nWhat is the problem with aerobraking? I havn\u0027t tried yet, the only problem I have is on reentry, I get swathes of orange flame within seconds of entering the atmosphere, even on minimum energy entries (70kmx70km orbit, de-orbiting to 30km periapsis)."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T14:38:04Z","Content":"Yes, the aero FX slider will do that, it\u0027ll look rougher but it will contribute less to slowdown of the game.\n\nIt\u0027s possible you\u0027re running KSP with the incorrect physics values, KSP comes with a Physics.cfg in the game folder but if this is deleted it will be replaced by the game, unfortunately with older (and incorrect) values.\n\nAlso if KSP is run from a shortcut outside of the game folder it will look for the Physics.cfg where the shortcut is, you can check the shortcuts properties to see if the path to the KSP.exe is in the target box, if it is not there it needs to be added.\n\nRunning KSP on the desktop can also cause problems, due to how Windows behaves with programs that were not installed, just unzipped.\n\nIf KSP is on the desktop please copy it to C:\\Games and run the copy."},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T15:01:39Z","Content":"For the aero fx, Im not worried about slowdown, simply aesthetics, I\u0027ll try fiddling with the slider later tonight ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nDon\u0027t know anything about a physics.cfg, is it possible that a mod has replaced it? The only mod I have that seems relevant is Deadly Reentry (though I have many others installed, would a list help?).\n\nIf the game re-writes the physics.cfg incorrectly, where can I find a correct version?\n\nI run KSP from its steam install folder, and I execute via the CKAN interface."}]}
