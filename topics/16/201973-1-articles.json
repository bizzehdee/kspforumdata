I was able to get an encounter with Eve, but this one took a little longer and I had to fight with my Maneuver node a bit.\u00A0 However, I am coming in at a really goofy inclination to Gilly which is going to be nasty to correct\u00A0 if I wait until I reach Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have looked and most say to do a correction burn about halfway to the destination playing with the Normal / Anti Normal nodes to do a slight correction burn and it usually takes a relatively small amount of Delta V to correct this way.\u00A0 My encounter with Eve is in around 80 days, so I wait until day 40 or so and try to play with the Nodes, but I can\u0027t seem to correct the inclination.\u00A0 I can change it a couple of degrees, but nothing crazy.\u00A0 I can also get my Apoapsis much closer to Eve, but can\u0027t seem to correct the inclination well.\u00A0 I have looked online and have seen a few things, but nothing really specific.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anybody has anything they could offer, I would love to hear your suggestions.\u00A0 I am sure I am just doing something silly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRylant\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-25T10:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be half way, in fact usually the further away you are the less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E you need to do your correction.

Or use a moon to do similar.

The best way to reach Gilly is to park around Eve in a highly elliptic orbit, then from close to your apoapsis you aim for where Gilly will be, and you get there. your orbit is very slow at apoapsis, so you can generally make a burn with a large radial/normal component and get away with it, and it\u0027s cheaper than trying to match inclination. I can generally do it with a few hundred m/s, with an extra 400 m/s for capture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome examples here\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022laIho0c.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/laIho0c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe orbital nodes are really close to Eve, so i\u0027d have to spend a fortune to change inclination. but a slight 120 m/s burn did the trick of setting me on intercept course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225LK3mj2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/5LK3mj2.png\u0022\u003E\u00F9\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhere it\u0027s even cheaper, just 66 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YOt7j7k.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YOt7j7k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis time i even saved the components of the burn, you can see it\u0027s a complex tridimensional one\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022h4dwTXQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/h4dwTXQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here is a return trip to rejoin the mothership, again it displays the burn components. I could have made it cheaper if i waited the next orbit, but i have a life support mod and i didn\u0027t have enough food to wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, those trajectories are complicated, especially for someone who has problems with regular planetary transfers. How do you find them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSet Gilly as a target once in Eve orbit. You will see the ascending/descending nodes. You do \u003Cstrong\u003Enot \u003C/strong\u003Ewant to make a manuever there, as they are generally very close to eve and require a very expensive burn. What you want is to \u003Cstrong\u003Eintercept\u003C/strong\u003E Gilly\u0027s orbit with one of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlan your manuever node in some point high in your orbit. Doesn\u0027t matter exactly where, but it must be far from Eve. Then try to move one of your inclination nodes on top of Gilly\u0027s orbit. Try first with normal/antinormal component, you should get there. once you reahc your intercept, the game will provide a close approach marker for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, you won\u0027t have a Gilly\u0027s intercept yet. You are merely crossing its orbit. But the close approach marker will let you know when Gilly will be there. So now you have to change your flight time to make sure you also pass in that spot at the same time as Gilly. A prograde burn will make for a higher Eve apoapsis and will make you lose time, if Gilly pass behind you. A retrograde will make you arrive there faster, if you need to catch up to Gilly instead. radial burns will change where you intercept Gilly\u0027s orbit. If you can\u0027t find a good solution because Gilly is too distant, try the next orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring those manuevers, you will move around the planar nodes, and you will lose the close approach marker. Fear not! Just change your normal component until you put your planar node back where it must be, on top of Gilly\u0027s orbit, and the close approach will appear again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rylant","CreatedById":211132,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-26T20:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you both.
