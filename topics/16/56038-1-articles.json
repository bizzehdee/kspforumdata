Any rocket with a TWR of 2.000 will accelerate gradually toward terminal velocity, getting ever closer with time. Now as time goes by and your rocket goes up, the air gets thinner and terminal velocity goes up. Your TWR also goes up as you deplete fuel, but different stages on your rocket may have very different starting and ending TWR. Also, the gravity lessens a bit as you ascend, further increasing your TWR. I find it all balances pretty well if your rocket has a starting TWR of ~2.0 on every stage. ~2.5 is the highest TWR you want to launch with, anything more and you\u0027ll be wasting fuel if you don\u0027t throttle down. So if your TWR is that high, just add more fuel if you can. Now if you have a TWR of less than 2 due to packing on lots of extra fuel, you may get more total delta-v out of your rocket. But don\u0027t go less than 2 unless you have a relatively small payload size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe in-flight way to check and see how your speed relates to terminal velocity is by looking at the g-meter. If you are going exactly terminal velocity straight upward, then it will show -1G for a very brief moment immediately after you turn off your engines (I think). Now if your rocket settles just above 1G for most of the flight (after you get up to speed), you have a pretty good TWR for efficiency. If you have it showing 1.5G or higher even while you see streams of hot air shooting over your rocket, then your TWR is way too high.
