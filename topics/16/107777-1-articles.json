This becomes very time consuming so I decided to put a crew into orbit to take caire of them all.\n\nThe problem I\u0027m running into is that you have to be almost dead on with your heading to get over a survey point and I have no way of telling what my heading will end up being after I do a burn until after the burn is done and I point the ship pro-grade.\n\nWhat is the best way to setup an orbital intercept with a point (Survey point) on the ground? (Not landing, but staying in orbit so that I can complete multiple survey above xxx objectives.)"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:40:49Z","Content":"Best way I can think of, starting from an equatorial orbit, is to look at Kerbin from the top view. Find where your ship will be 90 degrees ahead of the survey point, and place a maneuver node there. Mess with normal and anti normal to get the orbit passing directly over the point, and then once you hit 180 degrees from the point, lower your periapsis to just below 70km."},{"CreatedByName":"Tontow","CreatedById":64552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:48:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E lower your periapsis to just below 70km.\n\nI Don\u0027t want to land, I need the craft to stay in orbit to do several surveys."},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:50:46Z","Content":"If you\u0027re not averse to using mechjeb\u0027s autopilots, my general \u0022quicjkand-dirty\u0022 approach was to use the Landing Guidance to attempt to land on the spot, and cancel its action after it made the plane change."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:53:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E lower your periapsis to just below 70km.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I Don\u0027t want to land, I need the craft to stay in orbit to do several surveys.\n\nYou can orbit dozens of times with your periapsis in the high 60s.
