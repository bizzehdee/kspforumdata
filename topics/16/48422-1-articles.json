I\u0027m not sure this will work as I think it will drain the center tank and then the outer two. I suppose I could pop the stack separators when the outer tanks are at 1/3 or would I be better using all the fuel up top 1st and then re-fueling with anything left in the center bottom tank through transfer?

Wrong. Put it into an 80x80 orbit with about 260/350 fuel left in the center bottom bit to xfer back to the top outer 3. Not sure if what\u0027s left is enough to get to Minmus and land or not but I\u0027m betting it is. 12 Nukes should do that well enough.
