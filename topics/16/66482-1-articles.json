I often hide them in that silly little gap you always end up with between the fuselauge and the wing. The fuel line to the wing will feed all of the engines on that wing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB-The B9 landing gear HL or tall gear work for the clearance but you need to adjust the cfg on them so the stiffness value is the right value. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC- There is a fine line between to much and to little. It depends on what I am trying to do with the craft, but most of my SSTOs are flying fuel cans, they often have a fuel volume of 55%-70% of the total mass of the vehicle. Some of my non-SSTO aircraft are hauling much less fuel, they don\u0027t need as much for jet engines, they are REALLY effecient in KSP. You can fly around the world with the B9 turbine engines (the ones that look like a 747 wing engines), with only one Rockomax 16 filled wth liquid fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT- One thing I noticed about your craft, you will need a larger tail stabilizer.
