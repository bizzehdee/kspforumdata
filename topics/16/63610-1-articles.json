I park in a 75km orbit, then wait for the angles, and make my burn (which is usually around 1050 m/s). This pretty much never gets me an intercept, though. It doesn\u0027t even really get me very close. I play around with maneuver nodes, can\u0027t nail down an intercept, and then tell MechJeb to tune my approach. MechJeb then wants to make a 400-500m/s burn to fix my approach. From everything I\u0027ve read, this combined total of ~1500m/s dV is much more than I should be spending to get into a Duna intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve tried using Kerbal Alarm Clock to wait for transfer windows (both modes, which don\u0027t agree), and it doesn\u0027t agree with Protractor on when transfer windows are, and none of them agree with MechJeb on when transfer windows are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is it I\u0027m doing wrong, here, and, for my own curiosity, how \u0022wide\u0022 are the transfer windows?

A bad transfer can easily leave you with a 5000m/s or greater capture burn. Also, there\u0027s no need to match Moho\u0027s inclination. You just need your transfer orbit to intersect Moho\u0027s at the point of intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T05:55:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example of an attempt I made to set up a transfer to Dres. I\u0027m using VOID here to give me angles. I\u0027m still a ways out from my ejection angle, but my phase angle is just about there, and I\u0027ve guesstimated the ejection angle and set up a node of roughly the right dV (the only value I found which gives me \u0022closest approach\u0022 indicators:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.3ln.org/ksp/bad_xfer/screenshot2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, here\u0027s the closest approach. As you can see, \u0022closest\u0022 is a relative term. My closest approach is something like 1/4 orbit away, which isn\u0027t really \u0022close\u0022, even if you\u0027re counting horseshoes and hand grenades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.3ln.org/ksp/bad_xfer/screenshot1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb wanted to wait another few weeks for the maneuver, and the node it set up not only didn\u0027t have \u0022closest approach\u0022 indicators, it didn\u0027t really come anywhere very close to Dres\u0027 orbit. I played with it for a while, and I got the closest approach there down to something like 600k km, but I was approaching 3k m/s dV by that point, and it wasn\u0027t an encounter, just a \u0022closest approach\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming I\u0027ve gotten this far, what is it I\u0027m doing wrong? I\u0027ve played with my ejection angle, but nothing I tried got my closest approach any closer. I fear I\u0027m missing something somewhat fundamental here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T06:35:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022alexmun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022alexmun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem here is Moho. MechJeb\u0027s transfer maneuver generator calculates a Hohmann transfer (just like Protractor, ksp.olex.biz, etc). This works great for Eve, Duna, Jool or other bodies with orbits that are mostly circular with low inclinations. It doesn\u0027t work so well for Eeloo, Dres, or especially Moho. MechJeb\u0027s midcourse correction maneuver does properly account for Moho\u0027s eccentricity and inclination so it has to use a lot of delta-v to fix the bad ejection burn.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou, sir, are a god among men. I used your porkchop plot (well, I used the fantastic information to the SIDE of the beautiful plot...) and achieved a 15,000km closest approach (without a course correction, yet). Took a little more dV that your tool said, but hey, it\u0027s better than being 1/4 of an orbit away. Once I get out into the Kerbol\u0027s SOI, MJ plots me a 6.9m/s burn to get me into Moho\u0027s SOI. Fantastic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to install a mod that gives me ejection angles for my maneuver nodes, and I\u0027ll be all set. Thank you for the very helpful information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess where I went wrong was in doing a few transfers to Duna, figuring I had it down, and installing MJ. I let it take me to Duna a few times, and Eve once, and then it completely broke down when I tried to have it get me somewhere more interesting. That\u0027ll teach me to take the easy way out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T06:46:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, just a few days later, a near-perfect intercept at Eeloo\u0027s AN.
