The whole idea of a vertical stabilizer is to split the air and put equal pressure on both sides, holding it.. well stable... and preventing undesired roll and yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a little concerned about the wings, there is considerable space between the segments. Because FAR uses the craft shape to determine aerodynamics, the sudden \u0022dip\u0022 in the wing surface may be causing issues. Some like the \u0022black bar\u0022 appearance but the grey area of the wing should never be visible when two wings meet because that\u0027s where it starts change shape, those should overlap. I\u0027m not certain how that will react to be honest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally your roll control would be stronger at the outside of the wing, that\u0027s where it has to do the least work to roll the plane. In fact I would put it only on the outside elevons. This however is just a suggestion for improvement, if your not actively rolling it shouldn\u0027t be causing your problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are the front elevons intended to do? Spoilers? You should know that FAR does not simulate the stall effect from spoilers. You can right click the wing and see it\u0027s stalled 0% when the spoilers are deployed. It only simulates the drag, so they are really only good as either air brakes or on the runway as braking spoilers. You generally don\u0027t want to create drag ahead of the center of mass.
