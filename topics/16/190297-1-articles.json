In the screenshot I have the octo-girder shown as the \u0022root\u0022 (in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, at least), the weldable Konstruction docking ports auto-strutted to the root. After docking an arm, I weld the ports and then set the auto-strut for the arms inner octo-girder to \u0022root\u0022, and all other parts of the arm to \u0022grandparent\u0022. This has worked fine for the first 2 arms. Now when I try to dock the 3rd arm, the station breaks up into 3 large pieces as soon as docking is complete (before \u0022welding\u0022 the arm)...and I\u0027m at a loss as to why. I\u0027ve used these Konstruction weldable ports for station building in previous versions of KSP without having this issue (the death wobble has always been an issue\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E, thus the CS-R2 Portable Struts on the 2 attached arms). I\u0027m wondering if my auto-strutting technique, in this case, is causing the break up on docking? I should also note that the station does not break up at the welded joints, necessarily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://users.frii.com/viciii3/screenshot3.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 style=\u0022width:1024px;height:576px;\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022http://users.frii.com/viciii3/screenshot3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-11T18:58:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2019 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by strider3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-12T11:15:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223715818\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022190297\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221576016416\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199830\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022strider3\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/10/2019 at 11:20 PM, strider3 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
