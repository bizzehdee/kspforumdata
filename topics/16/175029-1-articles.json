On an aircraft I can increase the friction on the landing gear to solve that, but\u00A0 the Kerbals\u00A0just keep sliding. I had one fall off a cliff while I went to get a cup of tea. Considering they can climb up very steep inclines in space suits, one would think on a gentle slope they could stay in one spot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else found this?
