This involves gaining a certain amount of straight-upward velocity, and then tilting the rocket a certain number of degrees in the desired direction (usually east, and often north or south for polar orbits), waiting for the prograde marker to descend to match the rocket\u0027s new \u0022forward\u0022 direction, and from that point on following the prograde marker in a smooth curve that minimizes drag.

Drag can also be an issue if it\u0027s very high (large fairings or a great deal of parts sticking out without a fairing, for instance).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E determines how fast your rocket accelerates. If it\u0027s not above 1.0, you can\u0027t even get off the ground. I prefer to keep the starting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E in the 1.2 to 1.5 range, and though going higher is an option it could also mean that you have built too much rocket for your payload and might be able to save some money by using a weaker engine. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E will increase over time as each stage expends fuel, reducing its mass and thus its weight while the amount of thrust (typically) remains constant, resulting in a greater acceleration being felt, peaking right before the fuel runs out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStaging affects your ascent by typically causing\u00A0your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E to change suddenly, usually decreasing quite a bit as your spent first stage\u0027s powerful engines and rising \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E are traded for a more efficient but weaker upper stage engine. If your second stage (or third, etc) doesn\u0027t have enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E you could potentially find yourself falling right back into the atmosphere if your prograde is too low to the horizon and you haven\u0027t gained enough horizontal speed\u00A0yet, especially if the engine is\u00A0simply too underpowered for the amount of payload it\u0027s trying to push. I\u0027d recommend keeping this above 1.0, but keep in mind that sometimes you need to make sure it\u0027s showing you the vacuum stats (rather than atmospheric / sea-level) in order to see the right \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and delta-V figures, as some vacuum-optimized engines (like the Poodle and Terrier) have abysmal sea-level thrust and efficiency (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EHow does all this affect your ascent path?\u003C/u\u003E If your starting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is high, especially if your second stage\u0027s is as well, you typically want to make more of a turn away from vertical, and\u00A0start sooner. If your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is low, you want to start later and turn less. Expressing when to start the turn is also often done in terms of your rocket\u0027s current speed, such as \u0022start turn at 100m/s\u0022 rather than by giving a time or altitude. They\u0027re all interrelated along with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E anyway, and since a high-thrust rocket will gain speed faster than one with lower thrust, using starting speed figures can make it easier to make comparisons and take what you\u0027ve learned with one rocket and apply it to another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, it\u0027s typically best to throttle back when your time to apoapsis reaches about 50 seconds (in the stock game you have to go to the map view and point at the apoapsis marker to see this, you can right click it to make it stay visible without having to track it with your mouse). Try to maintain that time at 50 seconds so that more of your rocket\u0027s thrust is applied later in the ascent when the rocket is aiming closer to the horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe benefits of this are twofold: You\u00A0waste\u00A0less thrust on going \u003Cem\u003Eup,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and you delay causing your apoapsis to reach your intended orbital altitude. The sooner that happens, the larger a circularization burn you\u0027ll need to finish gaining horizontal velocity. For \u0022getting into orbit\u0022 purposes, a\u00A0larger circularization burn is bad. That\u0027s because having to apply more of your horizontal thrust at apoapsis, compared to at a lower altitude, reduces the efficiency of that thrust, costing\u00A0you more fuel, according to the Oberth Effect. (Basically, you spend more delta-V for the same effect when\u00A0you do it at a higher altitude.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a bit counter-intuitive, so to put it another way: Applying less thrust during the middle stages of\u00A0the ascent (when you\u0027re aiming more upward) allows you to apply more total horizontal thrust prior to reaching your desired apoapsis height, which saves you from having to apply significantly more thrust at the end of your ascent where that thrust is less effective. The net effect is that you spend less fuel to reach orbit if you throttle back as needed to avoid pushing your time to apoapsis over about 50 seconds until as late as possible in your ascent (often into the 25-50% range, although \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E affects it too).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-12T09:27:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2019 09:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Tallinu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-12T11:42:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe optimum trajectory is: \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eas flat as possible\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E.

In other words, head for the horizon on the navball while making sure that the prograde marker stays very slightly above it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe added complication of having an atmosphere is that your ship has drag, and that drag is probably (assuming normal ship design) going to be lowest when you\u0027re pointing nose directly forward and engines directly rearward. \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETherefore\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E your only efficient solution is to be \u003Cu\u003Epointing prograde at all times\u003C/u\u003E. Drag also affects control over the ship, and you probably also have best control (assuming normal ship design...) when pointing exactly in the direction of travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this brings us to neatly to issue 2: you want to get out of the lower atmosphere quickly, while always pointing in the direction of travel (\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eespecially\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E while in the lower atmosphere...). Therefore you have to start vertically and make a gradual turn to horizontal as soon as possible but slowly enough to get out of the thick atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat compromise: \u0022as soon as possible but slowly enough to get out of the thick atmosphere\u0022, is your \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Egravity turn\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the gravity turn has to be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nperfectly smooth (therefore minimising drag and control problems), i.e. facing prograde exactly at all times,\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nat full power at all times (otherwise you could use less engines, saving weight),\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nideally, at lower altitudes, executed at a speed not exceeding the terminal velocity of your ship at that point (since on reaching terminal velocity, drag = 1g, rising exponentially: you\u0027d lose less by climbing for a bit longer rather than trying to climb a bit faster). This is really only an issue for the first few mostly-vertical kilometres.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly what the gravity turn looks like will depend on your thrust-to-weight ratio.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E means you reach orbital velocity faster. Therefore the gravity turn has to be finished quicker - which means starting it more agressively off-prograde or launching at less than 90\u00B0. Therefore you end up going a lot faster in the lower atmosphere and losing more energy to drag (converted into a lot more heat on your ship\u0027s skin).\u003Cbr\u003E\nA low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E means that the gravity turn has to be much more gentle. At the lowest feasible \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, your gravity turn only comes to an end when you reach orbital altitude: you burn constantly from lift-off to orbit circularisation. You lose less to atmospheric drag and much more to gravity losses. What you lose on fuel, however, you more than make up for on cheaper and lighter engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, to find that best trajectory, one of the easiest tools to use is available in vanilla via the map: time-to-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn lift-off, time-to-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E is necessarily zero and rising. It therefore doesnt help much as you try to start your gravity turn right.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, it becomes a very good indicator of efficiency when you\u0027re at around 8-12km altitude, 45\u00B0 inclined to the horizon. At that stage, time-to-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E should be around 30s or 40s or so, climbing slowly before stabilising, then remaining that way until you\u0027re nearly in orbit. The lower your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, the higher this number has to be. For a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E ship, you need to stabilise at around 50s. For a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E ship, at 40s or less.

This can happen even if you start with low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (around 1.2), as in your engines are just barely strong enough to take off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaking a sharper turn isn\u0027t necessarily a surefire answer to that, especially if your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0drops quite dramatically when you stage.\u00A0It depends\u00A0on your rocket design and what fraction of your trip to orbit is performed by each stage. In fact, the closer you come to getting all the way into orbit on your first stage (doing so creates a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket with any remaining stages as payload), the more you have to throttle back as you get closer to aiming at the horizon in order\u00A0to avoid pushing your apoapsis up to your target too soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother issue: Being a little too high compared to the most efficient possible gravity turn for your craft is basically safe. Being a little too low can be deadly. Keeping TTA stable toward the higher end of the range gives you more time to correct if it starts dropping (for example, after staging), by aiming slightly above your prograde vector. Doing that is \u003Cem\u003Enot necessarily\u003C/em\u003E the most\u00A0terrible thing ever in terms of efficiency, as long as you don\u0027t have to veer too far off prograde. For example, I\u0027ve read that real-life rockets often circularize post-apoapsis, which would \u003Cem\u003Erequire\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0just such an orientation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-12T21:52:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223539355\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182117\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221549975651\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257810\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tallinu\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Tallinu said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is also a great perspective, overall, but I think it needs a couple of minor caveats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbsolutely agree!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose that I should have been a bit clearer about that \u0022TTA stability\u0022 thing.
