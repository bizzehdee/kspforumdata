Does anyone here really care about the stupidity, courage or BadS values of their Kerbals? If so, why?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T03:48:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 03:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity**"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T02:42:19Z","Content":"No. It makes no difference.

Mod authors are free to use it, though I\u0027m not sure how many actually do. The only example I know of is Extraplanetary Launchpads, which lets you build rockets on other planets or in orbit:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545)\n\n...to build rockets, you need to put a bunch of crew in your rocket workshop, and I believe the mod looks at your kerbals\u0027 intelligence (er, stupidity) to decide how fast they build. So to get shorter build times, you want to populate it with the lowest-stupidity crew you can get."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T03:09:58Z","Content":"Yeah, and Interstellar needed smart Kerbals to run its research labs.
