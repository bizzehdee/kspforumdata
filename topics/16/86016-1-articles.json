KAC xfer alarm doesnt time the same xfer calculations as mechjeb so the node dances because its 1 year away. so instead of making a KAC xfer timer i had mechjeb make the node then add the node timer to KAC this makes the node much more stable and basically invalidates any usefulness of KAC xfer timer \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kruleworld","CreatedById":69697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T06:26:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed it does that on my stock game version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
