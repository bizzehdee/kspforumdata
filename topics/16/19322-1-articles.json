What you want to do is when you get kerbin orbit, use the map to line yourself up so that you are seeing minmus orbit path as a line only. When your rocket\u0027s orbit path intercepts visually the minmus orbit path, burn north or south to horizon to cause your own orbit path to pitch until it is the same glide slope. this is a basic way of stating a more advanced technique. Essentially if you burn perpendicular to your orbital path, in the x,y trajectories (aimed at horizon) your orbit path will pivot axially on your ship in that direction. If you burn Z axis (towards/away surface) it will change apoapsis/periapsis. If you are losing altitude and burn away from planet directly, your min will increase, max on orbit will decrease. Off topic there though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, the most difficult part of minmus is getting the orbital planes aligned. fter that, you simply need to burn prograde to increase your orbit out to minmus orbit path. Because you are going faster than minmus, make sure minmus is ahead of you. If you burn too soon, you will arrive at orbit before minmus. In which case, you want to burn a bit more to extend your orbit a little bit out beyond the minmus orbit. This will allow it to catch up to you. Once your orbit is a bit beyond minmus, you can circularize your orbit a bit more to increase the duration you are beyond minmus until you capture orbit. If you got there too late, simply do the reverse. Keep your orbit within that of minmus and circularize it so you gradually catch up or capture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zapy97","CreatedById":45133,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T01:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Markus Reese\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Markus Reese\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you can get to mun and not minmus, my guess is the problem is the angled orbit path of minmus.

This method involves timing your launch so that your craft is orbiting Kerbin at either 84 or 96 degrees (instead of the 90 you use for the Mun). Your orbit around Kerbin will be on the same plane as Minmus (if you launch at the right time, that is) and then you can simply wait for Minmus to rise over Kerbin and do your prograde burn just like you would for a Munar injection burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how you do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESit on the launch pad, go into Map view, and flatten out Kerbin\u0027s orbit plane like this. Make sure the camera is pretty much centered over the launch pad too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CRJKU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CRJKU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZoom out so you can see where the plane of Minmus is. *Don\u0027t move the camera! Just zoom out. If you move the camera I am not responsible for lost Kerbals in space.* Chances are Minmus\u0027 plane isn\u0027t flat, but if you timewarp there will be 2 moments where it will flatten out. Those are your launch windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FLk9U.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FLk9U.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wait until the plane of Minmus flattens out like this, you can launch at a heading of 84 degrees and you will end up on the exact same plane as Minmus. This means you will not have to make a plane change orbital maneuver. If the plane of Minmus is the opposite mirror image of this, or from top-left to bottom-right, you could launch at 96 degrees to be on the same plane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RODq1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RODq1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you follow these directions you will find yourself on an inclined orbit around Kerbin, which happens to match the plane of Minmus exactly. (Or very closely, at least, depending on your piloting skills.) Now all you have to do is wait until Minmus rises from behind Kerbin and you can burn prograde just like you would for the Mun, and you will easily intercept Minmus.
