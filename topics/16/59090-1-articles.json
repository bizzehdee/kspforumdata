The trick is that the Mun is a moving target, and the predicted orbit that the transfer nodes show are relative to Kerbin. So when you are setting up your nodes, if your predicted path shows you moving directly north-south around the far side of the Mun, the Mun\u0027s motion will mean that you will actually get an orbit with roughly a 45 degree inclination. You have to come in at a bit of an angle relative to the Mun to get a true polar orbit. To rendezvous with a station, you\u0027ll also have to time your transfer burn so that you reach the Mun when the station\u0027s orbit is aligned with your approach path (this is tuning out to be a fascinating challenge!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give it a try later and post some pics to illustrate what I\u0027m talking about above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T22:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, halfway on your transfer trajectory set up a node and tweak it so that you end up in a polar orbit over Mun. Set up a node and play around with the handles until you achieve a gravitational capture that will twist you reasonably towards polar. Halfway through transfer is the most energy-efficient way to do it (unless you opt for a polar kerbin start. Then you can transfer polar to polar (it can take up to a munar month to wait for an economical transfer though, for reasons that should be clear).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Horn Brain","CreatedById":49626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T22:58:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you set up your encounter, put your periapsis over the north or south pole of the Mun (as close as you can get). Don\u0027t worry about lining up with the target orbit yet, just make sure your periapsis is close to the pole. When you do your capture burn, only burn until you\u0027re just barely captured; your apoapsis should be at the edge of the Mun\u0027s SoI above the other pole, and your AN or DN should be up there too. You will be moving only a few m/s up there, so it will be easy to adjust your inclination to match the target. Then do a maneuver at periapsis to lower your apoapsis and proceed to rendezvous as normal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thiosk","CreatedById":81242,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T01:00:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etheres some good advice here, but really it comes down to experience. When you gain an intrinsic understanding of how different burns effect various orbits, it becomes second nature to tune and adjust the nodes.
