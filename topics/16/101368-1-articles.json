Ostensibly it is a measure of a thruster\u0027s fuel efficiency, the ratio of the thrust provided vs the amount of fuel consumed. This ratio is pretty easy to calculate when you are looking at the statistics of various parts in the VAB. However the numbers didn\u0027t necessarily line up with how things were talked about on these here forums, the most notable being Nuclear engines which are known for having the best fuel efficiency, but when calculated from VAB numbers actually have the worst. Right clicking the engine of a craft it flight can show a direct measure of ISP that doesn\u0027t match up with the thrust vs fuel consumption numbers one sees in the VAB or SPH. Forum discussions also occasionally mention a difference of atmospheric ISP and Vacuum ISP and the Wikipedia shows that the two are different for almost everything, with the vacuum ISP being noticeably but not dramatically higher. Of course I assume the difference is in fact quite dramatic for Ion and Nuclear.\n\nThe question: What is the relationship between Atmospheric ISP, Vacuum ISP, and the ratio of Thrust divided by fuel consumption as shown by the parts list stats in the VAB/SPH?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T07:08:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 07:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by QuantumInc**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T11:15:19Z","Content":"In the VAB/SPH the Isp stats are shown for atmosphere and vacuum - right-click the part\u0027s thumbnail to expand its description.\n\nThe LV-N has a vacuum Isp of 800, being much better than any other \u0027normal\u0027 engine, which have a maximum of 390. The Ion\u0027s is 4,000 but its thrust is so low it\u0027s not usually considered for the same sort of vehicles where you\u0027d use a heavy engine.\n\nBut, yes, at full atmospheric pressure the LV-N\u0027s Isp is only 220; one of the worst ... it increases from that to 800 as you climb and the atmosphere gets thinner (indicated by the barometer beneath the altimeter). On Kerbin the LV-N\u0027s Isp already exceeds the other engines by an altitude of 2km or so. Unless you\u0027re planning extended flights in atmosphere you can generally ignore atmospheric Isp except for first-stage engines that will perform their whole burn, or most of it, immediately after launch.\n\nNB: How Isp works is one of the fundamental things that will be changed and in general there will be a re-balancing of parts it 1.0, so things may be very different in the next version."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T12:32:47Z","Content":"Currently, as Isp changes thrust remains constant and fuel flow changes, so a nuclear rocket motor will have 60kN in any condition but will consume about 4x the fuel to make that thrust deep in the atmosphere as opposed to vacuum.\n\nComing in the next update, thrust will change with Isp rather than fuel flow changing with Isp. So the fuel flow rate of that nuclear rocket will be constant, but it will only deliver about 1/4 the thrust deep in atmosphere. This more accurately simulates the way real rockets work.\n\nOddly, ions have the same Isp in atmo as in vacuum in KSP, so they are unaffected by it.\n\nAs for the formula, it is:\n\nThrust = Isp \\* G\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E \\* FuelFlow\n\nIn KSP, the units are kN for thrust, seconds for Isp, 9.82m/s^2^ for G\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E, and tons/second for fuel flow."},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T15:42:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The question: What is the relationship between Atmospheric ISP, Vacuum ISP, and the ratio of Thrust divided by fuel consumption as shown by the parts list stats in the VAB/SPH?\n\nIn KSP the atmospheric and vacuum values of I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E are somewhat arbitrary.

Most of a rocket\u0027s thrust comes from momentum. Pressure thrust is the result of unbalanced pressure forces at the nozzle exit. \n\nFor a given rocket engine operating under steady state conditions, the values of *q*, *V*\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ee\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E, *P*\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ee\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E, and *A*\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ee\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E are constant.

As others have explained, in stock KSP it\u0027s the other way around, with *F* constant and *q* variable.
