Part of the fix for those included not being able to turn on a battery that was disabled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt makes sense if you think about it. If there\u0027s absolutely no power for the probe, how does it know, or be able to, turn them back on?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that previously this was a nice \u0022safety feature\u0022 to leave one battery turned off, and if you forgot to extend solar panels you could turn the reserve battery on and get your panels extended. But, alas, no more.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I see that your ship has a crew pod on it. So if you EVA a kerbal over, they can board and turn the power on, but just the probe core cannot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T19:24:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the fast replies!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was afraid it was something along those lines...\u003Cbr\u003E\nToo bad there\u0027s no way (yet) to put a probe in a low-power state.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s still a hasle though as solar panels are hard to obtain in the early carreer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have them now, so I guess I\u0027ll mount at least 2 of them and keep the smallest battery on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
