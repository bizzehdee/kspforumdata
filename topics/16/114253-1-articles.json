In 1.0.2, I had rockets that just shoot straight up and free-fall back down and slowed with parachutes for doing sub-orbital tourist contracts. In 1.0.4, my chutes always rip off unless I deploy them so late that the pod crashes and explode before the chutes can slow them down enough (had to deploy somewhere below 1000m to not have them rip off, but that\u0027s too little time to slow down in 1.0.4.)\n\nMy craft is very basic (only unlocked the really cheap techs so far): Mk16 chute / 2 radial chutes - command pod - command pod - heat shield - decoupler - hammer SRB - decoupler - hammer SRB (I need the second command pod for a pilot for SAS, otherwise rocket will flip.) I tweaked the SRB so that I get around an apoapsis of 80,000m or so.\n\nI did manage to get something workable and economical by adding a flea SRB (and an additional Hammer stage) that fires during descent to slow me down to \u003C 200 m/s before deploying the chutes. Are there other solutions to make the chutes usable? Spamming a lot of radial chutes also look like it may work (it worked with the 1 pod version) - not because they slow me down in time if I deploy really late, but because they seem to add a ton of drag that slows me down even before I deploy them. Adding draggy parts seem like such an inelegant solution though, and I don\u0027t know if that approach will scale well when I build heavier crafts (not to mention wastes a lot of fuel on ascent.)\n\nAlso, what exactly changed in 1.0.4 that seems to have nerfed the chutes so much? Reduced air drag so crafts don\u0027t hit terminal velocity as quickly as well as raising the terminal velocity? Or is some part of the atmosphere a lot less dense now that it doesn\u0027t decelerate crafts as much? Understanding what changed will help me redesign all my old crafts much quicker.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T01:03:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 01:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by simsatellite**"},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T14:59:37Z","Content":"Drag seems to have been decreased, so you don\u0027t slow down as much.

If you only slow down that much below 1000m then you have a problem, obviously.\n\nWith two command pods you might simply be too heavy to slow down substantially with a 1.25m diameter. Also, how do you re-entry? Come in too steep and your descent trajectory is simply not long enough to slow you down enough."},{"CreatedByName":"simsatellite","CreatedById":144076,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T15:29:48Z","Content":"Flying straight up then free fall straight down. Worked fine in 1.0.2 - it was an easy way to do tons of tourist contracts with my eyes closed literally (press T, space bar, then every time I don\u0027t hear rocket noises, press space bar again ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif)) So I take it in 1.0.4, I either have to fall at an angle (which means I also have to launch at an angle) or pack some small rockets for the descent (which I\u0027ve done successfully, just can\u0027t do it with my eyes closed)?

I\u0027m at the same point in the game after starting a new career - earning some sweet early tourist money. However, I\u0027m finding that my speed doesn\u0027t reduce nearly enough to save me when coming back down. I\u0027ve tested it with just a pod, science junior and couple of wings and a heat shield on a fairly horizontal re-entry from maybe 110km up. I\u0027ll get up to 800 m/s around 70km up and by 15km i\u0027m doing a blistering 1200 m/s and I burn up. Am I being a terrible pilot or is something wrong with my game? I haven\u0027t played since 1.0 and I\u0027m on vanilla. \n\nAlso, I\u0027ve noticed my heat shield doesn\u0027t appear to be wearing. It keeps it\u0027s 200 units of ablator. After my speed gets too high and I get too low, I lose control and can\u0027t keep my shield towards my retro, then everything explodes. Any help would be good.\n\nP.S.

Airbrakes work at any altitude and they work well. They are very important parts nowadays and putting them on your spacecraft is a wise practice, especially that they can save you from overheating as well, creating drag at speeds where chutes have no chance to survive.\n\nYep, get used to the airbrakes, they are godsend with the new aero.\n\nHave a pic of airbrakes on an asteroid.![2015-08-02_00001.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-08-02_00001.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T18:43:44Z","Content":"Hello Scotsman, and welcome to the forums.\n\nFirst, if you lose control in atmo, your centre of mass is not in the right place. You want the CoM as close to the blunt end as possible to ensure stability during reentry. At only 0.2 tonnes, the science junior is very light. So if you put it below the command pod you have an unstable reentry vehicle.\n\nIt sounds like you\u0027re not coming in shallow enough. As long as you spend enough time in the medium-thick atmosphere, it should be able to slow you to safe speeds.\n\nThere is no need for a heat shield for the mission described. You will never use up any of the ablator. The command pods can withstand reentry from the Mun or Minmus without a heat shield, as long as it\u0027s shallow enough.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nHappy landings!\n\np.s.
