Come screaming into the system when you\u0027re already \u0026gt;5000 m/s at the edge of Eve\u0027s SoI, and you\u0027re gonna have a tough row to hoe. So the best thing you can do is set yourself up for success by using a transfer window planner (there are various ones out there, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis one\u003C/a\u003E is my favorite). \u0022How to set up a good, low-dV encounter\u0022 is a whole separate topic, so I won\u0027t go into detail here unless you\u0027re interested. I\u0027m sure there are plenty of tutorials out there. How to tell if an interplanetary encounter is a \u0022good\u0022 one from looking at the map view: If your orbit and Eve\u0027s are crossing each other like an X, that\u0027s bad. if they\u0027re nearly parallel, that\u0027s good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAerobrake.\u003C/strong\u003E It\u0027s \u0022free\u0022 dV. This may or may not be an option for you. First, if you\u0027re hitting atmosphere at high interplanetary speeds, you\u0027re going to get fried regardless of your ship design. Second, even if you\u0027re at a reasonably manageable speed, the amount of aerobraking you can do will be limited by your ship design. Ships that are specifically designed to be aerobrake-sturdy will do a lot better than a ship that was designed without aerobraking in mind. Heat shields are good. Airbrakes are also good. Bear in mind that small, light craft do a lot better at aerobraking than big heavy ones. If you\u0027re coming in with a juggernaut, your aerobraking options may be limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMake maximum use of Oberth effect.\u003C/strong\u003E Even if you\u0027re not aerobraking, do as much of your retro-burn at as low an altitude as possible. i.e. set up your Eve approach so that your periapsis is as low as possible-- just above the atmosphere, if you can\u0027t aerobrake. Wait until you\u0027re down at periapsis and then do your burn there. It\u0027s pretty easy to arrange for a low periapsis, as long as you do your correction burn a few days before arriving at Eve. If you do it several days in advance (i.e. before you even enter Eve\u0027s SoI), you can adjust your periapis altitude for a tiny amount of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s say you have a worst-case scenario: you have an existing ship that wasn\u0027t well-designed for aerobraking, and you already have a high-velocity encounter set up for Eve, and you have a limited amount of dV left and are trying to figure out how you can make best use of what you have to try to achieve orbit. Here\u0027s what you do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. A few days before encountering Eve, make a small correction burn to adjust your Eve periapsis to as low as possible, right at the upper fringes of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. As soon as you enter Eve\u0027s SoI, \u003Cstrong\u003Edo a quicksave.\u003C/strong\u003E You\u0027re likely going to have to try this several times to get it right, and you\u0027ll probably get fried a few times. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. We\u0027ll try for \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E aerobraking. Lower your periapsis a bit into the atmosphere. \u0022How far\u0022 is going to involve a lot of trial-and-error, that\u0027s why you quicksaved in step 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Just before you hit atmosphere, do a retro-burn to slow yourself as much as you can. (Save a \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E bit of fuel to adjust your orbit post-aerobraking.) The idea is to get slowed down enough so that the aerobraking doesn\u0027t fry you. You want to wait as late as possible to do the burn, because the lower you are when you do it, the more Oberth effect you get. Doing the retro-burn right before you hit atmosphere not only slows you down to a speed that is (hopefully) survivable, but it also lightens your ship by a lot, which means it will aerobrake better. The lighter it is, the more aerobraking will slow it and the less likely it is to fry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Make your aerobraking pass. If there\u0027s too much aerobraking, you fry, or end up going down to the surface. Too little, and you go shooting off into space. Hopefully you\u0027ve hit the sweet spot and end up climbing back out of the atmosphere with a captured trajectory. In that case, just coast up to apoapsis, then do enough of a prograde burn to lift periapsis out of atmosphere.
