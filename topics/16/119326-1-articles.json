There are some things to consider though:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do you want to do fly-bys, or do you want to go into orbit around the bodies? If you are satisfied with just doing fly-bys, you can save a lot of delta-v by using gravity assists to \u0027slingshot\u0027 yourself to your next destination. This requires a lot of planning though. It might also be easier to include Eve in your slingshot maneuvers, since her her strong gravity well may help you to slingshot yourself outwards towards the outer planets. Also, transfer windows between the outer planets suck, they are few and far in between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you bring mining gear, you can replenish your fuel at certain locations (the moons and Dres/Eeloo).
