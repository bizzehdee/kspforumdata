This means that there are 2 possible launch windows where we could end up on the same plane as Minmus. One would launch at 84 degrees, the other at 96 degrees, depending on Kerbin\u0027s rotation. It is relatively easy to time your launch so you end up in orbit on the same plane and then only have to do a single injection burn using the same method as you would to go to the Mun.

The only difference is that you need to do a mid-course correction burn to an inclination change so that you intersect with Minmus\u0027s orbit. To do that, put yourself in Normal or antinormal (point \u0022up\u0022 or \u0022down\u0022 on the elliptic plane) and burn.
