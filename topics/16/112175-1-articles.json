Push that and a column of filters appears instead of the usual tabs for different part types. Near the bottom is a green one that looks kinda like a rocket. That\u0027s the subassembly button. Click on it. Now instead of seeing a bunch of parts, the left edge of the screen is blank gray but at the bottom is a box that says \u0022subassembly drop area\u0022.\n\nWith the screen like that, grab the wad of parts off your vehicle that you want to save as a subassembly, drag them into the \u0022subassembly drop area\u0022 box, and release. A new box will pop up allowing you to name and save the subassembly, and add a description. That\u0027s it. The saved subassembly will now appear at the top of the left area of the screen, looking like a ship on the \u0022load ship\u0022 list.\n\nTo use a subassembly on another vehicle, open the subassembly tab again as described above, click on the desired subassembly from the list, and attach it to the vehicle same as any other wad of parts.\n\nThere are a few tricks to doing this correctly. See #2 below.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) What the heck is the root tool? Every time I play around with it, I can only click on one thing, but it tells me to click on 2.\n\nThe primary use of this is preparing to save subassemblies. To understand it, you need to know how KSP craft files work so I\u0027ll explain that first.\n\nKSP craft have a root part (by default, the 1st part placed, usually a pod or probe core). All other parts must attach to the root part or to chain of other parts that ultimately ends attached to the root part. These chains of other parts are \u0022branches\u0022, and branches really can\u0027t attach just to each other. IOW, the file structure is like your hand, with the root part being the palm and the branches being your fingers.\n\nSubassemblies can only be composed of branch parts, never the root part. Say you started with a lander can and built a whole lander with fuel, engines, and legs attached under the can. All you could save as the subassembly would be these other parts, not the can itself because it\u0027s the root part by default. You find this inconvenienty--you want the whole lander, can and all, as a subassembly for your Apollo-style rocket. You use the Root Tool to make this happen.\n\nWhat you do is attach some other part, it doesn\u0027t matter what (I usually use the short box girder) to your wannabe subassembly. Then you activate the Root Tool. Now click on the part the new part is attached to. Then make a 2nd click on the new part. This turns the new, extra part into the root part and makes the entirety of the vehicle, including the can, into branch parts. So now you can grab the entire vehicle, leaving the new, extra root part behind, and save this as a subassembly.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The subassembly will only have 1 attachment node until you attach it to the vehicle you want to use it on. This attachment node will be at the joint where the subassembly was connected to the extra part when you saved it as a subassembly. So, you have to plan ahead and know how you\u0027re going to attach the subassembly the the main ship. By it\u0027s nose, by it\u0027s tail, or radially. Then, when you add the extra part and change the root while saving the subassembly, be sure you put the extra part on the right place of the wannabe subassembly.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) Why can\u0027t I attach the rover in the picture to the lifter in the picture? I\u0027ve tried angle-snap on/off. I\u0027ve tried upside down, approach from every angle, tried with various pieces connected to the rover before trying to mate the two. Nothing works. The lifter will not accept the lander/rover.\n\nIs this rover a subassembly? Did you change its root so that it has an attachment node on the bottom?"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T16:46:58Z","Content":"\u003E Is this rover a subassembly?
