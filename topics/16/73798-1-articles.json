That takes practice. I started using a controller so I\u0027d have better landing controls and use the analog triggers for throttle so I could make slight changes easier. It helps - but you need to do a work-around and some file editing to get that to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a difference between horizontal and vertical velocity and the stock instrumentation does a poor job showing it in my opinion. Likely your surface speed is 10m/s horizontal and zero vertical. There\u0027s a gauge up by your altimeter that shows you your vertical speed, and note that altimeter is NOT radar altitude. If what I\u0027m thinking is the the case too your retrograde indicator will be the horizon of your navball too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally the easiest way to land is burn against that retrograde marker when in surface mode on the navball and follow it down. As you get more practice you\u0027ll learn how to push that marker around to do more precision landings and more efficient ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T10:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI imagine the answers you get in this thread will probably be the same as the answers in the other thread you started, basically asking exactly the same question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81655-Need-help-with-Mun-landing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81655-Need-help-with-Mun-landing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Worst at Video Games NA","CreatedById":112021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T13:32:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for this thread.
