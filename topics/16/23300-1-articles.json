The only reason to do it is when one engine is either too much TWR or too little. IE: 1 mainsail would make TWR 3 or 4 you can instead attach a couple smaller engines to keep it around 2 for liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way you do it is with the small cubic struts. Just put them on symetry and plant them on the bottom of whatever you are clustering. Then you can rotate them to be inside the thing and still clip engines to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*edit*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use the aerodynamic tail cone to put engines around the outside of a tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-21T15:00:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2013 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Scottiths\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadding info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T15:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou can, but usually the game won\u0027t let you use symmetry mode when placing the engines, so you\u0027ll have to place them one by one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor you can allow part clipping and do it all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T15:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI prefer using the tail cones: they make nice Soyuz-looking rockets, a nice design change from the rest of my designs. Of course, you do have to enable part clipping to do that.
