You can connect them at the top, the bottom, or the side, just so long as they\u0027re actually attached to the tank. Remember, fuel lines only flow in one direction; the first end you connect is where fuel will flow FROM, while the second end is where fuel will flow TO.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dekayy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dekayy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eand if i am connect them right, how can I get an indication that the fuel is being used?

Also, keep in mind that you just have to place the fuel lines on the bottom tank, if there are stacked tanks, but you can place the \u0022exit\u0022 of the line anywhere on the inner tanks.
