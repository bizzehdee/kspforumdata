While you\u0027re trying to take off, the plane will lift up ever so slightly (not enough that you can see) but it\u0027s enough that one side of the plane will be up higher than the other, and thus the plane will veer off in whatever direction until you force it to switch. Of course, this fails to explain why all my rovers like going to the right no matter what. Really annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I\u0027ve found that having wheels closer to the center of the craft makes it worse. If you can add wheels farther out along the wings, it makes it a lot easier to manage and in general makes the moving left/right not as bad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T18:48:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, 1st thing is to turn on SAS before you start moving.

Make sure your back wheels are only a little behind the center of mass. Possibly jack up the back gear if you must, so that your plane has a slight nose-down angle on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
