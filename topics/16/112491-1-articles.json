BTW it is a simple design based on a RoveMate and 4 M1 wheels, a couple of parts and an External Command Seat.\n\nI already remapped key for rover controls to different ones than WASD.\n\nI used mirror simetry to put the parts together (don\u0027t know if it matters) but I don\u0027t seem to see the origin of the problem. \n\nAny ideas on where I should be looking for?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T19:13:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by psychopoak**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T20:12:40Z","Content":"Huh, that\u0027s really weird. I\u0027ve noticed some odd rover behavior in 1.0.x, but not quite as egregious as what you\u0027re describing-- in my case, it was a rover that just seemed to ignore its brakes completely, but only some of the time; and during its less-cooperative mood, I could press the \u0022drive backward\u0022 key to get it to start slowing down, and *then* the brakes would work.\n\nSo, no idea what\u0027s causing your problem, but a few ideas for things that might be interesting to check:\n\n- Is your \u0022brake\u0022 key even registering? i.e. if you hold down the \u0022B\u0022 key, do you see the little \u0022brakes\u0022 icon up on the top status display (next to your altitude indicator) light up white? That will at least tell you whether you\u0027re actually trying to brake-- if it doesn\u0027t light up when you press the B key, this could be some sort of key-mapping problem.\n\n- What if you turn on (and persistently set) the brakes by clicking on the brake icon, instead of holding down the B key? Any difference?\n\n- Open the rover in the VAB (or SPH), go to Action Groups, and check the \u0022Brake\u0022 action grouip (this assumes you\u0027ve upgraded at least to level 2). Are your wheels listed there? (By default, they ought to be.)\n\n- Have you tried playing around with the brake torque on the wheels? (It\u0027s available on the right-click UI for the wheels.) Try sliding it up to max and then try the brakes.\n\n- If you deliberately flip the rover so its wheels are in the air, do they keep spinning even if the brakes are engaged?\n\n- Is the rover draining power when it accelerates like that? What if you right-click on your battery (or batteries) and disable the electric supply-- does cutting off the juice kill the power to the wheels? (If it doesn\u0027t, that\u0027s a pretty obvious bug right there.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T20:16:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T20:16:47Z","Content":"do you have a joystick? \n\njoystick throttle on rovers confused me at first."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T20:31:13Z","Content":"It\u0027s a bug with the stock tweakables. If you place the wheels without right clicking on them, then they will usually work just fine. However, if you ever right click on them (such as to repair, disable steering, etc) then the brakes will be forever \u0022broken.\u0022\n\nThe workarounds/fixes:\n\n1) Never ever right-click on the rover wheels\n\n2) Edit the save file (or .craft file) and change the wheel torque option to something higher than the default 30 (some of the rover wheels are upwards of 200, with the ruggedized wheels up at 500).\n\n3) If you aren\u0027t opposed to add-ons, you can [install my fixes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285).

I can see wheels slow down but they re-accelerate once I let off the brakes.\n\n@Claw : the bug happens despites any click. but thanks for the mod, it is in my list of installed mod since I needed some of the fixes you included.\n\n@Brainlord Mesomorph : THAT! you might have found the answer. I play with a xbox-controller, but in parallel I have a Hotas plugged in and the throttle was at 100%. so it might be the cause of all that non-sense. \n\nIt will test that ASAP, but it might explain a lot!\n\nthanks guys!\n\n@"},{"CreatedByName":"psychopoak","CreatedById":58162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T15:15:45Z","Content":"Back to you guys,\n\nI ran a couple of test as soon as I got back from work. here are my results so far :\n\n- I move the throttle of my HOTAS back to 0, no results\n\n- I unplugged my HOTAS, no results\n\n- I remapped control keys of the rover part, no results\n\n- I built a quick new rover with other parts, no results\n\n- I installed \u0022stock bug fix\u0022 from our pal Claw (I though it was installed, my mistake), no results.\n\nBTW I narrowed down the problem a lot. everything seems to work perfectly when I want to go forward or steer any direction. Brakes seem to be working, even if quite weak. but once I hit the \u0022drive backwar\u0022 key, it goes crazy:)\n\nActually the rover goes full throttle instantly and keeps going as if nothing else mattered.

Let me see if I can offer another two things that might be the cause...\n\n1) Check your trim input after you drive a bit and make sure you aren\u0027t accidently adding trim. The indicators are in the lower left. Press ALT\u002BX to zero it out.\n\nor\n\n2) There is a \u0022stuck key\u0022 thing that happens with kerbals where holding the SHIFT key and pressing forward, then releasing SHIFT causes the kerbal to keep walking forward. Possibly this bug happens with rovers (unconfirmed). Do you do any other keypresses when you drive?\n\nI suppose lastly, if you are using mods, might want to see if any of those are causing problems. Or at least keep an eye on the log file and watch for errors.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T18:20:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I am not sur for other rover at the moment, I will need to test.\n\u003E BTW, what do you mean by back up or earlier build? if you think about my career, I don\u0027t and I don\u0027t know if I would like to restart the whole thing.\n\u003E \n\u003E but if you mean my rover, it is definitely not a problem.

If a probe core or docking port that is oriented upwards has control then it might not know where \u0022backwards\u0022 is from the perspective of the command chair. Make sure that you \u0022control from\u0022 the command chair. If it\u0027s happening on other crafts then this is unlikely but worth checking.\n\nAlso, make sure that the new key binding you set up doesn\u0027t have the same key for \u0022backwards throttle\u0022 assigned to some other function already. I\u0027ve found that having the same key mapped for two different functions that could overlap can really confuse things, especially now that each key binding can have a secondary function. Also, make sure that you have the button checked to be enabled in the scene for \u0022Staging/docking\u0022 modes depending on how you drive.\n\nLastly, I don\u0027t know if you have any mods installed like Action Groups Extended, but it can set action groups to \u0022Toggle\u0022 rather than a simple press and hold. If you are using Windows I\u0027d also just check and make sure that \u0022sticky keys\u0022 isn\u0027t turned on in accessibility."},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T21:51:17Z","Content":"Trim could be on?
