Jeb is long out of fuel and electricity...and has been floating out there for about 2 years while I\u0027ve been continuing the space program and honing my skills at rescuing stranded kerbals (about 2/3 of my missions are rescue missions on previous fiascos).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve since built a probe ship with a rudimentary grapple / catcher\u0027s mitt (using landing legs attached to girders) that I know I can use to capture the small capsules. I even added an empty capsule if I have to resort to EVA, but I\u0027d rather bring back the original capsule. It\u0027s currently in heliocentric orbit ahead of Jeb (with a higher apoaps to let Jeb catch up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s my problem, it\u0027s really really hard to figure out how to get the best intercept. I don\u0027t want to time warp 10000x the whole time to keep waiting to get back to apoapsis over and over to adjust the intercept point (closest intercept near periaps). The reason I\u0027d rather not, is because I\u0027m in career mode with multiple missions going on that I\u0027m switching between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, using the maneuver nodes, I can get as close as about 300 km, which is tiny compared to the Kerbol system, but a bit far for a rendevous. I try to adjust the maneuver nodes, and zoom in as best as I can to see how closely the orbital paths come, but it\u0027s really hard to do when the node is on the other side of the star system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not using any mods besides the docking cross-hairs thingy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-13T23:08:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2013 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Soda Popinski\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

Since you won\u0027t be docked to your target, it will be considered a separate vessel, and every time you use time acceleration or switch to a distant vessel, the game will recalculate its position based on its then-current velocity converted to Keplerian elements, which will result in it escaping from your cage and moving significant distances away from your spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you\u0027re willing to spend time re-rendezvousing with your rescued pod on the way back, (or worse, do the entire trip in Physwarp) you should probably either look into using Kerbal Attachment System to dock and tow back your pod, or settle for just rescuing the Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T22:00:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChange your orbit so it touches the target orbit in one point.
