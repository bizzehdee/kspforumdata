Once you\u0027re almost out of jet fuel, you tip your nose up to about 40 degrees, switch to the rocket engine, and perform a burn to get you above the atmosphere - say to 80,000 meters.

A good way to practice the ascent is to build a training vehicle that doesn\u0027t have to worry about aerodynamics. A simple rocket with a probe core, a ram intake, reaction wheels, an FL-T800 fuel tank, and a RAPIER engine suits for the task.
