Specifically; Drag, DLift, ADrag, and how they relate to Mass/Area/Vol. For wings and other parts(tanks, etc) also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Reason I\\\u0027m asking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I tried to make an updated, normalized wing set, people could use, or base parts off of. Wanted to just get all the wing data compiled, updated, fixed, and all in one place. They may not work like real wings in real air, but at least all the parameters would be used properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I did the best I could, but after some searching, I found stuff in the archives that seems to completely contradict what I was using.

How is DragCoef factored in, multiplied by FD and set to -Y?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Angular drag (from Unity reference) is essentially \u0027roll resistance\u0027 Is this following something similar to the above equation, or is it simply a denominator to input torque?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Yes, I could try testing all this stuff myself, but I\\\u0027m quite sure there are a couple aerospace engineers only too happy to answer the questions.
