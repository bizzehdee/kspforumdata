Awesome right? Well little did I realize that in my design of my ship (which is the same as my Mun-lander just with parachutes) I accidentally put a parachute right over the crew hatch! I mean its great and all that I landed there finally but what\u0027s the point if my Kerbals can\u0027t walk around and explore? Is there any way I can just delete the parachute off my ship now that its landed or are my guys stuck to the confines of their pod for the trip? (Also, uploaded a picture I think but I\u0027m not really good with that stuff either so might not help.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/djeeu6lib/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/djeeu6lib/screenshot1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T22:09:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might be able to use the \u0022whack a kerbal\u0022 in the alt-f12 menu to surgically remove that piece.
