At liftoff I fire all three engines and fuel starts to drain from each stack. However the upper center tank is constantly being topped off by fuel feed from the two lower side tanks which in effect means the three engines are draining the 4 side tanks in between them. When the two side stacks run out of fuel I stage stage 4 which blows off the side stacks leaving me with a center engine still firing and two full tanks of fuel still.\n\nUnfortunately if you are planning to drop only empty fuel tanks and do so one at a time the only way to do it is horizontally. The point is though it\\\u0027s kind of a waste since as your rocket lighten you should be dropping engines along with tanks.

That was very nice.\n\nI took your example, and made something similar. (Call it a reciprocal gift.) It gets to Mun and back with just 19 tanks. It\\\u0027s very quick off the launch pad and in the ascent, so it helps to keep the speed below terminal velocity. If all goes well, the drop tanks go in Booster Bay, the first three engines dissolve in the atmosphere during circularization, and the second three engines hit the Mun during descent. The final engine is the only gimballed one, and has a single fuel tank for landing and return. We returned to Kerbin with almost half a tank in reserve, which is nice if you want to control the landing site. Or if you want to add weird things like lander legs."}]}
