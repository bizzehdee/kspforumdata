I assembled a space station in Kerbin orbit, but now I\u0027d like to tow it to a Munar orbit. The problem is, I can\u0027t seem to get my towboat to dock with the station: I get the docking ports within a meter, but the magnetic clamps don\u0027t seem to kick in. However, when I rightclick on the port and choose to decouple the node the magnets suddenly work and the station becomes the prud owner of a new probe core. What am I doing wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPictures of try #63:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bzx5rWa7zB_rRUw5dXFMRktIaEE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bzx5rWa7zB_rRUw5dXFMRktIaEE\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m only using Scatterer,\u00A0Kerbal Alarm Clock and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magzimum","CreatedById":167187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T14:25:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is my experience that the heavier the ship, the better aligned the docking ports need to be. In your pictures, the docking ports are close enough, but they are quite a few degrees off the perfect alignment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry to align them better when you approach. I also struggled a lot with this, but I found out that the trick that made it easier for me was to put \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0evenly distributed\u00A0around the center of mass - that allows you to use the IJKL keys to translate the ship. Then you can just align the ships (e.g. turn both to \u0027normal\u0027 or \u0027antinormal\u0027), and translate it until the docking ports are on the same line. My recommendation is to do this one axis at a time (first only JL keys, until that\u0027s aligned, then IK keys until they too are aligned, then some fine-tuning - again one axis at a time -\u00A0if necessary).\u00A0After you achieve that,\u00A0it is just a matter of moving forward.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not sure I understood your comment about what happens when you decouple - do you mean that you decouple a small part of the larger tug, which then suddenly docks without problem? That would be in line with what I suggest: that smaller part is a LOT lighter, and the docking ports can pull that into alignment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[edit] Obviously, when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is not distributed around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, you can still translate, but that will also cause a rotation on\u00A0the ship. This rotation can then\u00A0be prevented by just putting a lot of reaction wheels on the ship. But that is really just a medicine for a problem that you can easily avoid.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-23T14:28:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2016 02:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Magzimum\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadding another comment\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hydrothermalventclam","CreatedById":167200,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T14:49:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, it looks like your docking ports are not aligned well. \u00A0On smaller ships, this is not as important, because the magnets can pull your ships into the right orientation, but with larger ships you have to be super exact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trakt","CreatedById":170698,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T19:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the replies, but they don\u0027t even engage when they actually touch, without an angle (I put some better pics up).
