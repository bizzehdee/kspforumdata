The Mk2 cockpit (and nearly all of the other spaceplane parts) have a heat tolerance of 2000K.\n\nI then replaced that with a Mk1 command pod, which has a heat tolerance of 2400K. The plane was able to reach 1300 m/s in level flight, and got up to 1450 on descent before bits started popping. But, of course, it was still primarily constucted from other spaceplane parts which go up to 2000K, same as the Mk2 pod.\n\nWhat exactly is going on here? Is the pod \u0022absorbing\u0022 the bulk of the heating because it is at the front? Or does the game actually simulate a shockwave such that the frontmost part doesn\u0027t just absorb the heat, it also to some extent protects the parts behind it (as long as they are far enough back, ie, \u0022inside\u0022 the shock cone)?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T14:39:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 02:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran**"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T05:09:16Z","Content":"I\u0027m not sure it does any supersonic stuff, doesn\u0027t seem to be a flight regime change; FAR does model a shock cone but the effects aren\u0027t as big as you\u0027d think really."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T06:06:29Z","Content":"There is some element of the game trying to simulate shock effects. Also, the different parts have different conduction values and different heat capacities. So you may be hitting a combination of all of those things.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:14:26Z","Content":"Yep, bluntness will matter, and there\u0027s some occlusion going on too looks like."}]}
