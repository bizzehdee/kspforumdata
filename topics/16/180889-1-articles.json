You can\u0027t \u0022see\u0022 Kerbin from where your ship is currently sitting (you do not have LOS).

The Mun is blocking your signal. and since it\u0027s tidally locked, you have a real problem on your hands. You could send up a relay sat, BUT you could also theoretically fly the ship over to the Kerbin side of the Mun. You mentioned that you wanted to do an \u0022exploration\u0022 mission - does this mean you would fly the ship to other biomes? Or does it mean you would send \u003Cem\u003Eanother\u003C/em\u003E mission to the Mun to explore? Regardless, do you have some fuel left in your lander? You could also quicksave back to orbiting the Mun or landing on it so you can touch down in a connect-able spot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
