Because you\u0027re not doing a Hohmann transfer, these classic launch windows are not useful to you. However, it is useful to realize that there are also launch windows that do work for you - they\u0027re just \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C/em\u003E ones. Because your transfer is different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you need to do, then, is to find your launch window. You do this exactly the same way you figure out launch windows for Hohmann transfers that cannot be eyeballed or do not happen to be preprogrammed into Kerbal Alarm Clock: you use a porkchop plotter. My favorite one is here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt includes only stock planets, for now. We\u0027ll get to that part later. For starters, select something like Eeloo. It works as an example. Check the box for \u0022no insertion burn\u0022, and just press \u0022plot it\u0022 and let it spit out something. What you have just received is a standard Hohmann transfer window from Kerbin to Eeloo. It will be visible as a spot selected inside a blue zone in the colorful porkchop plot at the bottom. Blue means it costs the smallest amount of dV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut \u0022smallest amount of dV\u0022 is not your concern, is it? You want to fly a high energy transfer. You\u0027re willing to throw dV at the problem. What you\u0027re interested in is \u0022shortest travel time\u0022. And in that porkchop plot, the travel time is the upright, vertical axis. If you want a shorter transfer, you can simply click anywhere in that plot, at a spot that is \u003Cem\u003Elower down\u003C/em\u003E than the spot the calculator preselected. The further it is down towards the bottom, the shorter your trip will be. Ideally, select a spot with a color that is also indicative of (relatively) low dV costs. You are still looking for the optimal moment in time to leave, after all. And the \u0022moment in time to leave\u0022 is the bottom, horizontal axis in the plot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, instead of clicking around in the plot and guessing, you can have the planner spit out a high energy transfer by default. Click the easily overlooked \u0022show advanced settings\u0022 link above the \u0022plot it\u0022 button, and you will get the ability to specify your minimum and maximum acceptable travel time. Set that to your desired values, set earliest and latest departure time based on where you are in your savegame and roughly when you want to fly this mission, and then, plot it again. The calculator now finds you the cheapest possible transfer window in the time period specified, which will not exceed your maximum acceptable travel time. It\u0027s common here, if you\u0027re aggressive, to find the calculated solution plastered against the very top of the porkchop plot, indicating that you\u0027re really flooring it and all the cheaper solutions are slower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUp next, look at the list of \u0022Selected Transfer Details\u0022. The entry for \u0022Ejection dV\u0022 has a little blue info button right next to it. Click it. You get a little pop-down showing a prograde dV, a normal dV, and a heading. If you actually want to fly this transfer ingame, you launch your ship into orbit - the same orbit height you used for calculating the transfer in the planner! There, make a maneuver node, and give that maneuver node exactly the normal dV shown, and then add prograde dV until the node\u0027s total is exactly the value given for Ejection dV. Then, if the time of the transfer has come, all you need to do is to select your destination as a target, and move the node around in Kerbin\u0027s orbit until you get an encounter. (You could technically try and find the precise angle with a protractor, or use an addon like PreciseNode, but this method is simple and works for a stock install.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t want to circularize your New Horizons style mission, well, be prepared for trouble! Because the transfer window planner assumes a circular orbit, you will have to add additional dV to your planned node to offset the fact that you\u0027re not yet in orbit. (In other words, you don\u0027t save any dV in this approach. At all.) How much extra? I can\u0027t tell you, and neither can any calculator, because it depends on how you flew your ascent, and how much dV you would need for the circularization burn you are deciding to skip here. So yeah, I recommend against this. But if you absolutely \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E, then it\u0027s probably required that you use a different spacecraft - like a small probe in the correct orbit - to practice setting up the node and getting the encounter before you launch. Remember that you can shift your node forward in time in increments of one orbital period. You\u0027ll need to do this to accurately simulate a node for a craft that has not yet launched. A large problem here is that you must first find out where in orbit around Kerbin your ship actually needs to be to start the burn, because that informs how the planet must be rotated at the moment of launch so your non-circularized spacecraft is actually in space at the same location as the node after finishing the gravity turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you are perfectly capable of plotting and executing exactly the transfer you need to get to Plock. Except... how can you get a transfer planner that includes Plock?! Conveniently, alexmoon\u0027s transfer planner is also available as an ingame addon, called simply \u0022Transfer Window Planner\u0022. It works exactly like the website, and unless I completely misremember here, it should automatically pick up on all planetary bodies present.

before launching, do a big approximate burn, then do a fine-tuning burn a while after that in order to get your trajectory just right.\u00A0 It\u0027ll be more finicky, more trial-and-error, and will likely cost you more dV that way.\u00A0 If you do go that route, then you want to launch when Kerbin is between the 3 o\u0027clock and 4 o\u0027clock position around the Sun (if Plock is at 12 o\u0027clock), with your craft at between 3 o\u0027clock and 4 o\u0027clock position around Kerbin.\u00A0 That way you\u0027re adding both your ship\u0027s orbital velocity around Kerbin, and
