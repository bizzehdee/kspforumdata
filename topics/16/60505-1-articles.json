At exactly 1 your rocket can \u0027hover\u0027 but not accelerate against gravity. Most people recommend a launch TWR of 1.6 - 1.7 because that lets the rocket accelerate through the high-gravity, thick atmosphere reasonably quickly. In the game as it is you\u0027ll have to do the book-keeping of your mass and your engines\u0027 thrust to work this out.

I think I see what you mean. You don\u0027t want a total copy-me instruction set, but you\u0027d like to know some concepts to consider so you\u0027re not flying purely blind. I\u0027ll list a few to help out. And I agree that Werner Von Kerman and Scott Manley are good resources on YouTube. These really helped me get over the hump using maneuver nodes early on and later rendezvous and docking (it felt impossible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway... some thoughts on learn-as-you-go:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Learn your gauges... they tell you a lot and most are ignored. Example: The atmosphere thickness gauge at the top let\u0027s you know the air resistance. You don\u0027t have to have someone tell you the numbers... you can see this yourself realtime! Add to it homework reading from NASA... speed and air resistance in low atmosphere, gravity-turn, when/why to throttle up (and why they don\u0027t just have it \u0022floored\u0022 the whole time), etc. Then use the book smarts w/ the indicators in-game to create your own concepts. And remember, Kerbin\u0027s size, gravity, atmosphere thickness are different than Earth, so copy NASA in concept only... their exact math won\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Heat happens three ways that I can tell... direct contact with a hot part (can be a problem), radiant (not a big deal but not ignored), and by exhaust (almost always a problem). So, space your engines out and they won\u0027t overheat, test to see if they start to overheat but don\u0027t actually blow up. See if you can use seperators so hot parts don\u0027t touch or a heat-sink... something to absorb/spread the heat (a big metal part takes more heat from an engine than a non-metal part). Put a decoupler on one stage and the engine start on the next so you can space the timing and avoid explosions... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) ALWAYS LOOK AT THE WEIGHT OF PARTS. I can\u0027t stress this enough as it\u0027s not always obvious visually for given size/materials. It\u0027s easy to just keep piling on parts and you\u0027ll end up overbuilding badly. This compounds problems when trying to reach a new personal goal (farther planet, heavier lander, etc). Again, you don\u0027t have to calculate it, but if you always think, \u0022could I do without this or use a lesser part?\u0022, you\u0027ll be on a good path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Use probes when trying something new. These can be SUPER light, often handle easier and require less resources than manned capsules... good to learn concepts w/ less complication/weight. So, while you\u0027re learning, think of not killing Kerbals for the sake of skill advancement :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Build w/ modular parts. Save \u0022tops\u0022 of rockets as something like \u0022One Man Orbiter\u0022 or \u0022Unmanned Science Lander\u0022 and then label it\u0027s contents in the description, then a full launch version when you have booster, orbital, transfer stages and maybe add a \u0022FULL\u0022 suffix so you know that\u0027s a launch ready version. While building though, save the (usually bigger/complex) booster stage for this as something like \u00221m LKO booster\u0022 or \u00223m Heavy Asparagus Booster \u0022 and save that to the sub assemblies. You can then mix/match chunks you know work well and speed up your build-to-test time versus buld-from-scratch every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Don\u0027t just add more struts on a problematic rocket. It\u0027s an easy \u0022fix\u0022 but actually does add to the weight, air resistance AND the part count. Sometimes you can build a more orderly rocket and reduce complexity. That said, struts are vital... just think of the physics of push-pull (they seem to only work that way... not torsion or flex... just tension/compression) and use them sparingly when you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Print up the controls/keybindings for the game and keep it handy. Example: You probably don\u0027t use RCS translation controls yet.

Weight, Thrust to weight, Delta V (learn what Delta V is!) for each stage.\u003Cp\u003EOnce you know how much Delta V your craft has and how much DV it takes to get to orbit it becomes a case of just slapping stuff together and getting it to orbit and then the system! It quickly becomes second nature\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis a million times. Many think using some addons is \u0022cheating\u0022, however, unless you are already a rocket scientists, you will be unable to get all this information and still have fun. Remember, ALL this information is figured out months ahead of time before any real life rocket is ever built. Why should we build rockets blind in KSP? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow whether you want to use the auto-pilot functions to fly the rocket without any user input, that is up to you. Some people use it only after they mastered certain tedious and boring techniques because after you have gotten 100 rockets into stable LKO, it just gets repetitive. Others use it for harder maneuvers, to learn what is going on so they can try and emulate it. I tend to use it right now just for assistance, when I take off I set it to keep a 90,90,90 orientation off the pad, and manually do the gravity turn and all orbital burns to make a stable orbit. If my rocket is not designed well, then even using the A.S.S assistance in mechjeb, it will not fly straight. Just again, it takes away the tediousness of the boring parts of take off, especially when I am learning to dock and will do dozen of identical take offs as i fail my docking attempts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd again, the raw information you get from Mechjeb while building your rocket, and while flying, make the game more dynamic to me. It is less guessing at this point and more science. You can see the effect changing fuel and engines and parts has on performance. And if you are in career mode (I HIGHLY suggest this, you learn to do more with less real fast) then you don\u0027t vne unlock the more powerful functions of Mechjeb until later in the tech tree, after you have already learned to do a lot of flying hands on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-20T22:27:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2014 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by jedensuscg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverchain","CreatedById":83000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T22:56:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe single most important thing if you want to understand rockets is to learn what the rocket equation \u003Cem\u003Emeans in practice\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a nutshell: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe \u003Cstrong\u003Emore fuel\u003C/strong\u003E you have, the \u003Cstrong\u003Ebigger a change to the speed\u003C/strong\u003E of your rocket you can make \u003Cstrong\u003EBUT\u003C/strong\u003E it is subject to \u003Cstrong\u003Esevere diminishing returns\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach type of engine has an efficiency rating, its specific impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe \u003Cstrong\u003Ebigger the specific impulse\u003C/strong\u003E of an engine, the \u003Cstrong\u003Ebigger a change to the speed\u003C/strong\u003E of your rocket you can make\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - you have a rocket, and it can make a change of speed (delta v) of 2000ms-1, say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou put some more fuel on it.
