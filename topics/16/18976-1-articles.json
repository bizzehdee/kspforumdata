My first attempts failed miserably, as you might imagine. So I searched the webz for tutorials, watched some youtube videos, read through a couple of helpful topics here on the forums. After applying all of the knowledge I gained to my designs, I managed to create a working plane, take off and even land (although the engines break off on touchdown every time). With this, my ambition soared, and I aimed for Kerbin orbit. This has, however, proven to be quite problematic. Could any of you experienced spaceplane designers take a look at my attempt and try to point out design flaws?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the five series of my planes, but it\u0027s the first that is designed for going into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 5.0, inspired by the magnificent men in their flying machines, crashed and burned at the end of the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AqL8W.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AqL8W.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 5.2 took off quite well, handles pretty decently in the air as well.
