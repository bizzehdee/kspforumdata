Add a fudge factor to that in case you need to do some corrections mid-flight or suddenly develop a need to head home. I\u0027d say round it up to the nearest multiple of 100 and then add 20% just to be safe, so pack whatever stage you\u0027re using to get there with about 1,200 dV, and Bob\u0027s your uncle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, not that Bob.
