You wait for AP, and burn retrograde until your PE is where you want. You AP should not change much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow if you are on a hyperbolic orbit and want to set your PE at the right altitude for aerobraking, you should go for radial burn the farther you can from your target body (even outside \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom you screenshot, I think it\u0027s too late for a cheap radial burn : you\u0027ll loose much more than you\u0027ll gain from a lower PE circularization. Just burn retro at PE, then adjust your altitude by another retrograde burn when you\u0027ll be on a elliptic orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOTOH, if you\u0027re not on efficiency (have plenty of fuel), just burn radial to change PE and then retrograde at PE to circularize, it\u0027ll be quicker\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW : you could also do a direct landing. Set your PE near the surface, set a node at PE, pull it until it flips. the start landing at the count down = burn time.

At the edge of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, radial is definitely a lot cheaper, and you are still on an escape trajectory, which favors the radial burn.

Make a maneuver node, use a radial vector to lower your periapsis to 10 km. Then make a second node at that periapsis and circularize. Add up the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of both nodes, then remove them. Next, made a node at your flyby periapsis and use a retrograde vector to lower your periapsis to 10 km. Again, make a second node to circularize.
