I\\\u0027ll also be showing how to use the new trim controls, part rotation and symmetry modes that have been added.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpfZnClxvgQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThis is the first tutorial in regards to modding for KSP .15.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve these videos. I\\\u0027ll be covering more advanced topics in the coming weeks, including setup of emissive shaders and Unity Animation on Parts.

I\\\u0027ve noticed the physx simulation is basically *the* performance sink in this game (and I imagine any simulation based game built on Unity). I don\\\u0027t have enough experience to know, is the number of polys in the collider going to add \u0027significantly\u0027 to that performance hit? If I were to create, say, a 12 tri cube to surround the gear bay, would it boost the performance (measurably)? I\\\u0027m mostly referring to assemblies with many parts. Is the number of colliders more important than the number of triangles building up those colliders? For instance, considering 6 72 triangle colliders versus 36 12 triangle colliders; would there be a noticeable difference? Should I take considerable time to optimize the collider?"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T11:08:11Z","Content":"Not too sure about this, but I guess the more triangles a collider contains, the more time it requires to detect collisions, though I don\\\u0027t know for multiple colliders.\n\nI also have a question for you, C7: How do multiple colliders work in a single part? In the video, you make a convex collider for the gear bay, but how does it not intersect the wheel\\\u0027s collider when it retracts? Or are colliders in a single part allowed to pass through one another?"},{"CreatedByName":"C7Studios","CreatedById":3895,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T14:20:34Z","Content":"Here\\\u0027s an example from Unity itself. You can have multiple colliders linked to one rigidbody, and they will not cause a collision with each other. The forces of impact with another body will transfer to the core rigidbody. Essentially a wheel collider isn\\\u0027t a \u0027real\u0027 collider anyways. But even it if was, it wouldn\\\u0027t be a problem.\n\n![class-BoxCollider-2.jpg](http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Images/manual/class-BoxCollider-2.jpg)\n\nMesh Colliders are very \u0027heavy\u0027. The more triangles they have the more vertices that need to be checked against etc. Unless your model is perfectly convex and made of perfect quads, you can expect it to get a little messy when Unity processes it. In most cases its faster to use multiple primitive colliders, since the internal bounds are easily \u0027known\u0027. The case above is likely more efficient by far then a mesh collider would be. I\\\u0027d like to use more compound primitive colliders like this, but its difficult to do with the new part attachment logic."},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T18:27:17Z","Content":"Ok.
