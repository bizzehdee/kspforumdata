Regarding the fairing issue, I don\u0027t think it is ship-dependent, I think it is load-dependent. See, once you reload a ship with a fairing, \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E happens to it, don\u0027t ask me what. You can no longer click through it like you can on first load, and apparently from what you say here, the whole thing becomes a solid part with a single collision mesh. Probably in order to become less computationally intensive, not being hollow. Things I think you should try, to poke the thing into revealing more:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Do the whole thing after a quicksave/quickload, see if you can still take out and put back in the payload without issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Do the whole thing after a quicksave/quickload, but taking the payload out before the reload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Do the thing with another independent craft, but without unloading this one (the whole flight form launch to rendezvous and payload change without changing vessel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-There is some kind of mod to check part mesh geometries in flight, that could shed more light into the issue... but for the life of me, I can\u0027t remember the name. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/50750-azimech/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002250750\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/50750-azimech/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Azimech\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E \u0026amp; co. used to use it a lot to build stock bearings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRune.
