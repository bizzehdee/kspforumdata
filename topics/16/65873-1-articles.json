Here\u0027s my initial take on how to approach this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I think it\u0027s going to be difficult if not impossible to get a rescue craft to them while still in Kerbin SOI. So you\u0027re probably looking at a rescue ship capable of intercepting them in Kerbol orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I\u0027d have your rescue craft be light, and extremely maneuverable. RCS, SAS, and efficient thrust are going to be essential. After you pick up the crew, that portion of the rescue craft really only needs enough fuel to get back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I\u0027ve never tried to capture a Kerbonaut with a dead RCS tank. I\u0027m thinking I would put a LOT of extendible ladders on my rescue craft, and extend them all as you get close to your floating crew. That would increase the odds of getting a \u0022Grab\u0022 message.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Make sure all the ladders lead to a path to an entry point, because you still can\u0027t RCS over to an entry hatch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Seems obvious, but make sure your rescue craft has ROOM for your two floating crew. Maybe use the 3 man pod, with only one seat occupied. Or even a couple of external command seats. Forgetting to leave two seats empty at launch is exactly the sort of thing I would be likely to do. And then not realize it until I captured my crew...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T15:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell you could fix it with the cheat menu (alt F12) to turn on infinite EVA fuel/infitine rocket fuel.\u003Cp\u003EIt is extremely difficult to save a kerbalnaut without EVA fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the future, I\u0027d suggest always quicksaving before doing such stunts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf would be a cheater,I wouldn\u0027t ask such a question \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell,I have a quicksave,but I\u0027ve been in even harder situations than this one,so I don\u0027t want to miss the fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just need an advice in what way should I do it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T15:13:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JiWint\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JiWint\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShould I try to catch them while they\u0027re still in kerbin or when they\u0027re in the kerbol orbit?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry for in Kerbins SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve only done this once, and it did work, but I got it done just as I was leaving the SOI and then I had to burn like hell to get back to Kerbin (which is why you should use a nuke and take pretty much nothing but fuel)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T15:16:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WhiteKnuckle\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WhiteKnuckle\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETry for in Kerbins SOI.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve only done this once, and it did work, but I got it done just as I was leaving the SOI and then I had to burn like hell to get back to Kerbin (which is why you should use a nuke and take pretty much nothing but fuel)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to test it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I can finally find an use for my hyper speed rescue craft...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to tune up some action music! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T15:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr, you could \u0027cheat\u0027 and edit the safe file, putting some RCS back in the crew, and fuel in your vessel.
