I tried subassemblies, I tried merging. I tried stack decoupelers, I tried redial decouplers, I tried docking ports. Nothing wants to stick. I cannot even seem to add a docking port onto a docking port in the SPH.\n\nI can add a decoupeler directly onto the hanger by itself, and then stick an engine on that, and so on and so forth. But there does not appear to be any way to add pre made assemblies."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T00:10:30Z","Content":"Your premade assemblies need to have a root part (the main part you attach by) that has a free node. If this is not the case, then it won\u0027t work. Also, plz throw us some pics of exactly whats trying to be done. We can be much more effective in troubleshooting your dilema."},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T00:11:04Z","Content":"Try making a root part of the probe some wild thing like a strut or something, then save the rest of the probe as subassembly. Usually does the trick."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T00:14:39Z","Content":"For me at least, the merge feature is completely broken. I would use the old subassemblies. \n\n- For that, go to the big black arrow, then the green button on the bottom left. You should see a drop subassembly here to save box. \n\n- Now, use the select root mode (right of the rotate mode) to rearrange the craft you want to save. Make the part you want to attach to be the root, by selecting the part next to it then the part you want to be root. \n\n- Then pick up you subassembly craft by the root and drop it on the save box. Now load your main craft, select the saved subassembly, and you should be able to attach it by that root part."},{"CreatedByName":"wisnoskij","CreatedById":143705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T00:54:47Z","Content":"Ah, I had no idea about this root part thing. I always wondered why the subassembly window rejected most of my designs.\n\nNow All I need to figure out is how to fit it, it is rather wider than I thought (and impossible to balance). Do I read this right? The Narrow band scanner does not do long term mapping, it is just for real time looking closely at landing sight locations?\n\n![11054825_10153313284299242_6730053254935384362_o.jpg](https://scontent-lga1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/t31.0-8/11054825_10153313284299242_6730053254935384362_o.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T01:01:04Z","Content":"While I still haven\u0027t unlocked it myself yet, the narrow band shows a small window of the resources on the planet in greater detail.
