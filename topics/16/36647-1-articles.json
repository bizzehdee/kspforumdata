At the moment, though, I am more focused on making just a simple jet, mainly something that I can fly from KSS to the secret runway and land. I designed a plane that can take off between 50 and 80 m/s and the ASAS I have installed helps with that initial bearing. However, my plane seems to always veer downwards as soon as I disable ASAS to make any kind of bearing change. Is it even possible to perfectly balance a plane? Currently, my CoM is ahead of and above my CoL. Is this the ideal configuration? Should I use more control surfaces? More lift surfaces? Any advice is much appreciated as I am out of my comfort zone haha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snooze","CreatedById":67712,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T01:30:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse ALT\u002BW/S to set trim, and try not to use ASAS on spaceplanes.

I use it all the time and I\u0027ve gone all over Kerbin\u0027s SoI with my crafts with little trouble. Avionics packages just seem to make my planes dive, or flip out, or do anything besides go forward which is usually what I want. I mean, I can see how having to choose between having your heading absolutely locked or free to blow in the wind could be an issue, but it\u0027s usually not, especially with trimming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I need to experiment more, but I\u0027m interested to hear an experienced opinion on the matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snooze","CreatedById":67712,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T04:59:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on how much control you want to have while your ASAS or Avionics Package is active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Avionics you can exercise a great deal more control than you can with ASAS. Personally, I prefer my spaceplanes to handle like planes and not as rockets with a unconventional flight path. That\u0027s not slighting ASAS in any way. I have some designs that use it. But for smaller, one-person planes designed to get into LKO, change out crew, and return?

It will make life both more interesting and real-world research more applicable. pWings will also make your life much less painful. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, you\u0027ve probably built your plane to be too stable and/or have zero AoA when the nose is level. I would suggest canting up a wing section ahead of your CoL and down behind your CoL, like so \\____/ (vertical scale exaggerated) to help provide a natural pitch-up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PixelStache","CreatedById":73900,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T05:12:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the new asas systems of .21 it\u0027ll be a lot easier to use planes, as there isn\u0027t as much jerking around. Like Snooze says, holding alt while pitching up or down will trim your controls to hold a direction constantly, which helps. In general though, I\u0027ve found that smaller planes are much more predictable, and keeping the CoM and CoL in line with the engines at the center of the fuselage will make things a bit easier on you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you finally take on the challenge of getting an SSTO plane from the runway to orbit, take a look at harvesters post from a while back. It helped me out tons!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
