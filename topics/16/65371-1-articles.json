You\u0027re going too fast\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You\u0027re hitting some part mounted too close to the hatch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor #1, you have to go very slowly in EVA. Never hold down an EVA movement key, just tap them, to keep from getting going too fast. Also be sure to hit L to turn on the Kerbal\u0027s headlights. This is very useful for judging distance and approach speed as you get near the hatch. If you\u0027re going slow enough, you can often get into hatches that are otherwise obstructed by nearby parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor #2, if going slowly doesn\u0027t work, you\u0027ll have to move the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, it\u0027s best to learn how to EVA on a low-gravity moon instead of in space. On a moon, if you screw up, eventually you\u0027ll hit the ground and can walk back and try again instead of drifting off lost in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T15:55:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like one of two things are happening:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You need to slow down before you reach the ladder/hatch. At high speeds, your kerbals will lose their grip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You have a part blocking the hatch. In this case, you need to place your kerbals so they get the \u0022board\u0022 option while floating in space. This takes some trial and error, so I can\u0027t just tell you a quick way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully your problem is the first one -- the second is much harder to fix.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T15:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBTW, it\u0027s best to learn how to EVA on a low-gravity moon instead of in space.

Get the pod into orbit, then practice some EVA with it, for a while. (In fact, you can get some Science while you\u0027re out there, if you\u0027re playing Career Mode).

This should solve spinning. To fix bouncing off: When exiting the cockpit, leave the ship vertically up and down.

The object of the training, though, is to get the feel of gentle translations forward/backwards and left-right, combined without to move the camera around. You\u0027re not going for speed, so usually you don\u0027t have to worry about leaving Minmus. Just bump yourself up a few feet off the ground and move around laterally, like flying in a square around your lander or a nearby boulder. Then try to get into the lander\u0027s hatch without using a ladder. Only thrust up periodically to stay off the ground and never get going fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
