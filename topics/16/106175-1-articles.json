Use the big clamshell thingy in polar orbit. This gives you a very vague, low-res indication of the general area where you might find higher concentrations. It takes about 10 seconds and does the whole planet. Some folks have a problem with this but I see it as an abstraction of the centuries of prior observations with ground-based telescopes, spectrometers, etc., which for some reason you don\u0027t have in the game already.\n\n2. Land something with the surface scanner in one of the areas where the concentrations look denser. Move around measuring local concentrations to narrow down the target area. This gives results by the biome you\u0027re currently in, not a specific spot on the ground.\n\n3. Do flyovers with the top-end narrow-band scanner to zero in on the best spots within the high-level biomes identified by the surface scanner.\n\nAlthough there is usually at least a trace amount of ore pretty much everywhere, you go to all this trouble to find high-density areas becuase that increases the extraction rate. The drills overheat the longer you run them, so the faster you can suck up ore, the more you get before this becomes a problem."},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T05:37:05Z","Content":"\u003E EDIT: I\u0027m using the M4435 and there\u0027s no option to perform orbital survey, all it says is activate scanner.\n\nThat would be the problem. The M4435 is the narrow beam scanner used to examine a smaller geographic area, but it can\u0027t do anything until the full survey is done with the Clamshell M700 scanner first."},{"CreatedByName":"anakim","CreatedById":45411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:13:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I put an unmanned probe in a 200km 90 degree orbit.
