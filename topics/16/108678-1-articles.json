Actually, for most players (I guess) the game came first and the science in it after. Knowing the physics will help you, but only when you\u0027ll have played the game for a few 100s of hours then you\u0027ll be able to say that you truly master it.\n\nDon\u0027t worry, you don\u0027t need to be an astronaut or to have a PhD in aerospace engineering to do well in KSP, you\u0027ll learn while playing."},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T23:00:46Z","Content":"For launches maximum effeciency is just below terminal velocity.

I\u0027ve played a mere 87 hours in the game but i want to actually do this kindof science in real life. i enjoy seeing this applied physics and math simulated in game as a way to see the math and science in use. granted it\u0027s just a game but i see it more like a simulator for engineers than a video game. :]"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T23:50:17Z","Content":"Depending on how you define \u0022real\u0022 - we don\u0027t have 3-body (even restricted)! So IMO it\u0027s good for learning basic science, get interested in it, see how unexpected surprising consequence it results in, and then for the more advanced stuff, you need to go back to textbooks.\n\nAnd trial and error - I wouldn\u0027t go to against that. It\u0027s hard to do a design without trial and error, even if you have experience of building thousands of rockets. Real life stuff (not just rockets) would go through countless simulations before a design claimed to be done, and hey our game itself is a simulation!"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T23:54:51Z","Content":"If you\u0027ve gone through he Wiki already, there\u0027s also [The Drawing Board](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28352-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information), which lists a variety of resources, some of which include more math based type tutorials or vids which may touch on the kinds of science you\u0027re looking for."},{"CreatedByName":"justicarab","CreatedById":143434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T01:53:13Z","Content":"thank you guys\n\ni found a delta v mapping for the system, did they discover this by trial and error or is there a really cool equation to calculate this?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T01:55:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 01:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by justicarab**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T01:59:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E thank you guys\n\u003E i found a delta v mapping for the system, did they discover this by trial and error or is there a really cool equation to calculate this?\n\nA combination of both.\n\ndelta-v is easy to compute if you know the orbital velocity and altitudes of the two bodies.

In order to give you the information it can display, it usually has to to use the relevant math equations to solve for the information it wants to show you. This will likely lead you to learn how a lot of Kepler\u0027s orbital mechanics are used in a very practical sense. For example, before it was available in any of the mods, I made my own mod to display your current ejection angle to prograde. It was very satisfying to combine learning orbital mechanics with how to get the information from the game and transform it with math to show what I wanted."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T08:11:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Another way to approach it, would be to understand the source code that is used to make a mod like Kerbal Engineer Redux.

Embracing the math and science behind this game is a great step forward, but you might also consider finding some professionals in the field and sending them some emails. Say you are interested in the field and would like some suggestions on how to get started. We live in a world where too often what you know matters less than who you know. And many career professionals will enjoy hearing from a young person interested in their field. Of course many won\u0027t as well, so you might need to send out a few emails before getting a single response. Maybe google the aerospace engine professors at the university you wish to attend or google some folks from NASA. Or search for a really old person, long retired, who once won a Nobel prize in physics. Good luck and may you be the first human to play a video game on the surface of Mars!"}]}
