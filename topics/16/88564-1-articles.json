If you have 0 payload, and ignoring the mass of the rocket motors, there is a theoretical limit, determined by the mass of a full fuel tank divided by its empty weight. The weight of rocket motors also plays into this: in order to maintain a given minimum TWR, you must have X mass of rocket motor for every Y mass of fuel tank. The fact that you \u003Cem\u003Edo \u003C/em\u003Egenerally have payloads further reduces this ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution is staging: ditching empty fuel tanks (and the rockets powered by them) to start the rocket equation anew. While it does mean you must add more mass for the new stage\u0027s rocket engines and for the staging equipment, removing the prior stage\u0027s empty fuel tanks lets you reset that above ratio. It additionally has other benefits: once you\u0027re in upper atmosphere, you generally don\u0027t need as much TWR, so you can get away with proportionally less powerful engines, and sometimes more fuel-efficient vacuum engines*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Hydrogen-liquid oxygen is the fuel mix of choice for many upper-atmosphere rocket stages, but hydrogen-burning engines tend to have poor sea-level TWR and efficiency. As such, you will often see an RP-1 or other propellant in the first stage, with hydrogen used in the upper stages where the atmosphere is negligible and the rockets can operate with near-100% efficiency. The closest analog of this in stock KSP is the aforementioned LV-N, with its poor atmospheric performance and superb vacuum efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-27T00:42:54Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2014 12:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T14:48:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard of the Rocket Equation (Robert Goddard, right?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TABLE=width: 566]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD][/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]Isp[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]WetWgt[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]DryWgt[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]G (Kn)[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]DeltaV (Kn)[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]Gamma II [/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]320[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]32[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]18[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]9.81[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]1806.183124[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TABLE]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now I\u0027m confused.
