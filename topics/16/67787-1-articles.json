So that gives you a wet (i.e., fully fueled) mass of 15.675 tons and a delta-V of 4620 m/s. The total thrust from the five engines is 250 kN, for a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1.9-11.7. Definitely overkill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first stage, you have an I_sp of a little over 320 (not sure how to average different engines together), a dry mass of 4*1.25 \u002B 0.5 \u002B 25*0.25 \u002B 15.675 tons, and a fuel mass of 25*2 tons. That gives you a wet mass of 77.425 tons, and a delta-V of 3250 m/s. The total thrust is 4*215 \u002B 50 = 910 kN, for a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1.2-3.4.

Well, to design a rocket you need to either do some math, or have it done for you. Kerbal Engineer Redux and MechJeb both do thrust and delta-V calculations for you; unfortunately, they both have compatibility issues with 0.23.5 at the moment. I think there\u0027s a hotfix out for MechJeb, so you might try that one if you\u0027re in a hurry. Otherwise, Kerbal Engineer is more \u0022lightweight\u0022 if all you want are rocket specs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor each stage, from top to bottom, you need to answer two questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDoes the ship have enough delta-V for the maneuvers you want it to do?

You might want more if you want the same stage to take care of, for example, insertion into Mun orbit, but it\u0027s usually more efficient to make that a separate stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo maximize delta-V, you want to pick an engine with a high I_sp rating (the LV-909 is probably your best choice at this point), and you want to maximize fuel while minimizing other mass. Hence my advice to drop the other four engines; they weigh 0.5 tons each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]Does the ship have enough thrust to fight against gravity for launches and landings? This is determined by the ratio of your engines\u0027 thrust to your rocket\u0027s weight, which goes up as you drain fuel. For launch the LV-T30 and LV-T45 are both good choices (the latter is less efficient, but may make your rocket easier to steer). The LV-909 is really too weak to use until you\u0027re already moving at, say, half of orbital speed, and no longer fighting gravity per se. The ideal thrust-to-weight ratio for a Kerbin launch stage is 1.2 when full -- any less, and you\u0027ll waste fuel almost-hovering; any more, and you\u0027ll have to throttle down your engine to keep it from wasting fuel against atmospheric drag. Again, use the minimum engine weight you can get away with -- lighter rockets fly farther for less fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor landing on the Mun, theoretically the same rules apply, except that you want the thrust to the (Mun weight) ratio, which is 6 times higher. In practice, I like to have my landers capable of at least 5 m/s of acceleration (Kerbin TWR of 0.5, Mun TWR of 3), because otherwise you risk not giving yourself enough time to slow down. For a single LV-909 engine (50 kN of thrust) on the Mun (gravity of 1.63 m/s^2), you should be fine as long as your lander weighs 10 tons or less when you begin your descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a general rule of thumb, I_sp and saving mass gets more and more important as you go to later and later stages -- any excess mass in a stage will hurt the performance of that stage and ALL earlier stages, but have no effect on later stages. So make your lander as light as you can, and work backward from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T04:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnless I am sorely mistaken and they have seriously upgraded the joint connections the tops of your first stage are going to flop around like you wouldn\u0027t believe. Also, if you\u0027re not playing with far you can drop the nosecones as they don\u0027t really help much. With the LV-909 in the center of your first stage it will burn longer, meaning you could add a radial decoupler between the girder segment and ditch your boosters when they run dry.

There are 6-8 biomes just next door from KSC (launchpad, KSC, waters, shores, grasslands, highlands, mountains, even tiny strips of tundra) plus you can reach all levels of atmosphere easily. And all of that can be visited and measured within one Kerbin day. When you get to flying beyond Kerbin orbit, you could be able to build asparagus staged rockets already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget Runway!
