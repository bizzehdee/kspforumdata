These are notoriously difficult as the weight changes across the rocket instead of from the top down, moving the center of gravity sideways.\n\nIf you have gone for the simpler vertical construction it may be that your wings are the culprit, as soon as you try to turn they will either resist that turn or flip you over when their angle of attack to the airflow changes, I have had some luck by keeping my craft sideways so the airflow over any wings can\\\u0027t get a grip.\n\nThough it is possible to get into orbit on far less than 11 tanks, it usually requires extensive stripping down on parts and features on the craft to make it light enough to do so, we\\\u0027d really need to see your design in order to help in this case.\n\nNow go to work and try not to daydream of rockets, you have paperwork to do ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T07:26:40Z","Content":"In addition to what sal\\_vager said:\n\nStart small -- you should be able to get to orbit on 2-5 tanks (the LF-T500 tanks, specifically).
