Not including parts packs and some other minor mods, i\u0027ll have FAR, RemoteTech2, Deadly Re-entry, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Real Chutes, and most importantly, Tac Life Support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Kerbal Alarm Clock, i have 9 days to my launch window to Duna. I\u0027ve accounted for what i\u0027ll need to bring for all the other mods, but the part i\u0027m stuck on is how much life support to send up. Of course i could just stick some ridiculous amount of life support on there, but i want to be more precise and also keep the bulk and weight down. How long the mission will take will determine how much i bring, but i\u0027m unsure how long it will take. Of course with the launch window, i\u0027ll be making a very efficient trip there, but what about back? I can leave Duna anytime i want, but i\u0027ll want to feather that line between how quick i return, and how efficient it is to return. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a basic three part ship. They dock together in high Kerbin orbit, and then leave during the launch window. The Orbiter stage has an Interstellar reactor and generator, as well as most of the life support and the scrubbers and splitters for the water and oxygen. Attached to the Orbiter stage will be the Transfer stage, which is just fuel and nuclear engines. This stage will be jettisoned after putting the craft on an aerobraking trajectory with Duna. The Landing stage has everything needed to land and do science, as well as something like 20 days of life support, more than enough to collect science from the surface and return to the orbiter stage. I\u0027ll then leave for Kerbin when it is optimal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most obvious thing to do if you don\u0027t have to worry about life support is to leave Kerbin during the ideal launch window, and then leave Duna for Kerbin during the ideal launch window. Am i also right in assuming that would take the longest amount of time (as far as sensible trajectories go)? Whereas the quickest and least efficient way to return would be to leave during the launch window, and then, in order to come back to Kerbin, burn so your Pe is close to Kerbol and rendezvous on the other side with Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not going to have the Delta V necessary to make inefficient burns back to Kerbin, so how many days of life support am i looking at needing? Does anyone know the number of days if i leave during both transfer windows, and does anyone know how quick you could possibly make a trip to Duna and back? With those two figures, i should be able to determine a happy medium between life support and Delta V. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow long does it usually take you, and what is your usual trajectory?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T04:26:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you looking at the Year 1 Day 59 window? If so, your best return window is at day 273, trip time each way is about 66 days. Maybe 150 extra delta-v would let you cut 15 days or so off that flight or leave early with similar flight times. I\u0027m assuming aerobraking on both ends, if not then your extra delta-v needs will be higher since faster transits mean you have a significant radial component to your velocity ... in any case, 300 days would leave a 20-day margin, more than enough with the windows being what they are.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T07:33:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember, that\u0027s 300 days/kerbal. If you take a 3-man crew, you\u0027ll need 900 days of support (3 kerbals x 300 support/kerbal). A 270-day trip sounds about right, but I\u0027d have to check the math for the phase angles and transits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, all the interplanetary trips are good candidates for the water filters (waste water -\u0026gt; water) and the carbon extractors (CO2 -\u0026gt; O2). I wouldn\u0027t take the splitters, which turn water into O2 and waste. Water is the heaviest of the resources by far, so you plan to turn water into O2, you\u0027re being really wasteful. i see those hydrolysis units as kind of a last resort for O2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe carbon extractors and water filters in TAC LS basically reduce the consumption to 0.1 units/kerbal/day (they intake 1 \u0022used\u0022 unit and return 0.9 \u0022fresh\u0022 units), so you\u0027d need 30 water/kerbal \u0026amp; 30 O2/kerbal with a water purifier and carbon extractor for a 300-day mission. You still gotta pack a full 300 units of snacks/kerbal.\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the transfer, I\u0027ve usually just used typical Hohmann Transfer orbits. These lead to rendezvous with the target body 180 degrees from where they left the originating body. A Kerbin-to-Duna transfer takes 72-80 days (based on Duna being closer or further from Pe at arrival) and ~ 1750 m/s dV (doesn\u0027t include dV for escape velocity, plane changes, aerobraking). A return Hohmann transit takes the same amount of time, and I think about the same dV (again, not accounting for parameters above, but aerobraking at Kerbin is more effective and escape velocity from Duna is lower, so getting back is easier).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-23T07:45:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2014 07:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LethalDose\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T11:48:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot trying to argue, but I thought you can do an IP transfer to Duna in about 65-70 days with about 1500dV?

The numbers I provided are calculated. It assumes starting at Kerbin\u0027s velocity in kerbin\u0027s orbit and ending in Duna\u0027s orbit at Duna\u0027s velocity. Like I said, I didn\u0027t include aerobraking and escape velocity (which is really never the same as kerbin\u0027s orbital velocity). My previous IP trips have been in stock, and I didn\u0027t pay a LOT of attention to travel times and calculated dV. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou say ~1500 m/s, I say ~1750 m/s, thats about a 15% difference. To me, that\u0027s not so different. To you, it\u0027s different enough to point out. /shrug thats cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe differences between the travel times I\u0027d attribute to the difference between making orbit (my calcs) and entering/exiting an SoI (which is where I assume your numbers are coming from, e.g. Duna encounter in 65 days).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven the way I design my vessels, I would prefer to over estimate the dV I need, and this estimate has worked fine for me. I\u0027m aware of the assumptions that I used, and I thought I was clear when I stated those caveats about escape velocity \u0026amp; aerobreaking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure the differences between my calculations and your experiences are valid, and your experiences are probably more valid in reference to the way you do your interplanetary transfers. If you want to provide the details of your transfers to provide some context, we can discuss it further. Personally, I\u0027d enjoy that and it may help the OP design his Duna mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T03:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I did this a while ago...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI packed two of the small radial \u0022life support\u0022 hexcans on the lander.
