It was a Swivel engine 15T ship pushed at low altitude by 2 Whiplash. The lander had to climb up to 500km, where the space station was waiting... Since 1.0 has change aerodynamics this kind of lander may probably have flipped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the vertical air breather was working perfectly. The power is not as responsive as rocket engines, but that\u0027s OK for ascending.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t remember why I didn\u0027t used the rapier, maybe the total \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E was lower ; I don\u0027t know. I think the rapier may have a low thrust on low speed/altitude. That may be an issue. Testing your ship on Kerbin is useful...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an additional advice. If I would redo a Laythe mission, I would do a space plane. It\u0027s not easy to target those island with a regular lander due to atmospheric drag which alter projected landing site. Being able to fly toward an island is definitely a good idea. In any case, having a ship able to splash and take off is definitely a good idea on Laythe...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T14:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s certainly possible, the only real trouble is that the rapier\u0027s thrust is quite poor at very low speeds (i.e. during liftoff). One trick I\u0027ve seen to workaround that is to run the rapier in closed cycle mode until a couple of hundred m/s of speed are accumulated, then switch to airbreathing mode and continue the ascent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T15:47:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut don\u0027t wait too long, or you\u0027re going to lose thrust to altitude faster than you can gain thrust from increased speed... or your air intakes stop collecting enough oxygen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a tricky problem, and not all payloads benefit from an airbreathing launch stage.

Once the ship hits 10 m/s vertical, I turn the ship onto a 45\u00B0 angle and eventually just above horizontal until I hit 400 m/s and point back up to 45\u00B0. I can typically hit around 1200 m/s before open cycle burns out. I then detach\u00A0that stage and switch to the command pod\u0027s engines.
