I needed to create a lot of thrust, and needed a lot of fuel, for a traditionally-staged (non-asparagus) heavy lifter. So I packed a lot of large orange tanks into a shape I was happy with and towered them 3 high, giving some towers 2.5 tanks to fine tune the wet mass of the stage. Each tower terminates with a Mainsail with a sprinkling of other thrusters added in balanced formations to fine tune the thrust. The whole thing is balanced on the launchpad. However, each tower obviously drains at a slightly different rate, so it was in my interest to \u0022pool\u0022 the fuel - to treat the many tanks as one big tank so that the whole thing burns evenly and the stage runs out of fuel predictably. What I tried to do was use fuel ducts heading in both directions between neighboring tanks, such that every tank was in some way connected to every other tank. As you probably know, having more experience, this failed and the thing shredded as certain areas drained faster. Is there an easy way to pool all this fuel? Am I doing it right but missing a connection somewhere? Or will engines always just try to pull from the farthest tank?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-01T18:15:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2014 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CrazyCrazySam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMarked as answered.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T21:20:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPictures may help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo the additional rockets assisting the Mainsails have their own fuel tanks?

A fuel pipe from a full tank to an empty tank will not put any fuel to that empty tank. Fuel pipes are just clues for engines. Because engines are looking for fuel around the ship, select a set of tanks according to a set of rules (involving among others also fuel pipes) and draw fuel from these tanks. As soon as a tank becomes empty, engines re-evaluate their rules and select a new set of tanks to draw fuel from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that perspective, putting fuel lines in both directions between tanks makes little sense in most cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have a set of engines and a set of fuel stacks. And if I understand it correctly, you want to achieve the state when all engines run as long as there is any fuel in at least one of these stacks. You probably also want these stacks to be drawn in a balanced way, i.e. to prevent one side of the ship to be heavier than the other. It does not mean they cannot run empty at different times, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest way to achieve that is to run a fuel pipe from each stack to each engine. Yes, you can end the fuel pipe on an engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond simplest way - assuming you have a central tank - is to put a fuel pipe from each stack to the center stack, then a fuel pipe from center stack to each engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are more ways how to balance the fuel drawing but for more details I need to know more details about design of your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-30T21:39:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2013 09:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrazyCrazySam","CreatedById":99201,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T21:52:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe stage was built to perform similarly to the Saturn V first stage, and as you might expect has a *few* engines.

It ultimately is supposed to let you transfer fuel between containers which are attached with components that don\u0027t allow a fuel transfer (like the metal struts). The pipes will make fuel flow in the direction of the arrows on them. The fuel will flow out of the tank in the retrograde direction of the pipe first. That is if you have 2 tanks with a pipe between them they\u0027ll drain from the first to the second. The second one doesn\u0027t drain yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of asparagus staging (from what I can tell) is to maintain a flat TWR as the rocket launches. You\u0027ll drain 6 rockets with a TWR of 2 but by the time you drain the tanks on the first 2 you\u0027ll be up to TWR of 2.6 or so. You break those rockets off and continue on the 4, back down to a TWR of 2. This burns until you\u0027re down to one rocket with a TWR of 2 for the remaining weight of the rocket. You\u0027ll get the same acceleration with less fuel and hopefully cost than if you just stuck 7 tanks together each with a rocket and let em burn. That by the way is how I\u0027ve been doing it and I\u0027ll describe it below. I personally don\u0027t do asparagus staging as it is hard for the automatic stack control to understand and I don\u0027t like taking 10 minutes to figure out the stack only to find out I have to add a part and it completely resets my stack after I do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy 1.5 rule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you consider the largest tank you have available that matches your rocket\u0027s engine size as 1, the second largest as .5 you end up with the 1.5 I refer to.

Struts may be used to increase the stack stability for long rockets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we go:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T30/45: FL 800 and FL 400. : Provides about 2500m/s deltav at about 2.1 TWR. The T30 has a higher TWR with a lower delta v. Once I have the 45s I don\u0027t use the 30s though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV 909: FL 400, FL 200. If I followed the rule. I personally hate making tall lander rockets and wouldn\u0027t use the 909 for anything else. 1 FL 400 gives 2200 delta V for 1 ton of materal on the craft, enough for a return trip after a Mun landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocomax poodle: The rocomax 1600 matches this like the FL 400 matches the 909. Same purpose, bigger rocket. Also doesn\u0027t follow the rule. If it did it would take the rocomax 800 size as well (that thin one with the same fuel content as the FL 800)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocomax skipper: Rocomax 3200, Rocomax 1600: I primarily use this as an orbit insertion rocket. 2400 delta v for a 15 ton rocket. TWR is fairly low though, only 1.8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocomax Mainsail: Rocomax 6400 (orange tank), rocomax 3200: I call it the Flying cigarette. Used for bottom stacks in a pack of 5 (center with 4 surrounding). Struts must be used to attach the upper stages, otherwise the rocomax decoupler gets crushed under the thrust and the rocket falls apart. Launches up to 50 tons of craft above it (including the weight of the skipper stage). If you need to get more weight than this consider a castle shaped launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith what you\u0027re doing adding extra radial rockets watch your G force doesn\u0027t go too high and keep the large tanks to the bottom.
