If you have a maneuvernode 40min ahead, kerbin will rotate ~40\u00B0, so you can draw an imaginary line from your maneuver node to the center of Kerbin and then 40\u00B0 ahead back to your actual trajectory. The place where the second line crosses the surface of Kerbin, is roughly the position you should aim for with the trajectories mod. But keep in mind, that you have to move your maneuvernode which will be then more than 40min ahead, so your target marker will be again a little bit off. You can repeat this over and over again and your target marker should become more and more accurate (but the marker itself is already just an approximation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t done this before, just a quick thought and maybe just wrong \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: becomes more complicated after thinking about it a bit longer...my first idea implies, that you are in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E but if you are on the way back from another body and perform a mid-course maneuver (or just \u003Cabbr title=\u0022High Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003EHKO\u003C/abbr\u003E), you have to calculate the time until you are entering the atmosphere and approximate the position again...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-18T19:39:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2018 07:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by 4x4cheesecake\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-18T19:54:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you make a node near the impact you can see how long to impact and then use the above to determine how far Kerbin will rotate in that time\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SwissSpace93","CreatedById":179846,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-18T21:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sounds good, i need to try it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut first i need a better Rocket for the KSS flights\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-19T01:01:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Trajectories mod also draws a red X on the ground at the spot you\u0027ll land/impact.

Naturally by the time I reached the mun to rescue jeb, his landing zone had moved into complete darkness. Perfect. In the sarcastic sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst thing I did was set Jeb\u0027s Munar 1 as my target, then got my inclination correct, then began burning retrograde - first to lower my circular orbit to ~15-20km, then when I was nearly overhead of him; as I found doing a burn too early/slowly tends to give you a lot of horizontal velocity - kill the horizontal velocity first, then worry about the vertical. Having a high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E helps with this immensely. Additionally, I made sure to overshoot a little bit so I had more room/time for error. Once I was more-or-less falling directly towards/over jeb, and completely blind as a bat - I couldn\u0027t see any terrain at all, just a black mess - I turned to my navball and the (true height) altimeter/horizontal/vertical readouts from kerbal engineer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI knew burning retrograde would slow me down and make my descent steeper, but I wanted to do course corrections to get closer to my target, which required a bit of trial and error to figure out, but essentially: Wherever you burn around the retrograde marker, you will push that marker directly away from your indicator - the further you turn before applying thrust, the faster you\u0027ll move the retrograde marker around. Then, I simply used this technique to push the retrograde marker towards my target - Munar 1. Additionally, I set my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to radial-out. This meant that after any course corrections I made, the lander would auto-correct to facing directly away from the mun - it was VERY handy to keep my orientation considering I couldn\u0027t see anything. If I flipped the wrong way (I went upside down a couple times), I just let go and the autopilot put me up the right way. Strong \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is critical!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI occasionally flipped to retrograde on the autopilot to help cancel out extra horizontal velocity, but for the most part radial-out was the best choice. Eventually I reached a point where I was coasting along at about -5-10m/s vertical, and ~30-50m/s horizontal, and just sort of glided towards my target. When I finally made landing, I wound up only about 350m away. Not bad for my first time landing anything in pitch darkness relying only on instruments imo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, I got out, dropped a micro-rover, discovered it couldn\u0027t actually move, and then \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E-hopped valentine over to jeb\u0027s lander. Unfortunately it turned out he died and Munar 1 was scattered all over the landing area. Which I guess was from the life support mods and him losing electricity when the sun went under the horizon. RIP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso my rescue mission used up too much fuel landing and needed a rescue mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick album of the screenshots I took: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/7nc8nxN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/7nc8nxN\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-19T08:36:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2018 08:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Boersgard\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
