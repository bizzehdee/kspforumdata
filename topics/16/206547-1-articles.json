You can see examples below - but no matter how I terminate the stack (engine mount, Mk3 to 2.5m adapter, etc) the body parts all seem to *each* generate drag.

I mean, sure, those red arrows look impressive, but the blue lift arrows are also huge; that plane is big, looks like several hundred tons. So you should compare the drag to the weight.
