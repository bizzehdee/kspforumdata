It has an issue in that it always wants to fly crabwise. Here is a screenshot:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/cbsa33e17ihi449/screenshot8.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cbsa33e17ihi449/screenshot8.png?dl=0)\n\nThe air intakes show identical data when I click on them, the engines do as well. I checked all the tanks and they are draining symmetrically. I don\u0027t normally fly planes in KSP so I am inexperienced and am not sure where to look next to figure out the issue.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T23:41:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 11:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Leszek**"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T22:16:50Z","Content":"Center of lift needs to be behind center of gravity.

I didn\u0027t check with the tanks empty but the mass non-expendable mass is forward of both, as the fuel goes down the CoG should move foreward. Finally I am not getting anywhere near empty tanks.\n\nI moved the tail surfaces back a bit and added the smallest fins under the engines. It seems to help a small amount but not much. I am going to pump fuel from the aft-most tank to the fore-most tank to see what happens."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T22:30:25Z","Content":"My educated guess:\n\nKerbin\u0027s rotation speed at the equator is 170 m/s.
