That way, the attraction between the two will lift your rover off the ground, which doesn\u0027t cause much trouble. Doing things the other way around (pulling your rover into the ground and/or trying to lift a very heavy ship) tends to not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: By very slightly, I mean a tiny fraction of the docking port size. Basically, it\u0027s a way to make sure any errors in alignment work in your favor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
