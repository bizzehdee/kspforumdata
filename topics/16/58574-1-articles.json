Doing orbital assembly allows for more efficient (and more enjoyable) launches and increases the amount of \u0027stuff\u0027 that you can potentially take, but think you could manage without doing it. Not saying that would be easy thou. As deadshot says, Tylo is a beast so a single shot mission would be a challenging design and it would be much easier to do orbital assembly for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigdad84","CreatedById":49379,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T07:14:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can get to all planets, land, and return with a single launch.
