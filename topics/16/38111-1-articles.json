Before you can place Sepratrons, you need to know 2 things: where the booster\u0027s empty center of mass is, and where that empty CoM is with respect to the side separator holding the booster to the core. The latter is because the side separator exerts a force and if this force isn\u0027t aligned with the booster\u0027s empty CoM, it will rotate the booster up or down, depending.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, once you\u0027ve build the booster on the real rocket, memorize it or use subassembly loader to save it, then open it as a separate ship in the VAB, starting with a small probe core. See where it\u0027s CoM is, then mentally move that down a bit for when it\u0027s out of fuel (or get one of the empty fuel tank mods and build it empty). Once you know or guesstimate where the empty CoM mass, see where the separator is attached relative to that. Count it s 1 set of Sepratrons and balance it by adding real Sepratrons in the appropriate places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, instead of going to all this trouble, now that you know what the general rules are, you can just trial-and-error it on the launch pad. IOW, eyeball the booster and side separator, put 2 sets of Sepratrons where you think best above and below the CoM, then give it a go. If it swings too much in 1 direction, move the Sepratrons on the other end our or the ones on that end in and repeat. This way is usually faster than trying to figure out where to put them using the detailed method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust remember, it\u0027s a very good idea to slide the Sepratrons toward the outboard side of the tank to keep them from pointing straight at the core tank. Problem is, if you\u0027re doing asparagus, this tends to point the Sepratrons at the tanks of the later boosters. However, 1 fuel tank can withstand brief exposure to Sepratrons once, but the 2nd time usually blows them up. Thus, the later boosters can usually shrug it off but if the core tank keeps gets baked by all the boosters, eventually it will pop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T05:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022birrhan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022birrhan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have eschewed separatrons explicitly because (a) without using them I normally can shed spent stages vertically, without issue, and (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E every time I do try to use them, it results in the aforementioned unplanned rapid disassembly.

Decouplers can throw them to safe distance without problems. But if you need to separate heavy boosters, for example orange tank and Mainsail, separatrons are very useful. I put one separatron about middle of booster so that thrust points about 45 degrees down. It pushes empty booster away and down from main ship. Boosters start to rotate and crashes to each other but then they are at safe distance.
