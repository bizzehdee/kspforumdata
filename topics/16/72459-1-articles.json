To give you an idea I\u0027m an experienced career player and my playthrough of BTSM (just recently finished) took 2 months and I didn\u0027t even finish the entire tech tree (I finally completed my goal of a manned mission to Eeloo without having to unlock nuclear engines which are on the 9th tier and cost 16,000 science to unlock). There are many changes including a big focus on electricity (solar panels do not arrive for quite some time and even when they do they aren\u0027t super powerful) and a simple life support requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want you can read a playthrough in my signature (the first playthrough is an older version so it won\u0027t be a complete spoiler, but if you want spoiler free avoid it).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T18:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a more difficult career mode, then download the Realism Overhaul plugin and all of the required associated plugins.

Then, set up another spreadsheet with a space program containing goals, technology limitations, and a budget that expands depending on those goals. You can have several cost values on a given part that cost less the longer your program runs, and how often they are used. Example, solar panels would be extremely expensive at first, but cost comes way down with time to represent continuing development in their production. That way, you can start your program with a limited budget that at first restricts you to sounding probes that rely on batteries, then later allows you to place probes in orbit powered by solar cells, deep space probes using nuclear power, and eventually start your more expensive manned program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T21:35:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley reviewed a money and contract mod that goes with career mode.
