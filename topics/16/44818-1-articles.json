But still, due to this really small thrust, your maneuvers will take long time periods. Ion engines are used in real life to power space probes (like Dawn or Deep Space 1), and to compensate for their extremely low thrust of 240mN (yes, milliNewton), they can run for years. In KSP, I found them pretty useless, as you can\u0027t warp to high speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkStar","CreatedById":37056,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T13:32:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIons don\u0027t have 50 max power, they have .50 max power.
