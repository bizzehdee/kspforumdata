A major issue for me was that, launching vertically, it was very difficult to balance the thrust (thrust from the shuttle versus thrust from the enormous rockets) to stay pointed skywards. It can be done, but getting it into orbit is a whole different bottle of cats.\n\nThat\\\u0027s my guess. Post a few images or the .craft file and someone clevererer than me will be along shortly to tell you what\\\u0027s wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"hebdomad","CreatedById":16474,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T13:14:03Z","Content":"After some testing it seems the control surfaces on the shuttle are messing with the rocket.\n\nI wished I could turn them off until I needed them because that would save a lot of hassle here.\n\nSo it\\\u0027s either I have a flyable shuttle on a rocket that will want to flip out, or a flyable rocket with a shuttle I can\\\u0027t fly.\n\nAlso, I also wished that KSP had dedicated aileron, rudder, elevator, and flap control surfaces. This would make control surfaces clear and not conflict with each other. Because of this I don\\\u0027t put ailerons on my aircraft because the mess with my elevators.\n\nNo wonder I\\\u0027ve been struggling and cursing the physics. :\\\u0027("},{"CreatedByName":"RealityVeil","CreatedById":25388,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T13:21:52Z","Content":"Gentlemen!\n\nLet me stop you right there. I learned a painful lesson my first few days as a kerbonaut. Attempting to copy an existing real world design is a fools errand. Instead, think outside the box, and don\\\u0027t be afraid to say \u0027SCREW IT MOAR BOOSTERS!\u0027 As I have done many times in the past.\n\nFor example, instead of the spaceplane-over-rocket design of the space shuttle, why not build something more like an SR-71 and strap four liquid boosters to the main fuselage in an X shaped configuration. Is it realistic? Certainly not. Is it Kerbal? Absolutely. Will it be successful? That\\\u0027s the fun! Go find out."},{"CreatedByName":"hebdomad","CreatedById":16474,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T13:35:18Z","Content":"I\\\u0027m not trying to make THE space shuttle. \u003E![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) That\\\u0027s not my style anyway, plus the SRB in KSP don\\\u0027t burn long enough anyway...\n\nMy issue is putting a space plane into orbit using a rocket and launching verticality.\n\nI have one design that kinda works.

Its control surfaces will mess with you, and this can seriously upset it. However, using gimballing engines, and putting the orbiter stages at level with the shuttle will make a lot of difference. The biggest problem you are having is that all your engines are in the centre, and far below the shuttle - this gives the shuttle a very high centre of gravity, resulting in tipping over. You need to bring the centre of gravity to, well, the centre of the ship, and then you need to make the ship as short and wide as possible. Imagine the difference between trying to balance a stick on a stick, and trying to balance a frisbee on a stick. Clearly, the frisbee will be easier - because it is short and wide.\n\nI can also recommend removing the ASAS, and adding normal SAS to each of the orbiter stage collumns. If you don\\\u0027t want the orbiter fins moving, then don\\\u0027t have ASAS. Normal SAS should compensate. This does mean you can\\\u0027t use gimballing engines, but gimballing engines are less powerful anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"BillWiskins","CreatedById":12285,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T14:34:02Z","Content":"Yar, it is more the concept I was after as well, though I will not deny a certain desire for aesthetic similarity..."},{"CreatedByName":"hebdomad","CreatedById":16474,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T14:47:09Z","Content":"I don\\\u0027t think weight balance is the issue here but I\\\u0027ll give the regular SAS a go. \n\nAlso, I think I might have to do some recording and research so I can give some feed back to Squad on this issue.\n\nIt shouldn\\\u0027t be as hard as it is. KSP does not care about aerodynamics so you should be able to put any lumpy brick into orbit.\n\nRockets I can do. Aircraft are easy too. It\\\u0027s just putting that aircraft on top of that rocket that\\\u0027s all being too difficult.\n\nSo at this stage, trying to put a shuttle into orbit is like trying to wash a feral zombie cat by hand..."},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T15:02:29Z","Content":"I think those two wing mounted engines may be your issue, they can easily tip your ship over and unbalance it quickly due to their torque on the whole system.

I\\\u0027ve been trying to make a shuttle using the shuttle type stock parts - the ones with the heat shields - and it\\\u0027s been going horribly wrong. There are a number of things I\\\u0027ve learned by reading the forums and testing myself. I finally got a shuttle into orbit. It\\\u0027s a powered shuttle with a gimbaled engine connected to a tri-coupler and 9 fuel tanks. I used the 175 thrust gimbaled engines and also have a booster stage of 3 solid rockets. \n\nTrying to do a shuttle that was connected side by side to the fuel tanks/engines was bad news. \n\nEverything was going well just after launch, with RCS and SAS on, but then I\\\u0027d get a nasty oscillation from the control surfaces trying to counter a wobble. It eventually caused the ship to start spinning out of control. Once I added an advanced canard to the very front of the shuttle, that gave it enough of a control surface to stabilize the whole thing all the way up. I also removed the rudder and have 2 sets of RCS thrusters near the cockpit. \n\nI haven\\\u0027t tried to land the ship yet, but at least I can get it into orbit with a full tank of shuttle fuel left."},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T06:34:53Z","Content":"The way I found was best was not to put the plane on top of the rocket, but built the rocket around the plane."},{"CreatedByName":"CleavelandTheCav","CreatedById":27055,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T10:48:43Z","Content":"SOrry for the necro but what are the blasters on the bottom?"},{"CreatedByName":"Saaur","CreatedById":4298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T12:58:36Z","Content":"Huh.
