Ok, ok, I\u0027ll be using it elsewhere as well. The concept was to have a science jr mounted on top in the center (center of mass) then attach a coupler to the top of that and detach from a landing vehicle to be designed later. There\u0027s more stuff to go on, but not until I solve this major issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a single girder width rover, but it was too tippy, so I widened it. However, now I can\u0027t find a way to get a mount point on top near center of mass without way too many compromises.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas welcome.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E Craft File here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByOS7LT3mpnBUzJtRC1wMnRTeDg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByOS7LT3mpnBUzJtRC1wMnRTeDg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-17T21:25:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a look at it.
