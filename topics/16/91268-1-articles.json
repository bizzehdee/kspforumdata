While they have been getting better and better every day, one thing id like to know is the optimal number of intakes, and what types of intakes are the bets to use. This assumes stock game, no edits to part properties, no FAR, ect. I also airhog somewhat, although i tend to cut down on intakes, since they are dead weight in space and cut dV alot, although i like to be able to get out of atmo entirely before kicking in the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow ive heard that 8 RAMs/engine are the best in general, but im wondering whether the other types (or perhaps a mix of intake types) can be better, or should i just stick to rams? Also, i dont care about looks/size of intakes as i clip them inside my hull anyways, so its not like that makes any difference what ones i choose. Id just want to know from a SSTO perspective, what is the best layout for getting into orbit, as well as minimizing weight one i get out of atmosphere (obviously the cones have best surface area, but they weight so much more that it feels they do more harm then good at least in the long term, once i am using my nukes in space). Ive made a very good SSTO that used 16 rams for 3 RAPIERS, so it works, although it is a little underpowered at altitudes above 45km (its dragging 20 tons that doesnt exactly have too much lift).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a benefit to storage capacity for intake air as well, or does the only thing that matters is the raw surface area to mass ratio?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, id like to know if there are some differences in intake optimization between the rapier and the turbojet, as im guessing the turbojet can go a little faster and perhaps can squeeze more out of less intakes?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-06T21:10:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2014 09:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T02:20:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is more efficient to use a turbojet or two to get out of the atmosphere then switch to a nuke engine or ion engine to get into fuel orbit.

RAPIERs offer no benefits in this case.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The turbojet is rated for 225 kN (112.5 kN at 0 m/s), while the RAPIER is nominally 190 kN (95 kN at 0 m/s). If you can fly with the same number of turbojets and RAPIERs, choose the RAPIER, unless there are other reasons for selecting the turbojet. If you would need more RAPIERs than turbojets, select the turbojet.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E If you plan on using enough intakes to get your surface speeds above 2000 m/s, use turbojets. RAPIERs lose thrust faster at those speeds.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERam intakes are the most mass-efficient option under most circumstances. When you\u0027re flying at near-orbital velocities at high altitudes, with engines throttled down to prevent flameouts, your total thrust is determined by the number of intakes you have. As thrust is primarily needed to overcome drag, which is proportional to mass, the relevant metric is intakes/mass, not intakes/engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a typical ascent, you might be flying at 1800 m/s at 32 km. Because that\u0027s pretty close to the terminal velocity at the altitude, you\u0027ll need 4-6 kN of thrust per tonne to overcome the drag, depending on the average drag coefficient. A single turbojet can produce 135 kN of thrust at that speed, while a RAPIER can produce 114 kN, assuming that you can provide them with enough intake air. As a rough approximation, any thrust exceeding the drag will make you accelerate. If you can accelerate at 32 km, you can keep accelerating all the way to orbit, because both intake air and drag decrease at the same rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, intake air (and therefore acceleration) decreases exponentially with altitude, halving once every 3.5 km. With 1 intake/10 tonnes, you probably can\u0027t get any meaningful acceleration beyond that 1800 m/s at 32 km. Every time (within reason) you double the number of intakes, you can keep producing the same thrust 3.5 km higher, where the effective maximum velocity is 40% higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHence, assuming that 1 intake/10 tonnes will allow you to accelerate to 1800 m/s in a reasonable time, 2 intakes/10 tonnes will be enough to reach the point where the number of engines becomes the limiting factor again. Turbojets drop linearly from 112.5 kN at 2000 m/s to 0 kN at 2400 m/s, while RAPIERs drom from 95 kN at 2000 m/s to 0 kN at 2200 m/s. While doubling the number of intakes to 4 intakes/10 tonnes will make you accelerate faster, it won\u0027t affect the maximum speed significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the numbers above are rough estimates, because I haven\u0027t used airbreathing engines that much in the stock game for a long time.
