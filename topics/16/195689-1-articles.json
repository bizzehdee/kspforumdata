However I was unable to determine the exact effect of the spread angle which seemed to tail off with the higher symmetry levels (in testing with Mk2-R Radial Mount Parachutes, the cutoff where further angle had no effect was around 8 degrees with 6x symmetry and a 577t mass but around 6 degrees for 8x symmetry with the same mass).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you so far\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-19T01:33:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2020 01:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by AviosAdku\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding findings from RCS Build aid tests to also highlight the question of the effect of spread angle\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrSystems","CreatedById":195047,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-18T14:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy comment here might help:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1152770527\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/179306-19x-stagerecovery-recover-funds-from-dropped-stages/page/4/\u0026amp;tab=comments\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=3536288\u0026amp;embedComment=3536288\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-3536288\u0022 style=\u0022height:295px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizsilveira","CreatedById":202087,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-18T14:59:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/166546-19x-rcs-build-aid-continued-new-dependencies/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Build Aid\u003C/a\u003E has a great parachute calculator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
