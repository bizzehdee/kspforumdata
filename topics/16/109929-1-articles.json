I have a \u0022tourbus\u0022 that seats 18 plebs plus Jeb, and can go to Mun landing \u002B minmus landing and back.\n\nThe Munbase, etc. science type missions seem to never duplicate in the contract list."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T09:17:05Z","Content":"Maybe, but it\u0027s not very intersting. Futher more, Toursits take crew seats, and you can\u0027t get experience from you Kerbals when you go to distant planets.\n\nI had a 6 tourists contract who wanted to go from minmu to mun to Duna. They mostly pay 300k each (1.5M for 1 contract) . I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll take it. Too much of a hassle."}]}
