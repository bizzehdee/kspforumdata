But for some reason, one of the boosters runs out of fuel before the other one, forcing me to eject the first set of boosters early to avoid a mission failure (luckily this thing was quite over-engineered).

The outer engines will draw from the outer tanks at the same rate. The inner engine will draw from the inner tank, then the inner tank will draw fuel via the fuel lines from the outer tanks. You do not ususally need more than one \u0022parent to child\u0022 relationship in a series of tanks.
