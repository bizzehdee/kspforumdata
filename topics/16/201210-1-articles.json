The ablator normally takes the brunt of this. 2) heat transfer by conduction from the surface to the innards; and from connected components. I don\u0027t know the full details of how this is evaluated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it sounds like the heatshield is doing its job but all the while, the command module is getting \u0022cooked\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, there\u0027s a theory that a shallow entry with a long drawn out slowdown is worse, something to do with the overall heating being to the power of 4 of the speed while the instantaneous heating is to the square of the speed. So a more efficient entry is to drop straight down, except it will impose greater acceleration forces and damage components/kill Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe there\u0027s an info page which will show the numbers of the various temperatures of the components too, which will illustrate what is happening too - don\u0027t know the button to press though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-24T15:27:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLander can?

A steeper descent will mean you reach the thick part of the atmosphere sooner and slow down more rapidly, meaning a sharper thermal peak but less overall heating because you slow down quickly, whereas skimming through the upper atmosphere means you get most of the heating but over a much longer time period as you don\u2019t slow down as quickly, which is where parts with low core heat tolerances (like lander cans)\u00A0tend to go boom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-24T15:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mk1 lander can sticks\u00A0out beyond the 1.25-meter heat shield.
