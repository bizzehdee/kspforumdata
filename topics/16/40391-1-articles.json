For this course, I wrote a short research paper on \u0022Unmanned space probes.\u0022 Seems I was curious about exactly the same question at that time. Having grown up watching the original Star Trek and being in elementary school shortly after the Apollo missions, and in High School during the space shuttle\u0027s early work, I was exposed to a lot of TV media that hyped up manned space flight. I was just a bit puzzled why you would send up space craft with no one to control them or seemingly \u0027do\u0027 anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I learned from this paper was that manned space flight was in fact, at that stage (and probably still to a considerable degree today) somewhat useless and expensive compared to what unmanned probes can accomplish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo doubt someone will disagree at least slightly, but I think it is safe to say that most of the actual scientific advances made as a result of Apollo could have been achieved far more cheaply and with less risk to human life using various unmanned probes. Now obviously there are all sorts of indirect benefits from solving the myriad problems of safely sending humans to and from the moon, etc. Just based on those indirect scientific/engineering benefits, I believe all the manned space programs have been well worth it, and indeed wish that humanity could/would put even more focus on promoting and expanding manned space travel. But strictly in terms of acquiring information about the cosmos, unmanned vehicles can accomplish seemingly 95% of the grunt work. Hubble for example, possibly the most \u0027lucrative\u0027 scientific instrument ever in human history = unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn closing, I wanted to share some links to an inspiring pair of unmanned space probes that I think really captures the imagination, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a look over on the right middle of the home page \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Seems they\u0027ve been souping up this page a bit and it is quite nice.
