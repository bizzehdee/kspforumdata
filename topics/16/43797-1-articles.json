I don\u0027t get what I\u0027m doing wrong, can anyone spot the flaw? Here\u0027s my method: I take a single module, and slap Clampotrons on both ends. I angle each docking port two notches towards the top of the module (which I think is 10 degrees). I use Subassembly Manager to copy and paste this module, attaching docking port to docking port each time, with all of the modules oriented the same way.

Personally, I\u0027d put a single, round central part and add hammer-shaped modules(girder/girder/round module surface-attached to the end of the girder) to it in some high symmetry. It will look quite similar to what you probably have in mind, and will actually work, if reinforced a bit with struts between modules next to each other(use symmetry as well, this way you won\u0027t need to manually put every single strut in its place).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dooz","CreatedById":74263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T12:46:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen i made the gravity module for my station i had a core with beams and then the circle stuck on the beams use a core\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T14:49:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you attach parts at odd angles the game seems, for some reason, to pick a new reference frame. In other words, changing one orientation sometimes results in additional orientations changing. To see an example of this take a wing part, attach it to a fuselage like a normal wing. Then shift-rotate it a few times to give it a high angle of attack, say, and then try to shift-rotate it so the wing is swept back, and you will notice that it behaves very strangely. This is what is probably going on here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I suggest you do is this: \u003Cstrong\u003Estart your build in the horizontal plane\u003C/strong\u003E. Build a quarter circle. The alt-click to copy it and attach it with the correct orientation it to get a half circle.
