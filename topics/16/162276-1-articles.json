Good question! Automatic EVA is what happens when you click the EVA button on the Kerbal portraits in the bottom right corner. If your Kerbal is in a part with more than one hatch (like the Mobile Science Lab) then the game chooses for you which hatch the Kerbal will exit from. You can however choose which door you want the Kerbal to exit from by LEFT-clicking on any one of the hatches on the part your Kerbin is in and pushing the EVA button next to the Kerbal\u0027s name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mk1-Crew Cabin has two hatches, but they are on either ends of the cylinder, and usually one or both of them are covered by attached parts. You can only EVA out of a Mk1 Crew Cabin if one of the hatches on the ends is still left open with nothing attached to it. If the door isn\u0027t obstructed then you can LEFT-click on the hatch on the end and choose the EVA button next to the Kerbal\u0027s name. It won\u0027t always AutoEVA from a Crew Cabin by clicking on the portrait because one of the doors will usually be blocked by an attachment point and the game doesn\u0027t know which one you are trying to exit from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf both ends of the cabin are blocked then you will have to transfer the crew into another part with a free hatch in order to get them out. RIGHT-clicking on the Crew Cabin will give you a menu that includes a Transfer Crew button then it will highlight parts that they can move to. If a part has free space it will be highlighted blue, if it is full then it is highlighted red and you won\u0027t be able to move them to the occupied cabins unless you also move or EVA the Kerbin that\u0027s in it first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-19T06:45:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2017 06:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-20T06:41:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223096564\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162276\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221497854304\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146104\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HvP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 19/06/2017 at 3:38 AM, HvP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCabin has two hatches, but they are on either ends of the cylinder, and usually one or both of them are covered by attached parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMHO the top side is a much better place for a\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/151443-13x-mk1-cabin-hatch-v020-3-november-2016/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-20T06:50:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread moved to gameplay questions, since it\u0027s seeking help rather than offering it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cakepie","CreatedById":69278,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-20T09:56:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223096564\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162276\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221497854304\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146104\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HvP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/19/2017 at 2:38 PM, HvP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mk1-Crew Cabin has two hatches, but they are on either ends of the cylinder, and usually one or both of them are covered by attached parts.
