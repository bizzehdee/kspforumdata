Same problem if you use 2xMk3 normal tanks stacked - getting both pylons plus the axial intertank connect is really hard. And yet it can be done! I think I get it right about once in 50 times - so frustrating, even with the hints given here. So here is my solution (if KSP is reading)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is my view KSP should take a leaf out of some of the 3D CAD programs like Solidworks (including using the mouse wheel for zoom \u00A0- why is it up/down for construction but zoom in/out elsewhere in KSP?\u00A0but that is a story for another day.) These CAD programs use the concept of a mate which is implemented only partly in KSP - that is the green/black ball. Every part should have all attachment points and only the attachment points indicated by green/black balls - for circular symmetry these can be proceduraly generated as required on the part if\u00A0available depending on the degree of symmetry chosen. Then it is a simple matter of clicking a green ball, shift clicking another ball and mate! Any other balls that then overlap also mate, and if done correctly, visible bits of the two parts\u00A0can never overlap (an overlap test would not go astray in KSP either, but I\u00A0do confess to making some insanely funny rockets with congruent parts!)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to mates - this idea that all connections go through mates also permits simple generation of the\u00A0structural support tree needed to realistically simulate stress and failure in an interconnected structure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally get rid of the part\u00A0move/rotate/reroute menu. \u00A0right click mouse gives the camera view and its rotation options (you could consider left\u00A0click drag to go from rotate to translate). Holding down left shift should simply switch to moving/rotating the part instead of the camera.\u00A0All done.
