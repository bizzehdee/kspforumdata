Dropped before reaching orbit. If I have any cargo shrouds or the like, I drop them out of atmo here, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd stage boosts to apogee if 1st stage wasn\\\u0027t enough and then performs orbital insertion around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd stage performs the TMI burn to take us to the Mun and then inserts into orbit when we get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd stage then performs the first part of the braking burn and is jettisoned so it will impact the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDescent stage then performs the final braking and descent maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou land on the Mun with no debris left in orbit. All debris is separated at such times when your trajectory will hit the surface of something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd more stages if you need, but I find for most things, anything more than 4 main stages (stages where engines fire, to exclude cosmetic things like panels or aeroshells) is sub-optimal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DavidF","CreatedById":31901,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-12T06:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh okay, makes sense. I\\\u0027ll try it out. I just did a Shuttle Launch which carried two PowerTech Sats to the Mun. Upon takeoff I lifted until the Gravity Turn and aprox 3 seconds after the SRB\\\u0027s disengaged which automatically fell to the earth. I got to approx 90,000 before releasing the Orange Tank (I forget the name) and began coasting to the Apoasis. I continued to watch the Trajectory of the Orange Tank and watched it as it should automatically turn down into Kerbin and it eventually crashed into the water. At this point I had no other jettison events so I orbitted a full circle and went on my way to the Mun. I deployed both Sats after about 2 days in full orbit to give them some space. I made my way back manually and am currently orbitting Kerbin, awaiting \\\u0027clearance\\\u0027 for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
