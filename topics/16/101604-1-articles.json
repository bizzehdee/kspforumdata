My satellite fulfills the hardware requirements and has escaped Kerbin and is now in solar orbit, but the typical target orbit graphic is absent.\n\nIs there any way to get it to show? Quitting and reloading, going to space center and back, flipping views all did not bring up the target orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T12:52:36Z","Content":"I had one of these where the orbit turned out to be very close to the sun - I had to zoom in a long way to see it on the tracking centre screen. I rejected it as I figured the delta-v requirements would be massive.\n\nEdit: hmmm, looking at the wiki, I think an orbit of 35-60 billion metres should be out near Dres.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T12:59:02Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 12:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ElWanderer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thnd3r","CreatedById":137708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T13:34:09Z","Content":"Have you tried focusing your view on the sun?"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T13:39:14Z","Content":"Did you *accept* the contract?
