I have a central rocket comprised of two stacked orange tanks with a Mainsail engine below. This configuration has been radially duplicated and attached so that I end up with a fairly typical 6-way array on the outside, so all 7 tank/engine units are identical. I usually test these locked on the platform to make sure they all burn as expected before I go in and set my asparagus staging fuel lines, and when I did so this time I noticed that two of the outer rockets are burning at a different rate than the others. Again, no cross feeding fuel lines exist - these are all isolated burners. When the first tank runs dry, the remaining six tanks are burning at the same rate, but as soon as that tank empties, the tank to it\u0027s immediate right starts draining slower than the remaining 5. Weird. Any ideas?

I suspect the upper tank of the engine that cuts out early still has fuel in it, which is not getting to the engine below because it believes it has no connection. If so, put some launch clamps on the upper orange tanks to help distribute the weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, it could be something else entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rusty6899","CreatedById":85172,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T18:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat seems pretty bizarre. It seems like the engine that is burning quickly is only using up one of the Jumbo-64 tanks, and after burning out, the other tank above it is being switched to the engine next to it.

Meaning that the top tank and bottom tank are becoming disjointed, but are still attached to the craft with struts. This seems to happen when you stack orange tanks on top of each other. One possible solution you might try is using slack tank staging. Put the extra tanks on the outside of the engines and drop the spent fuel tanks with normal asparagus staging and that should fix this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/902138605379493746/A7EADB68633924C1DFD8A853A53CD007B1D875F7/\u0022 alt=\u0022A7EADB68633924C1DFD8A853A53CD007B1D875F7\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orange tanks on the outside drop as they get depleted so you\u0027re not carrying the excess weight with you. Also, in a stress test experiment that I did, I found that the orange tanks have weaker connections when stacked together than the double grey tanks.
