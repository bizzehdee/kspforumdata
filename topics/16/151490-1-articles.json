UT, and flight time. If you have no vessel, you have no flight time. So the only thing left is UT. What would you revert it to?

Well, there are 2 things you can do. The first is that if you have not switched focus away from your current ship you can revert that flight back to launch. That may not be enough, or it may be too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, you just need to load a savegame that is from before that time that you want to go back to. Do you create quicksaves regularly? Even if you don\u0027t the game does it for you -- but not very often. It helps to have some idea of what the IRL time was, before you missed the window, and you can look at a directory listing to see what the times were of the savegames that were created. In the game folder is a \u0022saves\u0022 folder, which contains a folder\u00A0based on your chosen playername, which contains your quicksaves and another folder called Backup. So look there at the dates of the saved games (the ones with an .sfs extension), and you may just need to try them all to see if any are good enough. To try one out, create a copy of it with a new name in the saves/(playername) folder -- save a copy of your current persistent.sfs, then click \u0022Load Save\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-05T17:04:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2016 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-DDD-","CreatedById":152222,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-05T17:16:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank!
