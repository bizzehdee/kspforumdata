I have been struggling with this problem for hours now and can not make it go away. No matter where I place the flaps on the wing (above, below) and no matter how I rotate the flap when placing it, I can not get that last flap to rotate in the same direction with the rest of them. The center of mass is fore of all flaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img841/393/ysqs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ysqs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img839/4126/0vbn.png\u0022 alt=\u00220vbn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I missing?
