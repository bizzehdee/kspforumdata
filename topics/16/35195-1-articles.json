But not KAS the way you would normally use it. With the newest version there was new code with the plugin that people have started using to be able to remove and replace Any parts on any ship while on EVA. You can literally take the old solar panels off, stick them to the probe, then take the new ones off the probe and put them on the drill rig. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a new mod being developed using the KAS plugin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s called attachment pack, and its currently located in the addon development sub forum.
