Not only may this not leave you with enough to get back, Vall\u0027s gravity is strong enough that the rover is going to take damage when you try to drop it to the surface. Also, Vall is quite hilly and lumpy, and it would be extremely difficult to find a spot flat enough to land on those engines without tipping over. If you had RCS, I would advise you to let the ship gently crash, accepting that this means no return, slowly let it fall to the side, and then drop the rover from that reduced height, but even then, the rover likely to land upside down and you probably wouldn\u0027t be able to turn it over again. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E It looks like your choices are a) attempting to accomplish the mission even though it means marooning the crew, or \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E bringing the boys home while abandoning the mission objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T01:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you land without landing legs?
