Eve is one of the easiest worlds to go to. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT attempt a manned landing mission on Eve.

You can use more engines for a higher TWR (and shorter burns) but lowered efficiency (because of more total mass). For a single lander, ideally you use one and if it\u0027s close and you really want to shorten the burn time, use two. Also, with proper design you can get anywhere and back with a single ship (and no docking). However, remember that Eve return is the hardest return you can do. For the cost (delta-v, the total acceleration) of ascending from Eve\u0027s sea level, you can land on Tylo and come back (and you\u0027ll do it with higher I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iBeej","CreatedById":78998,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T05:16:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEVE is what I call the \u0022devil planet\u0022 because it\u0027s one of the most deceptive planets in the solar system. On one hand, it\u0027s very close to Kerbin and seems easy to land on with its dense atmosphere. But on the other hand, it has the highest gravity of any planet, and while you slow down to a crawl through the atmosphere with little effort, you pancake HARD all of a sudden at only 1km from the surface at only 30m/s, thinking \u0022you got this\u0022. To make matters worse, there is a LOT of liquid covering the planet and can splash down a nicely crafted lander instead of landing it. So your trajectory is also important. Then to top it all off, you have to return home, and we already discussed the severe gravity issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of gravity, I had deployable solar panels on my lander, and after landing and then extending the panels, the gravity ripped them off. lol I couldn\u0027t believe it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use nuclear engines. You don\u0027t need THAT much delta V if you do a direct (non orbit) rendezvous with EVE if you get your phase angle right. It\u0027s actually very easy to reach. Very easy to descend. But it surprised me when I had my side mounted engines at full throttle at only 900 meters from the surface and still coming down at 10m/s. So I deployed THREE side mounted chutes on the lander as well, and I was still coming down fast enough to break the gear (just barely) and I ALSO kicked on RCS, smashed the H key on my keyboard (6 RCS thrusters on the bottom) and started grinding my teeth. The touchdown was beautiful, but holy crap there wasn\u0027t a lot of room for error. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe top portion of my lander is equipped with a large fuel tank and a main sail with no other weight attached to it but the command pod, which gets me in to an escape trajectory to return home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way I can describe the feeling of trying to pilot the atmosphere on EVE, is like a giant magnet.

No landing planned. I managed to get there ok and establish an elliptical orbit that had me swinging in rather low where I could observe the planet and plan for a future landing. The apoapsis of my ellipse was almost to the edge of the SOI so it wasn\u0027t a terribly great orbit. I\u0027d figured the atmosphere boundaries would be higher so I made sure the low point of my orbit was a bit higher than when I\u0027d orbited Kerbin. I set about planning a maneuver to normalize my orbit when I realized I was lower than anticipated. I had the barometric sensor (all the sensors really) on my ship and it told me that I was indeed experiencing... atmosphere. I could have just used that opportunity to aerobrake and normalize my orbit a bit but I was really just starting out and feeling in over my head. I could have raised my orbit a bit when I hit apoapsis so as not to worry about the atmosphere. I screwed up with that and the next thing I know I\u0027m downswinging again and this time I\u0027m experiencing thermal effects.
