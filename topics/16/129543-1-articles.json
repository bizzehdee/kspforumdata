So you want the mirror through a different axis right? Like say top/bottom?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn that case yes, the easiest way is to turn the whole craft via the root part. You can also rotate just the part you want to have funny mirror symmetry and attach radially to that part. That works too while keeping the direction of the mirror normal in the rest of the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI run into top/bottom mirror problem all the time moving subassemblies between VAB and SPH because of that stupid \u0022pitch axis is North-South in VAB but East-West in SPH\u0022 problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
