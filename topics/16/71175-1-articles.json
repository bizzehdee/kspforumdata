Eve is one of the easiest to get to, but the hardest to return from the surface. Moho has the opposite problems. It takes a lot of dV to get there and back. For the round trip (not including what your lander will do), you really want to plan your interplanetary stages to permit at least 10km/s of dV. However much fuel you think you\u0027ll need... bring more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch window calculators will routinely show that you need about 5km/s of dV each way. Again, not including what your lander does. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not so much that the rendezvous itself is hard to do, in terms of delta-V, but when that\u0027s combined with the relative speed that you\u0027ll have on arrival, and how long the burns have to be, it all adds up to a difficult mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I sent a manned mission there, I clearly didn\u0027t have enough fuel for the return trip, even after stealing back as much fuel as I could from the lander. So I sent a rescue ship, which docked, and then stole as much fuel from the mission ship as it could while transferring my dude over. When the rescue ship arrived back in Kerbin\u0027s SOI, and got into an atmospheric entry trajectory, I had only 1% fuel remaining. The rescue ship barely succeeded, and all it had to do was pick up a guy and bring him home, and got a free partial refueling at Moho.
