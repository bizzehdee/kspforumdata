For a Class A asteroid that is on a collision trajectory with Kerbin, I have been unsuccessful in intercepting the asteroid and a lot of the information out there seems tailored around capturing asteroids that will not impact or get very close to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current procedure is the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

If you put it in another spot, your craft\u0027s orbit will be misaligned with the asteroids inbound leg (resulting in no rendezvous).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you saw in my tutorial, I prefer to meet with the asteroid further out. When you do that, you can just sort of initially eyeball getting the orbits to intersect. This gives a lot more time to adjust things but takes longer for it all to happen. Some people prefer waiting until it reaches the SOI but I found that to be a lot more effort with timing and getting things all lined up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe path of the asteroid in that picture does look a bit unusual, but it\u0027s hard to tell from that picture. Is the asteroid just glancing off the side of Kerbin\u0027s SOI? It should still have a low point. If you can\u0027t get perfectly lined up, you should parallel the asteroid\u0027s direction and plane, and matching approximate PE location. You will likely have to zoom out and around a lot to get the axes to all line up. Once you get away from Kerbin, you\u0027ll have to do some midcourse corrections. My emphasis should be on getting a lose to parallel departure orbit setup. You don\u0027t want to angle your PE toward the asteroids PE as that will send you the wrong way. Parallel is better, erroring on the PEs slightly away from each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if that will help...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-19T18:37:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2015 06:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T18:40:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re basically doing the same thing as an orbital rendezvous, though obviously you only have one orbit to do it in, and the target has a rather odd trajectory.
