You\u0027ll need a central \u0022root\u0022 part which doesn\u0027t necessarily need to be a command module. Then, you can use the modular girder segment part and attach those so that they are coming out of the root part horizontally. Next, use the radial attachment point part\u00A0 and place those facing down toward the ends of those modular girder segments. This will allow you to place a part radially that is not designed to be placed that way. I wish I had time to post a picture as it would be much more easily understood but unfortunately work beckons me. I hope what I\u0027ve written helps, and hopefully someone else will be able to respond with a picture for clarification!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-17T15:19:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2016 03:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Justicier\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-17T15:27:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/89671-justicier/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002289671\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/89671-justicier/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Justicier\u003C/a\u003E says, you need to build out somehow since the lander cans cannot connect radially. So you need to build out radially then create something that can node-attach vertically to that. The two \u0022cubic\u0022 struts are very useful for this sort of thing too - they\u0027re very light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other option is to use the smallest 1.25m fuel tanks, surface-attach them and then stick lander cans on top or underneath them. Since you\u0027re bound to need at least some fuel to get down to the surface, this option might end up being the simplest and cheapest overall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, you can use the rotate and offset tools - attach a cubic strut radially to the core, attach lander cans to the node on that (you\u0027ll need to rotate the part before placing it so that it\u0027s facing out). Then rotate them and offset them so that they\u0027re in the right place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-17T16:12:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can do this with no extra parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStack your lander cans vertically and then use the offset tool to move them out and down into position.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike this or however you want them...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LQj6bAT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LQj6bAT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-17T16:21:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2016 04:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
