Also, they are very resistant, which helps with rough landings)\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe problem with landing is that i can\u0027t seem to find a way to lose vertical thrust in a controlled manner. as i gradually decelerate (i managed to put the engine control on the main accelerator) i abruptly go from having full thrust upward to having no thrust upwards at all. Even at 5% power the engines keep me in the air easily, and if i go below that they stop and i drop like a brick. the engines are probavbly overpowered, but they are the smaller available, and 2 engines won\u0027t lift this thing anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlack of fine control is also caused by me getting thrust in unexpected directions. like, i activate the engines normally, and i move upwards and forward. i assume it\u0027s intended, because most of the times you want to move your helicopter in a specific direction. but if i want to cancel that forward thrust, i cannot do it easily. which adds to the landing problem, because if i try to hover stationary and gradually reduce power to the engine, i start moving forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanother thing i noticed is that i\u0027m severely limited in speed. i assume it has to do with blade angle: when the helicopter starts moving, the actual blade angle will be modified on blade speed and air speed according to pitagora\u0027s theorem, and at a certain air speed the angle will become 0 and i will have no thrust. hence why all rotary engines have changable blade angles. however, i don\u0027t have any convenient way to change blade angle in mid-flight. having 4 helixes, i must select them all and change them one at a time, which is awfully impractical at best, when it won\u0027t make me lost control in the first place. with the action groups i can easily change the blades between extended and retracted, and i can use that to change between 2 different angles. but i don\u0027t see how to get better tuning. I think this kind of tuning would also be the key to landing safely. that parachute is meant for an emergency, not as the primary landing gear!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, there\u0027s lots of issues. any help with any of those will be greatly appreciated\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-15T16:42:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2020 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by king of nowhere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-15T16:58:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223838656\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196323\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221597509738\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nafter many trials, and thanks to some advice i got here, i finally managed to make a helicopter that flies. yay!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nunfortunately, i have a lot of troubles landing this thing. or doing any kind of fine manuever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know its not the best info you can get but my advice is....start with a stock helicopter or a simple design that works kinda the way you want and start adding/changing one part/thing at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully more will come here to help with specific info, but i just wanted to say what i usually do, and adding one by one in a working craft and see what goes wrong and right its a good \u0027\u0027simple\u0027\u0027 way to figure out as you go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, hopefully more will drop in here and we learn more specific/valuable info etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-15T16:59:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2020 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Boyster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-22T21:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, i discovered two interesting facts trying stock helicopters\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) all stock helicopters use the KAL controller ( which i haven\u0027t figured out how to use.) to do something with blade angles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, it would seem i\u0027d need to learn the KAL if i want to make helicopters, except that the most important fact is\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) stock helicopters don\u0027t work better than mine. even with those, at the first slight mistake they start going wild and i can\u0027t get them back under control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, it seems it\u0027s mostly to do with my piloting skills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wobbly Av8r","CreatedById":206697,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-23T21:51:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the first time I read your original post, k.o.n. but maybe this can help - you don/t need to understand the KAL-1000 for this, although learning it will definitely expand your ability to make some very cool stuff!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, go to the Actions Screen and assign ALL propeller blades to \u0022Translate U/D\u0022 or \u0022Translate F/B\u0022 so that you can control the pitch of your blades with the \u0022I\u0022 or \u0022K\u0022 keys (if you chose Translate U/D) or the \u0022H\u0022 and \u0022N\u0022 keys if you chose \u0022Translate F/B\u0022.

I have no idea why there are so many ways to invert the blades rotation that all do apparently the same thing. i\u0027m suspecting perhaps they do not do exactly the same thing. i put autostrut on rotors, not blades, as autostrut don\u0027t mix well with moving parts. this setup would fly in kerbin and laythe, but not eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhen i realize a lower blade angle may help in eve, i put on a kal controller, and i set a program to change blade angle from 0 to 15 degrees. i set an identical program for all four blades. i control that manually, adjusting the sliding bar (i can\u0027t come up with a better way to name it, not even in my native language) manually as i go up. and i selected \u0022rigid attachment\u0022 for the blades. that experiment went well, but it drained the batteries too fast. even making a continuous line of solar panels around the ship (which i did, later), i could not supply enough electricity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni decreased rotor power to 75% on all rotors, that\u0027s the most i can afford to consume (and i saved 1.6 tons in the process). but now the rotors aren\u0027t powerful enough to propel the blades to full speed in low eve atmosphere, which is causing problems again. next thing i will try will be another kal controller to set maximum rpm; i came to the conclusion that if the problem is one rotor going faster than the other and the other unable to catch up, then forcing all rotors to slow down should work. the alternative, powering up the rotors again and swapping the current solar panels i\u0027m using for gigangtors, would add too much weight and hurt aerodinamics even more. even then, i\u0027m not sure i\u0027d be able to keep the rotors powered for the 30-minute ascent. i will power up the rotors only if it can lift me a few more kilometers bfore i have to use rockets, and i would use them at half power through most of the ascent in that case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nby the way, i tried removing the convert-o-tron and drill and try for full gliding descent, unsuccessfully. even using every trick (opening the cargo bay to brake, tilting the ship so that the fusolage would provide some lift and keep me higher in the atmosphere for a bit longer, spinning to cool pieces off) i was unable to land the thing safely without adding at least two tons of wings to help braking. even then, it was a very narrow thing, a dozen pieces reaching the deepest red, most of them times something did break anyway. and i still needed to burn some fuel to finish landing, and those wings would increase drag going up. adding heat shields also increased weight very fast. not enough gain for the effort. so i will rocket brake on atmospheric reentry, and replenish fuel on land. i saved weight by swapping the big convertotron for a small one, at the price of decuplicating the time needed for refueling. i also ditched two radiators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-28T15:04:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbalancing the rocket to give a uniform push has been a challenge, as the ship is asymmetrical (i tried several reworks of the shape, to make it symmetrical while keeping the cargo bay mehcanism, none was successful). i moved the engine upwards and downwards by small increments until i could find the closest to the center of mass. i could not center it perfectly, and i decided to have it tilt down slightly (in a vacuum test), so that in atmosphere it should counteract the drag caused by the rotors and blades. still, leaving the atmosphere is a bumpy ride, the ship won\u0027t stand still, putting on autopilot and telling it to keep prograde results in the ship tilting too fast. it also starts spinning at some point. getting out of the atmosphere requires all my piloting skill, succeeds only half the times, and it is very expensive. i\u0027m uncertain how much of that is drag by the blades and how much is uneven push. i\u0027m fairly sure the lack of a nose cone on the forward docking port is not a huge part of it, though i will experiment there too\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wobbly Av8r","CreatedById":206697,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-28T17:05:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your coaxial rotors are rotating in opposite directions, one set of blades (the bottom ones, I presume because of their performance) are being rotated backwards.
