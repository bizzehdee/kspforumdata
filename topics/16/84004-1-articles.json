In particular, pay attention to the part of the link above that discusses how to work out what speed and angle of attack you need for liftoff.

Flaps deflect down; they increase both drag and lift. Spoilers deflect up; they increase drag but reduce lift. Flaps ease takeoffs and allow your craft to fly at a slower speed without stalling. Spoilers ease landings by pushing the plane down onto the runway and enhancing braking on the ground. Either can also be used to increase drag during reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl surfaces can be set to work as flaps or spoilers, but not both. By default, spoiler activation is linked to the \u0022B\u0022 key, with the spoilers off unless triggered. By default, flaps are on unless deactivated through action groups or right-click menus. If you\u0027re using flaps, it\u0027s generally a good idea to set one action group to increase flap deflection and another to reduce flap deflection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may find it helpful to have a well set up example craft to reverse engineer.
