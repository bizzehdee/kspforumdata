At launch, the CoM will be above the CoP and you\u0027ll go straight. During your orbital maneuvers, you\u0027ll use up the fuel, so CoM will drift backwards to the pod and engine (which don\u0027t lose mass), so that at re-entry, CoM will be below CoP and you\u0027ll tend to fall retrograde.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother trick: put elevons up front, ahead of CoM. On launch, use them as canards -- be careful not to go too far from prograde! On re-entry, turn them off (turn off pitch/yaw/roll) and use them passively to shuttlecock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr even more fun: leave them active on re-entry, turn off pod torque, and set your SAS\u00A0direction to retrograde. When you\u0027re pointing retrograde, SAS will try to correct for slight off-retrograde motions, but because you\u0027re going backwards it\u0027ll actually just increase the motion. Eventually you\u0027ll end up prograde, and SAS will correctly force you away from that to be retrograde. All in all\u00A0you\u0027ll be tumbling wildly, mostly perpendicular to the air flow. That ensures high drag and it spreads the heat over your entire surface, so nowhere gets overly hot. Then, within limits, you can leave the heat shield at home.
