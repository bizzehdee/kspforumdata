My question is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I have RemoteTech RemoteControl and RemoteCommand. I attached antennas to both my 3 manned ship (default setting in CFG file) but I cannot seem to control my probe..

We tell it to go somewhere, look at that rock, take some pictures here and there and there, shoot the rock with a laser and analyze it, scoop some dust here and analyze that, etc. It doesn\u0027t need step-by-step input, and that automation is the only feasible way to deal with the communications time-delay. It does all that on it\u0027s own, solving basic navigational problems and avoiding trouble on the way (these rovers could easily handle a \u0022whoooops, massive hole here that we didn\u0027t see earlier...right, I\u0027ll go around that\u0022 moment).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hallothere","CreatedById":39948,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T13:03:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sbowyer28\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sbowyer28\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhere are you at, There is a signal delay I believe, Duna I think is four minutes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, ok...
