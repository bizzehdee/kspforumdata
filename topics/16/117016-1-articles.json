If contracts are your kind of thing, [Field Research](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123892) has some contracts that will give you suggested waypoints for these hard-to-find combinations.\n2. You can also get landed on Water by EVA\u0027ing and standing on your ship. You can get this for non-EVA experiments by landing on a ship (or if you\u0027re clever, build a ship with a bottom section that floats, and decouple a top section with loads of experiments - FOR SCIENCE)."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T03:47:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Interesting!
