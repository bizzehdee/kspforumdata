The only listed differences are in the size of the Inline Reaction Wheel, which won\u0027t affect anything but the way something looks, and the mass and drag of the Cupola, which will improve anything using it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanes \u0027might\u0027 work, but there were a lot of changes to wings and control-surfaces so, at least, they\u0027ll benefit from a re-design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T08:47:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI loaded a couple of planes from 0.24.2 in to 0.25, and they looked a mess. The SAS I was using is smaller in 0.25, which showed up as gaps between the cockpit and the fuselage. The new MkI cockpit is a lot sleeker, which I felt ruined the look of some of my designs. The final straw is that they have changed the existing delta wings and controls surfaces, rather than add the new designs alongside the existing ones, and this has completely ruined the look of my pride and joy, a Harrier jump jet imitation. It\u0027s for this reason that I have gone back to 0.24.2 and will probably stick with that, as I am not a fan of anything else they updated with 0.25 either.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T16:53:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI completely forgot about the new aerodynamic parts.
