If you have camera mode on orbital mode... before going on eva, adjust your ship so that it is nose-up and appears to be aligned to 90 degrees regardless of which way you pan the camera (if you\u0027re equatorial it will be pointing toward your normal vector (or anti-normal if your orbiting the other direction). This makes EVA orientation \\*much\\* easier and it doesn\u0027t take long to get the hang of it.

I just do that so that I know the ships are aligned without having to use a docking port alignment mod.

I haven\u0027t tried ship RCS yet, is it very different from EVA RCS? You can rotate with it?\n\nthe translation part of RCS will be somewhat different, but the orbital mechanics are the same. (match velocities, burn towards the target, and make small mechanics to stay on target) (IJKL for up-left-down-right, h to move forward, n to move backward)).\n\n(with RCS, you also get to see the navball, which is very useful for being precisely on target)\n\nWhen RCS is enabled, it\u0027ll also respond to rotation commands (the same way your reaction wheels can turn your ship using WASDQE by default).\n\nNote that if your RCS thrusters aren\u0027t positioned correctly, RCS translation will cause unintended rotation, and RCS rotation will cause translation.\n\nIf you really have trouble with RCS docking, I suggest you start by using the Klaw; with the Klaw, you don\u0027t have to worry about lining up the docking ports, so all you have to do is touch your target with the klaw to dock.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T05:33:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 05:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reddeyfish**"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T05:46:38Z","Content":"Plain and simple: Kerbal EVA movement should have never been different from steering a spaceship.
