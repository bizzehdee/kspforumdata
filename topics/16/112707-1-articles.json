They are so marginal that I originally thought they must weigh like 10 times what they should. So l looked around for real-life fairing weights and found that they are actually only about 2 times too heavy. Fairing should probably help if you had something that looked like a brick instead of a cylinder, or something very asymmetric; but otherwise they seem somewhere between break-even and somewhat inefficient."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T23:22:42Z","Content":"Ditto. Your payload needs to be egregiously draggy before farings are a net gain. If dynamic pressure was a concern they could be useful, but as is you are better off flying subsonic to 35 km than add a faring for 90% of cases.\n\nAnything asymmetric enough for a faring is too large for one.

The point that this is rarely necessary is more down to the low-intensity nature of stock heating than anything else (as well as the low \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV requirements of LKO permitting inefficient-but-safe steep ascents).\n\nGiven the level of squealing recently on the forums about the \u0022impossibility\u0022 of flying even in the kindergarten-simple new stock aero, I can understand why Squad is keeping aero failures and reentry heating as unthreatening as they are."},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T05:49:52Z","Content":"Did some tests on the OTTOs, jettisoning fairings at 23km, and using Procedural Fairings.\n\nMechJeb ascent to 80km orbit, AOA limit to 5 degrees, 40% ascent path, 100m/s / 1km automatic altitude turn.\n\nUsing stock fairings:\n\nOTTO-1: 3663 m/s delta-V in VAB, 339 m/s delta-V in orbit.\n\nOTTO-2: 3531 m/s delta-V in VAB, 311 m/s delta-V in orbit.\n\nOTTO-3: 3511 m/s delta-V in VAB, 385 m/s delta-V in orbit.\n\nUsing Procedural fairings:\n\nOTTO-4 (Egg-Shaped Fairing): 3625 m/s delta-V in VAB, 425 m/s delta-V in orbit.\n\nOTTO-5 (Conical Fairing): 3626 m/s delta-V in VAB, 446 m/s delta-V in orbit.\n\nSo with FAR, of the stock options the pointy fairing wins.
