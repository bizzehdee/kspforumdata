For TWR = 1.4, it is as low as 29% of the dv , if TWR = 2, ~13% of your dv, making it competitive with the 6 TWR monster on verticale ascend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne can also prove that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/(2*TWR^2) \u0026lt; 1 - sqrt(1 - TWR^-2) \u0026lt; 1/(2*TWR^2) \u002B 1/(8*TWR^4)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo loss fraction = 1/(2*TWR^2) is a good approximation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo loss fraction not only is way better for inclined burn, it also decreases much faster as TWR grows, (therefore requiring lower TWR)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, when you build up horizontale speed, you are granted a centrifuge force (blue arrow, pic 3). I won\u0027t express it with gravitational parm, but as it grows like a square, if we call vh the horizontale velocity and v0 the orbital velocity at current altitude (eg 2300m/s for kerbin), we can write it :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eg * (vh^2/v0^2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoss fraction may be calculated as above by replacing the gravity by gravity minus this force, effectively multiplying TWR in above formula by 1/(1-v^2/v0^2), which is 9/8 over kerbin at 800 m/s, 4/3 at 1150m/s, up to infite when reaching orbital velocity (you\u0027re no more suffering gravity loss).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETo sum up gravity loss are by far greater while accelerating vertically. Even with non trust-vectoring engines, you will save huge amount of mass by adding some control surfaces to make an early enough gravity turn. If you like great acclerations, you should ask if a TWR \u0026gt; 2 (arbitrary high but resonable value) worth it : will you really lose less than 13% of DV by adding more boosters?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is for a heavy body ignoring drag which is reasonable at some altitudes and speeds, and which is always reasonable for kerbin with FAR, since it seems to make drag comparable to stock Duna. If you are going out of a mun with high TWR and low dv requirement, any ascent, may it be verticale, will cost very few dv compared to optimal path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit : \u003C/strong\u003E fixed the image. btw how do you make spoiler?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-15T07:51:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2014 07:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kesa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T06:46:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFYI: Your imgur gallery didnt work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery interesting work.
