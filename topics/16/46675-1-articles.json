I\u0027m not trying to get to orbit or anything, I just want to get off the ground. I read several tutorials, but all they really seem to talk about is CG and center of lift placement, or MOAR INTAKES!!!11!.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just trying to get something basic off the ground. So far I can\u0027t even get off the runway. My plane gets up to about 80 m/s and just veers right and crashes. I thought it was something placed asymmetrically, so I pulled it all off and reattached. Same problem. Reworked my twin tails into a single tail design, and didn\u0027t change much else, but now it won\u0027t move forward more than about 1 m/s. Again, this is on a small 2-seater plane. Fuel is flowing, brakes are off, it\u0027s not using up all its intake air, but it just sits there. I thought it could be the type of intake I used, but it doesn\u0027t work with either style attached to the front of the engines (or with the scoops on top).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I took a couple pictures to see if anyone could point out if there\u0027s anything obvious where I\u0027m going wrong on what should in theory be a simple, low part count, stock aircraft for 2 Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere it is at full thrust, engines roaring, but not moving (note the large plume behind):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/afazTY0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022afazTY0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a couple shots from the SPH showing my control surfaces, CG, COL, and COT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eiFTGc3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eiFTGc3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WuOlguA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WuOlguA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rDvWcz5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rDvWcz5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-27T14:16:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2013 02:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by UH60guy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Pilot395","CreatedById":42189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T13:18:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe landing gear at the back.

If you move them closer to center of mass its going to be easier to lift the nose. Also they are attached to engine housings. These are flexing a little and that introduces toe in. What I mean is the wheels may point in or out instead of being parallel. To get rid of that effect get rid of the camber and put some struts between engine housings and main fuselage. May I also suggest replacing one of the fuel tanks with structural empty equivalent. Keep fuel at center of mass.
