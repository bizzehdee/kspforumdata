You can get your first few science points just by flying a rocket up a few km and then safely landing it and clicking the green Recover (the button is now at the top of the screen if you hover over after landing). If your spaceship has been to new interesting places (like flown into orbit or around the Mun for the first time) it counts as new information and earns you science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour Kerbals can write a report about what they see - I just did a flyby of the Mun and Bob wrote a report about potential Mun landing sites he spotted (that\u0027s what the actual report says on screen). Right click a pod and select the report button (I think that\u0027s what it\u0027s called, it might be make observations). A window will pop up with what the Kerbal has observed and how much science it is worth. Even a low altitude flight has something to report the first time. You can only hold onto 1 report at a time, so you either need to land and recover it or you can transmit it. Transmitting reports only gives you a percentage of its value (when you make a report the window shows a blue dish icon that says something like 50%, indicating what percentage you get if you transmit instead of return it). Transmitting requires a dish or antenna and uses lots of power. I think that transmitting also means you can make more then one report during a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour Kerbals can go on EVA and do EVA reports too.

The first one you will get is the mystery goo container. Basically you right click and open up the container (expose it) sometime during the flight.

You then need to return the sample to Kerbin for analysis (I haven\u0027t worked out if a Kerbal in orbit can observe and transmit a report for a lesser percentage, but I think it\u0027s possible).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadoworgon","CreatedById":5032,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T00:20:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way, is to transmit data using commutrons.
