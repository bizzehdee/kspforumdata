Obviously, I checked for fuel and electricity but those are plentiful. I\u0027m using Mechjeb to control them but the problem seems to happen when I switch to the spacecraft. One thing I noticed on a small probe with this problem is the body is flexing as I attempt to turn it but it doesn\u0027t turn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T16:37:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen this a few times but it\u0027s always been fixed by either going into map mode and back or switching vessels and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobe","CreatedById":95803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T16:45:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found that after undocking a ship, MechJeb sometimes freaks out and decides to control it from everywhere, resulting in the ship trying to move but remaining stationary.

Make sure you didn\u0027t break in half or something.
