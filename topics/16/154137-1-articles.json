Was hoping to save some space and weight. Maybe I can squeeze the rear cargo bay a bit to move the rover further back without clipping out. The thing is, I wanted my ship to be able to do full orbital surveys and as such I have included the M700 scanner attached to the back of the rover, which I intend to deploy once near a planet so perform the scan and then retract once I have the data. I am wondering if it\u0027s not better to just send out satellites to each body and forget about the extra scanner on board. I have a very good satellite model that has all the science on it and very light, able to travel and return from just about anywhere on it\u0027s own with the use of ion engines. Is carrying the M700 useless and should just launch satellites before I start missions to have them on site before I get there?

All the other planets have less gravity than Kerbin, except for Tylo and Eve, which require special ships, and by that I mean rockets. I also only use 2 delta wings and small control surfaces to keep drag and weight down. Tanking off is a challenge since the ship wants to drop badly, but it does fly if you throttle to max, hit the brakes, wait until you reach 90kn and then release. At the end of the runway pull hard and it should barely go up, avoiding the ground barely with the rear engines. It\u0027s very tricky and I crashed it many times before I could get it flying.
