It acts normal for me, i.e. the same as any other engine where staging is concerned. What mods are you running, any possibility of odd interference there?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T19:03:00Z","Content":"\nHmmm, maybe it\u0026#39;s more correct to say what mods Im NOT running ;).
