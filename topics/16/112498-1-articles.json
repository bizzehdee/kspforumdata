The copied tank must have its own fully-featured .cfg file to be loaded by the game. In that file, you can set the values by hand.\n\nBut if you were looking to use ModuleManager to change an existing part, here\u0027s what you would do:\n\n    @PART[]:FINAL{    @RESOURCE[LiquidFuel]    {        @amount /= 0.45        @maxAmount /= 0.45    }    !RESOURCE[Oxidizer]}\n\nSince 45% of the tank\u0027s volume is liquid fuel by default, to make liquid fuel occupy 100% you need to perform a mathematical operation that reverses x \\* 0.45. Since that\u0027s a simple multiplication, reversing it is as easy as replacing the multiplication operator with a division operator: x / 0.45. That\u0027s what the above config does.\n\nExample: FL-T800 has 360 liquid fuel and 800 capacity. Targeting it with the above config will make it have 800 liquid fuel instead, because 360 / 0.45 = 800.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T08:03:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 08:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T09:45:58Z","Content":"I think the LiquidTanks mod is doing exactly that:\n\n[LiquidTanks](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121264-1-0-2-LiquidTanks-LF-only-tanks-for-nuclear-engines)"}]}
