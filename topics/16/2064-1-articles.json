What I\u0027m trying to do is see how fast I can shoot my Kerbals into the void. So, I was wondering: what is the optimal technique to set some speed records?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, when I pass escape velocity, my velocity vector keeps creeping up the gimbal. Is it better to follow the velocity vector, or keep it horizontal? Logically, horizontal should be better, as you\u0027re no longer fighting gravity. But when I try it, it just doesn\u0027t seem to work as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve attached the Katurn 1, what I\u0027m using at the moment.
