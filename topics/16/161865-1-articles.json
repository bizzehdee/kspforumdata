But I\u0027m ending up in a situation where I have to test it. Most of it I can figure out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut how the heck do you change the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E mode when you are in IVA? I can turn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0on and off, of course. But I\u0027ve pushed every button I can think of and I can\u0027t actually set the mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr do you just allow yourselves to flip to map mode and then set it there? I mean, you kind of need map mode to set maneuver nodes and targets anyway, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-09T21:45:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2017 09:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-10T03:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t believe there is any stock method of switching between different \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E modes from the IVA view alone. There also doesn\u0027t appear to be a keyboard shortcut for doing so, although admittedly the keyboard layout is starting to get a bit crowded so I can understand why such a feature isn\u0027t a priority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I remember correctly, the MechJeb mod allows the possibility to assign action groups for its version of hold prograde, hold retrograde, hold normal, etc... but it\u0027s MechJeb\u0027s controls that are being assigned, not the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike you said, bringing up the map seems to be the best way to set those functions right now. It would be nice to have more clickable buttons in IVA, but of course mods like RasterPropMonitor and VesselView attempt to fill the gaps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
