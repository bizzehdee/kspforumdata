I have been playing campaign mode, and just recently traveled to the muns orbit. I made a couple tweaks to my mun orbiting vessel today (just after patch), and now, the minute I reach stop throttling, I lose all pitch and yaw controls with my ship. Yesterday when i was playing, I would ascend until my apoapsis reached ~100K meters, cut my engines, then position and burn prograde when i reached the apoapsis. now I get my apoapsis to ~100k, and I am unable to maneuver once my engines are cut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe changes I made to the ship was to use FL-T800 engines instead of FL-T400 so nothing that should affect this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy ship is setup as follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommand Pod MK1 (attached is parachute)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience Jr 9001 (attached is 2 batteries, a comms antenna, and mystery goo)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFL-T400 fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-909 engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFL-T800 fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T45 engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFL-T800 fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFL-T800 fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T45 engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor the beginning ascent, I have 2 solid rocket engines to get me to a decent altitude \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully someone can help a newbie out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Changed prefix to Answered\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-20T04:24:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2013 04:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Prost\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T03:54:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFive possible problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Without electricity, you have no torque, and thus no control. The LV-T45 engine generates electricity, but the 909 does not. They do all have pitch though, which gives you control while you are burning the engine.

I checked and its not because I am running out of electricity, I have a full juice at this point. I also found out that I am moving, just really slowly. I think the problem is that the ship at this point in my flight is still in 3 stages, which makes it quite big. The fact that when i get rid of a stage the maneuvering gets better supports this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fix the problem, I added RCS which I didnt have prior(didnt know about this prior to your replies in this thread, so thank you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not sure why this suddenly happened after the patch, but its not a problem now that I have discovered how RCS works\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Prost","CreatedById":97484,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T02:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBTW, how do I change the description to say \u0022Answered\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WafflesToo","CreatedById":71736,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T02:21:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think they nerfed the torque on the one-kerbal capsule in this updates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can change it to\u0027answered\u0027 by editing your original post \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndrewBCrisp","CreatedById":57119,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T02:33:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom your \u0022schematic\u0022, I noticed you don\u0027t seem to have any reaction wheels installed beyond what\u0027s already in the command pod. If the command pod\u0027s reaction wheels have been nerfed as WafflesToo says, than that is probably enough to alter the spacecraft\u0027s ability to maneuver. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS can fix this, but RCS is dependent on a monoprop supply so once it\u0027s gone, that\u0027s it. I\u0027d recommend a belt-and-suspenders approach: i.e. put an Inline Reaction Wheel module (.3 tons if I remember correctly) on your spacecraft, to help you maneuver without using RCS - great for both ascent and for when the monoprop finally runs out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my thoughts - hope it helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
