I want to use it solely for KSP and mods (once it runs, the mods go into the game data folder and thats it I hope).\n\nAnd yes, I can start sentences without \u0022I\u0022...\n\n(I) thank you very much for your support!"},{"CreatedByName":"Aghanim","CreatedById":76587,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T15:22:58Z","Content":"Use Launcher.x86 for 32 bit KSP ,use Launcher.x86\\_64 for 64 bit KSP.

When you run it directly, it will use the ones installed by your distribution. You might find one or other option works better."},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T06:45:34Z","Content":"Great question!

Besides you can always run steam inside playonlinux and run the other games that are only for winblows from inside there...  \n\nAnyway you can extract that folder wherever you want, as of the launching I recommend fruition of this thread: [url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24529-The-Linux-compatibility-thread[/url]!  \n\nFor instance I run it using a script like this:  \n\n[CODE]#!/bin/sh  \n\ncd /location\\_of\\_ksp\\_folder/\u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022  \n\nexport LC\\_ALL=C   \n\nexport LD\\_PRELOAD=\u0022libpthread.so.0 libGL.so.1\u0022  \n\nexport \\_\\_GL\\_THREADED\\_OPTIMIZATIONS=1  \n\nexec taskset -c 2-3 ./KSP.x86\\_64[/CODE]  \n\nand in order to have it so that it suffices to run \u0022ksp\u0022 in any terminal in order to launch the game, I linked this script inside the /usr/bin directory with (on ubuntu):  \n\n[CODE]cd /usr/bin  \n\nsudo ln -s /location\\_of\\_ksp\\_launch\\_script folder/name\\_of\\_ksp\\_script ksp[/CODE]"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T10:52:13Z","Content":"This is probably better in Support but may be useful in GamePlay Questions, moved."},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T13:24:14Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027eggymatrix\u0027]export LC\\_ALL=C [/QUOTE]  \n\nI don\u0027t use this anymore, AFAIK this bug was squashed in 0.25   \n\n[quote name=\u0027eggymatrix\u0027]export LD\\_PRELOAD=\u0022libpthread.so.0 libGL.so.1\u0022[/QUOTE]  \n\nSound like bad idea to me. If your binary have trouble finding libraries, LD\\_LIBRARY\\_PATH is the way. If you really really need to push things via preload, you really ought to specify what libraries are you pushing. Pthread is core system library and I would be very careful around it, and libGL came from various sources (nowadays mesa or nvidia proprietary blob are most likely) and most people don\u0027t need to touch it.  \n\n[quote name=\u0027eggymatrix\u0027]export \\_\\_GL\\_THREADED\\_OPTIMIZATIONS=1[/QUOTE]  \n\nNow this is interresting.
