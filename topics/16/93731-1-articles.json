I do remember something from a devnote a while back saying that we would be able to switch from one to the other but I hadn\u0027t seen anything since the release to say that feature was there so I assumed it was left out. I looked all over the screen for a button or switch or toggle that I might have clicked by accident but I could find anything. Does anyone know about this? Is this an actual feature or did I just find a bug? A bug wouldn\u0027t surprise me, since they said the SPH and VAB were essentially the same now, just with a different backdrop.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-19T19:56:25Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2014 07:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by The Yellow Dart\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T19:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot a bug, it can be switched by pressing R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, F changes \u0022Radial symmetry around parent part\u0022 and \u0022Radial symmetry around Vessel\u0022, but I honestly don\u0027t know the difference.

Consider three parts, A, B and C. A is the root part. You attach two part Bs to part A using radial symmetry. You now take part C, set the mode to mirror, and attempt to attach them to one of the parts B. At this point, the mode will switch to radial, because you\u0027re trying to attach to an already radial part. The way to fix this is to detach the parts B and reattach them using mirror symmetry instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be all kinds of trickiness in trying to find corresponding parts when trying to mix radial and mirror symmetry, so I think they went with the simplest option in the editor and just made it stick to one mode. Of course, you can mix modes when attaching to a part that has no symmetry (so you can radial attach Bs to A and also mirror attach Cs to \u003Cstrong\u003EA\u003C/strong\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
