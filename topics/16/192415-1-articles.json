One - that I hope will get fixed soon - is that it suffers from bug \u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/23924\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E#23924\u003C/a\u003E, i.e. there is currently a bug in KSP that prevents the terrier from being protected by heat-shields in most cases. The other issue is that the terrier is a pure vacuum engine! At Kerbin sea level it has less than a quarter of the thrust it has in vacuum. So if you want to land in an atmosphere(*) it is better to e.g. use the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/48-7S_%22Spark%22_Liquid_Fuel_Engine\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Espark\u003C/a\u003E engine, that one has more thrust in atmosphere than the terrier, and it is lighter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while I think that your problem is due to the bug I mentioned, the real question is: Why are you trying to use a terrier in an atmosphere?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd about you other questions: which planet are you trying to re-enter anyhow?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. (*)Here Duna counts as having no atmosphere. But Duna\u0027s atmosphere is so thin that if you manage to burn up your craft entering that then you probably deserve some kind of award for that.
