So far, I only found a retrograde ejection from Kerbin at about 6,000m/s deltaV. \n\n- I can do those 6000m/s with a LV-N, if I can time the long burn times correctly. But how? I noted that if I burn \u003E6 minutes, the whole orbit shifts while I accelerate and the deltaV prediction from the maneuver node is not necessarily accurate anymore.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T20:25:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 08:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Falkenherz**"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T20:25:07Z","Content":"Distance is irrelevant. The trajectory just has to intercept the sun\u0027s surface.\n\nRetrograde ejection from Kerbin is correct. Delta-V looks about right.\n\nFor low TWR rockets and long burns, I like to chain a few short burns. So make a node, get it to the point where it will be a short enough burn (\u003C 1 minute), then make another node a bit further on the new orbit, etc. If you do it right you\u0027ll get a reasonable projection of where the single long burn will send you."},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T07:55:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Distance is irrelevant.\n\n600km is the altitude you need your periapsis to dip below to count as suborbital."},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T13:46:40Z","Content":"Indeed.

The distance your craft gets to is irrelevant. The altitude of perihelion is what matters. That has to intersect the \u0022surface\u0022 of the sun\u0027s atmosphere, which is at 600km. This works for any other body: the periapsis of the orbit must intersect the surface of the atmosphere to be considered a suborbital trajectory, or the surface of the body if it has no atmosphere. Clearer?"},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T03:52:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, I said that. The distance your craft gets to is irrelevant.

Not sure why you chose to shoot down the OPs question in such a way as to call it \u0022irrelevant\u0022 when he asked a very simple and straightforward question. Clearer? I was glad to followup and address his question with the specific altitude. Not sure what this reply hoped to add."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T23:19:09Z","Content":"It\u0027s probably the point that you don\u0027t have to GO there, just be on the trajectory to get there for a few seconds."},{"CreatedByName":"Falkenherz","CreatedById":141969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T21:52:59Z","Content":"I was indeed looking for that figure of 600 km because I did not find it until now.
