If you are behind, burn prograde. Warp until you are within 10km, and match your orbit again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Watch the other spacecraft. If it is below and in front, burn retrograde. If it is above and behind, burn prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Is the other spacecraft moving left and right (normal and antinormal)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5-Yes) Burn left between when it is moving left, and burn right when it is moving right. You can do this when it is all the way to the left/to the right, but it wastes a lot of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Burn towards the other spacecraft. You are probably close enough such that gravity is a non-issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Counter your velocity once you get close. This is to prevent you from overshooting and/or crashing into the other spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Have you rendezvous yet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8-Yes) Congratulations!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8-No) Go to step 6.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MoreEpicThanYou","CreatedById":29473,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-07T12:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt worked!
