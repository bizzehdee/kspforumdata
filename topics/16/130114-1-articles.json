I believe very large and NOT aerodynamic craft, but yet very lightweight, will usually make it to the ground. The high drag make it to lose speed quickly and the low-weight make sure it does not gain speed too much from gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MagicFireCaster","CreatedById":149926,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-17T17:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s 2000 k max temp using the right profile it will surely survive the reentry\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ForScience6686","CreatedById":144187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-17T17:27:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider the weight to drag profile. \u00A0Empty tank, and I\u0027m not sure of its orientation, but if it was tumbling it would lose speed quite quick. \u00A0Since you used rcs for de orbit \u00A0I\u0027m guessing it was a shallow profile as well so plenty of time to slow down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-18T12:40:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeatshield\u0027s aren\u0027t necessarily needed from LKO at all.
