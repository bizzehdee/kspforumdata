Today, I loaded up my career save, and all of my craft have a tendency to roll when I try to tilt. They are also much more wobbly than yesterday. The pilot SAS cannot keep a straight heading (it doesn\u0027t even appear to try staying on course). Tried sandbox, and the craft there were fine. Are pilots in career mode worse at keeping straight when low level? Was this added in a recent hotfix or something? Also, I was using the Stayputnik (I believe it has no SAS). Yesterday, it had a small SAS stabilizing effect anyway. Today, it seems to almost try and move, even in space keeping a straight line is nigh-impossible (even when still, it starts to spin more and more quickly). What puzzles me is these craft worked fine yesterday!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and btw I use FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: it seems the only way to get science at low tiers is satellite contracts.
