So, this may sound nooby or such. However, I have been having problems with rockets that are PERFECTLY stable on ascent. When I start the gravity turn though, even my most perfectly stable ships start tumbling uncontrollably. Not only are these rockets stable, they have worked on previous launches, and now, even if I just nudge the rocket into a slight angle, it falls over and tumbles uncontrollably. Even rockets I have used dozens of times. Anyone else having this issue???\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T22:43:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have this issue when I use aerospikes.

Either of these will make your ship want to point tail first when you point too far away from your prograde vector. You can still fly your ship to orbit; you just need to start your gravity turn sooner and keep your nose pointed mostly prograde until you get into the upper reaches of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T01:49:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s not much we can do without some pictures of the ship.
