So my true orbital speed is actually 2385.4 m/s. I do plan on attempting it with the smallest amount of RCS I can squeeze on there. I should also say that I was running the engines at max power the entire time. If I were to dip down to about 25,000 meters, I get a lot more thrust and barely any drop in speed, then if I nose hard up to about a 45 degree angle or better, I can get the apoapsis over 45,000 meters. Now, at 45km I\u0027m not going to get any air intake at all, but with the RCS system, I think it may be possible to accelerate just enough to get the peri and apoapsis equal or swap so the apoapsis grows to over 70km.

(It ended up going to Eve too) I have built a smaller plane in the past that, much like yours, managed to build up enough speed to bring up its periapsis above Kerbin ground. Although, it could only do this much higher up, like well over 40KMs. Up there, the air is so thin that you only need just a tiny amount of thrust to combat air resistance. Which is fortunate, because you only get just a few K-newtons from the turbojet engine up that high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn anycase, once you\u0027ve managed to get your speed that high, all you need is a tiny extra kick (Continuous tiny kick) to bring the opposite side of your orbit above the atmosphere and to combat the small amount of drag you encounter until you get there. The problem you end up running into is the mass of the extra equipment you have to carry along to do this. Drag in stock KSP is calculated in large part by the mass of the parts.

Climbed steeply at the start, until my apoapsis was about 55km, then thrust horizontally until I reached my apoapsis.

Once I got low enough, aero-dynamic lift eventually kicked back in and I started to gain altitude once more. My test run here was nearly perfect; regained lift around 25km and lost nearly no speed due to drag and sped up even faster, easily hitting orbital speed.
