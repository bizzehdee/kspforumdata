As for whether or not \u0022higher is better\u0022 it depends on how steep the inclination change you need to make is; sometimes it\u0027s more efficient to do it where you stand, sometimes it\u0027s more efficient to boost yor orbit first and then make the change. This is obvious for the case of a 180 degree inclination change; it\u0027d take about 4500 m/s to manage in LKO, but you can do it for under 2000 m/s by boosting your orbit to the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SoI, making the change, and then dropping your orbit back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe math here is very similar to the math for bielliptic transfers. Sometimes they\u0027re efficient, sometimes they\u0027re not; it depends on how large a difference there is between your current orbit and yourtarget orbit, although I don\u0027t remember the exact formula off of the top of my head.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"King Arthur","CreatedById":73849,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T18:08:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, most orbital manuevers are better done at a higher altitude if you\u0027re flying there as the associated slower velocities mean you spend significantly less dV than you would at lower orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asmi","CreatedById":59068,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T18:18:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022King Arthur\u0022 data-cite=\u0022King Arthur\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGenerally speaking, most orbital manuevers are better done at a higher altitude if you\u0027re flying there as the associated slower velocities mean you spend significantly less dV than you would at lower orbits.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, but that\u0027s not always possible - for example inclination changes need to happen when the vessel cross equator, otherwise only higher inclinations are available and LAN will change as well, LAN changes have to happen in most nothern/southern points of orbit - otherwise inclination will also change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T18:34:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe cut-off is generally around 60 degrees.

The break-even point will vary with initial and final altitudes, but for an initial altitude of 100km, it costs ~ 920 m/s to raise your apoapsis to the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI and a similar amount to lower it again. Your speed at apoapsis would be about 25 m/s, so inclination changes would be trivial.
