The results were confusing as the numbers that I found around the web were very different especially due to some of them being outdated (according to my understanding due to version changes). In addition to that, I figured out that there is a big misunderstanding about how to read delta-v maps when it comes to ascent values. I found posts where people claimed that delta v maps only use vacuum values (including for surface-to-orbit values), but I also found other posts reporting that the delta-v maps use atmospheric values when it comes to surface-to-orbit values. Furthermore, I found threads where both opinions were posted at the same time and some people were saying that the others were wrong as they didn\u0027t know how to read the maps\u00A0 (e.g:\u00A0\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/8s2y4m/hey_guys_just_a_bit_confused_here_deltav_related/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/8s2y4m/hey_guys_just_a_bit_confused_here_deltav_related/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 ;\u00A0 Chaos_Klaus\u0027 post).
