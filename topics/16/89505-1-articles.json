The other thing I do (for when I can\u0027t/don\u0027t feel like keep it symmetric) is to adjust the thrust limiter on your engines. What I do is turn off SAS and RCS, and make sure the station is completely still.

So if you need to re-arrange or move the entire thing, all you have to do is break it up and ship it off to its new location and then re-assemble there. A bit more work, but no wobble. Also makes it easy to ship it to far away places. For instance those big Cyclotrons from the Station Science mod. They need not be permanent at any one place. Once you\u0027ve done the kuarq experiments in one location, just detach and ship to another location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Make sure your load is balanced _and_ when transporting big things that are stuck together via docking ports and struts, you need to pull it, not push it. So engines up front, not at the back. And since KSP gets confused when Center of Thrust is in front of Center of Mass, turn off engine gimbal and let _ONE_ central SAS module keep the entire assembly pointing in the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Use Docking Port Sr for big heavy things rather than connecting with standard Docking Port. Even better, mods like Near Future got trussed docking ports that lock together really well. Strutting should only be the last resort. Besides looking ugly, struts doesn\u0027t add that much stiffness to big heavy things compared to the other alternatives I mentioned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-05T21:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ghost22\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ghost22\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I tested turning off all but one of the SAS units still wobbled I disabled SAS and still wobbled alot \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E guess I will test the thrust limiter on my engines\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes, things will resonate. I once had engines-on-outriggers swing like church bells. Any input would start the swinging, and any attempt at countersteering (like SAS does) would only make it worse. It was possible to turn the vessel with gentle inputs and lots of patience, then stop the turn through timewarp. Unless the engines were already swinging so wildly that I couldn\u0027t leave or enter timewarp, because the ship was supposedly under acceleration.

And if you have multiple reaction wheels, disable any that are similarly not near the control point. Then you should be able to keep SAS on during the burn. The parts of the ship that are on the far side of wobbly joints will still wobble around, but it won\u0027t affect your control, and SAS will at least not make it worse.
