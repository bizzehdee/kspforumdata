It is supposed to return the probe core and attached science to Kerbin. Currently the re-entry stage has an Okto-2, a Z-200 battery, a small reaction wheel, a Mk16 parachute, and a size 0 heat shield. It is aerodynamically stable, which is good because I play with \u0022require signal for control\u0022 and \u0022plasma blackout\u0022 difficulty settings active.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is, when it splashes down in the ocean, it sinks. This is a problem because I also have the \u0022part pressure limits\u0022 difficulty setting active, so the sinking probe gets crushed after less than a hundred meters of depth. I cannot recover the probe unless it either floats or rests on solid ground/ocean floor. Decoupling the heatshield does not help, the probe still sinks just the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince this will be coming back from interplanetary space with little to no remaining propulsion, I cannot control where it comes down. And I don\u0027t want to just roll the dice on a multi-year-long mission, only to lose it all after successfully returning to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would you build a re-entry vehicle for a probe that a.) is aerodynamically stable, and b.) floats on water, and c.) returns science observations intact?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidSquid","CreatedById":196199,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-25T07:53:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I had that issue too, my two workarounds: either a bit more fuel for small last minute course corrections, or alternatively\u00A0I added a MK-1 pod to keep the thingy floating, I prefer the 1st method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo guesstimate\u00A0when the probe might land, the Trajectories mod is pretty helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-25T08:12:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2019 08:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by VoidSquid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-25T11:24:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI add an empty fuel tank/mk1 structure tube.
