A lot of clipping is done by making attachment points with small cubic struts, so you can place items closer to eachother. You can rotate small cubic struts into things and then attach items by rotating/moving your camera so that you can view the inside. Sometimes you have to wiggle things on and off, they\u0027ll occasionally attach as red, other times as green. Once they light up green just clickie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I know you can still only use valid attachment points to attach to, things that attach radially can be rotated into parts and thus be hidden. Some items you can clip into eachother, one I\u0027ve seen used the most is oscar-b and toroidal fuel tanks. RTGs can be rotated into most parts and be hidden, I\u0027ve done the same with batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe aware though that part clipping can cause phantom forces or even unexpected disassembly (explosions or parts simply floating off).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EmanonP","CreatedById":60201,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T19:25:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the feedback.

But if you turn it off and rotate the part as necessary, you can get much more control over exactly how it clips into the other part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to see this for yourself is (with angle snap on) take the Swept wing, and try to join another either in front or behind. Then turn off the angle snap and try again. The part will likely show up first at a weird angle, but with a bit of patience you can build nearly seamless wings that are far larger than you could manage normally. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, you may know this already...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: It\u0027s also not what you were looking for.

Watch how he sets up the intakes onto that strut. From there you can rotate that whole thing inside of other parts if you want. This works with everything.
