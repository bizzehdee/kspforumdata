It weighs 200 tons, and uses a fairing shaped like a disc as a heat-sheild, (as well as an actual heat shield for the fairing base.). It explodes almost every time, no matter how I aim my re-entry, so here is my question: Do fairings shield things behind them, or just stuff inside them?\n\nI feel that the game needs a procedural heat shield, or at least something that can be used instead of many separate shields clipped together.\n\nThanks for all the help in advance,\n\nMajor999\n\nPS: How do all of you guys do Eve entries?"},{"CreatedByName":"Cebi","CreatedById":138242,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T10:54:43Z","Content":"Try to reduce speed before you hit atmosfere by burning your engines. Direct capture is more leathal in 1.04. Also remember that only parts behind heatshield are relatively safe. Anything you build radial will not be shielded unless you enclose it in fairing."},{"CreatedByName":"Signo","CreatedById":103766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T11:07:52Z","Content":"Alas you need to slow down by burning all the way down to avoid the \u0022too fast too low\u0022 barrier.\n\nIf you make a quick search you will find that there are several threads about this issue with the current set of aerodynamic/heating rules."}]}
