Hoppers are tiny vessels that can do , well, short hops in a local area to do some of the contracts that require this. Here are some screen shots of what im talking about.\n\n[http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/518259462780483242/BFEE9ECA0444F3CF48F93513BB943571BFE19BF2/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/518259462780483242/BFEE9ECA0444F3CF48F93513BB943571BFE19BF2/)\n\n[http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/518259462780483435/BE069676F1CC5D50F5307AA21B8554A19003B762/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/518259462780483435/BE069676F1CC5D50F5307AA21B8554A19003B762/)\n\nAs you can see it has a radial decoupler which would drop it from whatever vessel it is attached to. It then has another decoupler to detach the other decoupler from the main ship. I have saved this design as both a subassembly and as a ship. \n\nThe problem I am having is that when I try to attach this to a ship I have built it wont let me. It basically sinks the whole design to the center of the part im trying to attach it to. Not sure if that last sentence made sense but the best way I can describe it. I have tried radial attachment points, all the structural parts possible and yet it wont let me attach it. \n\nThe only way I have found that is a possibility is to use one decoupler and turn it around. This though would leave the decoupler attached to my tiny little vessel and would move the center of mass off to that side which i dont want and would add mass thus lowering its D/V as well. \n\nI hope this makes sense as it was hard for me to describe. Either way if it does any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nthe steam discussion is here if it helps [http://steamcommunity.com/app/220200/discussions/0/598198356166304614/](http://steamcommunity.com/app/220200/discussions/0/598198356166304614/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T07:21:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 07:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KBMODIGITY**"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T05:34:07Z","Content":"Limitation of the game. You cannot radially attach sub-assemblies. You can only stack attach them. You will also notice if you try to make that decoupler or pylon as the root part of the vessel, it won\u0027t let you.\n\nThere are some work arounds, though, to get what you want - the first is to build your hoppers at the same time as your other vessel. \n\nOr, there\u0027s a neat trick to making this a whole lot easier. Imagine that you will be attaching your hoppers to a fuel tank on your other vessel. What you want to do then, is to attach that same fuel tank part to your hopper, make the fuel tank the root part, and save that as sub-assembly. Then when you load your other vessel and grab the sub-assembly, you just replace the fuel tank from your other vessel with the one you have in the sub-assembly."},{"CreatedByName":"KBMODIGITY","CreatedById":80155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T05:49:15Z","Content":"problem is I have tried building a brand new vessel.
