See if you can find it. What it does is it lets you save part of the ship and load it into another ship. So basically, save everything attached to your small command pod, start a new ship with a larger pod, and load the rest of the ship as a subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that it doesn\u0027t always handle struts and fuel lines perfectly, so you\u0027ll probably need to re-check these.
