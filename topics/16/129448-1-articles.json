The slighly clunky looks come from those external tanks. While they are efficient, they do make it look a little silly, especiall with those SRBs attached. To reduce the complexity I would reccomend stacking three of those X-200-32 tanks (four if you can still get TWR\u0026gt;1.1) and then adding two T-800fueled liquid boosters with crossfeed lines feeding the centre tank (if you really need them). If possible just drop the external tanks completely (reduction of air resistance) and use four SRB\u0027s.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen building larger rockets add heavy liquid boosters. One thing you might to try out is putting stronger, lower ISP engines on the boosters and a lower thrust higher ISP engine on the centre tank. Also, watch your TWR, going over ~1.5 at launch quickly gets inefficient due to more air resistance in the low atmosphere, going lower than ~1.2 results in bigger gravity losses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-07T09:48:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2016 09:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eforgot sth.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T10:04:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could strip some weight out of the lander to improve its Delta v.

But it\u0027ll be quite fun to have space stations ^^ can\u0027t wait \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this part, I think I must have been unclear. I wasn\u0027t suggesting not landing on the Mun (which is essential, as you say, and much less forgiving than Minmus), but rather not using the Mk1-2 pod to do it if you want to travel light. The Mk1-2 command pod (with monoprop) weighs 1.37 tons per occupant. Although it does have a lot of things going for it (space for docking port, decent torque, stability on re-entry, etc.) it is the heaviest option when it comes to landing crew. Mind you, the Mk2 lander can is (inexplicably) not much better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vegetal","CreatedById":147251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T17:43:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s actually pretty good for a beginner. Nose cones are badly needed on those side tanks, and I see you have no docking ports, so there is no point in having an RCS system. Ditch that and drain all monoprop from the capsule itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I can understand your reasoning for the side mounted engines, but try using two instead. Keep in mind though, the less TWR you have on the Mun, the harder the landing will be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and the heat shield. Take all the ablator off, you can do a direct reentry from Mun or Minmus with no ablator, relying only on the shield\u0027s thermal resistance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou seem to have a good margin there in terms of delta V. That\u0027s good for a start. When you optimize your final stage and get more comfortable with the game, you will be able to work with reduced margins, and that means your lifter stages will be *way* smaller, so don\u0027t worry too much about size now, you will get better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T22:00:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy 0.02:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBottom sidetanks should be attached to top ones via decoupler, not to central tanks. Better aerodynamics.\u00A0And of course, nosecones, when you have them. If you are unsure about aerodynamic profile, just launch the thing straight up and see how high it gets. Also, if you put some engines under side boosters, you will see when they run out of fuel. If you don\u0027t need TWR, just slap on Ants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for lander - good lander is squat - low and wide, in case you have to land on slope.\u00A0 Having lander engines in side gondolas is good idea, it pushes down CoM and gives you better stability, so make full use of it: instead of empty structure make them into fuel tanks and have smaller and lower central tank. Spread your fuel weight wide, not high. Also, move landing legs onto gondolas, this will further widen your base. Ladder steps on command pod are unnecessary. And solar panels can be blocked by big tank, put some on it too.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T22:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI took liberty to have a take on your design:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/WYFdl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/WYFdl\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
