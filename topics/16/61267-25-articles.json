easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nspecially if you can use excell to help you as i did. now I can make a node transfer to the second with 2 stages in the middle if

little fuel (after all they get back to the big ship all the time) so they just reach get the debris, use the engine on them to move the debris to the main, they are detached of their fuel then

it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin fact if anyone wants the excell sheet, i can pass it so you can use it yourself. or check how its
