You could potentially combine the methods to avoid the risk of landing on it. Something like a probe core on the heat shield (wasteful, I know), and then sepratron-ing it after it\u0027s fallen away while lander\u0027s still descending via parachutes. I haven\u0027t tried vehicle switching during entry, but if you didn\u0027t know already, you can switch between nearby vehicles with [ and ].

Two things: adding the controller to the stage action group doesn\u0027t provide a staging icon, so can\u0027t treat it like a normal stage, but assigning it to the gear group (g key) worked as intended. I am so happy we can detach microcontrollers, and they continue to function (probably just while in physics range). ^.^ I was worried it wouldn\u0027t work once detached, lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-09T12:01:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2022 12:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by xionix4\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETested.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-09T10:00:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tend to eject heat shield pretty early, as in as soon as not needed because of heating, in part because it starting spinning after ejecting who can damage the lander,\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/GTpRgCo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022GTpRgCo.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GTpRgCo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is an standard lander of mine, has one with 4 side booster to for sea level launches.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe weird fuel pipe with radial decopler is to use the landers fuel going to Eve, it get decupled in Eve orbit after craft is refueled.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI drop the science rover first, then\u00A0 I\u0027m done on surface I drop the accent craft to pick up the kerbal and the science.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter the lander has slowed down I first drop the drag plate after disabled the main engine and staged the small retro rockets.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis flip the lander around, the landing legs is to protect lander from shield, after dropping the shield I drop the rear and front struts and lander falls with nose first.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow this is steerable because the fins and reaction wheels, the reaction wheel spam on the landing struts is to keep it stable during liftoff, once I reach 50-60 m/s I drop them.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause the lander has many kilometer cross range dropping from around 20 km the other parts lands well away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-09T11:31:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nto keep the mission within reasonable mass, you can use an helicopterocket. it\u0027s still going to require several tens of tons, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sAZnsC7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/sAZnsC7.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nan example of helicopterocket. at 15 km of altitude it jettisons the helicopter part and goes up like a rocket\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nas for reentry, landing on eve tends to require some careful sequence. here i am first dropping the upper heat shields - which I use as aerobrakes and to keep the craft pointed the right way\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022h0lNNTI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/h0lNNTI.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ns081LL.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/Ns081LL.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat\u0027s because they fall slower than the rocket, so they have time to move away\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthen I activate the parachutes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022y0Et6v1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/y0Et6v1.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nincluding parabrakes first, because opening the main parachutes too suddenly may destroy it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfinally, now that the rocket is falling slower than the thermal shield would on its own, I can drop the lower thermal shield. parachutes are opened at high altitude to give more time to gain distance from the shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xiz9oN6.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/xiz9oN6.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
