Just been watching some YouTube videos and then searching the web, and it seems that since version 23.5 of the game the Double-C Seismic Accelerometer is supposed to give you a menu that says \u0022Start Recording\u0022 \u0022Stop Recording\u0022 and \u0022Collect Impact Data\u0022. Well I\u0027m running the latest version (24.2) and the only things on my right-click menu (as well as Action Groups in the VAB) are \u0022Toggle Display\u0022 and \u0022Log Seismic Data\u0022.
