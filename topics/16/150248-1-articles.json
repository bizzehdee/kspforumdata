In the last case, where you set your own goal, you have to decide for yourself if you are satisfied with making a flyby or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that it is still possible to complete such a tour, but not without staging once on Eve ascent. You would carry a special ascent stage that lets you take off from Eve. If you wanted to prove your toughness, you\u0027d visit Eve last, and thus would be forced to lug that ascent stage with you the entire way, through all of the other landings and takeoffs and transfers. Pulling that off in an otherwise single-stage vehicle is a challenge in its own right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-18T07:30:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2016 07:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
