Instead of landing in each one with a rocket, you can just land a single rover and drive to each biome.

It\u0027s like spaceplanes; they may not be the easiest way to do some things, but it\u0027s an interesting challenge to make something that can do all the things you want while still retaining a semblance of mobility. For instance, here\u0027s my big rover (mobile base), weighing in at about 520 tons (shown here in the SPH just because the lighting is better than out in the wild):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EEME7uh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EEME7uh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou wouldn\u0027t believe how much time it took to make that thing capable of turning or going over hills without ripping itself apart from the sheer forces involved. But now I\u0027ve got it to where it can cruise along at ~10m/s pretty much indefinitely (although it takes a LONG distance to brake), and it carries enough fuel to refuel a fleet of ships.
