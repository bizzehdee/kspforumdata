In theory, it needs the turbojet engine, but that puppy is now WAY up the science tree.\n\nJust assumed I\u0027d be able to get preliminary funding for them and complete them once I had the turbojet, but they are now 6 out of 11 Active contracts and new ones are not spawning. Two more involve sending idiots, I mean tourists, on Minmus flybys, which I do not want to do before the Kerbonauts go there on the unspawned Explore Minums contract, one is Explore Duna, which is simply not feasible, two are getting orbiting stations for Kerbin and the Mun into position.\n\nMost of the various remaining waypoints for visual surveys, temperature and atmospheric scans are not above 14km, but sufficiently far from KSC\u0027s Pseudo-Africa landmass as to be out of the operational range of any plane I can design.\n\nI have everything in the tech tree up to the 90 RP level inclusive plus \u0022Heavier Rocketry\u0022, \u0022Command Modules\u0022, \u0022Advanced Exploration\u0022, and \u0022Advanced Electrics\u0022.

Pull off the wings and tailfins. replace the inline cockpit with a Mk1 airplane cockpit. Attach a pair of RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 solid rocket boosters to the sides of the fuselage where the wings used to be. Attach the wings to the solid boosters instead, and also fit each booster with one vertical tailfin and a circular intake. Adjust the boosters to 50% thrust. Make sure the boosters are attached in such a way that the center of mass does not change much between them being full and them being empty, so that your center of lift does not travel in front of it (or too far behind it). You may or may not need extra wing area, I can\u0027t say... but your basic plane is very small, so you might get away with what you have.\n\nWhen making your hard climb upon approaching the objective, wait until your jet engine can no longer handle it, then ignite the solid boosters and ride a trail of fire while shouting yee-haw! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nNow, two hammers are sort of overkill, but unfortunately stock KSP doesn\u0027t have any 0.625m solids that would be much more useful for this sort of thing.
