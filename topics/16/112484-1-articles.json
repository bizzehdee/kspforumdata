I did some searching and didn\u0027t really seem to come up with anything. I\u0027m using B9 Proc-wing, OPT, FAR and AJE (Many others as well, but these seem to be the relevant ones). \n\n I\u0027ve placed the engines individually after placing their respective intakes and I don\u0027t seem to be getting any unequal thrust. I haven\u0027t even gotten high enough to see if the engines flame-out evenly or not. \n\n Please see the picture attached below and if you need any more info, let me know and I\u0027ll do my best to gather it. \n\n It\u0027s probably worth mentioning that I haven\u0027t spent much time with aircraft in KSP and this is my first solid attempt at an SSTO. I know it\u0027s lacking sufficient orbital engines on the design right now, but I wanted to try to get the high altitude/speed flight mechanics down before trying to work on the orbital bits.\n\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com//imgur.com/a/t7jIh\n\n[Aero Overlay](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com//imgur.com/a/t7jIh)\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com//imgur.com/a/t7jIh\n\n(Not sure if this album will show up properly.

(Not being facetious here - I know what that damn thing does).\n\nLooks like an issue with center of pressure (CoP) being ahead of CoM making the craft dynamically unstable.\n\nCoP is center point drag forces act on. Keeping this behind CoM allows passive flight stability. Since CoP is not directly shared in game, most people use CoL as a proxy. It works for most cases, but since it doesn\u0027t track drag it doesn\u0027t give a complete picture.\n\nYou have intakes mounted fairly far forward. This will push CoP forward. At low speeds, your control features can compensate, but as velocity increases drag does as well. Eventually, the torque from drag forces overcomes the control authority. This imparts great rotational momentum to your craft and simultaneously kills speed as you stall. Enter the flat spin!\n\nMoral of the story: robustly test craft with a lot of drag ahead of the CoM for control authority and/or passive stability or avoid the problem entirely by keeping intakes in the rear \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 of your craft. Keeping CoP too far back does create overly stable craft though, but holding prograde with higher dynamic pressure is better that diverging from it. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEdit: wait, that album has two distinctly different craft between flight and SPH.

About a third a way down the page there are some sine wave graphs - the section header is \u0022Dynamic Stability\u0022. Dynamic stability happens to be what the simulator tab will show you - it shows you the tendencies of your plane after the initial, static conditions. So what you do is pick an axis you want to test (you\u0027re curious about your yaw, so use \u0022r\u0022) and put in an initial condition - I usually go with \u00225\u0022 - for that axis. Mash go and watch FAR generate the dynamic stability graph; the particulars of it aren\u0027t as important as the graph\u0027s shape. If the amplitude of the oscillations decreases from left to right across the graph, your plane will have a tendency to stabilize along that axis. If the amplitude stays the same, you\u0027ve got neutral stability. If the oscillations increase in amplitude with time, you\u0027ve got negative stability on that axis. And if things just fly off from the get-go, you have negative stability. With negative stability conditions, you want to re-design your plane.\n\nI have come across situations lately where the static stability was all cool and froody, but the plane wound up having negative dynamic stability. You can try to correct for it with SAS modules, but I wouldn\u0027t rely on SAS to be able to fix the problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T21:49:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 09:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"SavageSS27","CreatedById":145965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T22:42:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Make sure you\u0027re using the latest dev version; Ferri\u0027s got the aforementioned bug when it comes to cargo bays, and I\u0027m seeing it in your cross-section curve (the green one).\n\nJust downloaded the dev release as recommended.
