Avatar is what displays on posts, Profile Picture is what displays when someone looks at your profile.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe green bar is reputation, and it\u0026#39;s only earned when people share it with you. You share reputation with others by clicking on the black star-shaped button in the lower left of each post.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHope this helps.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T17:07:54Z","Content":"\n[URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48073\u0022][B]Forum FAQ \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Answers for New Users[/B][/URL]\n"}]}
