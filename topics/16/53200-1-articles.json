The answer is yes. Fuel lines and radical decouplers, the two key components needed for asparagus staging are in the parts list. The ship does have reasonable control in flight to orbit. There is only a very minor spin issue easily controlled. Note, Use LV-30s on the asparagus and the LV-45 in the core stage. It should be possible to build a lander on top with maybe needing the use of SRBs for the initial launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R3i7CSd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022R3i7CSd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RXOmbZk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RXOmbZk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tTMoH1Y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tTMoH1Y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/65LJuUV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002265LJuUV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4pevzyb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224pevzyb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GamerMitch","CreatedById":83492,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T13:03:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes,Asparagus is always possible as long as you have fuel lines and decouplers,though I haven\u0027t played around with it much lately,I just like to feed fuel from all the outer tanks into the center at once.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T13:11:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GamerMitch\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GamerMitch\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes,Asparagus is always possible as long as you have fuel lines and decouplers,though I haven\u0027t played around with it much lately,I just like to feed fuel from all the outer tanks into the center at once.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that is referred to onion staging.

Never had any problems with exploding SRBs and that was with them in a tight cluster under the main stack, so I imagine they\u0027d work just fine as an outer ring. If any part will give you problems with asparagus in the demo, its those crummy little TT38-K radial decouplers. Hard to tell when you\u0027ve got a tank sitting on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy demo design was onion, incidentally - two FL-T800s in seven stacks (center and six outboard), LV-T45 inboard and LV-T30s outboard; the RT-10s were put underneath those engines with stack decouplers for the initial stage. Usually got up to about 3000 before they had to be cut loose. The design had enough juice in the center stage to circularize, transfer to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, perform M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbital insertion, and deorbit for landing; it usually still had some gas left in it when I had to cut it loose to land. Lander was a Phallus 7 of course, but that\u0027s really the only kind of lander you \u003Cem\u003Ecan \u003C/em\u003Ebuild in the demo (I say that - you could widen the stack with additional FL-T400s, it\u0027d just give you way more gas than you need).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T23:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kurja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kurja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat parts would you need for asparagus that you won\u0027t need for onion???
