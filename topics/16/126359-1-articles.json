Since 1.0.5 (I think) when you hit F10 you toggle through four different modes (something like) : Gauges on, Gauges off, Gauges off with Highlights, Gauges on with Highlights. But I couldn\u0026#39;t see any differences between Gauges on and Gauges on with Highlights. What is it I should see highlighted?
