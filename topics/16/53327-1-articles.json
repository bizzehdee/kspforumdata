I am having problems getting the command module to unlock, and thus I cannot field any Kerbals into space. I have read that this is some kind of bug but have yet to see a detailed instructional on how to fix this bug. If someone that is aware of this fix could provide a detailed step by step I would deeply appreciate it.

If the command pod is just not showing up in the Part list (And R\u0026amp;D building) you may need to edit the config file (Especially if you play with mods) to add it to the tech tree.

I had to completely remove KSP- literally physically delete every single file including all of my saved games then run a clean install from Steam. Fixing the cache hadnt worked and neither did simply uninstalling the program because it kept some of the files. Once I wiped everything down and reinstalled it worked like a charm. Somehow there were duplicate Mk1 command pods coming from somewhere. IDK, but now it works! Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
