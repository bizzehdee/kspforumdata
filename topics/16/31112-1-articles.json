I\u0027m thinking about building a fuel depot there, but I\u0027m concerned I\u0027ll lose too much deta-v by ejecting outside the ideal transfer window, due to waiting for minmis to reach the right point in kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pontiac","CreatedById":62216,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T14:54:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ve done is plopped a gas station at 750km above Kerbin for interplanetary travel.

Kerbin orbit to Duna orbit is about 800m/s, it takes (all in all) about 1000m/s to leave Kerbin SoI from LKO (100km). So for a Duna return mission I have to have an interplanetary stage capable of around 3600m/s. But you can refuel easily on Ike there. My interplanetary ship has a dV of 8000m/s fully loaded and fueled, basically it can go anywhere in the system, as long as I can refuel on a something with less than 3.0m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 and no atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T16:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worth it.
