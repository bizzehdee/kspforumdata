The idea is to fly to specific areas and drop the capsule and do science. The plane flies just fine, with or without the capsule, not a problem. When I eject the capsule (via an action group), the capsule drops and the chutes open, and I can see the capsule floating down. Unfortunately, if I continue to fly the plane beyond about 2km beyond the capsule, it disappears. The Kerbonaut inside the capsule shows as \u0022Missing In Action\u0022. If I circle the plane about the ejected capsule, staying within 2km of it until it lands, the capsule and Kerbonaut survive ... only then am I able to fly away beyond 2km, land the plane, then switch back to the capsule and do science. I\u0027m wondering if the TR-2V Stack Decoupler is the issue?... should I use a docking port instead, and undock (answering my own question lol)? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gME1VVtAT04/VE_ScDpc4-I/AAAAAAAAEuE/xgqt8EHih8k/s800/screenshot27.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot27.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-28T17:57:59Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2014 05:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LordFerret\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T17:52:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce a ship gets beyond 2.5kms from you, it is no longer fully simulated, but becomes an abstract point travelling on rails.
