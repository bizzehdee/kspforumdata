KSP reliably hangs the second time I go into the VAB, especially when reverting from flight. Since KSP in this configuration takes like 8 Minutes to load, this is a giant PITA. I suspect memory usage, because it hangs not only KSP but the whole system, and I know that having to do too much swapping because of high memory usage can do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erelevant hardware configuration:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManjaro 64Bit (openbox distribution)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMD Athlon 2 x4 630 (4 cores @ 3 GHz)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12 GB RAM (2x 2GB, 2x 4GB)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClub 3D R9 270X\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10GB Swap on a regular Harddrive (so slooow)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my questions are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) How can I find out how much memory KSP uses? According to top, KSP uses a bit above 10 GB (RES column), but also less then 50% (MEM column). Does the MEM column count swap?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Is memory actually the problem here, or are there other issues with KSP that could make it hang the whole System? Keep in mind, everything worked before RSS/RO and associated Mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Are there any tricks to make KSP run more reliable with my current setup? I don\u0027t want to remove mods, and I would like to avoid downgrades of visual quality (i.e. ATM). Sadly, LOD works on windows only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Has anyone experience with throwing memory at KSP to make it work? I would specifically like to know if 16GB would be sufficient (changing the 2GB modules for 4GB ones) or if I would more likely need 24GB (changing the 2GB modules for 8GB ones)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
