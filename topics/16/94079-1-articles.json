I found I needed a small fuel tank as part of the docked section in order for fuel tanks in other docked sections to feed to the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind you this was also docked in space, not made in the editor. I think making it in the editor it usually worked, but docked from different launches it would not.
