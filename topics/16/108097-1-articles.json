I\u0027m already familiar with the equations for finding the delta-v for a craft, but it seems to require me finishing my design before I can learn if it has enough fuel for the task at hand. So I\u0027m wondering if there is an equation or set of equations for determining how much fuel I need for the first stage ascent of a craft for a given final stage payload.\n\nIf there\u0027s any additional information that I missed that would be helpful, let me know where I can find it and I\u0027ll post it for you.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T08:00:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 08:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by egneil**"},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:03:27Z","Content":"If you are looking just for howto get into orbit with craft design, the Kerbal Engineering Redux mod will save you a ton of time.\n\nIf you are taking an academic approach to calculation, based on experience of other players, the deltaV to reach orbit through the atmosphere is about 3400 m/s with an efficient (but not perfect) launch profile.\n\nKeep in mind, the amount of delta v required to go through the atmo is not perfectly calculatable for all crafts, since it changes based on air resistance based on cross sectional area of your rocket, as well as piloting technique in your launch profile."},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:10:56Z","Content":"I design \u0022standardized\u0022 launch stages using a dummy weight to represent the payload.

Still when I can get a stable launching platform it should help with my planning.\n\nMainly though, I\u0027m just trying to get my head around how much fuel I need for a static payload. Thinking about it now I think my main question is if you had a 9000dv first stage how much should you expect it to drop when you put on a 20t payload?"},{"CreatedByName":"Garius","CreatedById":142266,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T01:12:02Z","Content":"To answer directly, it depends on how heavy your lifter is and how much fuel it has. It\u0027s not nice clean formula. Indirectly though, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good way to think of it. As the above poster said, you should design your lifter with a particular payload weight in mind. The DV of the lifter with 0 payload isn\u0027t a particularly useful number.\n\nI generally aim for about 20% payload delivery, so my lifter will be about 4x as heavy, two stages. So eg a 5T lifter would weight 20T, for 25T total. This means I probably want 2 Reliants for liftoff. DV is usually optimized around roughly equal weight stages but it\u0027s pretty flat so I prefer more weight in the first stage to minimize TWR issues in second stage. So I\u0027d probably do something like 12T/8T, with a single swivel on the second stage (this setup can be asparagus staged which gives the bonus of gimbal from takeoff).\n\nThis gives about 1400 m/s in the first stage and 2200 in the second stage, which makes orbit on a good ascent. Tossing some BACCs on gives a bit more leeway."},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T02:47:02Z","Content":"Well, a couple things.\n\n1) Yeah, early career is tough. You have to redesign often as better parts become available, reaction wheels, elevons/wings, separators. But launchers generally only require a handful of parts, and once you unlock those you\u0027re pretty much set.\n\n2) As Garius pointed out, TWR issues can be a huge problem... \\*especially\\* during launch. So how much dV drops during ascent is \\*not\\* linear. It depends on TWR, ascent profile, and payload mass.... \\*not just payload mass\\*. TWR can have a huge impact if it goes too low.\n\n3) There\u0027s not really a good reason to be concerned with how much dV will be left after attaining orbit. Once in orbit, payload should be detached (IMO). This allows those stages\u0027 dV\u0027s to be calculated accurately for vacuum only operation (which is appropriate for most space operations, and much much simpler than concerning yourself with atmospheric dVs). Once the payload is detached, it\u0027s a simple matter. The remainder of the launch vehicle can be recovered if you\u0027re clever and compensate for that in your design process.\n\nAnd lastly, 4) There\u0027s no quick answer since everything depends on how you build and how you fly. You just have to keep doing it until you get a feel for it... but be aware that trying to operate outside what might be considered \u0022nominal\u0022 can have unpredictable (and often \\*fun\\*) results.\n\nSorry if I haven\u0027t helped out much. I\u0027m just not sure there\u0027s a satisfactory answer I could give you that would be correct. Calculating vacuum dV and comparing to that may help you get a feel for it over several launches."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T05:11:49Z","Content":"Early career is rough for running a structured fleet. This is where I let my artist out (with KER riding shotgun for analysis)\n\nI have a payload,\n\nSlap an upper stage for .5-1 Km/s vacuum. (Unless the payload is a suitable upper stage) TWR is not terribly important, but keep it high enough to circularize in 2 min (.3 should be fine)\n\nEngineer a lower stage (or set of them) for a total dV of about to LKO with the upper stage (3.5 Km/s these days). TWR is important for these.\n\nSlap some boosters so the previous rocket gives me some change in dV to play with. If possible, tweak the for better TWR though their full burn.

I guess I\u0027m just trying to build my rockets too small, as they can barely break 70~75km altitude straight up.
