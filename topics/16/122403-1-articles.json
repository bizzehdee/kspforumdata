On a typical SSTO I\u0027d have some rocket fuel tanks attached to a rocket engine and some jet fuel tanks with whipsplash jet engines attached. I calculate the fuel for the rockets so I will have enough D/V to get into orbit once I\u0027m in flame out height of the jet engines, around 22-24km. But when I disable the jet engines now I find my rocket tanks only slightly over half full with no way to reach a high orbit around at least 130k km, the jet engine draw fuel evenly from all my tanks as if I\u0027d have fuel links between the tanks. This makes no sense to me, if I have a jet engine attached to a jet tank I want it to only draw fuel from that tank, anyone knows if and how I can achieve that?

This results in less fuel for the rocket because it can\u0027t pull the fuel from the wings due to the fuel flow rules for rockets.
