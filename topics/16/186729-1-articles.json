I set it to full power and the blades immediately spin up to 460m/s, and the car gradually increases in velocity.\u00A0Reload, set it to about 10% power and the blades still spin up to 460m/s. However, once I hit about 90m/s velocity, the blade rpm begins to fall. Why is this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it something to do with drag on the blades? When my velocity is 0, (pretty much)\u00A0all of the torque is spent rotating the propellors against stationary air. When I\u0027m moving at 100m/s the torque is also fighting against air that is pushing the blades perpendicular to the torque at 100m/s... so less RPMS per unit of torque.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway I ask this as I think this phenomenon is\u00A0what limits the maximum velocity of my car/plane whatever. I seem to have a max velocity of about 115m/s with 2x rotor engines\u00A0and 130m/s with 4x rotor engines. Perhaps if I have 3x or 2x blades (not 4x) there\u0027s less drag but also less thrust, so I would need more engines or bigger engines...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I need to experiment but I was hoping someone would know the science behind it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-26T12:48:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout seeing\u00A0the actual craft, my first guess is it\u0027s your propeller pitch. Starting off you want it at a somewhat shallow angle, but as the craft begins\u00A0to accelerate, you will hit a falling off point, yes. But you can\u00A0increase the propeller pitch once you\u0027re moving to compensate, and, and it will speed you up even more\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know I\u0027m not explaining it well, and I apologize\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis video has been posted a few different times now on the forum.
