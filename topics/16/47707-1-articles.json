However it did not improve KSP\u0027s loading time very much, but it improved all of my other games a lot. Why would this happen?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eephesix\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T09:07:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESadly, the game load time is limited more by the CPU I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a couple of SSDs in a stripe set! Yet - still takes a while to load. It will probably be improved eventually.... by loading parts-on-demand perhaps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tstehler1","CreatedById":61706,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T21:43:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGraphics card and Processor are much more influential in this game than the fact that you\u0027re running it off an SSD.

I did a test of loading time on a physical drive once (a few versions ago) and got something like 47 seconds, on my SSD which is several times as fast got 45.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich i\u0027d imagine about as big a difference as I\u0027d get between different different loads on the same drive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
