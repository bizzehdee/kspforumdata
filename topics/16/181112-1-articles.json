I also have mechjeb and a few other planner mods but so far the only thing I have been able to do is spend a ton of time setting up a chain of nodes to get somewhat (usually not very) close to the intercept objects orbital plain and then waist tons of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E for final alignment. If there is a better way to achieve this or a better tool to use I would definitely appreciate the advice!

I think you\u0027re asking \u0022how do\u00A0 plan a transfer so that I will match the inclination of something that\u0027s already in orbit around the destination body\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe honest answer is that I don\u0027t know how to properly plan for it, but am certain that in many cases it simply is not possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are limited by which way you\u0027re coming from when approaching the target body. Which essentially is determined by the launch window. You can get some leeway by doing the transfer a few weeks sooner or later than the ideal hohman transfer window, but this usually won\u0027t have much of an effect. Even with the best planning tools, there\u0027s a lot of target orbits you simply cannot reach on any given transfer window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re lucky, you can make it so that your PE at capture very nearly coincides with an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E. If that is possible, do it, never mind the relative inclination. Capture into a highly eccentric orbit, then do a cheap plane change at apoapsis (which, in this scenario, also happens to coincide with an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut often, the cheapest way of getting to the target orbit is this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\ncapture into a highly eccentric orbit around Mars\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ncircularize to a very high orbit, as close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E edge as you dare\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nwait until you come across \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E, then lower PE and match inclinations in one maneuver.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSteps two and three together require considerably less than 1km/s, IIRC. I had to do that a few times, but it\u0027s been a while and I seem to have lost my notes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-04T16:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t do it with maneuver nodes. Matching planes is always a question of timing. There are two times a year when you can transfer and end up in the correct plane. However, those two times do not correspond to your optimal launch windows. So there is no way to get anything like an optimal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the best way is to use a gravitational slingshot past some CB to change your plane during your trip, and save you some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E at the same time. This is enormously tricky, and requires even more precise timing for your transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second best way, as said above, is to do the transfer at a good window and then use all the tricks at the destination and during your midcourse correction burn to minimize the cost of your plane change. This is easy and fast and has very little in the way of timing requirements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
