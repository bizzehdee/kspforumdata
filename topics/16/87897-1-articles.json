(to go to the inner solar system, I would go retrograde to Kerbin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, I would plot a transfer orbit, letting the ships float in solar orbit for sometimes 3/4 year. (Good thing Kerbals don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need air.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I look things up here, and I find launch window calculators, and you guys actually plotting direct Kerbin LKO to Jool transfer orbits. This sounds like a good idea, but with my interplanetary ships (12,000 units of fuel, 2,3 or 4 nuclear engines) a 4 km/s burn would take an hour plus, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll make two orbits of Kerbin in that time. Or actually, not make them, because halfway through the first orbit I am actually burning retrograde, the orbit becomes unstable and I fall out of the sky.

Personally I like this tool more for plotting trajectories than the alexmoon one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above link will show you where the planets need to be in alignment for doing a successful burn. The customizable \u0022parking orbit\u0022 is where you ship currently is in orbit around Kerbin (or whatever planet you are leaving). So if you are in a 80km orbit (80,000 meters) above the surface, you would change that number to 80km. I would recommend avoiding that other site unless you care about exact numbers and the math, otherwise you will confuse yourself. All you have to know is where the planets roughly need to be to do your engine burns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#2): Start somewhere easy.\u003C/strong\u003E First and foremost, if you are planning your first interplanetary mission, I recommend you send a probe first and not a kerbal or you will likely lose them. And I recommend your first destination be Duna as it is probably the easiest planet to get to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3): \u003Cstrong\u003EUnderstand the basics. \u003C/strong\u003EWhen you want to go to a planet that is farther away from the sun (Kerbol), then you want to while at sunset. What does this mean? See the map on the olex.biz site I linked to above? If you set your target to Duna, you will notice that, in your orbit around Kerbin, it tells you to burn about 30 degrees on the bottom right of the orbit. To understand this, look at your orbital map from a top down view. Kerbin, just like everything else, has an orbit with an apoapsis and periapsis. Line up your orbital map exactly as it appears on olex and you can see how Kerbin is moving towards it apopasis. Your ship, even though you are in kerbin traveling at around 2,300~m/s, is still in Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, and you are actually traveling at Kerbin\u0027s velocity around Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to add velocity into this Kerbin orbit you are in so that your orbit becomes bigger than the one around Kerbin. It\u0027s so easy to understand but hard to explain on a forum! Just try to follow exactly how that site shows you where to burn engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3) Approach the target closely.\u003C/strong\u003E Just encounter a planet isn\u0027t good enough. If you are going to Duna but you will be 21 million km away from the target, then you will probably not be able to get into a proper orbit. Also, you may come in too fast. To fix this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Get the engine burn right from Kerbin. If you are going to Duna or any planet for that matter, you want your periapsis where your encounter is to be almost in a vertical line with where your apoapsis is at Kerbin. If you encounter Duna too fast in a curved orbit where you aren\u0027t meeting at the other side of your orbit, then you will probably be coming in horrendously fast to get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Get close enough. Once you break free of Kerbin, try to fine turn your orbit along the way. Ideally you should do this when you are past the halway market to your target. You will see a \u0022closest approach\u0022 on your encounter. Add a maneuver node and play with it to try to get your orbit as close as possible, within at least 50,000 meters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4). Build the right ship. \u003C/strong\u003EMost interplanetary ships are very slow with nuclear engines. They have a high ISP but they lack the thrust that other rockets do. There are a few workarounds to this. Personally on my ship, it makes it harder to launch, but I attach four massive fuel tanks with mainsail engines. These are basically to help me push my rides out of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence. Once you break free from Kerbin, usually it\u0027s pretty easy to line up your target and make orbit. Whatever you do, build your ships as disposable as possible. Use several smaller fuel tanks with fuel lines and eject them once they run out of fuel. For your return trip, ideally you only need one nuclear engine and a fuel tank to come home without all the cargo and other junk you brought to the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T23:06:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022brainlordmesomorph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022brainlordmesomorph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewith my interplanetary ships [...] a 4 km/s burn would take an hour plus,\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, hardly any destination requires more than 2000-2500m/s on the transfer burn (if you wait for a good launch window, that is).

Raise the apoapsis if you must, but keep the periapsis down low. Use the \u0022plus one orbit\u0022 thingy on your maneuver node to plan a transfer some days in the future. Then raise your apoapsis, but keep the periapsis at wherever you determined your node needs to be be -- or in case of a low-TWR ship, perhaps a *few* degrees earlier. Add a few m/s on every orbit, beware that you won\u0027t encounter the Mun, and make the last burn so that you\u0027ll arrive at periapsis in at the pre-determined time. Plan the final maneouver at periapsis.

An apoapsis well inside Munar SOI still is 80% of Kerbin escape.

Transfer Window: I estimate a transfer window by where the planets are on a \u0022clock\u0022, like an old face clock (funny I have to describe it like that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ).

If I can get that I\u0027ll do the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Early transfer corrections: More often than not what looked like a direct transfer changes when I leave kerbin\u0027s SOI. A small burn early corrects the intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Later transfer corrections: I use kerbal alarm clock to track the transfers so I can do other things in the 66-190 days it takes to transfer. This means I add a late transfer node and make sure that the transfer is still on target, usually 20% of an orbit out from target. Part 4 and 5 burns usually don\u0027t take more than 300 d/v since the initial ejection burn setup most of the transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.
