However, the point to \u0022zeroing out\u0022 once you\u0027re at the point of closest approach is basically to reduce your relative speed to the point that the differences between the two orbits are mostly negligible. Once the two craft are close enough in position and velocity, it becomes less a matter of matching orbits and more one of steering your craft within a frictionless 3D volume so that it can link up with another stationary point within that volume. In theory you could probably do this from the point at which the navball cycles over from \u0022Orbit\u0022 mode to \u0022Target\u0022 mode (since most orbits are so big that even a 60km difference is a fairly small slice of the total pie relative to the orbit\u0027s circumference), but I generally try to aim for the closest approach I can get.

I inevitably get close to my target only to find it askew and I have to jump over there to line it back up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I like to do in this situation is to get ship A lined up with my target and moving in that direction. Then set SAS to hold that attitude. Swap over to Ship B and point it towards Ship A (Specifically the docking port I want to dock with) and activate SAS for it to hold attitude. Switch back to ship A, and perform the docking from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T23:03:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do lots of docking. After the first couple of times it\u0027s always seemed pretty easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I put my station in a circular orbit at 200km. Next a launch the ship that I want to dock and make its AP 200km. I move the PE just out of the atmosphere and let both vessels orbit till the ship is almost caught up with the station. Then I raise the PE till my intersect at AP is as close as I can get for the next orbit. (usually about 1.5 to 2km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhole on my final orbit I place a node at the intersect to raise my PE to 200km and match orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also acts as a countdown for the rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the burn is done to match orbits I line up with the relative velocity - indicator. This looks like the retrograde marker on the navball. In target mode the nav ball doesnt show prograde/retrograde, the yellow markers are Rvel \u002B and Rvel-.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI burn Rvel- till the speed shown on the navball shows 0. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I turn towards the station and use RCS to start approaching. The Rvel\u002B marker should show up once you start moving toward it. Strafe up/down and side to side with RCS to keep it over the pink target marker. It will tend to drift a little as you approach since your orbits are a close match, but not a perfect match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get to about 20m stop all relative motion and you can start lining up your final approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the suggestion about rotating the station to make docking easier is a bad one. Once you start your station rotating you\u0027ll need to use SAS to stop it. If any ships are docked with the station there\u0027s a good chance that their SAS will be fighting with the station SAS. Normally this starts as a small oscillation that increases till the station tears itself apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may not happen the first time you try it, but sooner or later it\u0027s likely to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your docking port is on the wrong side, drift past a bit then kill your relative velocity and approach from the other side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re ok with using mods the NavyFish Docking Port Alignment plugin is handy as mentioned previously, but MechJeb is even better. I\u0027ve never tried the docking autopilot so I can\u0027t comment on that, but the smartASS is very handy for holding a particular attitude and custom windows can add a lot of info you wouldn\u0027t normally see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy docking info window contains: Distance to Target, Closest Approach to Target, Relative velocity at closest approach, and RCS dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe relative velocity displayed by Mechjeb and the NavyFish plugin are also much more accurate than what the navball shows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T23:16:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been said already that -when you are close already- it\u0027s more or less safe to treat the remaining closing maneuvers as \u0027straight shots\u0027 as if you were in deep space. If you find you can\u0027t get close enough for that, or you still find you\u0027re drifting around too much and are interfered with by orbital mechanics one thing to try is to perform your docking maneuvers at higher orbits.
