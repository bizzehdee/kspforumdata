I think MechJeb is lying to you.\n\nTo reach low Moho orbit from LKO requires more than 4 km/s of delta-V, and you\u0027re trying to reach an orbit even deeper in Kerbol\u0027s gravity well. Double-check that MechJeb is also accounting for the circularization burn you\u0027ll need to match orbits (not just altitudes) with Sanrys."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T01:57:22Z","Content":"Not exactly equal when you want to return right after rescue. Interplanetary transfer dV is not a constant. It depends on the current location, how long you want to travel, etc. Most likely when you do an optimal transfer to somewhere else, it might not be the optimal launch window for going back."},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisD","CreatedById":144851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T02:29:42Z","Content":"DeMatt - you are correct - the delta-v indicated is just for the transfer to the orbit. I guess I\u0027ll need to factor in a decent margin to match velocities when I get to the correct orbit. It\u0027s looking like an 8km/s craft.\n\nHe might have to hang out where he is until I have fuel stations set up around Gilly, Duna and Moho! I hope he is well provisioned!"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T10:09:04Z","Content":"The way that I would approach this is to look in my persistance file and get the orbital elements for Sanrys. They are the block containing values such as SMA, LPE, LAN etc\n\nI would then add Sanrys as a new planetary body using those values in the launch window planner [http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/) - tha add new vessel option doesn\u0027t seem to work for me\n\nI would then use the tool to find the best time and delta v in order to rendevous with him and then use it again to find out how much delta-v I am going to need to get back"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T10:34:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have had Sanrys Kerman patiently orbiting Kerbol (Sun) at about 2.4million KM since early on in the game.

Otherwise add that, too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T10:37:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 10:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MarvinKitFox**"}]}
