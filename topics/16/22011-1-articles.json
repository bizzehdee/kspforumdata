Going faster by doing a direct burn will increase your apoapsis. When it reaches your destination altitude, stop burning. When you reach apoapsis (just before actually) burn direct again to bring your periapsis up to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConversely, you can burn retrograde to decrease your Periapsis to a lower target orbit, then when you reach periapsis, burn retrograde again to bring your apoapsis down to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
