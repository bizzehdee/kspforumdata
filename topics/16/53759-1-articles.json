So far as I understand it even mods like KAS (Kerbal attachment system) use the same method. But you can certainly check that mod out. If the issue is just not wanting fuel to flow automatically between the two, you can right click on the docking port and disable crossfeed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RHodeidra","CreatedById":50289,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T10:33:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENono, I meant the concept of fuel makes no difference, if I could still do it that would be fine, I just do not care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ideal solution would be a docking port that just attaches, in a way a docking strut would,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich could also get broken when ship A decides to fire boosters without warning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it like this: when the Space shuttle docked with Mir, they wouldn\u0027t become a slave to Mir.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, fuel MIGHT have been passed, maybe current, but in the end the controls that used these resources would remain where they were.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-20T10:52:58Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2013 10:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RHodeidra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lheim","CreatedById":62665,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T11:32:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking ports can break, but they\u0027re pretty darn sturdy.
