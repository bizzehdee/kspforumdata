You would do a little but of the burn on one pass of the maneuver node, then warp around again, and burn a little more, then continue this process until you gain enough speed to scape Kerbin. The only con of that being that it would mess up the maneuver node and you wouldn\u0027t be able to use it\u0027s information after you pass it the first time. This method will allow you to slowly gain enough speed to escape Kerbin while not forcing you to sacrifice fuel-efficiency for TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cashen","CreatedById":71281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T23:47:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could split the burn up, that would be more efficient, but you\u0027d have to be careful that your first burn doesn\u0027t take you out of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence.

As you get into those elliptical orbits, which take longer, the planets are still moving and the phase angles may be getting out of alignment. Is that increase in delta-v basically negligible? Or do you start your burns before the phase angles are properly aligned?
