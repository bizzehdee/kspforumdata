This will keep the rocket pointed up-right and give you some extra control. You can press and hold F to toggle it on and off while it\u0027s on to make minute adjustments. This also works while it\u0027s off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you can do is add control surfaces (found in the command and control tab in the VAB) to the rocket to give it a little bit of maneuverability, which will allow the A.S.A.S. to operate a little better, depending on your design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T14:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore often the high altitude flipping is caused by asymetry. If you have fins or other aero control surface, they become ineffective at higher altitudes. You want to make sure your fuel burn doesn\u0027t offset your center of gravity, also make sure your center of thrust is inline with your center of gravity. Even one engine being slightly off angle will cause a spin out of control. I had this happen on a space plane where I had one engine above and one below mounted to radial decouplers. The below one was only slightly off center on the decoupler and I spun out of control once I lost the airflow control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T15:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this is happening at high altitude then control surfaces won\u0027t have much of an effect, you\u0027ll need to use RCS instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat sort of altitude are you at and how violent is the flip? If it\u0027s fairly fast then they may be an easily identifiable cause but if it\u0027s slower then those are harder to troubleshoot - it might be that your thrust isn\u0027t under your centre of mass, either because of some small addition to the rocket or because it\u0027s bending under power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T15:48:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve got a whole bunch of fins and other draggy stuff up front, that may be the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPitch and yaw control surfaces need to be at one end or another of the ship to be effective, but putting them on the back allows their induced drag to add positive stability.

Also, turning-off ASAS may help stability. The problem with ASAS as it is is that it can cause severe oscillations in rockets that have a certain amount of instability (typically, anything that\u0027s tall and pointy...like a rocket). It corrects, but doesn\u0027t reduce the speed of it\u0027s correction until it passes over the point it was aiming for. Then it corrects just as hard back the other way, overshoots, and so-on. Both stock ASAS and MechJeb suffer from this. If it finally over-corrects too much, such that it can\u0027t correct it\u0027s over-correction, the result is the whole rocket flipping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you notice this back-and-forth oscillation, taking manual control for a bit may help matters. You can use ASAS when the rocket is more inherently stable. Reducing throttle may also help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
