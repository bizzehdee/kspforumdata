All was going well for Ore scanning and mining until a few days ago when the Surface scanners on the Mun stopped working. The unscanned biomes do not have a \u0022Run Scan\u0022 button (or whatever it says). I have only scanned the Highlands on the Mun, and when I drove my lander to the adjacent biomes, (Midlands, Highland Craters, and East Crater) the \u0022Run Scan\u0022 button never reappeared. I have two Identical landers on the surface, and both have the same problem. I thought it might be a corrupted save file or something (I don\u0027t really know much about this stuff), so I checked the landers that I have on Minmus. They both worked fine. I used the save file editor to try to figure out if I could force a scan or something but was unsuccessful. I noticed \u0022Biome Lock\u0022 in the save file on all the Biomes I have scanned, and the ones I couldn\u0027t scan.\n\nAny Ideas?"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T12:26:47Z","Content":"Weird.\n\nIt kinda sounds like the game thinks that you have already scanned all the Mun biomes, i.e. like a bug where it gives you \u0022scanned\u0022 status for free on a biome that you haven\u0027t actually scanned yet.\n\nI have no idea how such a thing could happen, but here\u0027s an easy way to test the hypothesis:\n\nIn one of the troublesome biomes, pop up the surface scanner window that shows you the ore concentration. Then drive your rover around, like a few km, while staying in the same biome. Does the ore percentage stay constant (as it would for an unscanned biome), or does it vary (as it would for a scanned biome)?"}]}
