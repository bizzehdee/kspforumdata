Raise that to the 1.5 power, we get .999135. Take the reciprocal of that, subtract 1, then reciprocal again, and we get an orbital period of 1155 days relative to the surface.\n\nSo if you\u0027re starting directly over KSC, you should have a few hundred Kerbin days before losing LOS."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T07:23:34Z","Content":"I don\u0027t put geostationary satellite at all. I just arbitrary pick one (depending on antenna I have, etc.) and shoot one rocket that carries *all* satellites on this orbit, and place them in one launch. First batch will be manned, of course, but that doesn\u0027t matter. You have full freedom of choosing which orbit you want to put. On the other hand if you just launch one satellite at a time, you\u0027ll need a careful plan of the second launch and often you can\u0027t just pick arbitrary orbit you want for the first one."},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T09:16:51Z","Content":"There is a simple way to know when you are in a true geostationary orbit (as opposed to a mere geosynchronous orbit,)\n\nIf your ground speed is zero and stays zero, you are there. \n\nThis rather requires you to be directly above the equator, and at an altitude of 3468km. Correction, 2868km above surface.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nHowever, from your concern about communications line-of-sight, I believe that what you are looking for is not a geostationary orbit, but a geosynchronous one.\n\nThe only requirement for this is that you orbit in the right direction, and have an orbital period of \\*exactly\\* one day kerbal time.\n\nYour ground track may wobble around in interesting ellipses or even figure-eights, but if your period matches Kerbin\u0027s rotation, you will not drift off to the east or west.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T10:38:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 10:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MarvinKitFox**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T12:59:44Z","Content":"What works for me is not to worry so much about being totally geostationary. If your satellite wobbles a little bit around a fixed spot in Kerbin\u0027s sky, that\u0027s good enough because you\u0027ll still never lose touch with the tracking station. It\u0027s like how Ike wanders around a small patch of Duna\u0027s sky but never leaves that area. So at the bottom line, all that matters is orbital period, which is what keeps your satellite from drifting below KSC\u0027s horizon over time. Put your satellite as close to KSC\u0027s zenith as you can, at approximately the right altitude and approximately 0 inclination, but don\u0027t sweat it if you don\u0027t get any of that exactly right. Then open some window that will show your orbital period and use RCS to tweak that until it\u0027s exactly 6 hours. That\u0027s it."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T21:03:15Z","Content":"Note that without something like HyperEdit (Or editing the save file directly) nothing will keep your satellites from wandering eventually. It\u0027s impossible to get the orbits exact. They may be good for years, but not forever.\n\nI vaguely recall a mod out there that would do it. I think IIRC that if you got a satellite within 1% of the orbit you wanted, it would allow you to snap it to that orbit to keep it there forever."},{"CreatedByName":"Orbital Vagabond","CreatedById":145561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T21:41:30Z","Content":"Is Kerbin\u0027s sidereal period still 6 hours?
