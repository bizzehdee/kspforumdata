Personally I put my career mode on 50% funds, 40% science, and 60% reputation, and didn\u0027t use any admin policies. So far it\u0027s turning out roughly right, although I think the funds might be just a tad on the low side, and rep could have been lower. 60/40/40 might have been a better start level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer the actual question, yes it\u0027s very plausible to do an early Mun landing. If you have stack separators and LV-45 engines, that\u0027s about all you need. Access to the LV-909 is nice for landers, but not mandatory if you build carefully. Never tried with just the basic LV-30, can\u0027t remember if it can gimbal; if not it\u0027ll be a pain to steer. You can also consider Minmus, which takes about the same fuel to get to orbit around it, but requires significantly less to land on and get back from. Also much softer touchdowns, so you can get away without landing legs more easily \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend getting the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/222685-kerbal-engineer-redux-v1-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer\u003C/a\u003E mod, which will show you up front what your thrust to weight ratios are on your rocket, and the delta-v you can expect.

For Mun, you want 4550 (low Kerbin orbit) plus 860 (Mun intercept) plus 210 (low Mun orbit) plus 640 to actually land; a total of 6260 to get to Munar soil, if you pilot it perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a rule of thumb, I like to touchdown on Mun with 1200 dv left in the tank, which is enough to make a small hop to an adjacent biome for a second surface sample and then come home, but it seems possible to ride the fumes back with just 600 or so, if you\u0027re careful about how to leave Mun\u0027s orbit and don\u0027t mind hitting Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at 3km/s. Just make sure to plan all the manoeuvre node up front, before you commit to the first big burn, so\u0027s you can see whether you\u0027ll make it or not! Playing with the angle at which you leave Mun\u0027s orbit can vastly alter the eventual cost \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously overspeccing delta-v is tempting, but be wary of over-engineering your ships; every kg of extra mass you add from stuff you don\u0027t vitally \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E means tens of kg of extra fuel to get it where it\u0027s going. I\u0027d start by making a one-piece lander with 2000 delta-v in it, at least 0.2 TWR, and some parachutes, which you can be confident will get you from low Mun orbit, to the surface, and back to Kerbin. After that, all you need to do is stage more fuel tanks and rockets, totalling 5600\u002B delta-v, who\u0027s job it is to get you to Munar orbit. If you\u0027ve kept the lander light, this isn\u0027t nearly as hard as it sounds! A lot of problems people have with getting enough delta-v seems to be overspecced craft that weigh too much.

In short, I\u0027ll echo what\u0027s been said before: you can get some spectacular gains from a Munar flyby*, milk crew reports to the greatest extent possible, and EVA reports are your friend. One caution on crew reports: they cost 30 electrical charge to send, the Mk. 1 capsule stores 50 charge, and the only way to get electricity before solar panels is to fire liquid-fuel engines (not including the LV-909, which strangely has no electrical generation). You also need some of that electricity to turn your vehicle: reaction wheels cost charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*The way to do it is a free-return trajectory. This requires that you set up an early, high-thrust Hohmann transfer which gives you a figure-8 around the Mun and back into Kerbin atmosphere. Don\u0027t be too afraid if you can\u0027t quite nail the Kerbin atmosphere: you can perform correction burns very efficiently at your Munar periapsis (all praise Oberth).

If you go into a polar orbit, you can also collect the poles, tundra the legitimate way, and badlands: Kerbin will rotate under you as you orbit, allowing you to fly over everything if you are sufficiently patient. The Gravioli detector also has the wonderful property of having biome-unique reports from low orbit (and high orbit too), but takes a long time to get to, but everything else is either global (unique to situation, not biome) or requires that you be in atmosphere or landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI designed a Munar rocket which requires a bit more than Umbral\u0027s rocket: it requires basic rocketry, stability, survivability, and Science Tech, but is 100% capable of landing 4 goo pods and 4 Science Jrs. on the Mun and returning. Three pieces of advice not conveyed by the picture: add a couple radial parachutes (the lander is too heavy for the one parachute I used on the test), right-click and remove all monopropellant from the command pod, and right-click the RT-10s to set their max thrust to be about 60-80%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HtGdMMv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HtGdMMv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-20T14:45:15Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2014 02:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T17:34:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eddiew\u0022 data-cite=\u0022eddiew\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...Never tried with just the basic LV-30, can\u0027t remember if it can gimbal; if not it\u0027ll be a pain to steer...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can\u0027t gimbal but is cheaper and higher-thrust than the T45.
