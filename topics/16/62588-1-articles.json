I had always assumed it indicated the point at which you would encounter the target object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, from the delta-V map I use, it takes 950 m/s to get escape Kerbin from LKO. It then takes 965 m/s to get to Jool intercept. I was wondering if this refers to a Jool encounter or to get into an elliptical orbit about Jool with a low periapsis and apoapsis close to the edge of its SOI. I was thinking that surely if it does refer to an encounter, then there is no way the map could be correct in either direction. It would have to take more delta-V to get to LKO from a transfer from Jool that it would from Duna after the encounter was made, as you would be travelling faster coming from Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-09T03:06:52Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2014 03:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rusty6899\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T23:36:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Intercept\u0027 on a delta V map, refers to the amount of delta V needed for your ejection burn to intercept the target.
