It was able to establish capture around Duna, get a Kerbin return encounter, and establish Kerbin capture all without any aerobraking. Add the encounter dV (which was on the transfer stage, not on the return module) of around 1080 and it comes to a total of about 3400m/s. Probably could\u0027ve done a little closer to the listed amount of 3314, but I like to play it safe. This was in 1.0.2, using only stock parts. The 2.5m poodle engine specifically. That said, that won\u0027t allow you to do any landing or orbital maneuvers (including rendezvous) once there, you\u0027d need other craft for that purpose. For rv maneuvers, you may want an extra 500-1000m/s. You could go with less, but intercepts would be long and annoying. \n\nI sent crew return modules, landers/exploratory vehicles, fuel/supplies, all in separate crafts/launches.\n\nThat 1700m/s estimate seems a bit low, even with aerobraking... it\u0027d be a challenge to manage.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T21:57:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 09:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by impyre**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T21:57:43Z","Content":"Using this Delta V map, you can add up all of the values along the path to your destination, but be sure to exclude capture burns because you can aerobrake both ways. It adds up to about 1,100 m/s to get there and just under 500 m/s to return. NOTE: you should add some Delta-V to the first value for orbital maneuvering in Duna orbit. This includes inbound aerobraking, but excludes landing on Duna. NOTE: these values start from Kerbin orbit, excluding the 3500 m/s to get to orbit). Since you are inexperienced in interplanetary travel, you should add a few hundred m/s of wiggle room in your craft design. EDIT: I can\u0027t find the Delta-V to land, but is is not too far off from the old value, it is on the forum somewhere. And one tip: make your lander somewhat aerodynamic; Duna does have an atmosphere (duh), so design accordingly.\n\n![DV_map.png](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.fr/images/6/61/DV_map.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T22:06:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 10:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tank Buddy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonboy","CreatedById":134111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T22:05:34Z","Content":"The burn to get you to Duna will cost 1,100 m/s.

It\u0027s still a reasonable topic of discussion, so if someone *\u003Cu\u003Enow\u003C/u\u003E* has questions to answer, it\u0027s worth asking them and having them answered.  But please note that the folks who posted up to May of last year have already said their piece and probably don\u0027t need more feedback at this point.  ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\nHere\u0027s what a typical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E budget to get to Duna looks like.\n\n1. Get to Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.  I\u0027ll assume you already have a handle on this one.  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n2. Eject to Duna.  [http://ksp.olex.biz](http://ksp.olex.biz) is a useful tool for this.  Exact amount depends on how close to the ideal window you are, and how high your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E parking orbit, but it\u0027s on the order of **1050 m/s.**\n3. Arrive at Duna and aerobrake, then land with parachutes (possibly a brief burst of retro-thrust to cushion landing, since it can be hard to slow down enough with just parachutes).  Minimal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E needed.\n4. Ascend from Duna surface to low Duna orbit.  This varies depending on ship design, ascent profile, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, height of parking orbit, etc., but a ballpark figure is around **1200 m/s**.\n5. Eject from Duna orbit to go home to Kerbin.  Again, http://ksp.olex.biz, this is around **600 m/s**.\n6. Arrive at Kerbin and aerobrake, then land with parachutes.  Minimal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E needed.\n\nSo, starting from Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, you\u0027ll need a bare minimum of around **3 km/s** for a trip to Duna surface and back.  If you leave your return-to-Kerbin fuel in orbit around Duna when you go down to the surface and back (a not uncommon mission design), then that\u0027ll help your fuel budget.\n\nAllowing a bit of safety margin, then **4 km/s** of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E should be ample for the trip, as long as you have some reasonable launch windows."},{"CreatedByName":"ElectricDeath5","CreatedById":169900,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-07T17:23:43Z","Content":"thanks!!!!!"}]}
