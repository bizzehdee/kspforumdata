So say I visit the Highlands of Minmus, using the goo canister. Say it gives me a potential total of 100 science. Transmitting it only gives me 40% of that potential science. What does the new 3 ton processing lab do, exactly? Does it increase that total 100 science, or does it increase the 40% that I can transmit back home?

I thought that the processing lab was meant to give me the ability to continue performing lots of experiments (science spamming, to a point). Am I missing something? Or is the only way to recover those 76 science points to bring the sample back home.
