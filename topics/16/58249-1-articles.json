Geofwise Kerman (the sole occupant) got out to change the tires. Once he\u0027d repaired 3 of the 4, the rover took off without him! (Didn\u0027t set the parking brake...). The rover has plenty of juice, solar panels, batteries, and isotopic generators; and it\u0027s a nice stable design in a fairly flat region of Duna. Any ideas on how to stop this runaway rover and get Geofwise back on board?
