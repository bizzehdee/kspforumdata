That is not my question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I want to do is put communication satellites in the same orbit as the various planets, so that I can have reliable coverage of both sides of the planet from opposite sides of the sun. Question is, how to get there. For Kerbin I figured out I could just eject them, one prograde and one retrograde, and tune their orbital periods to 5/6 and 7/6 of a year and then circularize at the correct apsis to be back in kerbin\u0027s orbit. For Duna and Eve I guess I can do the same thing, slingshot around them and eject prograde and retrograde and get into resonant orbits, but is that really the best way?

I have two potential vehicles, one with 6 km/s and one with 8.3 km/s, and I\u0027d like to use the cheaper one but I can spare the funds if I need the bigger one. Has anyone ever done this before? Can KSPTOT be used to calculate this? If so how? Does MechJeb have any useful maneuver planners for this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Come to think of it, the contracts for Duna and Eve are both generous enough that I could just launch the big ones and use that trajectory... I\u0027ll probably end up doing that, but I\u0027m curious to see how others would do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT 2: For the Moho network I would like to find a more optimized trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-07T22:27:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2016 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ruiluth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-07T22:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor other planets I\u0027d probably do a Hohmann transfer just before, or just after the optimum to arrive just outside the planet\u0027s sphere of influence and then circularize to match the planet\u0027s orbit around the Sun.
