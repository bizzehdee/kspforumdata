Then there is a slider that will let you crank the friction way up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: If the upper part of a drillshaft impacts the surface while it is running, it will bounce your entire craft into the air. And I don\u0027t mean the head of the drill, I mean one cylinder down on the shaft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of a bug in the physics library (which KSP has no control over), anything that has a suspension will bounce on the ground. I call it microbouncing. This will always cause any craft with legs or wheels to slowly drift downhill (and sometimes uphill). Often\u00A0it\u0027s better to retract legs if possible.
