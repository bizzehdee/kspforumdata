I\u0027ve gotten to LKO a couple times with barely enough dV to deorbit.

One time, I\u0027ll get it to 80K without enough dV to circularize, the next I can\u0027t seem to get to out of the atmosphere. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s the profile I\u0027m flying.

There\u0027s a thread on that somewhere . \u00A0Ramjet gives max power at mach 3, Rapier mach 3.75. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Make sure you\u0027re at a decent alt (17km\u002B) before hitting mach 3\u002B or you\u0027ll melt. \u00A0 Once you have hit optimum speed, you can either accelerate in level flight, but every knot faster will result in less thrust and more drag, or you can climb while maintaining same speed. \u00A0 The thrust starts halving every 2km above 22km so generally i accelerate mostly level here, until we\u0027re getting near mach 4.5. \u00A0 After that point, jet engine thrust really falls off a cliff so use any excess power to climb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor b), if you have a high thrust weight ratio, it doesn\u0027t make a lot of difference how you fly and it\u0027s probably more similar to a rocket ascent. But you might be penalising yourself with excess engine mass. \u00A0If thrust weight ratio is lower, then \u00A0managing \u00A0 lift:drag, AoA and temperature is absolutely paramount. \u00A0Watch the second video in that series for details.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-23T19:08:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2016 07:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AeroGav\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-23T18:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt really depends a lot on whether you are building an\u00A0MK1, MK2, or MK3 spaceplane. MK1 parts have much lower drag than the others, and\u00A0not much\u00A0fuel -- but I think they are the easiest. MK2 parts have much higher drag, and store the same piddly amount of fuel -- so they are probably the hardest to get to orbit. MK3 stuff is for going totally overboard -- the main problem there is flyability and durability, I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, I find that the whiplash engines give the best airbreathing properties. If the nuke rocket engines can give you enough thrust to accelerate, then usually they outperform the rest.
