When I reloaded and jumped back to my ship, the two parts had collided and bounced off each other. I got them back under control and lined up to dock again, but the docking port on one of my ships won\u0027t connect with the other. \n\nWhen I right click on one of the docking ports, there\u0027s an entry in the pop up window that says \u0022Status: locked\u0022. I tried doing an EVA with an engineer Kerbal to see if it was repairable, but no luck. I\u0027ll give your suggestions a try, but I have the feeling I might be out of luck unless I can \u0022unlock\u0022 the damaged docking port. \n\nI\u0027m in career mode and it would really stink if I have to go back an earn enough $$$ to rebuild this part. \n\nHas anyone else seen this, and have any advice on how to fix it?"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T20:10:49Z","Content":"\u003E Has anyone else seen this, and have any advice on how to fix it?\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100285-BUST-Docking-Ports-Won-t-Dock-Undock](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100285-BUST-Docking-Ports-Won-t-Dock-Undock)\n\nSome of the methods require save file editing."},{"CreatedByName":"Seaview123","CreatedById":130421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T14:40:17Z","Content":"Thanks, the directions on that link worked (my docking port was a shielded one and the game seemed to think the shield was still closed).

Save files would help me in creating a supplemental fix to include in my stock bug fixes.\n\nKJR did introduce a problem with docking ports about a month ago, and has since been fixed. What I don\u0027t know is if KJR prevents this problem completely, or if it only fixed it\u0027s own problem with inadvertently disabling docking ports.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T20:27:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, you have to set your target docking port as \u0022target\u0022 and control from your own docking port, also, try clicking T many times, that will activate and deactivate the SAS, which somehow helps on docking when you\u0027re that close.\n\nYou don\u0027t have to target the docking port as a \u0022target\u0022 or control from a docking port. The ports when aligned correctly will snap up automatically, doing the other steps just makes it usually easier. SAS may actually over compensate sometimes and pull you away from the port at times.
