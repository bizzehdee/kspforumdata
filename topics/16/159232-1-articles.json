I was inspired by Hazardish stock tiltwing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and while I copyed the design from his speedbuild video, I cannot get the system working. The hinge is very kraken-prone, and often the wheels parially glitch outside the strut-circle - but most importantly, when re-docking the wing, only one port will dock and then the whole wing clips through everything else, the hinge mechanism included.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-18T08:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour post as it stands is an observation rather than a question. \u00A0Reading between the lines though, you\u0027ve watched this video (posted for others reference):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139446-a-tutorial-on-how-to-make-fully-stock-hinges-and-pivots-building-a-tilt-wing-vtol-ssto/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=2572633\u0026amp;embedComment=2572633\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-2572633\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand it\u0027s not working for you despite copying the design. \u00A0I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m no hinge specialist, but there are plenty of people on the forums that are. \u00A0What I would do is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Search for other hinge / swing wing design threads, such as:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154733-stock-grumman-f-14-tomcat-with-automatic-swing-wings/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) If you can\u0027t find the answer you are looking for, post what you have in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/21-the-spacecraft-exchange/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ESpacecraft Exchange\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0with a link to the craft file, decent description of the assistance you require, and a couple of nicely worded \u0022pleases and thank yous\u0022 and I reckon one of the specialists will weigh in for you and tell you where you are going wrong/right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
