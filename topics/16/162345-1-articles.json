Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E works in the code by having electrical output but requiring no input; it just creates ElectricCharge from nothing. \u00A0As far as how to use it, it has nodes at the round ends and it also surface attaches, so it can go anywhere on your rover. \u00A0Just stick it on and it will work. \u00A0It is heavier than every stock solar panel but the Gigantor, and\u00A0its power-to-mass ratio is the worst of any electrical part. \u00A0It\u0027s extremely expensive--though you play sandbox so that\u0027s not a problem for you--but the point is that the comparatively free power is the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0advantage of an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.

Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E produces 45), but when used in combination with a solar power system, you have to consider that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E nullifies some of the battery requirement for the night side, not just the solar panel. \u00A0For example, let\u0027s say you\u0027re in low orbit of Jool, which has an orbital period of close enough to one hundred minutes. \u00A0If I have electrical equipment that requires, say, 100 EC per minute to operate, then I use up 10,000 EC per orbit. \u00A0Two Gigantor solar panels, at .3 tonnes each, will provide that power on the daylight side, but for the night, I need 4,000 EC of storage (the darkness time on that orbit is about forty minutes). \u00A0A Z-4K provides that at .2\u00A0tonnes, for a total electrical mass of .8\u00A0tonnes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut wait, that\u0027s not the whole picture! \u00A0Two Gigantors produce 114 EC per minute at Jool, but my equipment uses 100 of that, so I\u0027m only devoting 14 EC per minute to charging the battery on the day side. \u00A0That gives me 840 EC in the battery when I go to the dark side, not 4,000. \u00A0Adding another Gigantor gives me a total of 4,260 EC per daytime per orbit to charge the battery. \u00A0This means that we need another solar panel\u00A0whose only job is to charge the battery, and the total needed mass is 1.1\u00A0tonnes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we use an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E, we get 45 EC per minute forever. \u00A0This means that we can figure the electrical needs based on a 55 EC per minute requirement. \u00A0One Gigantor provides that at Jool (with only 2 EC left over), and the reduced load means I only need to store 2,200 EC to last the night. \u00A0Two\u00A0Z-1K batteries and one Z-200 give this for\u00A0.11\u00A0tonnes. \u00A0A second Gigantor (plus the 2 EC left over from the first) provides 3,540 EC every daytime per\u00A0orbit; the total electrical system is now .08 for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E, .11\u00A0for the three batteries, and .6 for the two Gigantors, for a total of .79\u00A0tonnes. \u00A0If I use two RTGs, then I can switch the batteries with a Z-400 and get rid of one of the Gigantors, for a total mass of .48\u00A0tonnes--this is less than one half\u00A0the mass of the solar-only system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso on the subject of Jool, remember that every one of Jool\u0027s moons is tidally locked, so the nights get quite long on Bop and Pol. \u00A0Any surface rover will need you to think about the means of power generation if you want to use it at night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen we go to Eeloo, note that a Gigantor still provides 33 EC per minute, so it does have some use there, but Eeloo is past the point where the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E outperforms the stock solar panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt Dres, on the other hand, a single Gigantor provides over 162 EC per minute. \u00A0At a 12 km orbit, you have an orbital period of approximately 45 minutes. \u00A0The darkness time here will be in the order of 15 minutes. \u00A0This requires 1,500 EC of battery if we\u0027re using the same 100 EC per minute rocket we sent to Jool, which we can get for .075 tonnes. \u00A0RTGs mass at .08\u00A0and you\u0027re already down to one solar panel, so there\u0027s no way to improve on the solar-only system with a hybrid as far as orbiting craft are concerned--but three RTGs will power the craft on their own at a mass of .24 tonnes, rather than the solar system\u0027s .375 tonnes. \u00A0It will also cost sixteen times more to save 135 kg, but that\u0027s not a problem for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-21T21:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223098743\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162345\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221498049105\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166190\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nascarlaser1\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, nascarlaser1 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E core by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105198\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RoverDude\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0also adds in different nuclear reactors of different sizes.
