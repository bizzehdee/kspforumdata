If it has a kerbal in it, i think you said it did, you could get out and push with jetpack fuel, so you can refuel infinatly with the command pod. As long as you get your apoasis below 60 ish kilometers it will take a few orbits, but eventuall, your orbit will lower and Bill will come back. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T02:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, get out and push might work.

A rescue ship is very much like doing a planet rondevous. Set an orbit inside of target, and you can use the navigation nodes to plan your burns to get pretty close. Once you get close, try to match speeds as best you can, then jetpack them over to the rescue craft. The other option if you want the vessel back is do the same as above, but use a scoop of landing legs to push against the other craft and decelerate it to a de-orbital altitude that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PhysicII","CreatedById":99100,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T05:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks guys, pushing the ship seems to be working.
