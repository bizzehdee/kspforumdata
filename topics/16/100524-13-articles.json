I\u0027d dump the whole thing and replace it with a proper nose cone (nothing else to put there that\u0027d be useful at the moment, not even a Circular Intake), but of course the point of the craft is to test the LES in atmosphere, so...at least I got the wave drag area down. Critical Mach number changed in the wrong direction...\n\nI take it the spikes in the yellow line come from the bush plane landing gear, and then in the way back it\u0027s the combination of the tail and the Thuds? I probably oughta take some sci to invest in some proper retractable gears in the near future...maybe go for Landing next up after Aerodynamics.\n\nI recall somebody on the main FAR thread saying something about the new FAR not placing the position of the CoL ball correctly - I\u0027m forced to wonder if that\u0027s affecting me with this plane. I\u0027d say something except A) it\u0027s already been said, at least I think so, and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) I don\u0027t have a flight log to report so anything I could say wouldn\u0027t be helpful. All I know is that I had the main wing down first, then added the Tail Fins forward, then the AV-R1s forward of those, and the CoL marker didn\u0027t budge. The plane still had pitch-up tendencies as it was, which probably could be fixed by moving the main wing aft. I did do the test run last night and everything was ok up until the test was successfully completed and the rockets were switched off. The jet had flamed out from lack of air and the plane slowed to subsonic speeds, and then proceeded to pitch up and enter a spin. Tore the main wings off in the attempt to recover, leaving me without roll authority...though I damn near was able to recover enough control to return to level flight (at least I thought I was about to a couple of times).\n\nComments? I\u0027m pretty sure there\u0027s not much else I can do with this particular plane that y\u0027all haven\u0027t already told me to do (move the CoM forward, move the wing back, etc.) or that I can do at the present time.

I should take a screenie with the numeric trans-sonic properties of the plane and voxels on just to see what all it\u0027s doing.\n\nThe problem I\u0027ve got now is the new characteristics of air-breathing engines in atmosphere. This was a plane that was able to get up to Mach 4 and 30k prior to 1.0; last night she struggled to get past Mach 2.7 and 25k, while simultaneously if I started the engines up at full throttle I\u0027d have far too much thrust at takeoff and rip things off the wings (last night it was one of the flaps that went). Can any of y\u0027all give me a quick lowdown of the new limits I can expect from air-breathing engines as well as what is now a reasonable spaceplane ascent profile? \n\nGot the Tylenol to its new limits three times before I decided to just go for it. I got the plane\u0027s Ap up to 70k but circularization would\u0027ve required 800 m/s of delta-V, and it simply didn\u0027t have that much fuel left at that point - not even close. I\u0027m assuming the underslung nacelle design is out at this point given the new wave drag generation feature.\n\nAn overview of rocket flight would also be nice as well; I\u0027ve been following the guidelines for new stock aero rocket launches for 1.0 and those have worked out...okay. My rockets want to oscillate as I make my way towards 45 degrees at 15k but once I get there it smooths out as a rule. I\u0027d like to figure out how to make the flight nice and smooth the entire way, though. I\u0027ve also had issues between FAR and StageRecovery - they appear to not be playing nice with one another after I started using Fanno, despite having something like 24 side chutes and a powered probe core on the stages (i.e. something I *could* recover - and occasionally *have* recovered - were I to do so manually.)"},{"CreatedByName":"ratchet freak","CreatedById":119895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T14:41:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, it looks like I need to learn how to fly once again...\n\u003E Last night I went ahead and ported my craft from my 0.90 litterbox into my 1.0.2 litterbox.

I dunno.\n\nThis sort of formulaic approach to aircraft design simply doesn\u0027t work. It\u0027s all about balance and compromises and the right tool for the job.\n\nYou need enough TWR to reach takeoff speed before the end of the runway. How much that is will depend a lot on the takeoff speed of your ship. This will, in turn, depend a lot on your lift (and is therefore related to your wing loading). But those wings generate drag and are dead weight in space...\n\nHow much wing always depends on what you plan to do. Heavy loads call for bigger wings, high speeds call for smaller wings. Straight-line speed wants high wing loading, high-G aerobatics wants low wing loading. Big wings aid low-speed fuel efficiency and stability, and make it a lot easier to land.

I did notice the same kind of behavior you were describing with the design, a catastrophic loss of yaw control around Mach 3 at 10k. Also noticed the same behavior around 20k in the Mach 3-4 regime, this with the game green-lighting the stability derivatives at my usual benchmark levels. So I went into the simulator and ran it at 10k/3 with the initial r parameter set to 5 - and I got a graph with increasing oscillations with time. Same occurred at 20k/3. At 30k/4 the graphs were flying out the window. The crapper of it is that ordinarily I wouldn\u0027t hit the simulators unless I had a red light (you know, a bonafide reason to go to the graphs), and at all of the benchmarks the numbers stayed green...\n\nI thought I\u0027d taken screenies - could\u0027ve sworn I\u0027d taken a bunch of them - with the graphs open. For some reason I don\u0027t have them.\n\nDidn\u0027t do anything else spaceplane wise last night, though it turns out I did take a screenie of my little do-nothing plane:\n\n![Nu9zv65.png](http://i.imgur.com/Nu9zv65.png)\n\nCaveat on the design: I wasn\u0027t expecting to make orbital altitude ...which is why it ran out of electrical power before I could make the insertion burn.\n\nLast thing I\u0027ll post this morning is the Javelin, an experimental design I was playing around with:\n\n![UQqjFF3.png](http://i.imgur.com/UQqjFF3.png)\n\nI\u0027ll admit that this one was me solely going by formulas again and forgetting the lessons of the past, though I think if I change the design from where the jets are slung under the wings to where they\u0027re more flush with the fuselage it has a fair amount of promise. Six tonne probe lifter, made Mach 3.5 by 25k, failed due to insufficient pitch authority after I lit the rocket. Haven\u0027t adjusted the design at all since the initial flight; I\u0027m thinking canards and strakes; the root of the wings is not as long as I\u0027d have liked. I was shooting for a takeoff TWR of 0.75 (which has since been established as \u0022a bit much), a wing loading of 0.6 (comparable to the Shuttle), a wing aspect ratio of 2:1 (again, comparable to the Shuttle) and ~1,350 in rocket delta-V (assuming I\u0027d get the design up to 1000 m/s before I had to switch over). Those are B9 procedural wings I\u0027m using there, and that was before yesterday\u0027s patch was released.\n\n(The \u0022backwards command module\u0022 in the screenie, incidentally, is being caused by the payload - all I had in there was an NRAP test module set to six tonnes, which was indeed pointed aft.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T14:25:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 02:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T14:24:06Z","Content":"The intakes were near the back of the wings, under the fuselage; I often use them to smooth the drag transition between wings and tail.\n\nI tried adding strakes to the Minithud (the red thing above) to give it a more reasonable stall speed.

I\u0027m not quite sure what FAR is using voxels for - my understanding is that they\u0027re measuring drag on certain parts of a craft. All I know is that you want to try to keep the green line as smooth as possible and the yellow line as flat as you can manage. That brought me to the notion of sticking a pair of Thuds on either side of a Turbojet; it seemed to me that sort of setup would generate a fair amount of drag near the engine. Right before I made the switch to FAR, my stock Turbojet engine setup used 24-77 engines for rocket thrust, which y\u0027all talked me out of using because they were \u0022draggy parts\u0022. Given the new wave drag model of new FAR, I wanted to investigate if that setup was still a bad idea. So I built a testing rig - a Ram Intake, Probe core with battery, fuel supply, and Engine Nacelle and whatever engine combos I wanted to put with it. I tested a RAPIER by itself, the Turbojet/pair of Thuds (Mk-55s) setup, and a setup for Turbojet/Twitches (24-77s) that produced a comparable amount of thrust as the combined Thuds (240 kN). Since they\u0027ve been reduced to 16 kN each, that works out to 15 Twitch engines - 16 was easier to build (just stick the SPH into Radial mode, set it for 8x symmetry and put two sets on). Here are the results:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/jkB3m)\n\nThe Twitch setup produced more thrust, more delta-V, less mass and less overall drag; the tradeoff is higher part count and higher expense. I decided to try it out on yet another transporter spaceplane:\n\n![9Uz7Fbz.png](http://i.imgur.com/9Uz7Fbz.png)\n![W6UJvvn.png](http://i.imgur.com/W6UJvvn.png)\n\nCrummy screenies - I know - but they were the only ones I had that were any good at all.\n\nI didn\u0027t like this design much. Static wing loading was around 0.6 (on purpose) and TWR on the Runway was 0.51 (I was shooting for 0.55). In flight, it didn\u0027t want to do much past Mach 3 at 20k - and I had to dive from a higher altitude to get it to go that fast in the first place. I suspect it would\u0027ve done better as a dual-engine plane. I also didn\u0027t optimize the craft\u0027s wave drag curves - a horrible thing to neglect when you know you haven\u0027t got a lot of excess thrust in the first place. Finally (and this is embarassing) I didn\u0027t add a dedicated liquid fuel load. The plane made orbit but it ran out of its own fuel in the process and I had to cannibalize the payload to make it work. I do think the design has potential, though. I just need to make some serious tweaks - like smoothing out the fuel fuselage, removing the gap between the wing and the engine or filling it in, maybe shuffling the canards around a bit, adding some damn liquid fuel, replacing the Engine Nacelle with a Pre-cooler, and so on. It has an all-moving fin; that was laziness/lack of time on my part and something I should take some time to correct. This one also has a support unicycle wheel to curtail the risk of tail strike; I\u0027ll try replacing it with a pair of wheels and see what that does (if anything; I wasn\u0027t convinced that kind of setup was strictly necessary with this particular plane). Should also take some SPH screenies too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T14:25:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 02:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T14:42:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Last night I had a thought. I\u0027m not quite sure what FAR is using voxels for - my understanding is that they\u0027re measuring drag on certain parts of a craft.\n\nYou probably know this, but just in case: a voxel is a volumetric pixel. In other words, voxels are what you use to build a 3 dimensional model out of tiny little cubes.\n\nIn the stock game, lift and drag are calculated for each piece individually, then summed for the whole craft. A stock aero ship is essentially a collection of separate parts flying in close formation. In FAR, the mod instead creates a 3-D model of the entire ship (this is the voxel bit), then works out the aerodynamic properties of the shape as a whole. Doing it this way allows FAR to account for part clipping and rotation: in stock, a wing sunk halfway into the fuselage works exactly the same as one that\u0027s fully exposed. In FAR, only the bit of wing exposed to the airstream will have an effect. This also allows FAR designers to construct their own cargo bays etc from structural parts and have them properly shield their contents.\n\nThe \u0022lots of Twitch radials\u0022 approach will be better in some circumstances, but not all, thanks to the area rule stuff.\n\nThe way to get your wave drag down is to minimise sudden changes in cross-sectional area. However, a conventional mid-wing design nearly always has a sharp drop in cross section immediately behind the wings, which then goes up again as it hits the tail empennage.\n\nSticking a few relatively bulky parts (Thuds, radial intakes, landing gear, mystery goo, monoprop tanks etc) in between the wings and tail is a good way of filling this gap. Most of my mid-wing turbothud ships actually generate more drag with the Thuds removed than with them in place.\n\nDrag needs to be considered holistically; the drag of a constructed FAR ship is not the sum of its parts."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T15:16:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This also allows FAR designers to construct their own cargo bays etc from structural parts and have them properly shield their contents.\n\nI.

The V-tail, however, was a spur of the moment decision.\n\nThis design was *almost* successful - it made it into orbit under its own power and launched a fully-loaded payload without issue. But, it didn\u0027t have enough Oxidizer afterwards to de-orbit. I\u0027m guessing my flight profile had something to do with that, though (maybe I lit the rockets too low), so I\u0027m going to try again tonight.\n\nThe main thing I\u0027m worried about at the moment is whether or not the plane will still be dynamically stable after fulfilling its mission (i.e. during descent and landing). It strikes me that the main wing may be a bit too far forward, and RCS Build Aid is telling me the CoM is going to shift back quite a little ways (the RCS you\u0027re seeing in the SPH screenies is for the probe; the plane itself has no RCS capability). Makes me wish I could rely on the CoL marker to be accurate. FAR green lit me up to 30k/M4, but that was with tanks full. I might see what it says with tanks empty before I try the next launch. Maybe put the wing a little further back (it\u0027s not like I don\u0027t have plenty of room to do that) and move the Mk1 Fuselage tanks forward.\n\nI am pretty sure something was borked with my instance of KSP last night - I had some weird behaviors going on later on when I switched over to my career game.
