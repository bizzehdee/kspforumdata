I tried to run before I could walk and set up a Mun base, but unfortunately screwed up landing on the new Mun\u0027s more hilly terrain, and eventually gave up and sent a rescue mission to pick up my three kerbonauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is, on the way home I discovered something nasty about FAR: drag isn\u0027t as powerful as it usually is. I used to have just deadly re-entry, and coming in at 30km periapsis would be enough to land me safely without even burning through half the heatshield on the Mk1-2. With FAR in the mix though, presumably because air resistance falls off after getting past Mach 1 (I think that\u0027s the physics behind it anyway), 30km sets me up for a high apoapsis. Luckily I forsaw that there might be a problem like this and quicksaved, so through heavy trial and error I worked it out that my best shot at re-entry from a Munshot was 23km periapsis. Anything below that, I\u0027d either lose my heat shield and burn up (way off) or not have enough time to bleed off speed for my parachute to avoid snapping at full deployment (above the ocean mind you). Above that and I\u0027d miss completely and have to come around for another pass, which I guess the pod could survive, but I didn\u0027t want to take that chance or the extra few hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway at 23km I found that the temperature of the burn started decreasing again just as the heatshield ran out, so while it heated up to 1400 degrees or so it still avoided exploding, and also that I would pass my own periapsis, causing the pod to start climbing for a few seconds before again falling, reducing vertical velocity and maximizing the amount of time I had to bleed off my fall, so that by the time I hit 500 m I was travelling at \u0022only\u0022 120-130 m/s, which was still nerve wracking because I only had one chute to take all that force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting to the question now: how do you go about figuring out where to drop your periapsis to using FAR? I don\u0027t know if Deadly Re-entry makes a difference, but I don\u0027t think it does. Should I just aim for 23km no matter what? I feel like from where I\u0027d be going would make a difference but is there a guide or some way to calculate the proper re-entry angle?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Swifty","CreatedById":57822,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T23:23:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s down to guess work with FAR as mechjeb landing guidance uses stock drag to calculate the drag. Also if your in a spaceplane lift from the wings are also a problem so my need to manage some nose down aoe to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR is much much more complex than stock and calculating drag on re-entry by hand is not possible as drag on each component changes with angle of the oncoming airflow. Thus to calculate re-entry height a solver would need to be written to number crunch (albeit in a clever manner) the different possibilities to find the desired solution...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T23:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt totally depends on how fast you\u0027re coming in.

Then again, under similar deployment conditions on a test run from LKO the chute managed to stay attached when I strutted it up, but I still believe aiming for a 3km periapsis is suicide with FAR in the mix.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mizo","CreatedById":75837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T00:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, with FAR, you can control how much lift you get from the capsule by controlling your angle of attack, so you can actually resist to some degree both being sent into the lower atmosphere too soon and being bounced out altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also steer the capsule to control it\u0027s heading somewhat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck this video I made some days ago.

I pod and chute. A probe body was along for the ride in order to provide control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreviously I did have problems with FAR not slowing the craft for suitable recovery. With more recent versions (955 is what I\u0027m testing right now to see if it\u0027s changed) I discovered I had a wide-ish window for reentry up to Munar energies. I attempted minimum orbit (60-70k) and Munar schemes and all had acceptable windows. I found that during Munar reentry my acceptable periapsis was 0-34km bounded by G tolerance and aerobraking limits respectively. The most shield I ever used was about 60% (I recall 108/250 left) and was never a limiting factor on these profiles. Perhaps double brake profiles or higher energies would reach the shield material quantity limits. Firstly I noticed a large difference in drag depending on orientation. Second I noticed a small ~5 degree cone of stability around the blunt attitude and another larger one around the pointy attitude. A zone of repulsion exceeded reaction wheel strength at significant Q loadings. The consequences of being on the wrong side of the fence too late into the reentry are obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 30km I had a no-bounce profile with no more than 4.5Gs. Approaching 34km I had a significant balloon in altitude to 66km which used more shield material and lessened G loading. Toying with this limit with minimal onboard battery life was beneficial but risky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift (which I think FAR 9551 addresses) offered surprisingly significant control. Not much experimentation was done regarding trajectory control by lift but L/Ds of no less than 8 were recorded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
