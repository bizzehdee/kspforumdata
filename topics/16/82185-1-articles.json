I had to test a BACC solid rocket with splashdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI learned that i need to have the criteria (be on kerbal, and splashdown) FIRST before I can activate my booster... WTF!?!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried SO many times. Decoupling ANYTHING and trying to get it to splash so that I can fire the booster, but for some reason, whatever I decoupled always ended up in the water after my remaining ship reached the water. Causing crashes etc for the rocket that I would like to light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I \u0027cheated\u0027 and just let my current ship (with BACC) touch the water, trigger the splash and IMMEDIATELY (milliseconds) after activate the BACC. I\u0027m sure that\u0027s not what the mission intended but then on the other hand, I\u0027m not sure what the mission actually tries to get you to do. Basically it felt more like a puzzle rather than a obvious envelope extension mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing something? In general I think I\u0027m missing how the missions in career mode are working. Why not just accept them all and hope you achieve some of them on the way up!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny specific ones don\u0027t seem to pay enough for all my failed attempts. It basically forces me to revert all the time. I was \u0027happy\u0027 getting a bit of green blood over everything before.

The conditions of the test are that you must only stage that part type under the correct conditions (ie green ticks next to all conditions on the contracts tab in toolbar), so to do that you need to have a special stage on your rocket that contains the test part and not fire any of that part type until you are ready to test it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for your splash down test I recommend building a wide ship (less likely to topple) with plenty of parachutes and either different type of booster or liquid fueled rocket to take off with. Then like Strainbom says just take off and parachute into the sea, splashdown then activate the test part and recover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI gather the devs decided to make the contracts a challenge by forcing you to design a ship that allows you carry out the test, its not meant to replicate real world rocket testing, so you\u0027re right its more like a procedurally generated puzzle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Simes","CreatedById":117456,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T09:07:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget that you can also set the amount of fuel in the BACC when building the ship in the VAB.

Can\u0027t wait to have AIRCRAFT parts and I\u0027ll just fly to to right altitude and do drop and burn tests then. I always thought of this for a creative way of doing this. e.g. giving my self an additional objective to build a droptest plane but reuse it for a bunch of tests. creative engineering cheating \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ONE thing I couldnt\u0027 figure out was to DRIVE the rocket to the ocean :-) very funny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont have wheels yet but wouldn\u0027t have thought about that. The other option was to eject a piece of girding with a chute but the problem is I can\u0027t fly low enough to get it (With the chute) to land BEFORE I crash with my rocket. (BTW, can you defer deployment of a chute on a stage that\u0027s already jettisoned?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a puzzle point of view I\u0027m ok that we have puzzles to solve sometimes rather than just logical tests, but still... SPLAHSDOWN \u002B Light, must be a single scenario that some developer built in. What else can happen with splashdown... Maybe fly to the moon and splash down? Is it a coincidence that the simulator came up with splashdown \u002B \u0027relit\u0027 or is there ANYWHERE EVER where someone would willingly do it? Or do we have an evil developer? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, how about all the reverts? If you remove my reverts (Which is basically time-travelling) if you look at my performance, I ALWAYS succeed in a mission. I would have preferred if I suffer some penalty for crashing rather than reverting all the time. Currently the penalty is just too much. I run out of money after trying anything 5 times.

As well as avoiding complicating your flight with a sudden increase in thrust, it\u0027s also worth remembering that 90% of the mass of a solid booster is the fuel.
