Try rotating some of your lifting surfaces in 5 deg increments (hold Shift while tapping w/a/s/d/q/e) to bring it as close to straight up as possible - this will give you a more stable craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BubbaWilkins","CreatedById":57993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T15:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your main wings, tailwings, canards, etc are not proportionally sized, then you can have an imbalance result. If any of your lifting surfaces are angled, this too can produce the same effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shufflermuffler","CreatedById":50724,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T06:58:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo this happens no matter what, ive taken all of the wings off until i have only 1 on each side, and its always tilted forward\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mirai The Kerbonaut","CreatedById":73853,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T11:22:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etry using either shift \u002B w/a/s/d keys if still nothing try putting your wings back of the plane well if it does not work at all you must have Jeb flying your plane. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T12:48:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas it actually affected your flight?
