I like to know the design and what I can expect from it before I launch (no Mechjeb for me!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is that now I\u0027m at the stage whereby I need to use asparagus staging to put a kerbonaut on the Mun I\u0027m unsure of how to calculate dV for the actual asparagus staging pairs. I\u0027ve read before that they are calculated the same way as standard \u0027stacked\u0027 stages but this doesn\u0027t seem true as in testing in sandbox the asparagus design out-performs what I calculate... Now I\u0027m aware that it\u0027s probably my calcs that are off so could someone ever so kindly explain how to calculate the dV for asparagus staging?

How many stages you treat it as depends on the number of boosters you want to include - if you use a six booster design, it\u0027s four stages to orbit; eight boosters, it\u0027s five stages to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemstar talks about how to build a good asparagus design \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/28248-Is-asparagus-the-best-staging-system-%28might-contain-science%29?p=346702\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post346702\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E; its the basis he uses for his Zenith booster series. Follow his guidelines to get a good engine mix for your payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you then can do is set up each stage equation so you account for the total mass of the previous stage (including fuel). Your target aggregate delta-V for any booster design is 4550 m/s, so you divvy up how much delta-V you want with each stage. For a four stage booster, I usually go with 10% for the first stage, 20% for the second, 30% for the third and 40% for the fourth. For five stages, it\u0027s 6.7% for the first, 13.3% for the second, 20% for the third, 26.7% for the fourth, and 33.3% for the fifth). You have your payload, you add the mass of the decouplers and the engine for the stage, and calculate how much fuel you need to achieve your target delta-V by running Tsiokolvsky backwards (keeping in mind the wet-to-dry mass ratio of almost all fuel tanks in the game is 9:1, i.e. M = 9Md). Do this for each stage. Then for an asparagus design, add up all the fuel you need for all the stages, average for the total number of stacks you\u0027re employing (7 for a six booster stack, 9 for an eight booster stack), and then select a set of tanks that get you as close to the indicated amount of fuel as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Odo","CreatedById":69000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T18:38:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou dont have to use asparagus staging, I personally dont like to \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ve landed on Duna, Eve, Mun, Minmus, and Ike all without asparagus staging, try pancake staging.
