However, I have the Kethane mod and am trying to start a mining base on Minmus. My first attempt at creating a Kethane miner resulted in various types of explosions, mostly due to me not being good at moving my lander once it\u0027s already landed. So I\u0027ve decided to switch to a rover that mines the Kethane, then I will send a lander to land in the rough vicinity, drive the rover up, dock to it, and transfer fuel to the lander. In the future I will set up a refueling station around Minmus. The problem is not docking, I can do that so long as I raise the landing gear on my lander: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QHHAh5L.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QHHAh5L.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just can\u0027t think of a way to get my rover to Minmus, I\u0027ve tried various rocket designs, including this thing (my rover was attached instead of the tank):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KcgEaHT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KcgEaHT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis launcher works up until about 10km, where it folds up like a lawnchair, each rocket crashing into its opposite.

I\u0027ve been trying to get it up for about 3 days to no avail.

Stick the other two BZ-52s either side of the girder and attach your FL-T100s and then the LV-Ns to them; the Adapter is what will connect the rest of the ship to the booster (along with a copious amount of strutting; struts are going to be your friend with this design).

(Don\u0027t worry too much about the math on that page; you won\u0027t really need it for a simple Kerbin - Minmus transfer.) Get your craft into a low orbit -- like 70 - 80 km low. Then plot your maneuver node for your trans-Minmus injection burn from that orbit. Target Minmus so that you can see closest-approach markers, and adjust your course using those as a reference until you get an intercept. You can drag the node around the orbit and tweak the values a little until you get it as close to ideal as your patience will allow. (Don\u0027t forget that Minmus itself is slightly inclined.) Once you\u0027re in Minmus\u0027s Sphere of Influence, wait for periapsis again, then plot a capture burn that\u0027ll put you in an orbit with a new periapsis close to the surface.

However, right as I passed my Kerbin apoapsis, my trajectory said that I was going to figure 8 around the Mun and Kerbin, and was heading for a Kerbin escape trajectory.
