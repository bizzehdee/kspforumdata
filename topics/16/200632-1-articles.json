If it keeps going pointy-end up but in the wrong direction it might be fixable by adding a few degrees of angle (so it points at e.g. 87 degrees up and slightly to the east on the launchpad) then just holding prograde for most/all of the launch. If it flips backwards then either your aerodynamics are off (too much drag at the front e.g. a massive fairing, and/or not enough at the back e.g. fins) or your weight distribution is off (too heavy at the back and/or too light at the front) which could be solved by changing the order that your fuel tanks get used so they drain from the bottom up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout seeing the rocket in question that\u2019s about as specific as I can get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-25T20:55:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo expand on the excellent answers so far,\u00A0I usually find 2 problems when this happens:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) too much drag at top (use a fairing, even something oversized/resembling taj mahal is better than nothing at all for things not shaped like end of rocket). Fins at the other end will also help here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) because of extra mass involved in lifting station parts, there is a tendency to stick a load of fuel in the first stage (ie lowest point) to boost deltav which is bad,\u00A0as a\u00A0rocket doesn\u0027t actually act like a pendulum as you might think. One trick I\u0027ve found is rather than having one huge first stage tank is to have a second smaller\u00A0one (nearest the end) but have it empty/part empty.\u00A0This shifts the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E upwards.\u00A0Also make sure you\u0027ve got plenty of reaction wheels, fins and gimbling rockets so if it does start to go you\u0027ve got more chance of recovering it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally if all the above fails, do the exact opposite and load it up with more fuel and launch straight (ie no gravity turn) until you are up to at least the thinnest part of the atmosphere. It\u0027ll use a ton more fuel to circularise but it shouldn\u0027t flip on way up (ah the memories of trying to get\u00A0the largest Alcubierre Drive into orbit coming back now...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul_c","CreatedById":208135,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-25T21:12:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve said it before (in other threads) but its worth mentioning again:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIn an ideal gravity turn, there are no* sideways forces at all!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Except for the initialisation of the turning (if it were designed to point directly upwards, as rockets are by default when built in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E), the gravity turn is like dropping a broom balancing on your fingertips, very gradually, from vertical to horizontal.

KSP doesn\u0027t help with its keyboard controls which bang in control inputs at either 0% or 100%, and some engines are very jerky with their gimbal (Thud) so its something you need to work around. But its possible that a beautifully designed rocket can be misflown and go bonkers; or a complete dog is launched in an apparently perfect ascent by an expert (or a good\u00A0autopilot).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-25T23:31:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223932238\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200632\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221614286553\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210116\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FruitGoose\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, FruitGoose said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne trick I\u0027ve found is rather than having one huge first stage tank is to have a second smaller\u00A0one (nearest the end) but have it empty/part empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMind you, may be tricky trick to pull off due heavy engines at the very bottom of the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223932251\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200632\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221614287554\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208135\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022paul_c\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, paul_c said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EIn theory\u003C/em\u003E you could turn off \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and let it do its own thing.
