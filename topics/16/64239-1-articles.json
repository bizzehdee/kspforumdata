This configuration will result in more parts and more mass, but will give you comparable thrust and have a higher Isp; change it up to eight LV-T30s and you\u0027ll have greater thrust than a Mainsail (1920 kN). Set the girders parallel to the sides of a large tank (X200-8, X200-16 or X200-32 depending on what you\u0027ve got available), stick the LV-T30s on the bottom and the LV-T45 centerline. The Girders allow fuel flow. Slap two X200-8s on top of one another, put another six radially around them, run fuel lines to the center from the outboard tanks and put the faux Mainsail engine configuration on them, and you\u0027ve got the equivalent of an orange tank/Mainsail. All you need for that to work is Fuel Systems, picking up General Construction and General Rocketry along the way (no more than 160 Science points total from the start of your career game).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-25T17:05:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2014 05:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T17:07:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow, as far as a 50k orbit of Minmus to landing is concerned, you need only to calculate the orbital velocity at that height - dependent on this formula:\u003Cp\u003EV = sqrt(mu/R), where V is the orbital velocity, sqrt is \u0022square root\u0022, mu is the Gravitational Parameter - the Gravitational Constant (6.67 *10^-11) times the body\u0027s mass (information already calculated for you on the wiki), and R is the radius \u003Cem\u003Efrom the center of the body\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we go to the wiki: Minmus\u0027s mu is 1.7658*10\u003Csup\u003E9\u003C/sup\u003E m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E and its radius is 60,000 m.
