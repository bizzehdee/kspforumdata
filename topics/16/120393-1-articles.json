The target has a periapsis near Kerbin and an apoapsis a bit past Duna... and an inclination of 150 degrees. Given that I\u0027m using the 6.4k mod (which scales up the Kerbin system by 6.4x), if I tried to launch straight from Kerbin, I\u0027d be looking at probably ~80 km/s of delta-V, which basically makes it flat-out impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, my thinking is to wait until I have nukes and ions, and then set up a Jool intercept and make a burn at Jool periapsis (combined with the slingshot) to make the inclination change. Are there any other tricks you guys can think of? The other possibility I can think of is a Jool-assisted bielliptic transfer, but that\u0027d take a hilariously long time (even without that, I\u0027ll probably need to edit the save game to give myself enough time on the contract).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe alternative, of course, is to bite the failure penalty (or cheat and use Hyperedit), but it\u0027s such an interesting challenge that I want to try it anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: To be perfectly clear, 80 km/s is \u0022I perform almost the entire maneuver straight from Kerbin orbit\u0022; I suspect it\u0027ll be a fair bit more reasonable by abusing Jool... at least for certain definitions of \u0022reasonable\u0022 which probably do not include making a profit on this mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-08T03:05:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2015 03:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T01:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStarman,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If it were me, I\u0027d definitely take the loss on the failed contract.
