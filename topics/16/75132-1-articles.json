I\u0027m also presuming you\u0027re using either RAPIER-type engines or a jet engine/rocket engine combo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, for the jet stage, don\u0027t worry too much about how much fuel/deltaV you pack into it. Even with non-overpowered jet engines, the fuel you\u0027ll be consuming compared to your rocket stage is miniscule. What really matters with your jet stage is TWR. A high TWR (but not too high, as FAR will tear your plane apart) will get you up to orbital velocity (OV) much faster and generally more efficiently, and it will save you some fuel for getting into orbit, as you\u0027ll be going faster and higher when the time comes to switch to rockets. Generally you should carry enough to get you up to your rocket stage, and then ensure you\u0027ll have enough reserve in case you need to use powered flight when you come back down for landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the rocket stage, fuel is extremely important. You need to ensure that by the time you switch to rockets, you have the dV to not only get up to your final desired orbit, but to circularize and then carry out whatever your mission is. You\u0027ll also need to consider deorbit. In my planes, a deltaV of ~2700 in my rocket stage (TWR, 1.2-1.4) usually leaves me with anywhere from 900-1200 dV leftover to do whatever I want once in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you want to look at with FAR installed is drag. You want your plane to be as streamlined as you can make it. Unlike normal spacecraft, its not that good of an idea to have too many bits and bobs stuck on the sides of your plane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as far as your ascent goes, the rule of thumb is after take off is to get up to ~ 10km altitude. Then, level off at a very low ascent angle (5-10 degrees above the horizon) and just gun it towards your desired inclination. At approximately 20km up, you should be going hypersonic and your engines should start losing thrust. This is when you want to switch to rockets. You can experiment here where exactly to switch to rockets, but if you let one of your jet engines flame out (and they\u0027re not set up to compensate for it) you\u0027ll have a bad time. Once you switch to rockets, you need to pull up to ~45 degrees and wait until your apoapsis hits your desired orbit, where you cut your engines and coast, just like a normal rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I mentioned, if you let one of your jet engines flame out (it isn\u0027t an issue if you only have one jet engine), you could run into problems if they\u0027re not set up to compensate. This is because one engine will flameout and throw off your center of thrust causing you to spin out. How to compensate for this is to have an odd number of engines and place them from the farthest points moving inwards to the center, with your last engine right in the center where you need your COT to be. Then, when your engines flameout, they\u0027ll flame out from the outside in, maintaining your COT. So, say you want three jet engines. You\u0027d place two of them in 2x symmetry, and then place the third engine right in between them where your COT needs to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T18:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022G\u0022 data-cite=\u0022G\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m presuming you\u0027re using FAR\u0027 date=\u0027 because otherwise planes are dumb.

Not only do these take their oxygen from the atmosphere, via air-intakes, so you don\u0027t need to carry so much \u0027oxidiser\u0027 but they are also very, very efficient on liquid-fuel, so you don\u0027t need so much of that either. To take maximum advantage of that you want to get as fast - horizontally - as possible with the jets before switching to rockets. You can go faster if you go higher because the air is thinner (less drag) but, and this is the balancing act you have to manage for flying spaceplanes, the higher you go the faster you \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to go to get enough of that thin air to feed the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such you should climb quickly from takeoff to get above the thick, draggy, lower atmosphere then start to level-out above 10km and especially 15km. Aim to be going above 1km/s horizontally around 20km and then do the majority of your speed-building around 25km while hardly climbing at all (depending on your design). Without massive amounts of intakes per engine you\u0027ll probably need to reduce throttle somewhere between 25 - 30km; this reduces the amount of air the jet needs and keeps it burning and thrusing when it would otherwise \u0027flameout\u0027 at full throttle. Keep climbing slowly (10-20m/s) and reducing throttle as necessary as long as your horizontal speed is still building. Once you have to throttle-back so much that you\u0027re not accelerating any more it\u0027s time to light the rockets, turn off the jet and close the intakes (to reduce drag, although there won\u0027t be much that high anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tutrakan4e","CreatedById":100818,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T19:21:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENever forget solar panels \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T20:40:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tutrakan4e\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tutrakan4e\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENever forget solar panels \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaha, so very true and easy to forget on a plane. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T21:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs a FAR user and one who doesn\u0027t understand how you can not use FAR.
