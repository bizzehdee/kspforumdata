After all it\u0027s ~20k cost versus 4-contract income... Until I found it became so mechanical and not fun to me\u00A0to play like that. But if you really need 90 kerbals, this might help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, the most common rescue missions occur on minmus and the mun as well as kerbin. I\u0027m actually in the process of upgrading the ships in my system to increase their range.\u00A0 I think I can do this with a much smaller set of engineers if I get lucky with their attributes. 12 for the EP mod workshop, 3 for the ground version and then last 5 dumbest engineers get stuck on refining/KIS/KAS retrofitting duty.\u00A0 I may cheat a bit, and remove the engineer requirement from KIS/KAS, so that cuts it down to only 20 engineers, aka 60 rescue missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
