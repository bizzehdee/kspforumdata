Just because you can put parts together in a certain way in the editor doesn\u0027t mean the design is viable once gravity kicks in\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour vessel twists and bends because attachments are not entirely rigid. There is no gravity in the editor, but\u00A0on the launchpad, there is a full 9.80665 m/s\u00B2 pulling on each individual part. And if a part\u00A0is heavy, but attached from the side, then it will sag a bit as that attachment point flexes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe strength of joints is proportional to the part\u0027s size. Their \u0022bulkheadProfile\u0022 in the config file specifically, if I remember things right (but don\u0027t quote me on this, it\u0027s been quite a while since I last looked into it). Small parts with small profiles have very weak joints. You happen to have used very small parts on a very long lever arm to attach wheels to a heavy rover. The result is that the mass of the rover easily bends the weak joints of the small parts used to attach the wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, depending on the destination of your rover, it may still be fine. Minmus for example has incredibly low gravity - just 5% that of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo test this, hit Alt\u002BF12, go to the Cheats section, and find the \u0022hack gravity\u0022 slider. Activate the checkbox and set the slider to 5%. You are now simulating Minmus\u0027 gravity. Look at your rover on the launchpad, and see if it still bends out of shape. If not, you\u0027ll probably be fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say \u0022probably\u0022 because gravity isn\u0027t the only enemy of flimsy construction. Inertia is, too. If you drive at a high speed on a flat surface that suddenly begins to slope upwards steeply, then your rover\u0027s front wheels are pushed upwards \u003Cem\u003Ehard\u003C/em\u003E. The inertia of your rover\u0027s center section, however, will resist that upwards motion for a split second, because the wheel joints will flex first. This can result in your center section impacting the slope your are trying to drive on, damaging or destroying your rover. So, better test driving around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, too, and hitting some of those slopes at the side of the runway, or the ramp up to the launchpad, at full speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-26T12:37:57Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2019 12:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jaunco325","CreatedById":198491,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-26T13:38:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo not be offended but did anyone really see the images I passed? gravity does not make sense, as far as I know gravity pulls down, but the image shows that the piece in question is twisted up.
