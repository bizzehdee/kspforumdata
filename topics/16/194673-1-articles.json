There are ways to mitigate this, but nothing that completely eliminates this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for you problem autostruts are a good idea, but autostruts stop at non-locked robotic parts. (Well, in some cases they cause the robotic part to freeze up, but that isn\u0027t better.) So what you can do is set the hinge (or servo?) to locked once the wing has moved into place. One problem is that just saying \u0022please set the lock\u0022 doesn\u0027t always work, you usually have to give that command a few time to make sure that all parts are locked. So use \u0022set lock\u0022 on an action group (and \u0022unset lock\u0022 on another) and hit the corresponding button often enough.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[Edit:] I forgot the other problem that I wanted to mention: when the lock is set while the wings are bent, then this bend is \u0022frozen in\u0022. So for my planes Itry to set the locks when there isn\u0027t a strong force on the wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother issue is that activating autostrut on the robotic part itself often causes that part to freeze up. So I don\u0027t do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-12T14:06:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2020 02:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by AHHans\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
