The game also treats this root part as a \u0022control from here point\u0022 for initial craft orientation. Also the root is the part where you can click that part and drag the entire ship around in VAB. If a part is not a root part you wont be able to move entire ship, but be able to pick off 1 part at a time. ALso root can be helpful for sub-assemblies, but rather your new in the game and we will let that story unfold at a later time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thorazine","CreatedById":134805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T16:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etater, Yellow Dart, Vladthemad, and lextacy: Thank you for your clearly written and detailed answers.
