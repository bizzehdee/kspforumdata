The only thing is these contracts are driving me insane. I complete all the per-requisites and they still don\u0027t fire. It\u0027s starting to get really annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done some reading on the forums. I know about the blue tick, and about having to stage the test part when the conditions are met.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know about usuing the test part option from the radial menu, if that\u0027s what the contract specifies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also know about some other intricate details after having another problem and trawling the forums for a while, such as having to use the test part as the FIRST use of it when conditions are met.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was because I was having a problem with testing boosters. I would use one booster to get to the right altitude for the test, decouple it and then activate the second one for the contract which doesn\u0027t work for some reason. I managed to get around that one eventually by building an elaborate rocket, which I think is unnecessary in this situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I digress, the problem I\u0027m having now is with testing the TT-70 Radial De-couplers. I have two contracts, one for testing while landed, the other while splashed down. I\u0027ve tried both and they don\u0027t work. At first I thought it was because the part was experimental. I used some science to unlock the part and tried again. Still nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat on earth am I doing wrong? This problem does not seem logical and I\u0027m getting very frustrated trying to figure it out. Any help would be greatly appreciated so that I can begin to enjoy career mode and stop hating it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T06:34:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need screenshots to see what\u0027s wrong.
