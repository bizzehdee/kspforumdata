My reentry speed is so ludicrously high that I can\u0027t manage to have either of my pods survive. After exhausting all my fuel I\u0027m still hitting the atmosphere at around 4900km/s and my heatshields (2,5m with full ablator) only survive for a couple seconds. I tried not decoupling and using my interplanetary tug as an improvised extra heat shield. It helps a little but as it burns up it starts to pitch and then my pods explode immediately since their heat shields can\u0027t do their jobs. I\u0027ve fiddled around a little and with a periapsis of 41km and staging at the correct time I can make 1 pod survive but it won\u0027t slow down enough to be captured so it\u0027s hurled back into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know if there is some technique I can use to make this infernal reentry?
