Build an asparagus out of 1.25 m parts and you will be surprised how good it is. What brings you to orbit in 2.5 m will bring you to orbit in 1.25 m, with just smaller parts. Staging, fuel pumping, all principles are the same, you just use 1-seat capsule instead of 3-seat. these things are smaller and contain less fuel, but are also lighter and have smaller fuel consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T14:29:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI designed a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53747-career-rocket-woes?p=713376\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post713376\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eship capable of Munar flyby\u003C/a\u003E for someone a few days ago at about the same level of the tech tree as you\u0027re at.

Can you get into orbit with, say, 3 FLT-800\u0027s? Why not exchange one of them for an FLT-400 and see if that works? Asparagus with 3 boosters instead of four, etc. We tend to slap on things but it\u0027s amazing how large the weight penalty is, and that also works in reverse. In sandbox mode I got an ion-engine probe to Duna (or any planet, really) launched on a single FLT-200 tank and a Mk1 Jet fuselage (and engines of course). Once you start cutting weight you\u0027ll be amazed on how much you can cut out and still get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Basilo1146","CreatedById":69489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T22:53:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGetting into orbit is fine actually.
