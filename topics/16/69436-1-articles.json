All in all the mouse and selection interface in KSP has been absolutely pathetic since it\u0027s inception. It\u0027s on of the few complete failures in the game. The game ALWAYS keeps everything in focus regardless of if it\u0027s behind a window(interface window not physical wijdow) \u00A0or you are in IVA, this makes for frustration because you have to make sure that button you want to push is not over something else on your ship or in map mode. Same with IVA and using RPM, you have to cautiously click the display MFD buttons slowly so the game doesn\u0027t register a double click and try do something funny.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-02T20:06:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2016 08:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by jedensuscg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LastStarDust","CreatedById":128569,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-12T17:21:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this is quite old but I have the very same problem as the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
