Of course aerobreaking in the atmosphere would save you a lot of fuel, but even with that trajectory you should be fine. Set a node at the PE to slow down and get an orbit, any orbit really, then once you\u0027re in a stable orbit you can burn at your AP to lower your PE, then at your PE to lower your AP, rinse repeat until you\u0027re in your desired orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jebster","CreatedById":77889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T23:42:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re going slow enough that you can get into an orbit if you burn at your periapsis, but if you want to conserve fuel, you could try aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bradvh97","CreatedById":78034,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T00:02:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to aerobrake but it\u0027s taking too much fuel, it takes about 1000m/s of delta-v to get into the atmosphere to aerobrake.

That way you could at least try to parachute down and save the poor things. I seem to recall repacked parachutes don\u0027t work by staging (spacebar) though, you\u0027ll have to right click them - deploy chute, alternatively try action groups (not sure the latter works, will test later).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T02:18:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProblem with a lander on Duna is it\u0027s size and gravity. Duna is not small and it\u0027s gravity is a force to be reckoned with. It isn\u0027t as strong as Kerbin gravity and it\u0027s atmosphere is thinner, so you need less thrust, but you do need a decent bit of fuel. Think about how much fuel it would take to build an SSTO lander for Kerbin. Then take about 25-30% of that (guys, double check me on that). People, what is the dV requirement for getting into orbit around Duna from the surface?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
