A 45 km periapsis will result in hundreds of m/s of braking, but if you\u0027re coming from mun it will take you a few passages before you are captured. A 40 km periapsis is generally enough for interplanetary capture. And even the time I came in at 10 km/s from a high energy trajectory, a 30 km/s was enough to stop my pod.

I never really end up with this problem because I never aerobrake. Except at Kerbin, which obviously slowing down enough is likely the intention since you\u0027re returning from a long journey to the outer planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-12-18T23:52:48Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2022 11:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Richmountain112\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
