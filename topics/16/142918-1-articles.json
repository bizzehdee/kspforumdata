I\u2019m using LT-2 Landing Struts to land on Eve, below its tolerance limit of 12 m/s, but they always crash. Maybe I don\u2019t understand how this works, and impact tolerance is not the same as\u00A0stress tolerance, but when the vessel \u201Clands\u201D it\u2019s going at 9.4 m/s, which I thought was safe. Here are two pics of before landing and after \u201Clanding\u201D (all struts explode and then the vessel flips and everything is over:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/6SnKY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/6SnKY\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(pics are from different landings, but both were going at the same speed and ended exploding)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you very much!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-01T18:08:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2016 06:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by montferrer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lunar Sea","CreatedById":164137,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-01T19:52:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes the game calculate the weight on the struts?
