I agree with you that it is at the extreme end of the tech scale, even for its era, but starting a KSP career puts us in a similar situation.

I disagree that it is a suitable method of balancing, or the current setup is correctly balanced, though I believe the current system is very much a placeholder. The problem with the current setup is that, compared with electric charge and transmission, fuel and engines \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E balanced to a believable level with respect to the Kerbal universe\u0027s scale. For example, one of the most famously overpowered-for-gameplay-reasons parts is the PB-ION, with an Isp of 4200 s (~42,000 s real scale equivalent). The NEXT ion thruster on which it seems to be based has an Isp of 4190 s, a factor of ten less. For our transmission model, taking the simplest possible antenna and the simplest possible data source (temperature readings are small groups of digits) at the shortest orbital range, we get 2.5 transmissions from a Z100 battery. That is 2,400,000 less efficient than its real-life counterpart. That is well beyond credible and far into difficulty for difficulty\u0027s sake. If we include the barometer readings also, that brings us to 6,000,000. Throw in the rescale factor and you\u0027re at sixty million. People are currently unhappy about Kerbin being too dense to exist. If fuel was 60,000,000 times as dense as in reality, you can bet that people would be complaining too. As far as an actual balance mechanic goes, it is a poor one. For early missions, it encourages running a rocket engine to transmit data. This is just poor gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that initial short range, low data, low science-value phase, things should become more complex. It would be perfectly reasonable to have the science lab produce hundreds or even hundreds of thousands more units of data than a thermometer, using whatever kind of inefficient protocol. There is a lot of scope there for balance tweaking, as well as gameplay progression through \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_code\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eresearchable upgrades\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also scope for tweaking the power requirement for a given transmission range, as in your Voyager example. This has the nice effect of having the effort required increase the further you explore, i.e. a difficulty curve. This fits in well with the current layout of the Mun and Minmus as tutorial bodies. Upgradeable ground stations provide even more opportunities for progression through reducing the transmit power required to be heard at range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, I\u0027m expecting the current system to change quite a bit in future releases. Given that there are three transmission parts, with only one given stats that incentivise use, I\u0027m guessing that the 0.22 implementation was the system they had time to create that maintained some level of gameplay. The directional antennae hint at a range requirement, which would go some way towards giving expected behaviour for both Sputnik- and Voyager-style craft. At this point, given that 0.23 is in the final stages of development, I\u0027m happy to wait and see what work has been done. The above points may already be moot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
