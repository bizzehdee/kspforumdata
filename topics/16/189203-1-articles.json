Stuck at \u201CTo The Mun, Part 2\u201D. In particular, at the decent to landing orbit. The instructions tell me to gradually reduce my altitude to 1.5km above the surface, however, when I try, I always crash at what seems to be ~2.5km. Research so far leads me to believe that high Munar mountains have been added after the instructions were written. Since the Altimeter only shows height above \u2018sea level\u2019, I can\u2019t judge where the mountains are, how tall they are, or how to avoid them. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-23T04:24:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199145-whichwayjanus/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022199145\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199145-whichwayjanus/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@WhichwayJanus\u003C/a\u003E and welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, any instruction which tells you to set your periapsis to 1.5 km makes no sense on the current Mun.\u00A0 Many versions ago, the terrain was very much flatter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, if you set the periapsis to something in the range of 5-8 km (depending where on the Mun you are) you should be good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use map mode to look at exactly where my periapsis is and decide exactly where to start my braking burn based on that.\u00A0 I usually want to try and land on the most boring patch of the local area possible.\u00A0 I certainly look for the flattest terrain I can find under my orbital trajectory and try to time my burn to kill my horizontal velocity over that.\u00A0 If I have a bit of altitude left to descend, I usually don\u0027t sweat it.\u00A0 One doesn\u0027t build up too much speed in a kilometer or three.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, there are tonnes of good tutorials in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/50-tutorials/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ETutorials subforum\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 If you take a look, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll find some other helpful hints in there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul23","CreatedById":120544,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-23T04:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell one solution is to get the pc version and get kerbal engineering redux or mechjeb (or some light version of said mods).

When landing you can then see the shadow of the lander: and the distance between you and the shadow is proportional to the distance to the ground (you\u0027ll touch your shadow when you are landed). It\u0027s a good rough estimate.
