The light green part shows the fraction of the total amount that this run of the experiment will get you, if you recover it instead of transmitting. The dark part of the bar is what\u0027s left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf the 3 antennae, the starting whip antenna and the big umbrella one both use the least power, but the umbrella is much faster. The middle antenna, the folding radar dish thing, is faster than the whip, slower than the umbrella, and uses more power than both.
