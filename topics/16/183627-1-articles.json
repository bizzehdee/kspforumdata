The catch is that you don\u0027t know what planets you will be going to. It could be any of the planet packs in KSP. You could have mega Eve, mega Tylo, boiling ocean moon, mini Gilly, etc. You don\u0027t know. You also have KSP Interstellar Extended and a few other futuristic but balanced mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to have all of your bases covered, which Landers should you bring?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, I have an an all atmospheric world \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, tested on Jool, a fusion powered Tylo plus non atmospheric lander, a Mun ish sized nuclear lander that can handle light atmospheres, and a nuclear light moon lander. I am concerned about large world\u0027s with thin atmospheres as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E can\u0027t fire its fusion engine in an atmosphere, and needs an atmosphere to accelerate. I am also concerned about ocean world\u0027s. I don\u0027t know what to build for a landing there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you think of any other niches I missed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-11T22:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think that any rational ocean world is going to have an atmosphere.

I have redesigned my atmo \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. It now has a lot more flexibility - if you are very gentle, you can land in and take off from water, but it was only tested on Kerbin. I have also added braking parachutes, as well as parachutes near the front so you can deploy them and do a vertical propulsively assisted landing. This makes water landings easier, and it also makes landing on worlds with thin atmospheres (tested on Duna) easier. It was tested on Jool again and still works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-12T05:54:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223580874\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183627\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221555009118\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161505\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ultimate Steve\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Ultimate Steve said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na Mun ish sized nuclear lander\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a big lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-12T07:13:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223581029\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183627\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221555021253\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think that any rational ocean world is going to have an atmosphere.
