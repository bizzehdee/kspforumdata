Laythe appears to be the same body in stock, just moved to its own orbit and with a moon added. Either way, my probe with one full small ore tank, an Octo core and some science instruments sank at over 100m/s, which I did not think was possible in water for something with realistic density. Even with the ore tank empty, it sunk at similar speeds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the density of Laythe\u0027s oceans? Are they modeled as water or air? If their density is something like 0.2g/cm^3 than I could understand the dynamics (liquid hydrocarbons?) but if it is supposed to be water then something is off. Maybe the New Horizons mod changes it around?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMax\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T04:57:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany have noticed that Laythe\u0027s \u0022water\u0022 density is less than Kerbin\u0027s.\u00A0 This has to be a property of the \u0022water\u0022 itself because buoyancy is unaffected by differences in local gravity.\u00A0 There are many opinions and suppositions on why this should be\u00A0but most boil down to Kerbin\u0027s oceans, being on a life-bearing planet, are saltier than barren Laythe\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad has stated that the new buoyancy rules in 1.0.5 allow varying oceanic density and apparently they have used this feature.\u00A0 So the fact that things don\u0027t float as well on Laythe is pretty much a given and accepted thing these days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd\u00A0I put \u0022water\u0022 in quotes because, given the insane density of Kerbin and the other features of the Kerbol system, there can be no common elements on the periodic tables of Kerbals and humans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T05:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, Laythe\u0027s ocean is less dense than Kerbin\u0027s, but only slightly, not dramatically so-- all that\u0027ll happen is that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128612-buoyancy-on-laythe/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2336091\u0022\u003Eyour ship sinks a bit lower in the water\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 Certainly it should be impossible to fall through it at 100 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat version of Kopernicus are you running?\u00A0 When 1.0.5 came out, it broke Kopernicus-- it caused a bug where all planets (including Kerbin!) have oceans that act as if they\u0027re not even there.\u00A0 A few days later, the author came out with a new Kopernicus version that fixed the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould it be that you\u0027re running the old Kopernicus?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-03T05:36:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2016 05:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxL_1023","CreatedById":152317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T21:59:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am using 1:beta-06-3 from the CKAN library with KSP 1.05.
