Mechjeb puts a marker in map view but I\u0027d like to see it in normal view. If the Lazor system can do it I haven\u0027t figured it out. Does GPS have a feature like this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I want to fly by coordinates specifies and land as close as possible. Maechjeb and Lazor have auto-pilots but I dont need them to fly and land for me. I just need a location marker in game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T22:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry getting a rover there and decouple a little plate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T23:14:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr put a flag there\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CommandantAce","CreatedById":84500,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T03:14:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETry getting a rover there and decouple a little plate.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr put a flag there\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ework arounds but not really elegant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to do a fly by first then decide if I want to send a rover or a Kerbal.

I know KER includes surface coordinates as part of the data it provides. So you can install it, add a KER flight computer to a small probe lander and use it to get a feel for where you\u0027re at while you\u0027re landing. Stick one on a rover and you can monitor your position as you travel along; the rover becomes the ground marker when it arrives at its destination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
