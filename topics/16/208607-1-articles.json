I knew I was close to the encounter, and the encounter disappeared. I did time warp carelessly, and I found myself having passed my target (vesta). I actually got the encounter - kerbalism science activates authomatically if it is set so, and I did get science from vesta. but I did not get anything else because the time warp was high. It stops authomatically when you change \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, but it had enough delay that i found myself out of time warp but already out of vesta.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, I was in a collision course, but i did not explode because the game didn\u0027t have time to register that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, my point is that when you KNOW you have an encounter because you had performed your burn correctly, perhaps you still have an encounter, and you just need to time warp more carefully. if you don\u0027t time warp to max, maybe the game will finally see you are on an encounter when you enter duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miklkit","CreatedById":201493,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-24T03:06:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have become far more careful than that and always sneak up on the encounter at normal speed.\u00A0\u00A0 I get close to it by warping slowly (warp 4) then stopping and checking because the encounter disappears when warping.\u00A0 Sometimes.\u00A0 Sometime it doesn\u0027t.\u00A0 And sometimes it is just gone and I can\u0027t find one.\u00A0 It is different every trip and is taking all the fun out of it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have heard some opinions that it is Steam that is messing up KSP.\u00A0 Dunno about that, but am thinking about creating a non Steam install and trying it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-24T10:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224148179\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208607\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221656039978\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201493\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022miklkit\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, miklkit said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have heard some opinions that it is Steam that is messing up KSP.\u00A0 Dunno about that, but am thinking about creating a non Steam install and trying it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy install is not in steam, and i have the same problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do believe it\u0027s a mixture of rounding errors and encounters disappearing. when you set the encounter right, it will still be there, and you\u0027ll meet the planet if you time warp carefully. if there is a rounding error, then the encounter truly disappeared, but you can avoid that by starting time warp to 10x manually\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nregading manual confirmation of the encounter using the navisphere...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022W1JwoQw.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/W1JwoQw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlook at the navisphere, the prograde marker is straight over the target. this means you are moving exactly towards the target, so you have an encounter (notice that you have to set the navball on \u0022target\u0022)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222oQ53ZN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/2oQ53ZN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere the prograde marker is not exactly on target, so you\u0027re going to miss (in this case the target is another ship, but the principle is the same).
