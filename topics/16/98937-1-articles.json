Tiny changes can have big impacts down the line, and that will allow you to Finetune your exact arrival as you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you will need a mod that allows for extreme fine control over manouver nodes. Mechjeb has that function, and Precise Node mod is basicly all that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you can do with those, is make a manouver node, center the view on the target planet, and modify the manouver node from there.

You can adjust your encounter by burning in a combination of directions: Radial, Anti-Radial, Prograde, and Retrograde. If you double click on a body (or right click and select \u0022focus\u0022), you will change the conic display mode and it will show your trajectory as it would appear if you were in it\u0027s SOI. This way you can see the results of burning in ^ these directions. Depending on your location relative to your target, each direction will have a different result. Once you get a feel of how it works, it becomes very easy to manipulate your intercepts. If you use KAC, set an alarm for 48 hours before your encounter; you can usually make minor changes easily then. Once you reach your target\u0027s SOI, you can burn North (0 degrees) or south (180 degrees) at the horizon to move your trajectory north or south. The same can be done for moving the trajectory east (90) or west (270). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note: The further you perform a maneuver from the target, the less DV you will need to expend to perform said maneuver. (this is not always so for plane changes, best done at low velocity and at Ascending/Descending nodes). This means it is best to fine tune your trajectory in your initial transfer burn, rather than later. If you use KAC, set an alarm for 48 hours before your encounter; you can usually make minor changes easily then. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your last question, the maneuver nodes aren\u0027t very good with plane changes, but you can combine prograde/retrograde and Normal/Anti-normal burns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T20:40:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36476-WIN-MAC-KSP-Trajectory-Optimization-Tool-v1-2-0-Now-64-bit!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Trajectory Optimization Tool\u003C/a\u003E is the go-to program for calculating these sorts of things for KSP.

When you are still a long way from the planet it is really hard to have fine control because the slightly velocity change has a big effect. I usually just try to get close, primarily focusing more on being in the correct plane than I am about getting the altitude right. Once crossing into the planet\u0027s SOI a final course correction can be made.
