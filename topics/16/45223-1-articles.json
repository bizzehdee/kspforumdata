Problem I am hav\u0027n is I need to swap out liquid rocket I docked with orbing station to fuel up docked space planes with the last fusion rocket close by in orbit to complete this Interplanetary Station.. But in-line and shielded docking ports are now frozen in locked position on the liquid fuel rocket and station.. (Docking Bug?) Since this station has multiple ships docked together, I cannot find this station in quicksave fsf. files, nor persistent fsf. files. Even after (ctrl-f) search.. Nor any of the ships in this station in VAB saved ships. Any help in solving this problem would be greatly appreciated, as I do NOT want to go thru all the time again to re-do this Interplanetary Station. Thanks to all that reply.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aNewHope","CreatedById":76088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T01:21:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst: I would really appreciate it, if you cared a bit more about your layout.
