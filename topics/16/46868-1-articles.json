Plus the rovers I use to transport the kerbals always end up flipping or break even when I try to put everything close to the ground so it won\u0027t flip or break it does meaning its a very long walk/jetpack ride for the kerbals. So what I\u0027m asking is how do you get them to land close to each other without making a mobile base which I currently suck at by the many many dead kerbals on the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T19:30:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb?

My first attempts put me several kilometres away from my target, but slowly I got better until the distance could be measured in metres rather than km. At that point I felt comfortable in sending up the parts for my base, and it all went swimmingly, with no long hikes/drives to get the parts in the same place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T21:02:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could just design a rover that attaches on the bottom of modules to drive them together:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/20g0cv8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220g0cv8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/20aea1k.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220aea1k.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy modular base construction kit uses that technique:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50685-Modular-Base-Creation-Kit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50685-Modular-Base-Creation-Kit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
