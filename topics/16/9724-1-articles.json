At that time I could try a direct descent, and I have done that. But, assuming that I want to enter a Mun orbit, what is the most safe and fuel-efficient manoeuvre I can do? I have tried burning prograde, but if the Periapsis is very close to the Mun\\\u0027s center, it does not work and surely doesnt look efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaraz.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-20T11:09:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Maraz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy preferred method is to only raise my Apoapsis to about 10,400,000 meters, when the Mun catches up to me my trajectory becomes a counter clockwise orbit that can escape Kerbin, but I can easily correct this with a burn it Periapsis, this then allows me to get into an easterly orbit around the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have recently seen Munar approaches where the Apoapsis is 12,400,000, from there you can get into a westerly Munar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you find yourself heading for a Munar collision still though, use the purple markers as a quick guide on where to burn to move your trajectory out of the Mun, they point towards and away from the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cooly568","CreatedById":17763,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-20T12:18:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy strategy is rather odd.

Quicksave, set your throttle to a low setting, go to map mode, turn your craft around and see what it does to the orbital path. But to answer your question, once you find yourself on a collision course with the Mun, imagine drawing a line from your position towards the flight direction vector. Now imagine a line that is at 90 degrees angle on that one - direction really depends on which side you\\\u0027re approaching the Mun from. Experiment in map mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you could avoid having collision courses at all. When doing your TMI burn, make sure that your apoapsis is a bit further than Mun orbit.
