Some of the high ISP engines can be quite heavy. For example, the LV-N engine weighs 2.25 tons. You only benefit from carrying such a heavy engine when you are planning to burn enough fuel in it to make the extra weight worthwhile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd be very careful about using multiple engines.

I did an optimality analysis and it turns out the only other two engines you really need to consider for interplanetary stages are the 48-7S and the LV-N. Every other choice is always inferior to those two, including the LV-909 (which surprised me because I would have guessed it would have been optimal for certain sizes of spacecraft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the rule of thumb for interplanetary engine selection: Above 4 tons total wet mass (excluding the engine), you always want the LV-N. Below 2 tons (excluding engine), you usually want the 48-7S. And in between 2 and 4 tons, it depends on how much fuel you\u0027re carrying, but if you have a lot of fuel (over 75%) you probably want the 48-7S and otherwise you probably want the LV-N.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-01T21:24:02Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2014 09:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Yakky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HorusKol","CreatedById":117326,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T22:27:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022el_coyoto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022el_coyoto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMake everything that is not fuel on the rocket lighter (less RCS, less batteries, unmanned, i.e. building small) : this has a huge impact on delta-v.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdd more fuel : diminishing return on delta-v after each added tank because of the so called \u0022tyranny of the rocket equation\u0022, use with caution.

Empty tanks and engines that aren\u0027t firing at maximum thrust are extra weight, and should be dropped if possible. If your TWR is too high, it basically means that you\u0027re carrying too much engine. This is the biggest reason why asparagus staging is so efficient -- you empty tanks a pair at a time and drop them off as soon as they\u0027re empty.

In .24 career, SRBs are so comparatively cheap and get used quite a bit. One trick trick I do with SRBs is to break 4 of them into 2 pairs, and reduce the thrust setting for one pair to keep the TWR at 1.5 at launch, then when the SRB that\u0027s burning faster empties, I drop it off. Sometimes, I need to adjust the thrust setting for both so that the TWR doesn\u0027t drop too low.
