Luckily that is easy in KSP since the maneuver node basically does that for you. All you have to do is increase the pro grade marker until the post burn orbit just crosses the orbital line of the Mun. Then pull this along your current orbit until you get an intercept. (of course I am assuming a fairly good equatorial orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as landing goes. Try not to start your burn too soon. The most efficient burn is one that brings your craft to a stop just in time to land. Of course most of us are not that good at getting it perfect. What I do is try to bring my craft a 0 horizontal speed about 3-5 km above the surface then try and gage a a last minute burn from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope some of this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh for a mun burn towards the Mun just as it comes over the horizon of Kerbin when in low Kerbin orbit usually gets you a fairly efficient Mun injection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this might suprise you but it takes less energy and thus less total fuel to go the Minmus and back. If you dont want to rebuild your Mun ship and lander send it to Minimus instead and get your first non Kerbin landing under your belt. Land on what looks like flat places they are frozen lakes and are very flat so your ship wont tip over easy. The Mun is very hard to find a flat place to land on so your lander there should have a wide base so it does not tip over.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-25T02:57:55Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2013 02:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by mcirish3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAlternative ending\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GraviTykillz","CreatedById":60694,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T03:01:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust did a Mun Landing today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to say that although I did not have mcjeb onboard today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMcjeb is what taught me how to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/487808930282706580/D8748F4F1A5CF513F5B88C632A2F3D8EE684D5B9/\u0022 alt=\u0022D8748F4F1A5CF513F5B88C632A2F3D8EE684D5B9\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/487808930282710807/50C1427FA87308D39F0400908D88BF735EDA534A/\u0022 alt=\u002250C1427FA87308D39F0400908D88BF735EDA534A\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etheres plenty of ships available in the stock craft section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexperiment with some of them or i would mail you this craft if you want\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Traches","CreatedById":79229,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T03:10:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s tough to offer more help without more detail, but I\u0027d leave the SRBs at home.

So launch - straight up to 10k, then 090 at 45 degrees elevation until you\u0027re at T-35 seconds to apoapsis. Then follow your prograde vector. If you fall below T-30 to apoapsis at any time, return to 45 degrees elevation. Above T-60 to apoapsis, begin burning along the horizon. Burn until your apoapsis is up around 110,000 meters or so. All the while, watch your gee meter - you want to throttle back occasionally such that the needle stays right at the top of the green section of the gauge (not above it). Once you\u0027re out of atmosphere, set up your maneuver node and burn for orbit when you\u0027re ready. You\u0027ll probably want to do that at about 1/3 thrust. Dump the booster once you\u0027re in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, align your map view so that you\u0027re looking at it top down, and target the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Set it up so that if the top of the screen is 12:00, the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn is somewhere around 3:30 or so (about 100 degrees from the top going clockwise). Set up a node at the 6:00 position and pull prograde until you get an encounter. Use the data from the maneuver node to time it - you want roughly half your burn to occur both before and after the node. You might want to light your transfer stage engine and fire it up for a few seconds before you get there; it won\u0027t throw things off too far and it\u0027ll give you a better time estimate. Burn when the time comes and adjust as necessary. When you get to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s SOI, burn retrograde at periapsis to establish orbit. You want to get it relatively close - 14k is good. Pick a landing site, burn to deorbit, and dump the transfer stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the tricky bit - quicksave (F5) before you begin (and F9 to quickload after a foul-up). Go IVA and find your radar altimeter - the gauge that looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.navfltsm.addr.com/collins-ra.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022collins-ra.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep an eye on it until the needle starts twitching. Then burn retrograde. Make sure your speedometer is set to \u0022Surface\u0022 mode (click on the word portion of the speedometer if it isn\u0027t. Lower your lander legs if you haven\u0027t already. You want to burn off most of your velocity at this point. When it gets to 50 m/s, back off the throttle to 2/3, then 1/3 at 20 m/s. The retrograde marker should approach the center of the blue portion of the nav ball. Kill your burn at that point and go back to your radar altimeter. Watch it until you\u0027re 500 meters over the deck, then burn hard again - use the radar altimeter to get an estimate on where the ground is. Get your speed below 10 m/s and keep it there once you\u0027re within 100 meters. Throttle down when you hit the surface.

You want to burn off most of your velocity at this point. When it gets to 50 m/s, back off the throttle to 2/3, then 1/3 at 20 m/s. The retrograde marker should approach the center of the blue portion of the nav ball. Kill your burn at that point and go back to your radar altimeter. Watch it until you\u0027re 500 meters over the deck, then burn hard again - use the radar altimeter to get an estimate on where the ground is.

One trick you can use in the VAB to get just a little more footprint out of your legs is to hold the \u0026lt;SHIFT\u0026gt; key and hit \u0026lt;W\u0026gt; (or is it \u0026lt;S\u0026gt;? I can\u0027t remember) a few times to angle the legs out a bit. Most of the designs people have suggested with radially-mounted fuel tanks or girder sections are good things to look at. The other (slightly less important) is mass. Generally speaking, it takes about 10 tons of rocket to lift 1 ton of lander into orbit so I\u0027d recommend against RCS and RTG spam for this reason. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso related to mass is your Thrust-to-weight ratio. Of course you need a minimum amount of power to be able to land (and take off again) but too much makes throttle control really difficult when you get close to setting it down. I\u0027m sure you noticed that just as you\u0027re trying to set it down you\u0027d lower your throttle a tidge and the thing drops like a stone; tapping the throttle up a scosh and lander tries to fly back into orbit. This is a sign that the lander may be overpowered. I\u0027d recommend trying Markus Reese\u0027s design, only swap the LV909s out for the 48-77 engines (that should drop your Munar TWR down to about 3:1). I\u0027m willing to bet it\u0027ll handle easier for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA downward facing spotlight can be a real life-saver when it comes to judging how close you\u0027re getting to the terrain; and can help you gauge if it\u0027s level enough or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELAUNCH and ORBIT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot going to talk about design too much outside of suggesting you not use SRBs after stage one. They\u0027re really not that efficient and are mostly there to get a quick boost of speed early on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEfficiently launching can make a huge difference in how much rocket you need to get to orbit. First, watch your speed. I could tell you about terminal velocity, air resistance, and map out maximum efficient velocity every 1000 meters... but that would be stupid and overwhelming. The rule of thumb is 100m/s off the pad, keep your G-meter at about 1G, and you want to hit about 200-240m/s when you reach 10,000m. Second is turning the rocket over. The easy way is to turn it over to about 45-degrees at 10km of altitude, then turn it over to the horizon at about 30km. It\u0027s not the best turn, but its a good place to start from and you can work out better ways as you gain experience. Third, you want your orbital altitude as low as possible. I used to go all the way out to 100km but these days I put my parking orbit down around 75-80km. Less energy spent getting into orbit and (unintuitively) less energy spent with your Munar injection burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGETTING TO THE MUN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is easier than you think. Plunk down a maneuver node. Grab the prograde green karat and pull on it until you have a ~860m/s maneuver plotted, then grab the blue circle on the node and wave it around your orbit until you get an encounter with the Mun. You can fine-tune it from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that covers some of the basics.

In fact, in the pics I posted earlier, it lands entirely on the fuel on the outer engine. Without lines, the center will not be used at all is the only difference. On landing, still using the same thrust efficiency and same fuel source so biggest difference is slightly slower on decel, and a bit more on touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always tell people who do have trouble getting a rocket to work is to work in reverse order, just like how you build. So to get the feel for building the more complex rockets with what you have, get each step one at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Return module using one piece (my pic), or deployable science pod if you bring it. The latter simply is using a decoupler and radial parachute on the science module to deploy when you get to low altitude (sub 10km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Return drive. This is pretty tough to get wrong in solar system. One fuel tank to match pod and one of the high efficiency engines will always get you home. In my rocket, the half tank and the single engine is enough to de-orbit mun AND re-enter atmosphere. Trick is to do your decel at high Ap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Lander engines. Just fiddle around. Might take more than one flight, but fortunately if your return drive is working, you can abort a landing if these run out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Munar engines. This stage is what I like to use to de-orbit and capture munar orbit. Preferably, you can have a little bit of fuel as you begin your landing just to help slow down a bit quicker, but ideally, your lander engines should be able to capture. This section is more important to the high fuel consumption portion of de-orbiting Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Launch engines are pretty standard. They either work, or they dont. Most important part is to remember that if you do this with multiple engine stages, that any non fired engine is just extra mass you are burning fuel to move. Without fuel lines, it is best to have all boosters running from start or have a long burn high thrust with a lower thrust small secondary booster to get from high atmosphere to orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, refering back to the one I did, I have the heavy cluster of SRBs to get me up out of the worst of the air resistance, then I engage my tri clusters of fuel where it is more efficient to get high atmosphere. The singles capture orbit and begin my transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other way to do this is how I did it in ye olden days. I had shorter side liquid fuel boosters that ran the high thrust. The inner engines had more fuel, but were more efficient. In this way, I had assist in getting fuel to higher atmosphere, and was able to jettison the outers as they ran out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: That rocket I took to minmus, I think I use the full size tank (not double size) for my mun lander, but cannot remember for certain...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-27T07:13:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2013 07:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Markus Reese\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T14:00:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WafflesToo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WafflesToo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027d recommend trying Markus Reese\u0027s design, only swap the LV909s out for the 48-77 engines (that should drop your Munar TWR down to about 3:1).
