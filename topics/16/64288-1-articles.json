Im using FAR so the rocket has to be aerodynamic and its turning out to be hell. A serial staged 12k Dv rocket is simply massive. The tricky part is as I design each stage I need a 2.0\u002B TWR to go along with it. Im using mods like SpaceX for the large lander legs and StretchySRB for any diameter I want plus whatever non-op engines I can get my hands on. My latest design is about 10 meters wide at the base. But it only has 8k Dv and weighs 1,500 tons. So getting this thing off Kerbin is going to be whole different escapade. But for now I need a lifter that can get one single kerbal to low Eve orbit with enough fuel to rendezvous. Has anyone tried this with FAR? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve been trying this balloon concept for a few days now and its.. no good. It takes six of the Hooligan Labs Death Star balloons to lift this thing.. that\u0027s just too much I cannot get this to orbit let alone Eve. 12,000 DeltaV.... how the hell can I do thid? Now.. I realize that with FAR and a proper rocket I can reduce that number a bit. And I can also land on higher ground. But pin point landings will be hard with the sizes im working with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and then I need to LAND this thing.. ha.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T03:46:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith FAR, you \u0022must have\u0022 Deadly Re-entry.

You should be able to manage it with 8Km/s, maybe a bit more. Try doing radial staging, it should be lighter, and you could just get the whole thing to orbit as an SSTO, then refuel it and send it to Eve. As for aerodynamics, you would probably be best to put a kerbal inside a small fairing, that way he will be protected.
