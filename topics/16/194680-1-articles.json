You can probably rotate that craft while it\u0027s on the ground -- especially if you try retracting and extending that drill. If you can get it so that the tip of that drill enters the ground, and the \u0022pumping\u0022 motion of the drill does not\u00A0 move your craft around, then you can still mine and convert. But yes, when you mount drills, you must take into account that they extend down and bounce\u00A0when drilling. So you need to mount them higher than that. Always best to test a mining craft on the runway before committing to an actual mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-12T18:24:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223801788\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194680\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591985402\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlways best to test a mining craft on the runway before committing to an actual mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyes, now i always run a full simulation of a mission before doing anything new.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nat the time when i launched the mining complex? i still didn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-12T19:03:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t bother to try to try to keep it upright.
