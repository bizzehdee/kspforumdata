You could go with any of these, because 4000 m/s of dV is a lot and you will easily go home to Kerbin with plenty to spare, so you have a lot of choices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption #1: Direct ejection. Eject when Laythe is moving retrograde relative to Jool\u0027s orbit around the sun (i.e. when Laythe is on the sunward side of Jool), and also when your ship is orbiting Laythe retrograde relative to Jool\u0027s orbit around the sun (i.e. when the ship is on the opposite side of Laythe from Jool). This will allow you to add Laythe\u0027s Jool-relative velocityand your ship\u0027s Laythe-relative velocity to your burn, which will save some dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption #1a: Same as #1, but time it so that you get a slingshot boost from Tylo. This can make a big difference-- Tylo is big and heavy, it packs a pretty good wallop as a slingshot fulcrum. It means waiting for a few Laythe orbits until Tylo is in the right position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption #2: Jool slingshot. Eject when Laythe is on the side of Jool that\u0027s away from the sun, and your ship is on the side of Laythe towards Jool (i.e. when your ship is orbiting Laythe in the retrograde direction of Laythe\u0027s orbit around Jool). Give it enough dV so that when it ejects from Laythe, its periapsis takes it down as low as possible to Jool, i.e. just above the top of the atmosphere. Coast down to Jool periapsis, then do a burn there to eject from Jool solar-retrograde to take you home again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption #2a: Same as #2, but with a Tylo slingshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, to make maximum use of Oberth effect, you\u0027d want to do your Laythe ejection burn when you\u0027re at Laythe periapsis. However, you\u0027re limited there by the fact that the periapsis orientation is stuck in one particular direction that you can\u0027t change, unless you\u0027re willing to wait until Jool orbits around to the other side of the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the cold fact of the matter is that with a honking great load of dV like 4000 m/s, you have easily enough for pretty much any trajectory that it works-- you\u0027ve got plenty of dV to spare, so you don\u0027t need to be too concerned with optimizing Oberth unless you want to do so just for the challenge of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yasmy","CreatedById":79995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T20:09:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starhawk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starhawk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou should need much, much less than 4000 m/s to return to Kerbin.\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, about 1100 m/s, plus some extra for a plane change, from low Laythe orbit back to Kerbin.
