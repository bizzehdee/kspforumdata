I have only watched videos myself but it is truly a thing of beauty, especially if you like IVA missions. It is designed to go along with the Raster Prop Monitor mod, and it also has about a thousand switches on the inside, many of which actually do things. It also comes with external cameras to place on your lander to help with docking and landing, which will subsequently feed to the monitors in your craft. I don\u0027t know that I\u0027ve ever seen another mod with lander cans in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also now that I\u0027m looking at the page, it appears to be out of date, not updated since June so if you are in 0.25, you may be out of luck. Hopefully someone else will know of a mod with lander cans. I have seen various odd looking ones which could be used as landers but aren\u0027t authentic, such as the transparent pods here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83364-WIP-NohArk-s-Pick-and-Pull-Ambient-Occlusion-NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!?highlight=pick\u002Bpull\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83364-WIP-NohArk-s-Pick-and-Pull-Ambient-Occlusion-NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!?highlight=pick\u002Bpull\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T06:49:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo looking some more I found these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBobcat looks to have a lander (no pictures here) in his American pack and possibly in his N-1 pack, since it is supposed to be a moon rocket, but it doesn\u0027t specifically say.
