First I have a vent... I find it confusing when I\u0027m trying to follow a tutorial and the mods used to complete it aren\u0027t listed... uggghhh... I\u0027ve spent hours just trying to find the right one. Anyway.... Maybe I\u0027ve broken the game, but I\u0027m in the VAB and trying to assemble my first space station, but having problems with the connection tool. I am trying to connect Clamp-O-Tron docking collars to the any of the multi-point connectors and it will only let me attach 1 collar. Why is this not working? Have I broken it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gus","CreatedById":68154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T06:43:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might have to rotate each collar into the correct orientation first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T13:04:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, this one is a pain. Those multipoint connectors only work in one orientation relative to the point you connect them to even though they look identical from all 6 directions. Rotate the part before connecting it until all of its attachment nodes are green when you hold it up to the connection point, then attach it and it\u0027ll work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
