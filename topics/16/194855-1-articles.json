When you place a fairing it will automatically go into construct mode, all you need to do then is move your cursor around to drag the fairing wall into the shape you want and left click to place that section. There are limits to how wide you can make the fairing; I think the maximum radius is the same as the diameter of the part, so a 2.5m fairing can be up to 5m wide. When you want to close the fairing, just narrow it to a point and the \u0027place section\u0027 on screen should change to a blue \u0027close fairing\u0027. You can also close the fairing by moving it into contact with a part, this can be useful if you\u0027re using a launch escape tower or just want the fairing to cover up an aerodynamically ugly section in the middle of your rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two sliders on the fairing control the number of sides and the deploy force. Number of sides is more important with the \u0027clamshell deploy\u0027 mode ON, it simply determines how the fairing splits up when you deploy it. Deploy force should be kept high if you\u0027re deploying the fairing in atmosphere and/or at high acceleration as that will \u0027throw\u0027 the pieces away with more force and so reduce the chances of damaging your payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0027Clamshell deploy\u0027 mode is off by default and will make your fairing deploy as solid sections like real fairings do, rather than just shattering into many pieces. It looks better and in some rare cases could help avoid pieces of the fairing damaging the payload, but I don\u0027t think the differences are particularly significant. If your payload has protruding parts at a specific symmetry (e.g. 3x), then you can set your fairing to match that symmetry or a multiple of it (either 3 or 6 sides) and line it up appropriately so that the fairing splits away from those protruding parts and reduces the chances of damage. Plus it looks waaaay better, which is more important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u0027Interstage nodes\u0027 is a useful feature of fairings that lets you effectively stick multiple payloads in a single fairing by providing a column of attachment nodes rising up from the fairing part itself. These are particularly good when you want to deploy a satellite constellation using resonant orbits, haul many small satellites up in one larger rocket or just want a little bit more space between the base of the payload and the fairing part itself (e.g. if the payload is actually wider than the fairing part and a direct attachment would make the fairing ugly/impossible to build).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0027Truss structure\u0027 is only relevant if you\u0027re using the interstage nodes, it will create a scaffold-like structure for each interstage node that has something attached to it.
