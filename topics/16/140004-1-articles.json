Decouplers now have the option to turn on crossfeed, and if so they\u0027ll happily suck your upper tanks dry.

I\u0027ll need to see your ship and a list of mods you\u0027re using, if any.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T23:18:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe would need to see a pic of the ship.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, moved to Gameplay Questions, since it\u0027s not a tutorial.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
