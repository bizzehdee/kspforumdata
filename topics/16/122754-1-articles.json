(The latter is where it is because I\u0027m lazy and I intend to put my mining operation A: on flats, and B: near the equator. I want to pick the least-bad spot that meets those criteria.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am reasonably clear on the overall concept: the survey scanner gives a broad global overview of resource concentration, but isn\u0027t terribly accurate or finely-grained. The narrow-band scanner only provides data for the location it\u0027s overflying, but is supposed to be more accurate and thus supplements/improves the overview data obtained with the survey scanner. So, no need to explain that part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow here\u0027s my issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I see no way anywhere in the UI to STORE the narrow-band results. It doesn\u0027t seem to be updating the survey scanner results... am I expected to get out paper and pencil and make hardcopy notes about the lat/lon of superior locations? Or is there some way to get the game to store the narrow-band results for later use, and I just haven\u0027t stumbled across it yet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Near as I can tell, the two instruments\u0027 readings have NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with each other. They\u0027re not even VAGUELY similar. The survey scanner claims there are wide swathes of Minmus with Ore concentrations over 60%--there\u0027s even one area of Flats, on the equator, that it claims is somewhere in the 50%-60% range. But the narrow-band scanner? It shows NOPLACE with Ore concentrations above 8%; and it appears to be providing values that are tightly tied to Biome type. ALL areas of Slopes have concentrations of 5.65%, all Midlands are 2.75%, the entire Greater Flats is 2.0%, and so forth. Including locations where the survey scanner is claiming 80%-90%-ish concentrations. What\u0027s up with that? Clearly, (at least) one set of measurements is utter garbage. Or I\u0027m getting hit by a bug (No! A *bug* in KSP? Say it isn\u0027t so!), or I\u0027m grossly misunderstanding something, or or or....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t sent a rover or hopper with a surface scanner yet...which I am given to understand provides highly-precise results for the exact location it is on/over, and is really the one to use for site selection.

But usually not by much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just scanned and mined Moho, and in my case, the hottest biome was the \u0022Minor craters\u0022 - a number of craters scattered around the surface. After landing in one and doing the surface scan, the orbital overlay changed to highlight some of the craters over others. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best was at high lattitude : bad for mining. So I focused on the equatorial ones, and found that the western part of one gave me 6.9%, while others had less than 4%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to use one of the non-monochrome highlight colors for the overlays. They provide a much clearer image of what\u0027s going on, than the default pink color.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Srpadget","CreatedById":111267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T02:20:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ripper2900\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ripper2900\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E ... scanned and mined Moho, and in my case, the hottest biome was ... \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeh.
