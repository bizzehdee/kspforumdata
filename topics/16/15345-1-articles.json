But here\\\u0027s my best go at a short description of how I approach it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst build a lander. For first attempts make it small and light, that way it\\\u0027s easier to change velocity though they can be very sensitive on the controls. Try the smallest cockpit for one kerbalnaut, add one or more parachutes, then a decoupler, then an ASAS and say one large \u0027small\u0027 fuel tank and the smallest engine. For refinement add an RCS tank and say 3 thruster blocks. Add 3 of the larger legs (heavier but much more resilient, the small can be used but tend to break if you have any transverse velocity). That\\\u0027s the lander; might be a bit short of fuel to return, you may try a second small tank, experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext you need the motive stages, and this is often a case of trying a certain configuration and modifying. For first goes keep it simple. I\\\u0027d go for two stages here for simplicity, with one to launch and 1 to push you into orbit and to Mun. The second stage is, say a couple of BIG tanks and a big engine, attach with a small decoupler (I reckon these are more stable, but YMMV). When experimenting if you need stability add fins and struts for support, just be sensible. I\\\u0027d add fins for the early part of the descent too. First stage, try the same as the second plus, say, 3-4 of the larger solid fuel boosters, plus fins. Attach with small or large radial decouples, I like the small as they seem to detach better, but that may be just me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPay careful attention to your staging; have the first stage and the solid fuels in the bottom, then a decoupler stage to drop the solid fuels, then group the first stage decoupler with the next stage so you just drop the stage and keep going. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may need more push, you could try a small third stage above the second, but experiment, you can often add solid fuels for just a bit more but try not to get too complex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you go up, start to head North at any time from 8,000 metres up, might be best to wait until 12K or 16K, but I\\\u0027d say definitely by 30-35K where you can be over by 45 degrees. This reduces the \u0027gravity drag\u0027 and reduces fuel burn. Wait until you have an apoapsis of, say 80K (suit yourself on this, can be as low as 70 or as high as 100-120 to 240 if you have plenty of fuel). Stop burning and coast until you are at the apoapsis ( 10 or so secs out to give yourself a little margin) and be ready at close to a horizontal burn, a little up and adjust down as you go, try to keep close to the apoapsis until you get a periapsis and burn until that\\\u0027s above the atmosphere. Your now in a stable orbit around the equator or close to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get to Mun, slow way is to go to your periapsis and burn towards the round green circle on the control ball or whatever you call it. That will extend your orbit on the opposite side of Kerbin, push it out until it intersects the Mun\\\u0027s orbit, and warp time until you pick up an intersection with Mun. Faster way is to go into the rocket view, orient yourself until you are pointing at the green circle in your orbit and change the view to look forward at the Kerbin horizon. Wait until Mun rises and immediately burn at full thrust. You should intersect with Mun the moment you orbit crosses Mun\\\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027d then warp until you are over by Mun and right next to the perhaps is with Mun, then decelerate until you get an orbit. Adjust your orbit by burning retrograde as appropriate, into a reasonably circular orbit. Try to get the orbit so it crosses one of the large craters, they\\\u0027re pretty smooth to land in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext to get to the surface, the\\\u0027s lots of ways. I like to choose a spot, then wait until I\\\u0027m say 10-20 degrees short of being over the top of it, then decelerate hard until your orbit intersects Mun, and keep burning until your intersection is about where you want to go. Remember that it may move further as you brake when you descend depending on how much lateral movement you retain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I often switch to the spacecraft view and warp until, say, 50K or so, burn to reduce speed to under, say, 50-60 m/s, then switch off and drop to say, 20, repeat, etc. you can have fewer longer burns, or if confident just one final burn, experiment ! At say 4-5 K up you want to be pretty much dropping vertically, I like to keep the speed down here to 50 max but there\\\u0027s no hard and fast rules, just be sure to have enough time to slow down or, kersplattle ! Lower the landing legs at, say, 4K, and guide it down. If you keep aimed at the green circle with the cross you will remove all lateral velocity but it is hard as your speed drops to below 5-6 m/s to stay stable, as above, work on it. You can use RCS if you have it, it isn\\\u0027t essential. At the end try to get to around 2 m/s for the last 20 metres, it\\\u0027s a judgement call and you\\\u0027ll get better as you practice\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In my install the surface of Mun is at A minimum of around 720-750 metres, often around 850, and that\\\u0027s in the craters. Can be up to 2K outside or more, hard to be sure but watch the terrain change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s it, you should be down. Next crank up the throttle and exit if you have the fuel. Aim at one of the pink items on the trackball to get an equatorial orbit. Get into low Mun orbit, burn to accelerate backwards, exit Mun orbit then got to your Kerbin apoapsis and burn retrograde until your orbit intersect Kerbin. Go home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhew, that\\\u0027s much longer than I thought.
