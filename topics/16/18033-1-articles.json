One is simply really large rockets and the computer stresses all the physics. Two for me used to be caused by having alot of persistent debris in the area my computer had to independently track. Lastly, if you have been using mods and updating the version. Occasionally conflicts, errors or bugs can occur causing permalag. Try a clean unmodded install and see if lag continues. All mods, download .17 updated and only use the plugin from original source, not the ones with the mods if it can be avoided.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aggressorblue","CreatedById":39337,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-28T18:23:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you mean 0.16 updated, unless .17 was released and I don\u0027t know about it....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-28T20:53:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s lagging specifically more on kerbin than anywhere else, you can try the fix in this thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/17854-Massive-frame-rate-drop-when-looking-at-kerbin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/17854-Massive-frame-rate-drop-when-looking-at-kerbin\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s lagging at launch, the best thing to do is to build as small rockets as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
