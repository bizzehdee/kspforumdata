When I began I too did not know about qucksaving/quickloading and did the exact same thing you did just fyi.\n\nBut just to echo the above statement, yes, you can do them again no probelm with no reduction. Also as for you\u0027re reentry attempt, I am too interested in what your AP/PE was. But just a general rule I have found helpful is that 30-50km is your target PE but this depends on your AP, so 30 if your AP is lower, 50 if its in the higher range."},{"CreatedByName":"Pirx","CreatedById":149331,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T07:14:46Z","Content":"Good Morning Champ, Glaran K\u0027erman:\n\nThanks a lot for your replies, I finally managed to make succesul landings and reentries into kerbin (yesterday I managed 3 succesful missions without any new cassualties YAY!) and with the science I won I\u0027ve been able to substantially improve my rockets.\n\nIn relation to the question I opneed my post with I must say that as you told me, I was able to perform the experiments again with no science reduction.\n\nRegarding the reentry I think that I was coming in in a really acute angle, the heat shield overheated and exploded, as per the missions I performed yesterday I tried to reenter really shallow thus staying in the atmosphere more time but having less friction and also aerobreaking more (the heat shield life when I finally touched earth was 175/190 more or less)\n\nI have other question (this time regarding ressurrected kerbonauts) but ill open another thread.\n\nThanks a lot for the help and the welcome ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T18:24:25Z","Content":"Glad to be of assistance!"}]}
