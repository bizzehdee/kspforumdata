And found this issue: I cannot set maneuver nodes with my spacecrafts. They are manned with pilots and have enough electricity and communtication. It looks for me as some functions of the map are either deactivated or missing. The flightpath\u00A0is allways in grey. I cannot set a target and I am unable to accelerate time via klicking on the flightpath and say \u0022move here\u0022. Can someone help please?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-30T21:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume you are in Career mode?
