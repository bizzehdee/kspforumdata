What does you flight log read (F3 default) before chute deploy, after initial deploy (drogue mode, ie chutes out but not fully opened) and after it goes into full deploy both before break off and after? I have a feeling it broke a connection somewhere. Had this happen on a crew return vehicle for my station. Thankfully I F5d before leaving my station. Thing broke during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cerberus738","CreatedById":100744,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T11:13:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know time warp seems to break chutes, at least for me. Also if you are going too fast when they fully deploy they will all rip off. You could try deploying them higher up... they cause drag partially deployed and may slow you down enough so they don\u0027t break when they fully deploy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pjschurr","CreatedById":49025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T18:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven that Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere has the consistency of oatmeal, I open them later instead of earlier - you\u0027ll slow down below 150m/s without any help, at which point the parachutes are much less likely to cause spontaneous disassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
