Its always been a bit less gravity than kerbin, its just that you have no atmo so the landing is harder but the takeoff easier. My rule of thumb for building tylo landers has been to just take off from kerbin to test it. If it can make it to orbit on its own with a bit of fuel left over it can probably handle tylo.
