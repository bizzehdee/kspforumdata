Probably due to float-datatype or otherwise bad computing algorithms. You should adjust velocity several times before rendezvous. Let\u0027s say 3 days, 1 day, 12 h and 3 h. Typically you have very large delta v and you must start braking burn before you even see the distance marker of target. Little use of mathematics helps to solve right start for burn. Mechjeb is a great help, if you are not against it. When you are in range of several kilometers, do not use time warp. It can move crafts kilometers relatively to each other. Therefore docking takes much time and is boring. There are also some erratic influences, so that you should actively watch rendezvous parameters. I recommend that you should not intentionally plan dockings on solar orbit, but occasionally KSP\u0027s orbit calculations make large errors when you return from Jool and if you try to optimize delta-v near theoretical values, you may need rescue missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T19:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dooz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dooz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewell Docking in Interplanetary Space is Very hard I Never have Attempted it Heres What its like Getting a Encounter With a Planet that is Very very very Small No gravity Well Make sure to put alot of Deltav On your Module\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis burns my eyes...why are you doing this to us?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, Docking in interplanetary space is waaaay more effort than it\u0027s worth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Respawn","CreatedById":57256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T23:38:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have done a couple of interplanetary dockings and it\u0027s just like docking in kerbin orbit, except the distances is higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found that when in loading range of your target don\u0027t use time warp,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas your target will tend to jump around several km when physics is unloaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse physics warp instead or just be patient. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T23:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only question I have for the OP is where in interplanetary space are you attempting to dock?

Drive one and set the other one as target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2: match their inclination by adding and executing maneuver at either intersection node. You need the angle to be 0.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3: if the object you\u0027re docking to is ahead of you, go on lower orbit to catch up. If it is behind you, go on higher orbit to wait for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 4: when you\u0027re sufficiently close, add a maneuver and play with it until you get intersection or minimum distance sufficiently low. It\u0027s good if it happens at very close angle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 5: after you find such point and execute the maneuver, add another maneuver at exactly the meeting point and match the two orbits as exactly as you can. Execute that maneuver\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 6: From now on you switch from map chase to navball chase. Check your navball, there are your prograde and retrograde marker and the two markers for direction towards and from your target. Notice that when you accelerate in a direction which is not straight towards prograde or retrograde, these two move around the navball. You need to push your prograde marker on top of the \u0022toward target\u0022 marker. You can do so by either accelerating in a direction which on the opposite of the target marker than where your prograde marker is, or by decelerating in a direction which goes from target marker through the prograde marker. In either case you don\u0027t want your relative speeds to be very high, it should be less than 1% of your distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 7: When you are up close, kill the velocity and select the target plate as target and your plate as \u0022control from here\u0022. If you can rotate the target, rotate it towars you and just go forward (at a reasonable speed). If you can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to rotate your target, you need to put yourself above the target spot visually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice that in Kerbin orbit everything appears to rotate around the axis perpendicular to the orbit. To get rid of the target plate escaping, you can rotate it so it is perpendicular to the orbit (i.e. aims straight at south or north on polar orbit) and then place yourself against it. You don\u0027t even need to accelerate towards the target in that position, orbital mechanics will push you together as your orbits intersect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Kerbol orbit I assume the orbit matching part will be a bit harder and may require many tweaks to get you together close enough so you see the target in space. The docking itself should be easier though, as orbital mechanics play way less role there so no target rotating away will take place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lukaszett","CreatedById":77230,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T10:02:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I said: docking itself isn\u0027t a problem.
