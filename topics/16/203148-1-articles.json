KSP colleagues,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have noticed that sometimes if you time warp -- especially by large amounts -- you will get a warning that time warping can damage the spacecraft\u0027s structural integrity.\u00A0 (I may not have the wording exactly correct.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould this really happen?\u00A0 Is time warping potentially dangerous to one\u0027s spacecraft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank

warning comes when you physics warp, the 2, 3, or 4x warp you get if you try to warp in the atmospherere or by holding alt and warping. which could cause problems since the game is trying to calculate the same physics on the vessel in a fraction of the time.\u00A0 I have never had any issues but don\u0027t use it much either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor regular time warp there is sometimes a bit of a jolt when you exit warp, which can cause problems for landed vessels or\u00A0 large, complex vessels and particularly those with creative use of docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-20T20:02:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022

Warp\u2019.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhysics Warp normally only occurs while you are in an atmosphere. \u00A0 While in atmosphere you are prevented from hitting \u2018Normal\u2019 warp. \u00A0 You enter Physics Warp by holding the left modifier key while pressing warp. \u00A0Physics warp can also be induced while in space (outside of any atmosphere too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the name suggests, during Physics Warp, the game still calculates physical effects. \u00A0Yes, bad things can happen to your ship. \u00A0 If you are careful, it is usually fine however. \u00A0 I use it all the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u2019s a few examples of bad things that can happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWhile controlling an aircraft it is easy to accidentally over-control, and exceed G limits, causing parts to fall off.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUsing rovers on the surface makes it more likely for parts to break.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn some cases, usually with rovers, parts can actually move slightly into a different position. \u00A0That\u2019s usually just annoying for small rovers, but for rovers with a lot of parts the cumulative effect can be a big problem.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEven in space, using Physics Warp can cause issues with large ships.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that using \u2018Normal\u2019 warp doesn\u2019t really cause these problems. \u00A0 Normal Warp is sometimes called \u2018On-Rails\u2019 warp, because objects stay \u2018on-rails\u2019, just obeying basic orbital paths, but otherwise ignoring the effects of atmosphere or other physical considerations. \u00A0 During Normal warp, there is not much concern for strange things happening to your ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne example where I use Physics Warp is while waiting for a pod to settle to the surface under parachutes. \u00A0 Waiting for a vessel to descend 1000 m at 2.0 m/s is painful, I usually use 4X Physics Warp for that. \u00A0I do try to be at 1X warp at the moment the vessel contacts the surface though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MetricKerbalist","CreatedById":211699,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-20T20:05:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi

the physics system- in atmosphere this is the only type of time warp you can get if you\u0027re moving, but you can also activate this in space using Alt\u002B,/. to make longer burns take less time. Be warned that physics warp can have unintended consequences- if your engines are running then your entire craft can crumple into itself like an accordion and become unstable, or have pieces pulled beyond their limits and break off especially in atmosphere, or just become uncontrollable as the controls can\u0027t keep up with the increased physics speed and keep overcorrecting. Physics warp goes up to x4 speed, although there are mods such as Better Time Warp which can change this value, both to make it slower for dramatic slow-motion shots and make it faster which can help with low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E engines, large ships that cause game lag due to their high part counts, or both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime warp is different- the physics system is suspended and everything proceeds \u0022on rails\u0022 without the effects of thrust, and cancelling any spinning that the craft may have picked up. This is a slightly cheaty way to bring an unstable craft back under control and can immediately stop wobbles and other instabilities that can be caused by having unbalanced reaction wheel torque or large parts connected by much smaller ones (e.g. docking a station together using small docking ports). Time warp starts at x5 and goes all the way up to x10,000, although again mods can change these values. Time warp is only available in space and when stationary on the surface of a planet or moon and will automatically be disabled when you enter an atmosphere or if you get below a specified altitude on each body; however if you\u0027re warping really fast the delay before it slows down to normal speed and re-engages the physics system can result in your craft ending up under the surface, deep into the atmosphere and burning up or in very rare cases going straight through and out the other side!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
