Can be a nightmare when you have lots of craft interaction. I\u0027ve started putting action groups for all craft in a mission into an excel sheet so I can see if their action groups interfere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elol, 3 is also my standard group for solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022codepoet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022codepoet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow does the stage action group work?

For me its one of the least used action groups. I use it for mostly to toggle steering locks on rover wheels, it doesn\u0027t matter that they get toggled during flight, but once the rover has landed chances are it doesn\u0027t have anymore stages so space can now toggle steering on a set of its wheels while keeping the other actions groups free.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T13:04:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI set Solars to 0 - because I can easily reach 1-5 with my wasd-hand - usually for toggling thrusters (fore/aft) on my docking tugs or other mission relevant commands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELights go with L and have there own command group, as have gears, although they are not always assigned automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T16:56:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a note to say that you can assign multiple actions to one command key.
