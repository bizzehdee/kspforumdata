Your hyperbolic trajectory must always be **counter-clockwise**. Remember : you\u0027ll enter the SOI by the line side and exit by round symbole side. If youn rotate the Mun view so the entry point comes from the bottom, your trajectory/periaps must always pass/be on the right side of he mun (or any other body).\n\nIf you\u0027re not in that case, create a node few minutes away and tweak it to be in that configuration. Those mid-course corrections are usually cheap.\n\n-\u003E For a simple flyby, or single landing : prefer an equatorial orbit\n\n-\u003E For a science stripping : prefer a polar orbit with a mother ship/space station.\n\nPlease note that some missions require **clockwise** orbits : some satelites placement, some crew recovery, some junk recovery."},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T13:09:18Z","Content":"I think you need to change the CONICS DRAW MODE to 0 to be able to see the orbit when focusing on the Mun."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T13:10:36Z","Content":"One more hint as to which side you approach is to judge by the resulting gravity assist maneuver. If it\u0027s a speeding up one (and you end up with an orbit with significantly higher periapsis, or with an escape trajectory) it\u0027s prograde. If your new orbit leads to a direct fall to Kerbin, you\u0027ve aimed for retrograde. And if your orbit goes way high above and below, you\u0027re in for Polar.\n\n...or collision course.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T13:12:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 01:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T14:34:56Z","Content":"As previous posters have suggested, set your focus to the Mun to see your trajectory there (you can use backspace afterwards to restore focus to your ship).\n\nNote that you can still tinker with your maneuver node that\u0027s over near Kerbin, even while focused on the Mun; this is very useful for fine tuning your periapsis.
