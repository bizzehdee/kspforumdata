Which version are you using? The 13.3 version is a free demo, if you have that you can\\\u0027t save your game. The 14.4 full version should save the game automatically (make sure you click \u0027Space Center\u0027, not \u0027End Flight\u0027). You can also use F5 and F9 for quicksave and quickload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the update error message, that\\\u0027s just the Updater\\\u0027s quaint way of saying that you\\\u0027re using the latest version available to you (13.3 or 14.4 depending on whether or not have you purchased the full version). Much like the game the Updater is a work in progress and this is one of the things that need to be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
