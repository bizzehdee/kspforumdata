Adding fins to the rear of small rockets can improve aerodynamic stability during early parts of flight. This may not be needed if you have engines with a high degree of gimbling instead.

Conversely, having the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E far below the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E may make turning slightly sluggish and the rocket more \u0022determined\u0022 to stay pointing in the direction its currently travelling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. During early parts of flight, it is generally a good idea not to turn too far away from your prograde vector. A good rule of thumb is to keep your direction indicator inside the prograde vector circle on the navball. Tap controls when turning rather than holding them down and use fine control (caps lock on keyboard) if necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Start turning early and smoothly rather than trying to make larger corrections later in flight. This will vary depending on the exact design of your rocket (mostly based on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of your stages), but a general rule of thumb is to fly vertical until you reach about 80-100m/s speed then pitch over 5-10\u00B0 and then keep pitching over gradually until you reach about 45\u00B0 at around 25 km altitude and be pointing more or less horizontal by 50km.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE: these figures refer to stock Kerbin atmosphere if you have any mods that replace Kerbin or change the atmosphere, then you may need to adjust for those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Don\u0027t worry too much about getting to a perfectly equatorial orbit for going to the Mun. An small orbital inclination can be corrected quite easily (and for little cost in fuel) during transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RunaDacino","CreatedById":233327,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-26T13:35:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E1.

A super wide fairing will introduce more lift than the fins at the rear and make you flip out like crazy. If you can keep your fairings relatively straight, you\u0027re good. Slightly flared out (with symmetry on bottom and top ideally) also works but... don\u0027t make it too wide.
