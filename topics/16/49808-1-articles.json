Once you reach that number you can only complete the set via trading/buying or by getting random booster packs. The booster packs are incredibly rare, with your chances of getting one increasing with your Steam level. I\u0027ve gotten 2 or maybe 3 boosters since I signed up for the STC during its beta, and none of them have been recent. You also have no control over which game the booster pack cards are for, except that they are always for a game you own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T04:58:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mufasa\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mufasa\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENobody I know owns this game yet so I\u0027m kind of out of luck there then.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can sell them (for steam $ credits) on the free market.
