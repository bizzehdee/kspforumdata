Jeb is currently orbiting Kerbin @ 2200m/s at 80KM. He\u0026#39;s showing some tourists the sights and perils and space. Whenever I try to get him back down his low-tech ship always disintegrates. I played KSC [i]a lot[/i] around 0.18 but this re-entry heat stuff is new to me!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nanyway the ship: \u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13203382/OCUK/November/2015-11-20_00001%20%28Small%29.jpg[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe situation: \u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13203382/OCUK/November/2015-11-20_00002%20%28Small%29.jpg[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I re-enter the atmos very steeply (by using all of my remaining 70 units of fuel lowering burning retrograde) my rocket overheats and explodes very. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I re-enter the atmos very genttly (set my P to 61Km or so) it burns up at around 33km altitude. If I spin the rocket around, I can keep the temperature-weak cockpit away from the heat, but I then run out of that fuel that SAS uses and the rocket settles to cockpit-first because of the big fins at the back causing a lot of drag.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo you reckon there is a way down? What sort of altitude should I burn the remainder of my fuel retrograde? Could I release my four parachutes one by one whilst burning through my atmos to try to slow down or would they have absolutely no effect at 2000m/s?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd how would I design my ship around this problem next time?\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-22T13:41:01Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2015 01:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Stewcumber\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T20:58:07Z","Content":"\nNot yet having tried an SSTO plane in 1.0.5, take this with the appropriate amount of salt-\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTypically I\u0026#39;d set my reentry PE at 20k just over the peninsula east of KSC, with AP around 75-80 on the opposite side (where I\u0026#39;d be doing the deorbit burn) and hit the atmosphere (surface)Prograde but pitched up 15 degrees with airbrakes deployed, adjusting as necessary to hit the landing strip. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m not sure if the Mk1 can survive that.

That current design is not made to re enter. Next time I would add a stack decoupler to drop the tank and fins. Or add wings to give you lift so you can glide longer higher up, but that will add challenges in getting it to space in the first place.\n"}]}
