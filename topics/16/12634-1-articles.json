Baby stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to build a plane with a rocket on the top. I\\\u0027ve attached my \u0027most working\u0027 design. By this I mean the design that doesn\\\u0027t immediately fall to pieces when you press launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\\\u0027t do too well. It goes careering off the runway (as most of my planes do for some odd reason) and if it manages to survive that and stay in one piece until it\\\u0027s airborne, the second it does get airborne it does backwards flips that don\\\u0027t look even physically impossible. Maybe my wings are in the wrong place or something ;/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the time, either the decoupler breaks and the rocket falls on the plane, some part of the plane falls off, or some parts of the rocket fall off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a working design that is similar to this except that it works. But it can only carry a rocket with one fuel tank, and that isn\\\u0027t enough to get into orbit, sadly (at least with my lack of skills). Really I want 2, 2.5 or maybe 3 tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really wish the parts wouldn\\\u0027t just fall off that way when horizontal when they work perfectly bloody well vertical.

I notice you have both canards and elevators. I always assumed it was in most cases a one or the other type situation (can\\\u0027t think of any real aircraft that use both - not that I\\\u0027m an expert). I do know that the canards in KSP do enable some slightly hyper manoeuvrability which is very difficult to control, even in precision mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve even played around with leaving off ailerons - the command modules generate enough rotation to roll even fairly large planes, and I\\\u0027ve found it more controllable in a lot of cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m just guessing here, really - I\\\u0027m away from my KSP enabled laptop, Anyway, someone who knows what they are talking about will be along shortly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoenix Aerospace","CreatedById":26120,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-13T23:51:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E To address your first problem, it\\\u0027s not at all uncommon for planes to veer like yours. Mine do too. This isn\\\u0027t your fault at all. It\\\u0027s caused by the way the game handles collision. The parts all have their own collision meshes, and like colliding with each other, even if they\\\u0027re on the same craft. This can pose a problem by pushing the craft off course. On planes, where it\\\u0027s more pronounced due to atmosphere and the smallish wing parts, it\\\u0027s best handled by a good SAS (preferably ADV SAS) unit or trim. (For realism, I like blaming it on crosswind.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The second has a little more to do with design. Look at IRL air launched craft like SpaceShipTwo / WhiteKnightTwo. They always carry the payload below the fuselage, in the case of the Pegasus micro launcher, or below the wing, as in the case of SpaceShipTwo. This is so that the craft can be dropped before lighting the rocket engines, so that it maximizes distance between carrier and payload, thus minimizing the chances of a collision. Example pics are attached.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T17:50:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour centre of lift might be too far forward, judging by the position of your wings. The centre of lift should be near your centre of gravity. Think of a side-view of your plane as a see-saw, and the wings/centre of lift are the point where it\\\u0027s balanced. Try moving the wings backwards if it\\\u0027s backflipping, and forwards if it\\\u0027s frontflipping. Keep the payload (the rocket) close to the CoL and CoG too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Knyght","CreatedById":22035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T20:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I put the wings further back and made some other tweaks and it kind of flies okay... But won\\\u0027t go high enough/fast enough that the rocket is sufficiently out of the atmosphere to not be affected by drag and brought straight back down. Any attempt to add half tanks and aerospikes to make up for it, but then it\\\u0027s heavy and falls apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a big part of the problem is that currently when building horizontally there isn\\\u0027t enough strength in that orientation for everything to not just fall apart, which is pretty annoying. It makes it ridiculously frustrating to put something together that looks totally fine, but the wings fall off. Struts help this fine, but if the rocket falls off... Not much I can do about that. Hopefully that\\\u0027ll get fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I could make rocket powered but this, well, mostly defeats the purpose :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\\\u0027t really put it underneath. Well I can, but t\\\u0027s a bit more complex to get takeoff right without smashing it up.

The fuselage of aircraft IRL is usually much bigger than the rocket itself. Take fighter-launched Anti-satellite missiles, for instance. If you deploy from the bottom, you also face the problem of the aircraft being uncontrollable. Most of the time it will pitch down into your now-accelerating rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found with my HADS - High Altitude Deployment System, which was a huge carrier that launched a Vanguard shuttle into orbit (I later discovered Vanguard no longer flies straight in 0.15 D:\u0026lt; ) I mounted the rocket over the wings and it worked out okay. That was a heavy launcher, and my launch strategy was to not climb too steep until I got to around 10km, then accelerated as fast as I could and did what\\\u0027s called a zoom-climb - if you don\\\u0027t know what that is, you speed up as much as possible then trade your speed for altitude even after your engines flame out. I think my final deployment altitude was around 17km, and initially your rocket burn should be straight up as if you were doing a standard ascent, to get you out of the thicker atmosphere. I made two successful deployments like this before I got bored of the treacle-handling bug with small craft decoupled from larger ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Knyght","CreatedById":22035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-15T00:56:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm.
