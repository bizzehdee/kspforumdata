Also, KSP uses a simple heating and drag model and shockwaves have nothing to do with it. It\u0027s just the increased drag of a blunt heat shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe probably best way to deal with heating is facing perpendicular to prograde on reentry. This way, drag is maximized which can make your speed drop faster than heat builds up, allowing to survive reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadiators are commonly attached to spaceplanes and are sometimes effective, but usually, if a spaceplane explodes after removing radiators, it is either a bad plane or someone flies it badly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for reentry profiles, lower the periapsis to somewhere between 25-40km, and if you keep exploding, you can go for 35-50km periapsis and reenter several times to gradually bleed off speed. If applicable, a good method can also be adding excess deltaV to a spaceplane to decelerate to a completely suborbital trajectory, which, coupled with facing perpendicular to prograde, can give a very safe reentry. That\u0027s what I do on a spaceplane I extensively use in career mode right now. Despite being theoretically capable of doing a Mun flyby, I instead use the additional fuel to lower reentry speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, one more thing.
