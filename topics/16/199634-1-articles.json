I thought to attach a storage to the lander via my trustworthy engenieer, but since it has SOMETHING inside I can\u0027t.

If you just want to detach one storage part to the lander, you should probably be able to move any inventory into other storage spots. Are any of the things in inventory rocket parts? If so, you can just weld them onto the outside of your rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
