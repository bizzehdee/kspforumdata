You can have it show your TWR for various bodies in the solar system. You want to have a twr of 2 or better for Mun landers. While you can land with anything over 1.0 you have to start your landing burn at very high altitude and burn a lot of fuel getting down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, I made a lander with 4 ion engines that has a twr of about 1.35 and about 6300 dV, but it will burn almost half of it getting to the surface of the Mun from orbit. Normally getting to the surface from orbit takes under 1000 dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELow TWR craft are best used for point to point travel on the surface as they can hover for a long time and you don\u0027t need to bleed off that much velocity when you slow to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure Kerbal Engineer Redux also shows your TWR for various bodies but I\u0027ve never used it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T00:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use KER for the raw numbers, but nothing beats on-site testing.
