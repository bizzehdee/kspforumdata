Now that\u2019s all we\u2019ll and good, I can get a lovely intercept and that\u2019s all solved. But now, docking. However this time the question is simple and only really requires one answer: Is there a way to align docking ports, for an easier time? The only way I can thing of is to be able to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to lock onto target, but say I\u2019m using a drone, is there another way?

A good tip is to switch to \u0022Target\u0022 mode on the navball, and get your prograde vector onto the target vector. When you get close to the docking port, start aligning. Turn off \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E if it makes it too hard for you. Once you and the docking port are aligned, start moving forward towards it.

That is plenty of time to make errors \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E corrections, \u00A0adjust it if you feel overwhelmed or confident to proceed quicker. \u00A0Now get an intercept as you already did and when you are about 10km (a safe distance for a rokie, with experience and confidence you may get much closer, among other things because you setup better encounters and you need much less time) away from the target. Make sure the navbal is In target mode.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EKeep your eyes in the navball\u003C/strong\u003E, the only re reason you have to look elsewhere is to check the alignment and distance to target except that, all info is in the navball.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 10km if you are slower than 300m/s you are within the maneuvering time. \u00A0Make \u00A0the markers coincide and proceed. As soon as you can switch to the target and align it properly (If you feel necessary\u00A0slowdown a bit more for this) As\u00A0you close distance you will notice the markers moving, just keep maneuvering to maintain it in the same place and burn retrograde to keep the velocity within the time (200m/s \u00A0at 6km; 100m/s at 3km; 30m/s at 1km...) . While you are far away (10-3km) the main engines are precise enough for the maneuvers, as you get close (3-1km) start to control from the docking port and use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and for the last bit (1km-0) use precision mode.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere will be moment where you will be well aligned and slower then the \u0027recommended\u0027 velocity.

Even the fuel tank I put on the ship for orbital maneuvers was overkill considering I explicitely diminish engine thrust for such maneuvers down to 1% of nominal in order not to overshoot, I could get way with a few more percent up I guess, like get the thrust up to 5% of nominal would be enough.\u00A0\u00A0 Yeah I\u0027m really not confident. I\u0027m the type of guy going to Minmus with a 9000 deltaV rocket just in case I make a mistake and decelerate until 1000 meters from the surface still with the main tranfer engine and dumping it to surface with still some fuel left and activating the ship own engine only for the last slowdown before touch down, helps preserve the possibility of a (more than one) take off and landing elsewhere on the moon for science gathering on another biome quickly, the ship having science data storage containers. When I think I could do a Duna or an Eve mission with that kind of ship... I\u0027d be a waster IRL...

I\u0027ll do it next time I\u0027ll have a lab in orbit, when I couldn\u0027t do docking on my first little lab, I simply deorbitted everything and launched another one with more assets to be autonomous and not need an orbital supplying mission. I was not lacking money thanks to tourists contracts !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso I don\u0027t know if some of you use the M.O.L.E mod, can you confirm these MOLE docking ports have magnets because they don\u0027t seem to. Once the two docking ports just went past eachother but the ships didn\u0027t move to stick to each others like I saw on videos. So, either it was because of the additonal weight making the ship too slow to rotate on their own, either the docking ports were farther from one another that I could see (didn\u0027t angle camera to see on the top view if they were that close, tbh...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to my liquid poor experience, docking is easier the smaller ship you have...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I don\u0027t find the IHJKLN key to be practicle, I always mix them up (and also always forget to rotate the ship in the normal way to have directions going in the right direction, I always expect the ship to on the right when I press the right key and forget the ship goes on its right and if it is not in the correct inclination, the ship goes in the wrong direction)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest I find the game controls and interface quite badly designed to begin with, althoug getting used to three dimensional movement can be a bit of a stretch for someone used to bi dimensional movement in video games. The only other space games I own are strategy games and the ships move on their own when you give them commands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI once tried, in an exhibition about space, a simulation about docking to the ISS with a laser guidance system like the real ships do, I couldn\u0027t pull it off even with a laser guidance...\u00A0 It takes ages, IRL, they take three days to rendez vous with the ISS when they can be on orbit in about twenty minutes... Three days just to change orbit, match plan inclination, get a rendez vous, approach and dock. Most of it is fully automated and even if the astronauts have to check everything is going on as planned, they must get quite bored, stacked in this little tin can... Docking is good for computers and robots (quoting inspired by Obi-Wan here, I guess)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
