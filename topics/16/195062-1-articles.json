When you\u0027re in Duna orbit and want to get back to kerbin, you have to remember that you\u0027re technically in a higher position around the sun than Kerbin is. As such, you\u0027re going slower and and will need to both descend closer to the sun and speed up to meet Kerbin as it passes under Duna\u0027s orbit. To do this, just wait until Kerbin is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebehind\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Duna by about 15/20 degrees or so and set up a maneuver and see how close you are to meeting Kerbin on the other side of the sun. Presumably it should be close enough and you should be able to adjust time and/or the maneuver to get close enough for an encounter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForgot to say. When you want to raise\u00A0your sol\u00A0orbit, you\u0027ll need to accelerate with your maneuver node on\u00A0the other side of the planet you\u0027re orbiting from the sol (Camera sees sol behind planet). When you want to lower it, you\u0027ll need to put the maneuver node on the side of the planet facing the sun. (Sol should be behind the camera as you\u0027re initially placing the node.)\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-26T18:54:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2020 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by James M\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-26T19:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry going from Minmus to the Mun for practice.
