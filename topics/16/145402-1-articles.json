I was thinking about building it like a rocket, and then just tilting it over onto its wheels when it landed wherever its going and decoupling, like on a fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, rovers are NOT the ideal way of going to other biomes on Mun or Minmus. \u00A0On Mun, in most places, you have to drive dozens if not hundreds of kms to get to another biome, and the terrain is NOT kind to rovers. \u00A0The best bet is a self-refueling (aka ISRU) lander hopping from biome to biome. \u00A0On Minmus, the gravity is so low that rovers are way more trouble than they\u0027re worth. So instead, drop a lander that has about 3500m/s still in the tank when it 1st lands, and you can hop to every biome on Minmus and get back home no problem. \u00A0Given that Minmus can be hopped without ISRU, I recommend doing that first, collecting the thousands of Science! points from all the biomes, and then going on to Duna to finish the tech tree. \u00A0There are more biomes on Mun but they\u0027re not worth as much as biomes on Minmus, and after you pillage all Minmus biomes you should be mostly done with the tech tree anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, how to land\u00A0rovers is an age-old KSP question predating the advent of career mode. \u00A0The basic problem is called the \u0022vertical to horizontal transition\u0022, because no matter how you slice it, the rover\u0027s POV (and thus the way its navvball is oriented) must change at some point. \u00A0Given that this is a very old problem, there are many possible solutions, which I will try to outline below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, 1st off, you need to understand\u00A0navball orientation and how the 2 different editors (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E) deal with it..... \u00A0Rovers should always be built in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, saved as subassemblies, then added to rockets started in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0But \u00A0the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E says \u0022forward\u0022 is towards the open doors and \u0022up\u0022 is towards the ceiling. which means that when you launch the rover from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E to the runway, the navball will have brown down, blue up, and all is good for the rover. \u00A0But\u00A0in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E \u00A0\u0022forward\u0022 is towards the ceiling and \u0022up\u0022 is towards the wall WITHOUT your big flag on it. \u00A0If you build a rocket in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, the navball shows all blue when you launch it to the launchpad and wheel steering is reversed from the keys say. \u00A0This is why you should always build rovers in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E as subassemblies for the rocket in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but is also the basis for the \u0022vertical to horizontal problem\u0022 because, unless you do something, once you separate the rover, its navball will have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E orientation. \u00A0That\u0027s fine for landing it but sucks for driving around. \u00A0This is where the \u0022vertical to horizontal problem\u0022 comes from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are 2 main ways to work around this problem all of which assume the rover was built in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E navball orientation for the primary \u0022control from here\u0022

(mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E unit\u00A0radially attached to face up,\u00A0or any radially attached probe core from a mod. \u00A0The idea here is that the rover separates from the rocket in orbit and then descends with engines that will be ditched once landed. \u00A0The\u00A02nd \u0022control from here\u0022 part is used only during the descent and landing. \u00A0Once down you switch \u0022control from here\u0022 to the core probe core or crew pod that you started with in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane
