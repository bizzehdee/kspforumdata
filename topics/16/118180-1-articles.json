Unfortunately, the jet engines always drain the central rocket fuel tanks as priority rather than the jet fuel tanks they\u0027re directly attached to. Is there any reliable, stable and non weight intensive way of making engines drain only from fuel tanks they\u0027re directly attached to?"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T04:42:46Z","Content":"You can always click those squares on the tanks to stop fuel flow.

I think the idea behind this was to make planes easier to balance without mods like TAC Fuel Balancer. \n\nOne method that hasn\u0027t been mentioned to make the side pods drain first is to mount them to radial decouplers that you never stage. The airbreathing engines will think that the side pods are drop tanks and use that fuel first, leaving your center stack alone (though they will draw fuel from there when the side pods run out)."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T13:23:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sorry, don\u0027t care for mods myself.\n\nWell you should, like, really. You don\u0027t need to get mods that add thousands of parts or completely change the gameplay: if you want to stay really close to vanilla, you could still use mods like [KER](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-1-0-4-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v1-0-18-0)/[MJ](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124336-PART-1-0-4-Anatid-Robotics-MuMech-MechJeb-Autopilot-v2-5-3-%28July-6th%29) or [stock bug fix modules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-4-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-4b-2-1-Aug-15%29) that just add info or fixes bugs (duh) ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif).
