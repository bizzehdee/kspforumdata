So you need to hit a certain altitude range at a certain speed range, and then activate the engine through normal staging. Which can be tricky - whatever current stage is running is likely not out of fuel within that range, or will go too fast or too slow at the given altitude range. And if you activate next stage with the current stage still running, you\u0027re likely to have a sudden and impressive fireworks display...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T09:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow are you activating it?
