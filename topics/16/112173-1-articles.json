Thanks, green beans\n\u003E \n\nIt\u0027s worth noting that the discussion above is several years old (and therefore on older versions of the game), so any time you have a question *\u003Cu\u003Enow\u003C/u\u003E* about the current game, it\u0027s usually best to either hop on a recent thread (if there\u0027s one currently under discussion), or else just spin up your own new question thread.\n\nThat said, though, I *\u003Cu\u003Ethink\u003C/u\u003E* this particular game behavior hasn\u0027t changed in the last four years, so I believe the discussion in the thread above is still relevant.  Skimming over it it just now, I think your questions are answered there-- suggest giving it a read, if you haven\u0027t already.\n\nShort answer is:\n\n- If a crew member were going to respawn, they\u0027d do so right away.\n- If they haven\u0027t, then likely they ain\u0027t gonna.\n- It\u0027s possible to do some manual tinkering with the savegame (i.e. the .sfs file) by editing it in Notepad or some such.\n- However, if you decide to go that route, *\u003Cu\u003Ebe sure to keep an untouched backup copy\u003C/u\u003E* of your file from *\u003Cu\u003Ebefore\u003C/u\u003E* tinkering with it, because it\u0027s easy to accidentally screw up the file when editing, and if you do that, you could break the whole thing and make it unloadable.

There is a slider in the difficulty settings called \u0022Crew respawn timer\u0022. (Which is directly below the toggle button \u0022Missing Crews Respawn\u0022.) The default for Easy and Normal difficulty is 2 hours, for Moderate and Hard the default is that missing crews do not respawn.\n\nYou can also check in the Astronaut Complex. If they are listed as \u0022Missing in Action\u0022 then they will respawn. If they are listed as \u0022Killed in Action\u0022 then they won\u0027t respawn. I believe that if they will respawn, then you can just time-warp for the required time and they\u0027ll be back.
