Aim just above the horizon, in line with your retrograde marker, and thrust. As it moves, tilt towards it, always keeping yourself between the navball horizon and the retrograde marker. Continue until the retrograde icon is at the top of the navball (the little dot in the middle of the blue half of the sphere). At this point, you are dropping straight down. Point to retrograde and begin to burn away your vertical speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T15:21:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a nice wide lander with a relatively low center of mass might help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy early-career Mun/Minmus lander has three Science Jr. modules radially attached to the central core, with landing legs attached.
