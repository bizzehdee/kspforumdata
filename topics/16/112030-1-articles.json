For instance, my headcanon is that for the Goo and Material Lab experiments they are taking the samples out of the respective container and put them in a compartment of their EVA suit, just to store them in a proper cabinet in the capsule later.\n\nThing is: It has been suggested by selfish\\_meme to put a second [lander can at the bottom](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122925-Eve-landing-and-return-in-1-0?p=1969175\u0026viewfull=1#post1969175) of tall landers, in order to save ladders. While the idea is great, and with proper design the Kerbal on EVA can gather all experiments, it\u0027s somehow necessary to transfer the data to the other command pod internally... I\u0027ve just found the [Ship Manifest](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62270-1-0-2-Ship-Manifest-%28Crew-Science-Resources%29-v-4-2-1-1-14-May-15) mod, which will allow this as well, but if there\u0027d be a simpler mod that just allows science transfers, or if there would be a solution without using mods, I\u0027d greatly appreciate any hints toward these."},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T10:17:15Z","Content":"I would like science to be transferable internally, a bit like it was a resource, and to be able to be selective about which science is transferred to which pod.\n\nYou may want to leave certain science behind on a station to re-fill its MPL later and take some of the science back home. If to start with all the science is in one pod I can\u0027t see any way of selecting the results you want to leave behind and moving just those result to a different pod. There needs to be another button on the review science dialog that when clicked lets you select a different pod to transfer the result to (similar interface to how Kerbals are transferred)."},{"CreatedByName":"Borsek","CreatedById":129852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T11:28:32Z","Content":"Searcj for the crew manifest mod, that enables you to transfer mor pr less anything within ships.
