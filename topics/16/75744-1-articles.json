When I get into an orbit, way out of the atmosphere, let\u0027s say 500km apoapsis and 300km periapsis, then it s my understanding that the orbit should stay like that forever. If there is no atmospheric drag (outside of 70km), then the orbit should stay like this indefinitely since there is no orbital decay implemented. However, when I look at apoapsis, then it is slowly decreasing. When I say slowly, I mean like ULTRA slowly, maybe 1m every 10 seconds. However, it seems to happen only at normal time speed, and not when I have time accelerated. And it happens when I keep the mouse cursor on the apoapsis for a while, the last 2 digits of the apoapsis flicker a little bit and then it decreases by 1m. Then it stays like that. If I take the mouse cursor off the apoapsis and put it back there again, then the same thing happens again and 1m goes down again. This behavior looks like a bug to me, but I thought I should ask here for any other possible explanations first. Does anyone else experience this behavior?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T23:35:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are correct that it shouldn\u0027t happen and it\u0027s probably down to rounding-errors. Unless you somehow have a little thrust from engines or RCS then, yes, your orbit should stay the way it is forever. In real-life orbits decay and are altered because the other celestial bodies have a constant but varying effect ... best to just write-off these minor fluctuations in KSP as \u0027other stuff\u0027 like that and plan to make small orbital-adjustments every few months if it\u0027s important enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeepOdyssey","CreatedById":91001,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-23T06:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are phantom forces in the game, as a result of SAS simulation.

So if your craft is rotating, then the altitude of that part is changing and therefore the orbit will also change very very very very slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn rails warp the orbit is calculated in a deterministic manner and no longer takes this kind of thing into account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn big ships that bend and flex a great deal more this can be very noticable when looking at solar orbits, intercepts, etc. At regular speed your orbital path may jump around, but go into rails warp and everything becomes stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-23T07:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour ship is either rotating, or wobbling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that the \u0022orbit change\u0022 vanishes when entering timewarp is a pretty good sign of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry: switch SAS and RCS and engines off, then timewarp to stop the wobbles, un-timewarp.
