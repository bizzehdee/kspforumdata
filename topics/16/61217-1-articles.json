I have a weird idea for my career mode but I want to know how it actually works before I try it and it fails. Also do the experiments like the temp gauge and seismic test be reused without cleaning it out or no? I am really new to the career mode, even though I have had the game before .23 I never really tried it out before. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-27T13:20:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2014 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Liowen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cerberus738","CreatedById":100744,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T22:57:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust the goo canister and the materials bay need to be scrubbed. i think the science lab also boosts the science points gained for all the experiments but i\u0027m not sure i haven\u0027t used it yet. i always bring everything home. just try building it on the launch pad and see what it does you should be able to transmit the old experiments even if they don\u0027t give any points anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sticklyman","CreatedById":94761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T23:26:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECerberus is correct, the Science Jr. and the Goo Cannister need to be cleaned out.

I made a prototype on my test save (a sandbox one) to see if my idea could first land on Mun like I wanted. To my surprise it did and actually would have had enough fuel to get home I figured but could test that as I didn\u0027t put parachutes on it as it was only a probe. Here is the picture of it on the surface, I modeled it after the old Go-Bots ship from the 80s \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img819/1381/aaop.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aaop.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
