That should make the Duna mission easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERSwordman, if you find you\u0027re going too fast when your reach the target altitude, try completing it on the way down. After you launch make a new stage above your engine and drag the engine there. When you hit your target altitude hit X to cut your throttle. You\u0027ll keep going up till all your vertical speed bleeds off then start to fall. As you pass through your target altitude hopefully your speed has increased enough that it\u0027s also in the target range and you can hit space to stage the engine again and complete the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
