My question is: is there another way to calculate when the best Hoffman transfer orbits can be made and to time warp to them?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T14:47:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T14:58:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also just put a rover on the ground - outside of the launch pad circle and the runway.
