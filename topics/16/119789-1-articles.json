Really like the changes in 1.0. But I\u0027m losing Kerbals during re-entry, which for me has become maybe 10 times more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing in particular that\u0027s recently cost me two Kerbals on \u0022routine\u0022 missions with the smallest command pod (one-seater) and the Mk16 parachute: It takes forever to open, so I hit the water or ground before slowing down. Deployment altitude of 2000m no longer works. Heck, even 3000m is too low. But if I deploy at an altitude much higher than this, I\u0027m going so fast (above 250 m/s) that the speed will destroy the chute rather than allow it to open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo formerly (before the aerodynamic changes for 1.0), you could open a Mk16 chute at just about any altitude and it would open at 500m reliably, and all would be well. Now, open it too soon and it fails, open it too low and you hit the surface before the chute opens. The \u0022narrowing of the window\u0022 of operation for this chute is cool and I like how it makes the game more challenging, but in this case...they may have narrowed it to the point I can\u0027t do anything to save the Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve searched the forum here and don\u0027t see this to be a particular issue, or maybe I just missed it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny advice / recommendations?
