I was wondering if there was a design that somebody has that can take 4 or more kerbals into orbit around Kerbin and return them, and hoping to keep cost relatively low to improve my current money making efficiency. I can currently send 3 kerbals to orbit and back\u00A0using OKTO probe control and the rocket cost 20,260. However, most of the time the contracts are only for 20k per kerbal. So if anybody could share a design that is more efficient I would be appreciative as I\u0027ve been trying for 6 hours to get a 4 kerbal probe up there and back, but always fall short unless I spend like 40k for the rocket. Also, my science is only into the 90\u0027s bracket with Advanced construction, Aerodynamics, and Electrics.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-17T19:30:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2019 07:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by superhero34x\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-17T20:50:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to gameplay Questions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-17T20:52:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is nothing in the contract which says you have to do all 4 of them in one vessel.

I am trying to design a rocket that will carry more kerbals per trip to increase efficiency and reduce the number of times I have to launch to orbit as I generally have 4 or 5 of the quests at once so I can have anywhere from 10-20 kerbals that need to orbit. The less number of times that I need to launch the better it will be for me. Plus, most of my rockets are wasted to I don\u0027t really get money back from recovery (Plus the added bonus of being relatively new to the game, I\u0027m still learning how to cause a re-entry to place me close to the Launch site to increase recovery payout.) The 4 kerbal (or better preferably if $/kerbal can be maintained below 7000/kerbal) is simply to help me complete the contracts faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-18T03:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith an OKTO on the top (under the battery), this will get 5 tourists to orbit for under $16k if flown properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a 1-star pilot and no OKTO, it will get 4 more kerbals to orbit much more easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229FCuglb.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9FCuglb.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022347\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then it lands vertically on the runway for a huge refund on your launch costs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-18T03:59:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2019 03:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-22T20:28:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n@superher\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA common four-passenger \u0022go to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and back\u0022 type of craft that I use has an orbital stage that looks like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022C8fRhHE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022450\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/C8fRhHE.png\u0022 width=\u0022265\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHolds a pilot and four passengers.\u00A0 Needs no heat shield, just does a spaceplane-style reentry with the nose about 30 degrees above \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:prograde:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/prograde3.png\u0022 title=\u0022:prograde:\u0022\u003E.\u00A0 That package costs 7870 funds, uses 17 parts (you could probably get away with 15, if you eliminate the yaw fins), masses 6.34t, and has \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1281 m/s in a vacuum.\u00A0 So, just stick that on top of a fairly simple two-stage lifter and you\u0027re good.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
