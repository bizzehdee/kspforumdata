have a specific question.\u00A0 Do wings always provide lift in KSP?\u00A0 Take a look at my specific case...oh, looks like I can\u0027t add photos.\u00A0 I got that screenshot for nothing then...Well, just imagine\u00A0an awkward looking spacecraft.\u00A0 It is short and fat with multiple parallel stages (like the Soyuz launcher, not like Falcon 9).\u00A0 On its bottom is one of those inflatable 10m heat shields.\u00A0 On its top is a tail fin.\u00A0 The tail fin is attached to the spacecraft via a grabbing unit.\u00A0 The tail fin is composed of three \u0022Big S Delta Wings\u0022 spaced 135 degrees from each other.\u00A0 Overall the whole assemblage looks rather like a bomb that is meant to point down as it falls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe purpose of the spacecraft is to enter Eve\u0027s atmosphere.\u00A0 The heat shield is supposed to detach and fall away eventually, and the tail fin will also detach and fall away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately this setup does not always work.\u00A0 During atmospheric entry (say around...50km?\u00A0 40km?\u00A0 30 km? altitude in Eve\u0027s atmosphere) the craft flips around so the heat shield is not facing the direction of travel, said craft quickly disintegrated.\u00A0 That is -- this is USUALLY what happens.\u00A0 One time the setup worked.\u00A0 The tail fin kept the craft pointing in the right direction the whole time, and it would have \u0022landed\u0022 except it was heading for Eve\u0027s ocean (at that point I just reverted to an earlier save).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m wondering is if those Big-S Delta Wings are providing lift?\u00A0 I don\u0027t want them to provide lift; I just want them to provide guidance and stability.\u00A0 I was looking for an option to change the curvature of the wings to eliminate lift, but didn\u0027t find any.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried a couple of other things trying to keep my large-ish spacecraft oriented properly as it heads to Eve\u0027s surface.\u00A0 I tried adding more and larger reaction wheels (didn\u0027t work) and I tried adding a weird parachute/heat shield thing.\u00A0 The weird heat shield parachute thing was three of those 10m inflatable heat shield facing the wrong way, attached to the top of the spacecraft like the tail fin in my current setup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do I keep my big Eve Ascent Vehicle (which obviously has yet to even attempt said ascent) from flipping over during landing on Eve?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBen\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS I\u0027m playing on Xbox with no

The one you uploaded isn\u0027t visible, probably because you haven\u0027t enabled sharing -- I\u0027m seeing a 403 Forbidden when looking at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo answer your specific question: no, wings do not always produce lift. The lift they produce is a function of angle of attack, and there is a point in that function where the generated lift is zero. However, wings (and indeed all parts) have such a function, and generate lift in the right conditions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour difficulty is that the 10 m heat shield produces a tremendous amount of drag right at the nose of the craft. This moves the centre of pressure forward, and once it\u0027s forward of the centre of mass, your craft will want to flip.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two ways you can attempt to address this problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDesign your craft to have the centre of mass as close to the heat shield as possible.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd a stabiliser. It doesn\u0027t necessarily need to be that big, but it needs to have a long lever arm. Imagine a long, thin rail going waaaay back, with a couple of tailfin parts on it.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo without seeing a picture of your craft, I think the problem isn\u0027t that the Big-S wings are producing lift; it\u0027s that your stabiliser isn\u0027t far enough back -- you describe your craft as \u0022short and fat.\u0022 If the Big-S wings are there only for stability, I think you would do better with less mass by replacing them with a detachable, light, but long tail, with much smaller stabilisers at the tip. If your heatshield is on the nose and the craft enters nose-first, you would detach the tail after you\u0027re through the dangerous part of entry; the drag from the heat shield will cause the craft to flip into tail first orientation. Then you can detach the heat shield, causing your craft to fall away from it. And once you\u0027re at a safe distance from it, deploy parachutes and float down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BenKerman","CreatedById":201843,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-28T17:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried posting a picture of my ship to imgur, here is a link:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/6vM4Inn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/6vM4Inn\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022_dfyqFgjCiI1OA-rBJqynOJi5V3-AonJmKm1VWh0\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002259.75\u0022 height=\u0022673\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_dfyqFgjCiI1OA-rBJqynOJi5V3-AonJmKm1VWh0gz9DKChCj651IJGR6yDxhVUvovxVTcH-lAsJZB5I8YVS-5hwuITDSp7saT27EbyNMqJxEvUag5GBNJKLZoFCtclbUA=w1280\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-28T17:12:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2021 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by BenKerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-02T19:42:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002255.58\u0022 height=\u0022667\u0022 style=\u0022width:430px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u00226vM4Inn.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/6vM4Inn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would\u00A0have thought that craft would be stable on reentry.\u00A0 The heavy fuel is near the heat shield, and those big wings would tend to swing downwind as you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nav-ball is pointing retrograde (probably because the command pod will be pointed forward for the return journey) .\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t know that you are flying backwards, so won\u0027t know to tilt the elevons appropriately.\u00A0 So \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E would be commanding those big elevons in the wrong direction, and that might be enough to flip in Eve\u0027s atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf those elevons are always used when flying backwards (relative to the command pod) you can reverse their actuation by setting a negative \u0027Authority Limiter\u0027 in their right-click menus.\u00A0 Or, you can set \u0027Control Point:\u00A0reversed\u0027 on the command pod on the way down, if you remember to restore that setting before going back up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
