View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the life of me I can\u0027t get this thing to fly reliably. This small SSTO was inspired and developed from Narcosis\u0027s Jian SSTO, using a Sabre engine instead of the Turbojet. While Narcosis\u0027s flies in a very stable and easy manner, my version has been nothing but trouble as long as it\u0027s near the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary issue at hand is the fact that it wobbles uncontrollably once its speed exceeds 20 meters per second. If I pull up hard and cross my fingers, perhaps I can get it off the ground, in which case the only safe way to fly it is straight upwards until it\u0027s 10km high and going faster than 250m/s (and even before them, it\u0027s still pretty wobbly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m completely out of ideas on how to fix it. I\u0027ve tried many different landing gear configurations and shifting the center of mass around as much as I could. There are a couple of things which I remained invariant about, like trying to keep the landing gear within the fuselage when retracted, and trying to conceal the RCS tank by more than half, but I can\u0027t get this thing to drive at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-01T18:49:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2014 06:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T00:54:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDouble check to see if the wheels are not toed in or out, and do the SHIFT \u002B orientation keys to get them as close to straight up and down as possible.

You\u0027ll want them straight up and down or else your craft will fishtail wildly. The rapier engine has a bit more vectoring which makes the problem a bit worse. Use SHIFT\u002BWASDQE as GDJ pointed out above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It looks like you might have angled your wings down in the front (hard for me to tell in the picture). I\u0027m not talking about the dihedral, but you have negative AoA on your wings. That will cause downforce as you accelerate, which will make the bending on the angled landing gear worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your CoL is also below your CoM. And I suspect it\u0027s even worse than it looks because of the landing gear causing the CoM to be lower. This will cause your plane to be a bit unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There is a bug with stock aerodynamics and flight control surfaces (not wings). As AoA increases, lift from the flight control surfaces continues to increase. For your design, this will cause your aircraft to pitch down which is okay, but might be contributing to your wobbly nature because you\u0027re using an angled twin-V tail design. Try disabling the pitch and roll axes for the V-tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Also, the landing gear causes the CoM marker in the SPH to lie. Although landing gear has mass in the SPH, it is considered massless in flight by the physics engine. Remove your landing gear and tweak your CoM/CoL markers. It\u0027s probably okay, but it\u0027s hard to tell from the pictures. If it\u0027s too far forward then it will cause problems when you try to pitch up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It also looks like you could remove the I-beams. The only thing I see attached to them is the monopro tank, but you could attach that to the underside of your probe core. Your landing gear is probably better attached to the body. That\u0027s mostly personal opinion so if you want the I-beam there then have at it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-01T01:29:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2014 01:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"generalguy26","CreatedById":83881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T01:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:14px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E[deleted]\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-21T23:58:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2023 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by generalguy26\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T01:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022generalguy26\u0022 data-cite=\u0022generalguy26\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe I-beams were there to show the plane expanded piece-by-piece.
