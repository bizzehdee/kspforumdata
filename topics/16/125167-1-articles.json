Anyway, I don\u0027t know how to update the game without downloading a fresh copy from the KSP store;.;. I could use some help, as i\u0027d really like to make seaplanes and use the tiny jet engines, as well as keep my current ships and saves. Oh and as long as I\u0027m here, I know how to make a backup of KSP but not how to use it. Any help on either problem would be appreciated(but the first one is more urgent).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T01:58:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis *is* how one gets an update from the store. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E They\u0027ve had some trouble with the patchers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T02:01:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have the store version, the best approach is to redownload it entirely, and unzip in the desired directory.
