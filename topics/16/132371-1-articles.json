alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Suggestion: Replace each pair of 2-ton tanks with a single 4-tonner.\u00A0 It\u0027ll reduce your part count by a lot, and significantly reduce wobble as well.\u00A0 Will also help a bit with CoM issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFair \u0027nuff.\u00A0 You could still mount all six of the radial boosters to the central core for greater structural strength.\u00A0 Also, that would allow you to stage them off in three pairs rather than as two sets of three, which should eke out a bit of extra dV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you can set up the fuel ducts to help with (though not completely solve) the top-down drainage issue for better stability during ascent.\u00A0 If stack A is draining into stack B, set up the duct so that it\u0027s hooked from the top of stack A to the top of stack B.\u00A0 That way, stack B will be pulling fuel from the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebottom\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of stack A, which helps keep CoM high.\u00A0 It also ensures that stack B will use zero of its own fuel until stack A is completely empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple of ways to tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, just eyeballing the separation.\u00A0 The decouplers have a bit of \u0022thickness\u0022 to them, so if the outer thing is on the decoupler rather than being directly attached to the inner thing, there should be about 30 centimeters \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(maybe? never measured it)\u003C/span\u003E of clearance between them.\u00A0 In your screenshot above, it looks like your outer boosters are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etouching\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the inner ones, snugged right up against them, which is the warning sign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, try mousing over the decoupler.\u00A0 In the VAB (or SPH), whenever you mouse over a part, it highlights green, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand so do all of its child parts\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 So, if the radial booster is attached to the decoupler (i.e. is a child of it), then when you mouse over the decoupler, both it and the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eentire radial booster\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E should highlight in green.\u00A0 On the other hand, if \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eonly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the decoupler highlights when you mouse over it, then it means nothing\u0027s attached to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t notice that new fuel tank--it looks small and I didn\u0027t realize it was actually big.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hooked up the fuel about as you say (I wasn\u0027t quite at the top in either case, I didn\u0027t realize it mattered) and it drained the outer ones faster than the inner but both lowered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see what you mean about the hover once I try it.\u00A0 I\u0027ve got some color vision issues, while I can see the highlighting it\u0027s pretty subtle to me and I wouldn\u0027t have thought to call it \u0022green\u0022.\u00A0 Unfortunately, those decouplers are well buried, it\u0027s hard to pick them out.\u00A0 The game really needs a better means of building stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Loren Pechtel","CreatedById":157006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T05:12:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

It\u0027s true that the command pod is limited to holding only one copy of any given science result, but that\u0027s generally not a practical limitation because you don\u0027t get much benefit from having multiple copies anyway.\u00A0 As long as each science result is a different one, there\u0027s no upper limit to how many science results you can stuff into a command pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a purpose of this trip was to gather new science from Minmus, and you didn\u0027t already have those Minmus results on your ship, you should be able to stuff \u0027em in there with no problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s the issue you\u0027re having there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure but when I re-entered the capsule I was told I had to dump the experiment and nothing was learned.\u00A0 Was my orbit too high for biome-specific EVA reports, perhaps?\u00A0 Anyway, I unlocked a lot of stuff and I\u0027ll go back with a hopper to get the surface data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
