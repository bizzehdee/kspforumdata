I think I have the design of the craft strapped down, but I haven\u0027t a good landing spot yet. I would rather not come down on an ocean (even though my design is surprisingly stable on water) due to my aim of collecting science. I am going to try and attach a rover/lab to the ship, if possible so I can trek to another Biome for max science. \n\nI am using the Biome map from the Biome mod (I still use 0.24.2) so any landing sites would need to be based on that. Any large flat sites that I could reasonably target even if I am 10km off target are recommended.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T09:03:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 09:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ron1n1**"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T08:26:20Z","Content":"Kerbal scientific society has prepared a set of detailed surface maps for each body in the Kerbol system:\n\n[http://www.kerbalmaps.com/](http://www.kerbalmaps.com/)\n\nI hope you\u0027ll find your answer there ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"ron1n1","CreatedById":102346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T09:03:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Kerbal scientific society has prepared a set of detailed surface maps for each body in the Kerbol system:\n\u003E [http://www.kerbalmaps.com/](http://www.kerbalmaps.com/)\n\u003E \n\u003E I hope you\u0027ll find your answer there ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nPerfect...exactly what I need...thanks!!"}]}
