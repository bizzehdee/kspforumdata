I have another craft similar to the one posted above,\u00A0with the rear landing gear placed on the wings, and it goes in a fairly straight line down the runway EVEN WITHOUT the steerable front landing gear this \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E has. Are the wings bending and causing the rear landing gear to steer the ship off course?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSidenote, I like to see the game have a large landing gear variant that has the capability to steer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-27T00:23:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2019 12:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by fireblade274\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-27T02:12:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t load your craft, because it has a modded part and I\u0027m running stock.

KSP has a bug where mirror symmetry gives parts slightly unsymmetric stiffness, which can manifest as veering to the side on takeoff or landing, and the way to combat it is by attaching your gear as rigidly as possible to the center fuselage. Some even cheat wing gear by attaching to the fuselage and shifting them outward with the offset tool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, avoid wing gear like the plague. Any additional joints between the center and the gear make the problem worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is your problem, you\u2019ll also see behavior\u00A0like unwanted roll occurring\u00A0during hard pitch-ups.
