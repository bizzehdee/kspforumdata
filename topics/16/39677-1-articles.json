I made a 3 point geostationary network based on Scott Manley\u0027s tutorial but I have a kethane mining operation on the far side of the Mun that needs communications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve thought of two ideas for this. I could send up two satellites, one to lead the Mun and one to trail it, on the same orbit as the Mun but outside its sphere of influence. Hopefully they would reach far enough around to the Mun base. I tried this but as one of my satellites was coming in it suddenly got an encounter that wasn\u0027t predicted by the node system which threw me off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise I could try and do a 3-point system around the Mun. Not geostationary but hopefully they\u0027d have enough coverage. But I don\u0027t know the mathematics of what orbit to put my deployment vessel into to space the satellites evenly. If I choose an orbit of 2000 km for my satellites around the moon, what periapsis would I need for an orbit to have the same apoapsis (2000 km) but 2/3 or 5/6 the period?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-28T19:06:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2013 07:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SnappingTurtle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T17:50:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOrbital period is proportional to a^(3/2), where a is the semi-major axis. A circular orbit at 2000 km would have a semi-major axis of 2200 km (since the Mun\u0027s radius is 200 km), so to get a period of 2/3 the circular period, you want the semi-major axis to be 2200 * (2/3)^(2/3), or 1679 km.
