I\u0027ve read the wiki and several threads and I just don\u0027t quite get what happens to the science points. For instance, if I have an experiment worth 100 sci-points, and it\u0027s worth nothing to be processed in the lab, but I\u0027ll get 25% by transmitting, I expect that when I transmit I\u0027d see my science balance go up by 25 points. But that doesn\u0027t seem to happen, so I\u0027m clearly misunderstanding how to use it properly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-15T22:04:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect that you are looking at the wrong number, to see how many science points that an experiment is worth?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022worth\u0022 of an experiment is \u0022how much science would you get if you brought the experiment back to kerbin and landed/recovered it\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if an experiment is worth zero to process in a lab, that means you\u0027ve already seen that experiment before, in that\u00A0lab.
