different biomes? \u00A0Is it possible to do this in orbit or not because 70k is considered high above the planet or a single biome?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat depends on the experiment.\u00A0 Here\u0027s the essential idea of how science works:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, experiments work in specific \u0027situations\u0027.\u00A0 There are a number of these:\u00A0 landed, splashed, flying low, flying high, space low, and space high.\u00A0 Some experiments work in all of these situations, but some experiments only work in a few situations.\u00A0 On top of that, any, all, or none of these can be biome-specific, meaning that instead of a global result for the whole planet, you can get specific results for each biome.\u00A0 For example, the seismic accelerometer only works when \u0027landed\u0027--it won\u0027t let you take a report otherwise--but it gives different reports for every biome.\u00A0 The infrared telescope only works when in space high, and it\u0027s global, so it only takes one result total for each planet.\u00A0 You can take EVA reports for each biome in space low but only one for all of Kerbin in space high.\u00A0 Also, it\u0027s not necessary to enter orbit:\u00A0\u00A0so long as the situation is correct, you can get the results, even on a suborbital hop where you clear the atmosphere for only ten seconds, or a hyperbolic flyby where you dip low enough to get the low space science and then then head back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, not every world has all of these situations.\u00A0 \u0027Flying\u0027 requires an atmosphere; \u0027splashed\u0027 requires an ocean (that may or may not have water in it; it just needs to be liquid), and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, the altitude transitions for these situations vary with the location.\u00A0 For Kerbin, \u0027flying low\u0027 changes to \u0027flying high\u0027 at 18,000 metres; \u0027flying high\u0027 changes to \u0027space low\u0027 at the edge of the atmosphere (70,000 metres), and \u0027space low\u0027 changes to \u0027space high\u0027 at 250,000 metres.\u00A0 You can\u0027t get flying science when you\u0027re in space, for example, so that\u0027s a limit, but all that means is that there\u0027s a different range of experiments to do.\u00A0 Eventually, you leave Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, so I suppose that\u0027s the absolute maximum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022

pass thru multiple choice biomes. \u00A0So, big most important question is how do I prepare my orbiter to gather science while in orbit around the mun? \u00A0What I still have trouble with is the

gather the data. \u00A0But could someone please be specific on the exact steps and order? \u00A0I always seem to get errors indicating I have not done \u00A0something in the correct order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no preferred order of experiments; the only thing to be really concerned about is that when you take crew reports, you have to gather the data from the pod, as well.\u00A0\u00A0I\u0027m probably telling you something you already know, but the steps are:\u00A0 get\u00A0out of the capsule, right-click\u00A0on it (or the experiment), select\u00A0\u0027Take Data\u0027, right-click on the capsule\u00A0and select\u00A0\u0027Store Data\u0027, and then get\u00A0back in for the next report.\u00A0 You may also choose to just board the capsule after taking the data, which will also store the data in the correct place.\u00A0 Otherwise, the most recent report is stored in the--we\u0027ll call it the \u003Cem\u003Eactive data slot\u003C/em\u003E--and keeps a new one from being added without overwriting the active one.\u00A0 You have to pull the data from the active slot and put it into inactive storage in order to make room for a new report.\u00A0 As to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E you have to get out of the capsule to do this, I have no idea.\u00A0 If you continue to get errors such as duplicate report errors, that only means that you\u0027ve already visited that biome.\u00A0 Alternatively, it means that you\u0027ve got a global experiment and can only take one for that situation, which is the same problem but with fewer total reports.\u00A0 Temperature, for example, is global unless you\u0027re landed,\u00A0splashed, or flying low (two of these are not an issue at the Mun--I\u0027ll let you guess which ones).\u00A0 The same is true of crew reports.\u00A0 Pressure is global except on the surface--it doesn\u0027t do biome-specific science\u00A0even\u00A0flying low.\u00A0 In fact, the only experiments that are biome-specific in space low are EVA reports and gravity scans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can tell whether an experiment is biome-specific in any situation by looking at the experiment result.\u00A0 If it says, for example, \u0027Temperature while Landed at Mun\u0027s Poles\u0027, then the biome name (Poles) tells you that it gets results by the biome.\u00A0 Obviously, \u0027landed\u0027 tells you the situation.\u00A0 If it says, instead, \u0027Temperature while In Space Near the Mun\u0027, then that\u0027s a global experiment (\u0027space near\u0027 is the same as \u0027space low\u0027).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, to properly answer your question, preparing your orbiter is a matter of putting the experiments you want on it.\u00A0 I\u0027d recommend using a service bay to keep them out of the wind on the way up, but that doesn\u0027t help you get science except indirectly.\u00A0 However, assuming that you\u0027ve already gotten Kerbin\u0027s low and high space temperature and pressure results, then on the way down to the Mun with a thermometer and barometer, you\u0027ll get four experiments in high space:\u00A0 temperature, pressure, EVA report, and crew report.\u00A0 All of those experiments are global in high space.\u00A0 The change from high to low occurs at 60 km at the Mun, so 15 km is definitely close enough.\u00A0 There, temperature, pressure, and crew reports are all global, so you\u0027ll only get one each, which means that in all honesty, getting the most science entails hanging off the ladder and taking EVA reports in each new biome (and remembering to put the reports away to make room for new ones).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, preparing your vessel is a matter of\u00A0knowing what you intend to do with it.\u00A0 Don\u0027t put a telescope on your lander; it only works in orbit.\u00A0 Don\u0027t put seismometers on your orbiter; they only work when landed.\u00A0 Take a barometer (surprise!) but not an atmospheric analysis unit, unless you\u0027re both visiting a world with an atmosphere and intent\u00A0on flying there (Jool and Eve can be tricky).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d recommend a polar orbit in order to get all possible biomes, but if you want any more science, then you\u0027ll need to land (or take different experiments).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022

the planet or mun rotating under the orbiting command module so that with enough orbits I could conceivably pass over every biome on the mun? \u00A0Not sure I understand this part of an orbit. \u00A0I am picturing the path like the ISS makes over earth, where each subsequent orbit is shifted east (or is it west?) of the prior pass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said above, use a polar orbit.\u00A0 When you launch and turn east, you end up in what\u0027s called an\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eequatorial\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eorbit\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0(so named because it\u0027s above the equator).\u00A0 If you were to turn north instead, you\u0027d end up in a \u003Cem\u003Epolar orbit,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0so named because it goes over the poles.\u00A0 The ISS is an intermediate case; but the general term for all orbits that are not equatorial is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Einclined orbit\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Much like a ramp has a tilted surface that is called an\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eincline\u003C/em\u003E, an\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Einclined orbit\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is tilted with respect to the equatorial plane.\u00A0 Something of which to be cautious is that the Mun, being tidally locked to Kerbin, has an extremely slow rotation period of nearly six and one-half days, so it will take a while for the Mun to rotate under your vessel.\u00A0 Forty-five degrees of inclination will give access to most biomes in less time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo set up a polar orbit, the most straightforward way is to burn to transfer to the Mun as usual, but as soon as you cross into the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence, set up a node for an immediate normal burn (\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:normal:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

want to burn as soon as possible after entering the sphere.\u00A0 However, you won\u0027t get the most up-to-date orbit information until\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0you enter the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence, so don\u0027t set up the burn until after you\u0027ve crossed over, either.\u00A0 Add enough normal burn to tilt the orbit as much as you like (or put it over the pole if you want to try for a polar orbit), add enough prograde or retrograde so that your periapsis is out of the ground and at the altitude you want (15 km), and then burn to capture when you get there as usual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022

Any other experiments will only give you one reading for the whole planet/moon while in the region considered \u0022low in space.\u0022 You can get another reading for \u0022high in space\u0022 which starts at different altitudes for different worlds.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy recommendation is to make sure to have an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experiment_Storage_Unit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EExperiment Storage Unit\u003C/a\u003E on your craft and bind it to an action group.

This also makes it much easier to time warp around the planet without your Kerbal floating away. You can\u0027t assign the EVA report to an action group so you should probably right click on the Kerbal in the command seat and pin their action window open so you\u0027ll have easy access to it. Now you can much more quickly scoop up science in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving said all of this, it\u0027s likely that you are in an early stage of your career before you have access to either the command seat or the gravity detector. If that\u0027s the case then you\u0027ll have to content yourself with getting out on EVA every time you want a biome report. The experiment container still comes early enough in career that you should plan on unlocking it for science gathering missions. Many people opt for a strategy of building a lightweight \u0022hopper\u0022 than can land on the low gravity moon Minmus and hop around to its different biomes on the surface to gather a boat load of science fairly quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you aren\u0027t opposed to using mods, there are a few different ones that help you run science experiments and notify you of new biomes you are entering.

Finances, Science, and Public Relations Departments are interested in Funds, Science, and Reputation, respectively.\u00A0 They each have two long-term strategies that turn the other two currencies into the one that they\u0027re interested in.\u00A0 There is a required minimum Reputation and a\u00A0set-up cost, so you have to have some of what you\u0027re converting to begin, and the conversion amount varies depending on how much you choose to commit (which is also limited by how much you\u0027ve upgraded the Administration Building), but it can go as high as 100%, meaning that you can conceivably trade all of your gains in one thing for another.\u00A0 This makes sense in the late game when you\u0027ve researched the entire tech tree and no longer have a use for all of those Science points you keep collecting, for example, but you may want to have a few million Funds to pay for your new mega-rocket that uses all of those new parts that you just finished unlocking.\u00A0 It\u0027s also useful if you keep killing your Kerbals and want a\u00A0balm for the strikes against your Reputation, though I\u0027ve found that bad Reputation is actually the easiest obstacle to overcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinances:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFundraising Campaign:\u00A0 Trades Reputation for Funds\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPatents Licensing:\u00A0 Trades Science for Funds\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nScience:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nUnpaid Research Program:\u00A0 Trades Reputation for Science\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOutsourced R\u0026amp;D:\u00A0 Trades Funds for Science\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPublic Relations:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAppreciation Campaign:\u00A0 Trades Funds for Reputation\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOpen-Source Research Program:\u00A0 Trades Science for Reputation\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two more long-term strategies (both from the Operations Department) that change the balance of launching and recovery:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAggressive Negotiations:\u00A0 Trades some Reputation for lower costs on launches, building repairs and upgrades, and unlocking technologies in the R\u0026amp;D building (\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the nodes which require Science, but the individual parts which require Funds).\u00A0 This is applied for each discount, meaning that there\u0027s a Reputation cost for every new launch, every\u00A0new technology you research, and so on.\u00A0 On the other hand, the discount is a percentage of the Funds cost (up to \u003Cem\u003Ethirty\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0(Wow!) percent for launches) and the Reputation cost is limited to six (that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Esix Reputation Points\u003C/em\u003E, not six percent), so if you\u0027re in the habit of buying expensive rockets or you want to unlock the expensive third-tier upgrades (or you need to fix the third-tier \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E since you just crashed the expensive rocket into it), this is potentially a lot of money saved for a comparatively minor strike on Reputation.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRecovery Transponder Fitting:\u00A0 Trades the maximum recovery value for a higher minimum.\u00A0 This is the only Funds-for-Funds strategy; it mainly is useful if you tend to drop your rockets on the other side of Kerbin.\u00A0 If you land near \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, use a lot of disposable probes, or like to keep your vessels in the sky for many multiple missions, then this strategy is silly.\u00A0 If you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to land on the other side of the planet and get 25% recovery at the risk of only getting 88% when you\u0027re next to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, or if you just have too much money and need to invent nonsensical ways to spend it, then this strategy is for you.\u00A0 It may have a use in the early game when you may not be able to land planes in one piece or you don\u0027t have good landing control, but as soon as the value of the rocket begins to make this worthwhile, you\u0027ve got both the skill and the technology to do better on your own.\u00A0 Besides, if you want nonsensical ways to spend money, why not do something spectacular, such as launching a rocket full of Xenon tanks into the sun?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, there are two immediate-return strategies, one in the Science Department and one in the Public Relations Department, that respectively trade some amount of your Science and your Reputation for Funds right away:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nResearch Rights Sell-Out:\u00A0 Sells Science (up to 100% of it) for Funds\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBail-Out Grant:\u00A0 Sells Reputation (again, up to 100% of it) for Funds\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThese strategies appear to be intended for those who manage, either through bad luck or bad management, to bankrupt their space program and have no other way to make money (because, for example, they don\u0027t have enough to pay for the rocket that can complete the contract to get more money--Rockomax does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E, apparently, accept credit).\u00A0 Granted that people in this situation must also have managed to do a few experiments or else remain in the public\u0027s good graces, so if you\u0027re completely out of Reputation, Science,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Funds, you\u0027re also out of luck.\u00A0 The other use of these that I can think of is that, for example, let\u0027s say that you\u0027ve completed the tech tree and set up Patents Licensing for 100%.\u00A0 There\u0027s a Science set-up cost, but after that, there is still a lot of Science left over; Patents Licensing only works on new incoming Science, not what you already have.\u00A0 The Sell-Out in this case gives you useful money from the Science you still have left over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong-term, the strategies you\u0027ve activated will both lower your reputation, so it will be more important for you not to fail contracts or to kill Kerbals.\u00A0 One will help your Funds by giving you cheaper launches and facility upgrades, and the other will give you Science for everything you do well (new World\u0027s Firsts and completing contracts mostly).\u00A0 However, the amount of Reputation loss is balanced by a few things.\u00A0 One of these is that Reputation is actually fairly easy to get, provided you have the standard difficulty settings for your game.\u00A0 Another is that Reputation, unlike Science or Funds, is not strictly additive.\u00A0 By that I mean to say that when a contract promises a certain amount of Science or Funds, it pays that amount and your totals increase.\u00A0 Reputation, on the other hand, is limited to 1000, so as you get closer to that value, contracts pay out less of it.\u00A0 Lowering your Reputation with strategies, oddly enough, actually opens the way for you to get more of it from each contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium
