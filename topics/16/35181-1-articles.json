It\u0027s just the target which is why RCS on the LM doesn\u0027t work. It\u0027s not there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, the , Command Module has RCS, but no ASAS. I\u0027m pretty sure the scenario was around in v0.18, where the RCS translation was broken in 18.1, so the translation controls on the CM are a little off the COM, which induces the undesired pitch \u0026amp; yaw. And because there is no ASAS, there\u0027s nothing to try and maintain the heading during translation operations. So switching to docking mode does nothing to help maintain attitude, it only remaps the controls, because there\u0027s no ASAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the upshot is, the Mun Orbital Docking scenario is docking in hard mode, so I\u0027d recommend staying in staging mode, and using the combination of both keysets (IJKL) for translation, and (ASWD) for fixing you Yaw/Pitch whenever you try to translate. Accomplish this despite the broken RCS, and you\u0027ll be golden for any other docking operation ever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
