I\u0027ve had moderate success, with an eve/gilly Manned mission that has returned home and a duna/Ike mission that is on its way back, as well as a mission to Jool with Landers for every moon. However, my contracts don\u0027t seem to be updating, specifically the world\u0027s first contracts. I only had explore eve for the longest time, \u00A0and now that I finally finished that one I got an explore gilly. Does this mean you have to complete each body before it gives you new ones?
