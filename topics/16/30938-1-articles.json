I take some parts and test them. Mostly, it goes terribly wrong and I have to adjust the parts or exchange them many times, before the launch works.

Ships \u0022having\u0022 delta-v: You\u0027re correct; \u0022delta-v\u0022 is basically short for \u0022change in velocity.\u0022 Rockets work by accelerating a volume of propellant out an opening at one end; because of Newton\u0027s Third Law of Motion, this exerts an equivalent force on the rocket in the opposite direction. The more efficient your engine is, the faster it can get the propellant moving, and thus the more your rocket will accelerate for every bit of fuel it uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine for a moment a rocket standing still in a featureless volume of space with no other forces acting upon it. Let\u0027s say that, for instance, this particular rocket has a delta-v rating of 1000 m/s. What that means is, if we burn all of it\u0027s fuel in one continuous burn, by the end of that burn the rocket will be moving in a straight line at a velocity of 1000 m/s. If we only burn half of that fuel, it\u0027ll be moving at 500 m/s; if we then turn it around and burn the other half of that fuel against our direction of travel, the rocket will come to a standstill again. In short, a rocket\u0027s \u0022delta-v\u0022 represents how much you can change that rocket\u0027s velocity with a given fuel load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u0022How do I know if my ship will even launch?\u0022: That\u0027s actually governed by another number entirely, known as your \u0022thrust-to-weight ratio.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery rocket engine has a certain maximum thrust rating (though I think the game calls it \u0022Power\u0022 in the VAB parts listings, which isn\u0027t an entirely accurate term). Again, a rocket engine exerts this thrust as a force pushing the rocket upward. At the same time, gravity exerts a force trying to pull your rocket downward (\u0022weight\u0022). The way to find your rocket\u0027s weight on the launchpad is to take its mass, then multiply by 9.8 m/s^2 (the value for surface gravity on Kerbin, identical to that for Earth) to find the total force exerted by gravity, then divide that into the total force exerted by your active engine\u0027s thrust. If that number is less than 1, then you are not going into space today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Natural logarithms: If you take a number and raise it to a power with an exponent, you get a second number. Relative to that second number, the exponent is the logarithm, and the first number is the base. For example, the logarithm of 1000 using 10 as the base is 3, since 10^3 = 1000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the \u003Cem\u003Enatural logarithm\u003C/em\u003E of a given number uses a very special number called \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28number%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ee\u003C/em\u003E (or Euler\u0027s number)\u003C/a\u003E as its base.

When you want to go to a 100km Kerbin orbit you need about 4700 m/s (according to the wiki).

Together, they almost achieve 4700 m/s. But only by using two stages. Is this profitable? If yes, what is a good altitude to start the next stage? I guess, it should be the edge of the atmosphere? Or would it be okay to reach orbit with one stage (that has a delta-v of about 4700 m/s) as well?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. But how does this number (4700 m/s) come about? Does this have sth. to do with the orbital velocity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. What is the context of the Thrust-Weight-Ratio and delta-v? I might have a clue.

If the ship has a delta-v of e.g. 7600 m/s but just a TWR of 0.5 it won\u0027t start. The explanation might be that you need a big acceleration to escape Kerbin. If you have small engines, they \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E reach 7600 m/s.

Does it mean, the ship accelerates faster than with a value of 1?

Well, all in all it doesn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t matter too much how many stages you need (although using multiple stages could be a little bit more efficient if you set it up right) ... what matters is that the dV (if calculated right) is \u0026gt;= the dV needed ... what matters more with regards to the dV needed to get into Kerbins 100km Orbit is, how you perform your gravity turns ... peforming the right turns at the right altitudes can indeed make a difference between needing 4500 dV to get to the 100k orbit, or needing 5000\u002B (something that btw. is dependant on the individual rocket ... many people have taken up the standard practice of taken gravity turns at 10, 20 and 30km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You already cited the formula with which dV is calculated.

It determines how much much more than its own weight the engine can lift (or, if calculated for a rocket/stage ... how much more than the rocket weight the engines of this stage can lift) ... so, if you have a TWR of 1.0, your rocket engines might (if your rocket currently is in air and facing upwards) just be able to keep your rocket at the same height, but not be able to ligft it up ... if it is below 1, then it might even just be able to slow the fall of the rocket, if your rocket currently is floating in the air and facing upwards. Therefore you should always try to have a TWR \u0026gt; 1.0 for your ascent stages (at least those stages that are active below ~60km ... in later stages you try to propel your rocket sideways -\u0026gt; TWR doesn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t play too much of a role in those stages ... for the interplanetary stages the role of TWR becomes rather insignificant (at least if you don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t mind the time needed to have your engines active to reach a certain speed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

If we reduce the overall mass while keeping the same engines, our rocket will accelerate faster because it\u0027s pushing a smaller mass with the same amount of force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise, the delta-v potential of a rocket is proportional to the propellant fraction and the efficiency of the engines used. If we reduce the size of the payload while keeping the same engines and propellant load, we increase the delta-v, because a smaller overall mass means our rocket has less momentum to overcome in order to reach a given velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn light of both of those facts, we can come to the conclusion that ultimately, the best rocket for a given mission is the lightest rocket that can accomplish that mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, it might help to think of the delta-v equation in terms of mass management. A rocket needs propellant in order to move its payload, but until that propellant is burned, it\u0027s just \u0022dead weight\u0022 that needs to be carried along, and thus you need more propellant to boost both the payload and the propellant you already have... and those costs add up quickly. This is why SSTO craft capable of carrying any signficant payload are so difficult to build, and why staging is so popular for many launches -- dropping unneeded mass at strategic points allows you to change how the equation is calculated in midflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Yes, the delta-v requirement for reaching a stable orbit around Kerbin is the same, assuming an ideal flight path. If you have a rocket that\u0027s capable of lifting you off Kerbin\u0027s surface and getting up to that delta-v target, it\u0027ll get you there regardless of how big the rocket itself is or how many engines it has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it in the same way you think of money.

In one hand you are holding one end of a spring which is attached to an old piling jutting out of the ice. Consider it a fixed point. If you are at rest and the spring is totally unstretched then there is no energy present in this system. Now say you start skating. Since you are still holding the spring you are rotating about the post (the spring doesn\u0027t tangle up, its on free rotating bearing or something...its not a perfect analogy). As you skate faster and faster what do you expect to happen? Your radius of rotation will increase won\u0027t it? In this case energy \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E present in the system, in the form of the kinetic energy of you the iceskater, and of the potential energy of the spring. Again not a perfect analogy, gravity isn\u0027t quite like a spring, gravitational force decreases with distance, whereas spring force increases with distance. But, it turns out that since energy is conserved (assuming no friction:)) the energy of the total system remains constant and we get an equation called the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Evis-viva equation\u003C/a\u003E we we take the sum of the kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy to get the total energy of the system (if you multiply all of the terms of each side of the vis-viva equation by m for mass, after a little bit of algebra it becomes the conservation of energy equation). If you happen to know what the radius of your orbit is and the gravitational parameter mu for the plant you are orbiting, you can use the vis-viva equation to calculate your orbital velocity. If you recalculate with a different r, and compare the different values of v you have your delta-v... mind you this is your total delta-v, not the delta-v required for say a Hohmann transfer orbit.

Solved for acceleration, a = F/m.

The actual \u003Cem\u003Eaverage\u003C/em\u003E acceleration for the whole burn is probably going to be the mean between the initial and final maximum values for that one stage -- and calculating each stage individually by hand is a long, arduous, repetitive, and potentially maddening affair, the sort of tedium that people who really want to work it out tend to create spreadsheets for so that they can just plug in the values that they want. Plugging in a flat value of 20 m/s^2 -- a little over 2g -- can give you a very rough idea of what the ideal ascent delta-v should look like, though.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAccording to the Atomic Rockets page, you can\u0027t simply calculate the \u003Cstrong\u003Eatmospheric drag\u003C/strong\u003E.
