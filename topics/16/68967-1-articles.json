What seems to be the consensus on them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on what little I\u0027ve played yet, it looks like\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KR-L2 (the big one with only one nozzle) is better that the Skippers and Mainsails. It\u0027s hard to use in a lander as landing legs radially attached to a fuel tank on top won\u0027t pass the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe S3 KS-25x4 overheats quickly, has more thrust than the KR-L2 but looks like it\u0027s less efficient. Is it better as a first stage due the higher thrust meaning it will get through the thicker parts of the atmosphere faster? It can be used as a lander engine because landing legs can be radially attached to it. But, you can\u0027t put anything below it, so the lander would have to be upside down and the legs don\u0027t graphically attach properly, so they look silly. Also less efficiency means the Poodle is still better for airless moons?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not exactly sure KR-1x2 is useful. Seems worse than the 25x4 and unless I\u0027m missing something, the only advantage is a very slight reduction in part count. Maybe if, for some reason, someone wants to avoid using the new extra large parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new SRB seem cool. In an asparagus configuration the first pair of engines might exhaust their fuel before the rockets do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is there a mod that can show their deltaV? mechjeb and KER don\u0027t seem to work properly with these new engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, am I right in these appreciations or do you guys have better ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T03:55:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using KER, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72062-Test-of-new-KER-deltaV-simulation-code-0-23-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egrab the updated Padishar .dll\u0027s for it\u003C/a\u003E, they work well with 23.5 (there was even an update today for parts with the physics significance flag I think)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines seem fine, if quite a bit out of line with traditional \u0027stock\u0027 balances.

(IOW: use an LFB and 2 orange tanks, rather than 3 Skippers with orange tanks and fuel crossfeed. And don\u0027t bother with the Mainsail.) None of the engines are geared up for landing, though I suppose you can attempt that. The size 3 tanks are slightly worse than their size 2 counterparts (mass ratios of 8.2 instead of 9), which means that sticking an S3-7200 on a Skipper or S3-14400 on a Mainsail is pointless. The KS-25x2 has a slightly higher effective TWR than the quad version, and can more easily use the size 2 tanks. It also acts as a drop-in replacement for any mainsails. The KS-25s clones and KR-2L have a breakeven Isp at 1/3 atm (~5.5 km).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T16:34:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAside from balance issues, I really, really wish we\u0027d been given individual engines and adaptors instead of premade clusters.
