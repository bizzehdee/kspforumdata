I need advice on how to make an SSTO more stable during the reentry. To be more specific I am now having a bit of issue with one SSTO that is capable of taking one orange tank and one rockomax tank at the same time. No issues in control all the way to orbit and in space. However I am strugling to keep it under control on the way down. Prograde I cannot go or the pilot cabin will explode and if I raise the nose to 40-45deg ( that seems to keep heat under control) the plane would uncotrlably flip and go retrograde. No it is not COM/COL issue the COL is back of COM. It might help if I say that on the way down the COM is close to COL unlike when I am going to orbit then the COM is much more forward. Would more forward COM posiotion help in reentry and allow me to keep 40-45deg? How about more SAS torque and RCS since I guess the air up there is too\u00A0thin\u00A0for control surfaces?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-31T09:12:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the two are close, then pitching up too much can indeed cause you to lose control.\u00A0Having the CoM even further forward should help you maintain control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, have an even shallower re-entry so that you don\u0027t need such a large amount of pitch to avoid overheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-31T11:04:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, I would double check your centre of gravity when unloaded - no cargo and fuel - to see if your plane is just unstable, period. \u00A0 \u00A0You should be able to hold 30 degree angle of attack without flipping, \u00A0in fact my spaceplanes have trouble holding the nose that far off prograde due to excessive stability. \u00A0 You can see that the layout avoids large shifts in CG\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002237km%20mach%205.5_zpsq46n2bs3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/Penta%20Project/37km%20mach%205.5_zpsq46n2bs3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229_zpsxv0sahhd.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/shakedown%20flt/9_zpsxv0sahhd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221_zpsdgfhttcc.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/shakedown%20flt/1_zpsdgfhttcc.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nHeavy nuke engines either side of the CG\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOne cargo bay in front of CG, one behind it\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOne engine at rear of fuselage, balanced by the weight of the cockpit\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe fuel is stored in the wings, in other words, the exact place where the lift is generated, and is thus cg-neutral\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThread (including download link) for this airplane here -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30639-sstos-post-your-pictures-here~/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;embedComment=2469679\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, \u00A0Mark 3 aircraft have higher temperature tolerance than type 2s and there is no way you should need to hold that much nose angle to avoid burnup. \u00A0Coming back direct from Minmus \u00A0I might set a 42km periapse and 10 degree pitch angle. \u00A0 If I\u0027m undershooting the space centre, I lower the nose to 5 degrees where lift/drag ratio is better, \u00A0if i\u0027m overshooting i pitch up a bit to make more drag and if too hot i also pitch up because that keeps me higher in the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving lots and lots of wing helps re-entry on my design because it generates enough lift to stay out of the thick atmosphere till it\u0027s slowed right down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, you can probably take a few measures in case the worst happens -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nuse an inline cockpit so it\u0027s not right at the front and the first to blow\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nattach a heat shield to the front of the cockpit\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nattach an aerodynamic nose cone to front of heat shield\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nattach a radial chute to cockpit (optional)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, in \u00A0a normal re-entry, the heat shield is covered by the nose cone and never ablates.
