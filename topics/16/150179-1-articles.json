However now it does\u0027t seem to open when pressing those keys. Is there an option to enable the window now? Not interested in any sort of hardcore cheating but my reflexes aren\u0027t quite as good as a computers so getting that perfect in sync orbit for my sat network is rather difficult. Any tips? Thanks guys! Really enjoying this update and once I can get this debug window working I will have no need for Mechjeb anymore and can run a fully stock game \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"REGZZZ","CreatedById":141152,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-17T00:43:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m having the same problem.... \u00A0 \u00A0alt-F12 worked at the beginning of the game (i started 2 days ago) \u00A0 today there was some update from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, so I\u0027ll try removing mods one by one to see if that changes anything... \u00A0I have about 8 mods installed right now...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReg\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-17T00:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe debug menu looks a lot different now than it used to, but on Windows it\u0027s still alt F12.
