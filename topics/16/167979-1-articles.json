Also the launch profile, drag, and many other factors. However, you can boil it all down to one\u00A0number\u00A0-- the payload fraction. But it varies between each ship, so it\u0027s not a fixed\u00A0number.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, however, it doesn\u0027t really matter. Once you are making fuel on the Mun, you have an infinite amount of it available (it just takes a little time). If your transport ship only burns 25% of its fuel load getting the other 75% to a tanker ship in orbit -- then 75% of infinity is still infinity. It just becomes a question of logistics in moving those infinite amounts of fuel around at that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oiff","CreatedById":182027,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-27T11:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is even cheaper than you think to reach munar\u00A0orbit compared to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLow gravity, no drag, full rocket \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E immediately, low orbital velocity and low orbital altitude all add up to very little fuel consumption to get into orbit. \u00A0Of course landing can be expensive though as there is no drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-27T15:46:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no direct ratio possible, firstly because the cost of getting from the surface to orbit will vary a lot depending on the radius of your planet or moon and your intended orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompare Moho and Vall: Moho has higher gravity (2.7 compared to 2.3 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E at the surface) but Moho is significantly smaller. Therefore it takes much the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E to get to low orbit (860 m/s to 15km for Vall, 870 m/s to 20km for Moho according to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/gBoLsSt.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edelta-v map\u003C/a\u003E). Despite its higher gravity, therefore, Moho is cheaper to refuel from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second factor is your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E when full of fuel. You want high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E to avoid gavity losses, but you need to maximise their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and minimise their weight. Terriers trump Aerospikes on both counts, but only if the local gravity is low enough not to rack up gravity losses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third reason no direct ratio is possible is because the rocket equation is logarithmic with respect to the mass fraction.\u00A0 For example, a single orange tank powered by twin Aerospikes and loaded with landing gear \u002B wheels \u002B solar panels \u002B bits and bobs (say 8 tonnes dry mass, 40 tonnes wet mass) will get a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E of about 5350 m/s. If you use that as fuel lifter on Moho, spending about 1000m/s going up to orbit then 1000 m/s going back down again afterwards, you will use 11 tonnes \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002BOx getting to orbit, and need to keep 3 tonnes on board to go back down. That difference of 3300 m/s - what you can store in the fuel depot - is actually only 56% of the total fuel load, 18 tonnes. However, add a tonne of dead weight to your lifter and you only lose a bit more than half a tonne of fuel, because most of the fuel is spent when the lifter is nearly all fuel. When mass fraction is high, weight savings give diminishing returns...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically you\u0027re left with:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\ndoing the orbital equations (radius, gravity goes in, required \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E to get to orbit comes out) then converting that to real \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E to orbit depending on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (basically a function of time to accelerate to orbital speed multiplied by local acceleration due to gravity) and plugging that into the rocket equation (mass fraction and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E in, percentage fuel available out)... OR....\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\na rule of thumb: you need to spend nearly 50% of your fuel to lift fuel from Moho or Vall. Virtually none for Gilly. Virtually all from Eve.
