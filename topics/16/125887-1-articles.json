All you need to do is have the part on your vessel and carry it through the flight envelope, or to the destination. You can use the part before you get to the destination if you like, as long as it remains attached to your vessel.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T18:11:49Z","Content":"\nHaul, im my understanding of the word is to drag, or carry the item with you\n"}]}
