Your aero control surfaces should all be attached as low as you can possibly get them on the vehicle... fins in the middle are useless and fins up toward the nose destabilize you. If you simply must lift a high-drag payload, you can compensate for it with huge fins on back. You\u0027ll have to burn more fuel to overcome all that drag, but at least you can fly straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RPrG3O7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RPrG3O7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mGOuqib.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mGOuqib.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEDIT: You nailed it RoboRay.

Each engine needs to see a branching tree of linear fuel tank connections, with no loops or multiple connections to the same tank. If you split the flow and then bring it back together, or let fuel run out of a tank then back into that same tank, you can confuse the logic. When that happens, the processing gets stuck in a loop and eventually terminates in a silent error.
