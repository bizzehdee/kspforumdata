Long time forum creeper here with a major issue (at least for me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently unable to undock two shielded docking ports. By that i mean. I AM able to \u0022undock\u0022 and close the shields on both my station and my supply/science ship, but i am unable to move away from the station. The magnetic force is too strong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said it may just be an issue with the ONE docking port on the station. i tried to undock a different part and it went no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought the craft may have been to light but its 45 tons and the craft i was able to undock and move away while testing was 48, so not a huge difference in that aspect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have thought about leaving it attached to the station as an \u0022Oh well ill deorbit it all together eventually\u0022. But its currently loaded with precious science that i desperately need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy KSp X64 is modded pretty decently. But the part im having trouble with are stock so i dont believe that could be part of the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny and all imput would be greatly appreciated. Id rather not loose the whole station as it is the one i learned to dock on and have continually upgraded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T06:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry undock, switchcraft, quicksave then quickload.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jlo96","CreatedById":62307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T06:04:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the science at least you can get a Kerbal over there in EVA to extract the experiments (from the pod or the modules)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the docking ports, have you tried the \u0022bang it until it\u0027s fixed\u0022 solution?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T09:26:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you using KJR?
