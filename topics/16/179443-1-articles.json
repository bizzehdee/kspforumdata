Just spend 30 days or so flying out to where the asteroid\u0027s orbit pierces the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. If I get there early, I burn to a stop and start very slowly falling toward Kerbin. Make sure I have a close flyby with the asteroid. Then burn like crazy as it gets near. I always have a drill and converter on my asteroid catchers -- so I don\u0027t bother worrying about fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-10T02:46:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntercepting in Solar orbit is worth some World\u0027s First points but it\u0027s a lot easier in Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo intercept in Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, I put my catcher on the launchpad, target the asteroid, warp until the asteroid\u0027s trajectory within Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E passes over the launchpad, then launch into that inclination (AND direction!) as closely as possible.\u00A0 Then I put the catcher ship into an orbit at that inclination that\u0027s about 1/2 to 2/3 of the distance from Kerbin to the asteroid\u0027s eventual trajectory through the Kerbin system.\u00A0 Once the asteroid is within Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, it\u0027s just plotting a maneuver same as going to Mun or Minmus.\u00A0 In general, this strategy gets you to the asteroid well before it\u0027s Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E so you have plenty of time to do whatever you want with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntercepting in solar orbit requires making a plane change with respect to the sun and that\u0027s always quite expensive.\u00A0 I haven\u0027t found the best way of reducing this \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E cost.\u00A0 The method I generally use, which is better than nothing (IOW, leaving Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E in the same plane as Kerbin), goes like this....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou will always leave Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E on the night side as you need to get into a higher orbit than Kerbin to be slower than both it\u00A0and the asteroid coming up from behind it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf the asteroid is coming down from above Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane, you want to leave Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E going down on Kerbin\u0027s night side.\u00A0 If the asteroid is coming up at Kerbin, you want to leave Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E going up.\u00A0 This determines whether you launch north or south in the next step.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWait until \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is more or less on the line between the sun and the center or Kerbin.\u00A0 It doesn\u0027t matter if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is on the day or night side of Kerbin, just launch into a polar orbit going north or south depending on whether you need to leave Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E going up or down.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBurn to leave Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E on the night side with a bit of outward velocity so you\u0027ll end up in a\u00A0 slightly higher, slightly slower solar orbit than both Kerbin and the asteroid with respect to the sun, but mostly up or down relative to Kerbin to get the closest you can to the asteroid\u0027s inclination.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMatch planes with the asteroid, then rendezvous with it.\u00A0 This will usually take several burns as you get closer and closer to the asteroid, and none of them will be particularly cheap.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
