Only things about it\u0027s design I would note are that you have a goo container on just one side of the probe core at the top, that may cause the craft to pull to one side a bit while under thrust. But a goo container isn\u0027t much weight, but still I would balance that with either another goo container or something else of the same weight. I\u0027d also make the fairing fit tighter around the payload, but that\u0027s more an aesthetic choice than one that will affect it\u0027s flight (may have some effect). \n\nFrom a flight point of view, I\u0027d suggest you want to be pitched further down sooner on. Rough guide I follow is when the Ap is at 20km be pitched to 40 degrees, when Ap is at 40km be pitched to 20 degrees, and by the time the Ap is at 60-70km be pitched right right over to ~0-5 degrees (rough guide, different craft need different approaches).\n\nedit\n\n(also, best to post these kinda Qs to [Gameplay Questions and Tutorials](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/15-Gameplay-Questions-and-Tutorials))\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-21T11:54:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2015 11:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by katateochi**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T11:53:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Show us your rocket.

The reason why you had to fight the whole way is because the air resistance becomes a brick wall near the speed of sound. That means that even a small angle off prograde is going to slap the tip of your rocket sideways. The rocket is never aerodynamic travelling sideways, so you want to point prograde during that critical time when air resistance is great. Also you don\u0027t want to hit the speed of sound too low, as a thick atmosphere compounds the problem."}]}
