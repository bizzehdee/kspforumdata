For making various spaceplanes, especially \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s, it is desirable to be able to pick a smaller angle. To do this I have made an Inclinometer that I use for getting precise angle with snap off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VMBGvmq.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/VMBGvmq.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe inclinometer has been set with graduations of 0.5 degrees using small solar cells as \u0022markers.

I want to set the wings at 2 percent. I attach an arm made of wing sections to the wing I\u0027m adjusting and move it back and fourth until the arm matches with both arms on the inclinometer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Wa31T01.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Wa31T01.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I turn snap off and rotate to the angle I want, in this case 2 degrees.
