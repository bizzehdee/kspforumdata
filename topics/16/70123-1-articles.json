At this point my intake air is about 0.2 (not 0.02) thanks to a bit of light intake spamming (ram intakes only so no ugly 50 radial intakes attached to every possible surface) At this point my nose starts to climb and drift to the left or right and I end up in a flat spin which is often so aggressive that I drop to less than 5000m before being able to recover (if I can recover at all) Disabling all engines does nothing to help and my rockets are not yet fired. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso my designs tend to have fuel efficiency at their heart so I use two small LV909 engines and a FL-T800 tanks meaning there is a slightly inevitable speed drop when trying to switch engines which I may switch out to aerospikes due to the ISP being the same but the huge step up in thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately I would like to be able to build an SSTLAB plane (single stage to laythe and back) thanks to the newly overpowered ion engines. But to do this I need at least enough rocket fuel for 2 transfers to orbit (one on kerbin an one on laythe) and enough fuel to be able to explore laythe for a reasonable time (perhaps a half circumnavigation) and I also need enough xenon and solar panels to allow for 2 interplanetary transfers, all while carrying around 2 tons of science apparatus. If this is all too big of an ask I could send a forward command post out to laythe with fuel for the return to orbit and return to kerbin although I would rather just do it in one hop. Any advice you could give would be much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rodyle","CreatedById":103194,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T08:20:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethis point my nose starts to climb \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypically a symptom of the weight balance being off.
