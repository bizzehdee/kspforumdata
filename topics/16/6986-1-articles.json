If you want to turn/move, it doesnt directly control the RCS blocks, but instead, depending on the orientation of the craft, it gets the direction (lets say where the craft is facing at) and then figures which RCS blocks to activate, with how much force, and which ones of the 4 outputs in them to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should have them placed around the ship in different directions so that the game can find enough RCS blocks that can move your ship to a certain direction (if you place them all on 1 side you cant move up/down relative to the RCS blocks... and rotation will give problems)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt assists in wasd and q and e to rotate the ship like normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it also allows you to move the ship to all 6 directions (up, down, left, right, forward, backwards), relative to the rockets orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EH is up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN is down\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJ left\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EL right\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK down\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shaunlake","CreatedById":16304,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-28T18:43:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGod damn!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 0.14 update introduced a new physics engine.
