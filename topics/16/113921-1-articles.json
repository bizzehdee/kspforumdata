The goal was to land on Tylo. My first attempts at aerocapture got me into Jool orbit and I easily transfered to Tylo. I came up short of fuel to land however, but that\u0027s beside the point. I built a new lander and was trying again today after the recent patches. My Periapsis entering Jool atmosphere was always between 185000 to 190000. Now, as soon as I hit the atltitude of about 198000m, My craft explodes. Ironically, I placed heat shields on the craft before the patch was released. I enter the atmosphere prograde leading with sheilds. How do we Aerocapture now? Does my design suck? \n\n![F891E9EC06E88C5930D6DE569825C1AFC8C1B406](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/523889851078057898/F891E9EC06E88C5930D6DE569825C1AFC8C1B406/)"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T22:25:57Z","Content":"It explodes doesn\u0027t say very much? Are your decouplers getting fried? Does it flip around?\n\nAnyway, you don\u0027t need to do aerocapture at Jool. You can just swing by Tylo. It\u0027s fairly easy to set the right encounter during one of the course corrections half way from Kerbin to Jool."},{"CreatedByName":"One-Way Films","CreatedById":90926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T22:26:25Z","Content":"you might wanna bring the design back to kerbin or make as much use out of that craft as you can. You\u0027ll need some radiators to take some of the heat away from the fuel tanks. The design has all the fuel tanks bunched together and a heatshield is merging into one of those tanks. Convection will bring heat across to the already heated fuel tank (just behind the 3m heatshield) and cause your explosion. You could alter your course and get a gravity assist around Tylo into the Joolian system. From the Tylo assist, aerobrake around Laythe. It\u0027s atmosphere is much thinner and that craft has a much larger chance of surviving Laythe entry. From Laythe, go on with your normal plan. Depending on how the moons are aligned, you can save or lose fuel. good luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T22:28:36Z","Content":"Are you sure all of you\u0027re craft is protected from the airstream?

Aerobraking is sometimes the best way to go, but recently I\u0027ve found that it\u0027s just much, much easier to use gravity assists. Though... that thing looks likes it should work. Maybe try for a higher periapsis? I can never remember the atmosphere height on Jool. I think reentry heating is supposed to be more severe in 1.0.3.

Because, forgive me, but I just do not find it fun to go round and round and round and round just so I can land my Mun lander back on Kerbin.I realize that there are other ways of dealing with the reentry heat, like heat shields or even changing the difficulty settings. But, the heat shields are heavier than radiators, and I like at least trying to play the game as intended for a while before making major changes to .cfgs or difficulty. \n\nSo is this what was intended? Pushing us towards using radiators for reentry? And for those of you that carry over saves from version to version, this must suck big time, especially since one would think that a 1.0 release would mean no more save breaking.

That corrects so steep reentries are in fact deadlier than shallow ones.\n\nSince reentry on Kerbin is currently rather harmless, I fundamentally agree with the new \u0022to fast, to low\u0022 feature (introduced by patch 1.0.3).\n\nThere should definitely be at least some basic threat to burn-up during reentry.\n\nIn addition, you\u0027ll probably only encountered this new feature if you intentionally try to destroy your vessel.\n\nBut, I dislike the way this new feature is implemented:\n\nAny part that exceeds a particular velocity on a given atmospheric density, will be instantly destroyed by overwhelming amounts of heat.\n\nFuthermore there seems to be no consistentl heat progression towards the burn-up. \n\nInstead the maximum skin-temperatures will tend to drop for some seconds, until the final burn-up occurs.\n\nThere\u0027s also no recognisable burn-up order of the involved parts.\n\nIt\u0027s not like: Your heatshield goes first, afterwards (almost simultaneously) your batterys overheat and finally (with a small delay) your fuel-tanks explode.\n\nInstead the entire burn-up feels much more like crashing into a wall!\n\nTo illustrate this behaviour, I\u0027ve prepared some pictures from my previous reentry testing in 1.0.4.\n\n\u003E ![vQKDamS.png](%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/vQKDamS.png)\n\u003E The test-vehicle\u0027s apoapsis is slightly above Minimus orbit, it\u0027s periapsis is close to the center of Kerbin.\n\n\u003E ![5ofGxE4.png](http://i.imgur.com/5ofGxE4.png)\n\u003E Inital reentry velocity at 3.3 km/s.\n\n\u003E ![FyAyS0t.png](http://i.imgur.com/FyAyS0t.png)\n\u003E Max. recorded skin-temperature is at roughly 2900 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0K (all my other screenshots showed a lower skin-temp.).\n\u003E \n\u003E You can also see the vessel\u0027s propulsion-stage, falling in front of it at 600 m distance.\n\n\u003E ![S1ItoHx.png](http://i.imgur.com/S1ItoHx.png)\n\u003E Skin-temp. has allready droped by almost 200 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0K, less then one second away from final burn-up.\n\u003E \n\u003E In front, you see the propulsion-stage hitting the \u0022to fast, to low\u0022 wall.\n\n\u003E ![SSP8rfY.png](http://i.imgur.com/SSP8rfY.png)\n\u003E More than 2 km/s below 19 km altitude? - KSP says: Nay!\n\u003E \n\u003E In this screenshot, you can also see the temperature gauges of some parts inside the explosion. \n\u003E \n\u003E But you probably won\u0027t be able to recognise them during normal gameplay\n\nMaybe the feature is intended to simulate g-forces instead of heating, you might say.\n\nIn this case, I\u0027d at least expect to see a recognisable order of structural failures.\n\nAccording to the individual part\u0027s impact tollerance.\n\nWhat do you think about the new \u0022to fast, to low\u0022 feature?\n\nShould it be rebalanced or is it fine as it is?\n\n(Please excuse any scribal errors or flawed grammar in my posts!)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T19:36:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 07:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Magniff**\n  \nclarification"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T18:16:55Z","Content":"This is basically what happens to meteors in real life, see Chelyabinsk ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T18:19:35Z","Content":"You\u0027re going 2km/s and hitting the thicker atmosphere of Kerbin, I don\u0027t see a problem here."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T18:27:17Z","Content":"Moved to gameplay questions, also, you have to take aerodynamic heating into account now, this is a long requested feature."}]}
