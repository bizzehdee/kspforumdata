I didn\u0027t have enough fuel to get it out of this orbit to land back down, but I was able to get the periapsis of the orbit into the Kerbin atmosphere (48,000m right now). My question is since the rocket passes through the atmosphere will this take energy out of the orbit until eventually my rocket comes back down?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T07:11:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.
