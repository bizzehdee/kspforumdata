I was wondering if there was a way to reconfigure the tank so it stored rocket fuel, or actually both (It should have both if in fact it is a service module)!

The only thing you can do is manually edit the .cfg file but that means it effects all your rockets at once, even ones you want it to use as RCS fuel.
