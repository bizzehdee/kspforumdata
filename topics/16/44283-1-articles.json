It uses a tree data structure; all parts have a single \u0027parent\u0027 part which is the part you clipped the new part onto. Basically you\u0027ve got 3 engines whose parent is the tri-coupler, and the lower one can only have one \u0027parent\u0027, so the other two connections are not connected, physically, as far as the game is concerned, so you have off-axis forces which causes problems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a couple solutions you could try. My personal preference for interplanetary stages with LV-N\u0027s is to use sidepods- there\u0027s a number of ways to connect them, and you\u0027ll need to ensure you include a fuel hose if you want to pull fuel from the center tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, you can leave the setup you have now, but augment the connection with a web of struts. You may need to do this anyways as rockets of that size tend to have rigidity problems already. Struts bypass the whole tree idea a bit and create physical links between any two parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour third option is to use docking adapters on the bottom of the engines, on the other side of the decouplers (so you can remove them when the engines are ready to fire). Docking ports, I\u0027m told, can create multi-joins at least as far as forces are concerned. I\u0027ve never attempted it myself since in the past it didn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you go with struts, you can use trusses or I-beams on the side of the tanks to clear the lip of the couples/engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T15:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep.

This way you have three stacks of engine/port/port, and when you add the tri-coupler, it gets attached to one pair of docking ports. the way to do this is to make a rocket/tri-coupler/3x engine/3x decoupler or separator(whichever you prefer)/ 3x docking port facing down. Then, you take 1x symmetry, not 3x, and place a single docking port(let\u0027s name it X) so it \u0022connects\u0022 to one of your already placed. Then, take a tricoupler and orient it so it faces the right way; hold it under the one docking port and when it looks like it\u0027s oriented right, click Q or E twice to make it rotate. NOW place it. Take two more docking ports and put them on the two available nodes on the tri-coupler. Now pick up the X port, hit Q or E twice and place it under any of the ports(if the thing is rotated, use Q, E or shift\u002BQ/E to fit it).
