See, Oberth effect is just about speed, and the distance you can get your apoapsis at is too about speed. Now, if you want to set your apoapsis to the edge of the SOI, you\u0027ll have to burn nearly to the escape velocity. The thing is, you will have \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E the same velocity the moment after you complete that maneuver to push your apoapsis out than when you will come back, falling from your apoapsis.

It is actually an intermediate step for people with low T/W ratios. They will burn at periapsis and create an eliptical orbit and they will continue to do this each pass of their periapsis orbit to do as much burning near periapsis as possible. BUT as soon as their apoapsis is no longer in the Kerbin SOI, they cannot do this again because they won\u0027t be coming back to Kerbin\u0027s SOI any time soon... so at that point they just do whatever is left for their interplanetary burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main point is that there is no reason to try to setup your elliptical orbit first.
