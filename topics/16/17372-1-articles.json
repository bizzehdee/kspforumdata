I then tried a new design and when I got off the ground the ship was vibrating and all moving and swinging, so I aborted the mission (my command module had the asas on top and then the parachute) and when I deployed the parachute it ripped it\u0027s self off the ship and everyone died :|\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo can someone give me some basic advice on how to use the new parts properly please :S\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serratus","CreatedById":12069,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-20T17:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new parts set is not complete yet.

Pre-launch you can use the gantry parts to hold it steady, put them in the same stage as your engines firing and you\u0027ll be off. If it\u0027s post-launch wobbles, try some struts between the wobblier bits. Struts are pretty expendable, so you can tie parts together that aren\u0027t even in the same stage. Bit chunky SRBs tend to need some tying down but will still jettison normally, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xenotheos","CreatedById":40486,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-20T19:19:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe larger parts aren\u0027t all that great.

Keep that G-force meter down and they will hold. The only real annoyance is the way the crafts will sometimes mis-behave when being manoeuvred. Here\u0027s hoping that the Kraken fix will address that. They can also be slow to pitch, but I have found that they don\u0027t mind nearly as much when you ask them to roll - you can use this. If you need to pitch up or down to hit your velocity vector or whatever, give it a bit of roll side-to-side first.
