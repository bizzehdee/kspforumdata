Are you going too fast while you\u0027re still in atmosphere?

Need to avoid going a lot faster than 300ish m/s until you\u0027re above 10km. If your rocket is aerodynamically unstable, then it will get dramatically harder to control when it starts going really fast. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYour rocket is short and wide. That means the fins aren\u0027t placed very far behind, which will limit their effectiveness. A taller, skinnier rocket will allow the fins to get more leverage. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf you\u0027re using T-30 engines, they don\u0027t have any gimbal ability, which means they\u0027re not helping to steer the ship. Consider switching to T-45s, they can gimbal and will really help steer the ship (at least while it\u0027s under thrust). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAs far as I can tell from looking at your ship, you don\u0027t have any reaction wheels. Combined with your lack of gimbaling engines and steerable fins, that means that the only torque authority on your ship is the Mk1 command pod up top, which is puny. You simply have way too little torque to steer something huge like that ship. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou\u0027re making your life difficult by building tall stacks of 1-ton tanks. Reason: Each engine is pulling fuel from its tank stack. It will start pulling from the topmost tank first, then when that goes dry, it starts draining the one below that, and so forth. This means that it\u0027s losing the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eforwardmost\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E mass first, which means that as it burns fuel, the CoM is moving rapidly backwards on the ship. Pretty soon this will move your CoM behind your center of drag, which will make the ship aerodynamically unstable, and hilarity ensues. What you need to do is to replace that stack of 1-ton tanks with a single 4-ton tank. It will be the same size and shape as the stack-of-4, but it drains its mass uniformly rather than from the top down, so you won\u0027t have that stability problem. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA side comment on your design: You appear to be trying to use 2 sets of radial decouplers for each stage; for example, you appear to be trying to hold on each Thumper with \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Etwo\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E radial decouplers, one positioned above the other.

When you put multiple decouplers on there like that, the thing being attached (e.g. Thumper) is actually being held by only one of the decouplers. The other decoupler is just sitting there and isn\u0027t actually connecting anything to anything; it\u0027s nothing but dead weight and drag, you can delete it.
