That speed was commonly reached only at very low altitudes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.1 has made parachutes much more resilient, so if you\u0027ve followed the instructions about right-clicking the chute and setting semi-deploy pressure to a very high (the highest?) setting, then it would seem that you\u0027re simply coming in at too steep an angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe obvious solution is to do it the 1.0.5 way: do not stage your chutes at all until the background to the icon turns a greeny-grey, or for safety a light grey, colour. This is actually very fast for the drogue chutes, like nearly mach 2 iirc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more tutorial-friendly way is simply to ensure that you\u0027ve set the pressure stting right, and make sure that you are coming in a sufficiently shallow angle to slow enough at that pressure-related height.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, concerning incoming angle, you need to find the happy medium. Re-entering with too high a Pe makes you slow with virtually no vertical velocity at a very high altitude, then you drop more and more like a stone. Re-entering too low, and your vertical velocity will just rise and rise constantly. In the middle there, there is a point where your vertical velocity is relatively low while you are quite close to the thicker lower atmosphere, but you still have a decent horizontal velocity, so you will slow down enormously before reaching parachute height.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T23:46:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222589696\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140058\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463611811\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022164036\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rmack\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n52 minutes ago, Rmack said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually try to re-enter on training missions, but I seemed to loose my main chute half the time.\u00A0 Even if I seem to be doing everything right, it still can get destroyed.\u00A0 The drogue chute, when there,\u00A0hasn\u0027t survived yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this normal?\u00A0 Am I doing something wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hate to sound like I\u0027m implying that you\u0027re dumb, but I just want to get the obvious out of the way.
