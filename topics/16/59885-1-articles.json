If nothing else, it allows you to place the maneuver on the trajectory and fiddle with controls and its position until you get a decent transfer without using any other tools or window planners. The only downside is that it costs about 30% more dV when transferring from Kerbin. Which does not necessarily have to be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat often helps a lot is to avoid separate plane change and merge it with either ejection or injection burn. Or both - that\u0027s what Alexmoon\u0027s \u0022ballistic\u0022 trajectory gives you anyway. Good thing about using this maneuver is, you get your intercept right after the first burn so you know you\u0027ve done it right.

I made the burn for Kirbin from a similar position to the leaving Kirbin setup, with the Moho Apoapsis lining up with Kirbin on the far side and got an encounter straight off. Again I managed to take off most of the inclination on the initial burn and had only to make a 300 Dv or so burn mid way.
