(possibly even excluding the map like myself)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, please, post here as to your means and methods of how you do certain things in IVA that were once much simpler without!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t start off with any of my own contributions, as work and school have been keeping me too busy to really get some IVA flight time in. So as a request (and this is potentially a great one for the mathematically inclined), how can you find your Apoapsis without using map view or a mod? (Unless said mod only uses your vehicle\u0027s velocity and attitude and/or altitude to figure it out). I\u0027ve been googling like crazy to try and find a formula that I can use to calculate my Apoapsis just from knowing my speed, altitude, angle of attack, Kerbin\u0027s gravity, etc, to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure I\u0027d be capable of doing a Mun landing eventually, after using a calculator to find the required velocities and such for injection burns and what-not, but this one hurdle is currently stopping me. I also don\u0027t want to just launch and get to some random altitude and then get into a circular orbit =P\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"amore555","CreatedById":23863,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-21T14:08:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ea map view monitor would be an amazing addition, it would mean potentially you could do most of a flight without leaving the IVA\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ekku Zakku","CreatedById":34696,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T22:03:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d honestly be fine with just Ap and Pe shown in the cockpit somehow, then I wouldn\u0027t feel bad because it wouldn\u0027t be a mod XD I just don\u0027t want to use a mod that automatically takes the game\u0027s data for Ap \u0026amp; Pe and shows it to me, that just feels a bit cheaty.
