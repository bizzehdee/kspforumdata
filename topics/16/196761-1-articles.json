I\u0027m still learning the ins and outs of the KAL-1000 controller but, I\u0027m currently making a co-axial helicopter and trying to make it consume as little liquid fuel as possible when needed, but also try to make the flight controls as snappy as possible; especially on yaw control by increasing torque limit temporarily when the rotors has to spin up faster instead of making them producing max torque 100% of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022max-width:800px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:rgb(26,26,27);\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor yaw controls on the helicopter I used RPM limiting where one rotor will either spin faster or slow down and while the other does the opposite to provide left or right yaw controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI plan on having one \u003Cstrong\u003E(collective torque limiter controller)\u003C/strong\u003E where torque limit increases or decreases for both turbo shaft engines as collective pitch increases or decreases on the rotors. I plan to bind this one to the \u0022Main Throttle\u0022 action group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I\u0027ll have another \u003Cstrong\u003E(yaw torque limiter controller)\u003C/strong\u003E set up for torque limit but as soon as soon any of the yaw controls are pressed it overrides the \u003Cstrong\u003E(collective torque limiter controller)\u003C/strong\u003E regardless of current position and defaults back to the last position of the \u003Cstrong\u003E(collective torque limiter controller)\u003C/strong\u003E as soon as yaw controls are depressed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR version: I want a KAL-1000 controller that overrides another KAL-1000 controller that both use torque limit and defaults back to its original torque limit setting of the overridden KAL-1000 controller when not activated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope my wording wasn\u0027t too confusing, but any help in how to do this or insight would be much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wobbly Av8r","CreatedById":206697,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-07T15:27:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure of the size/power demands of your helicopter, but my experience is that the turbine motor is a real pig when it comes to fuel - you may be better off going electric and placing a fuel cell or two to supply the energy - in a recent thread, I discovered that using the smaller -16 sized electric motor, I was able to raise a simplified co-axial machine from the surface of Eve to 25,000m on 11 kg of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile your requirement may be for the more powerful motors, I would think that electric \u002B fuel cells will at least resolve your fuel consumption issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-07T15:29:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2020 03:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Wobbly Av8r\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
