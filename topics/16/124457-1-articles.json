You see, on the first two or three stages the additional couple hundred kg from the cockpit won\u0027t make a huge difference, however, on the final stage it\u0027s really well worth using the lander can, since that has a lower mass and it will actually be carried the entire way. Basically make you stinginess with added weight directly proportinall to how long you will be carrying that stage with you, the further the stingier. Also I made the lander design two stage which has two main advantages, more dV due to dropping unnecessary weight and more stability because the center of mass is lower down and you have a wider base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the rocket is mainly unchanged apart from the fact that I use two skipper engines instead of just one as that allows you to carry quite a bit more fuel to orbit at little additional cost. I also slightly increased the length of the first liquid fueled stage since otherwise you would be wasting precious lifting capacity. One thing I did, then reverted because I don\u0027t know what you have unlocked was stick some winglets (preferrably with control) at the base of the first LFO stage, this will give you control early on, since the SRB\u0027s are ungimballed and the radial lander design shifts the CoL far forwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see from the screenshots, this setup will give you around 4000m/s of dV once in orbit, which should be way more than you need for going to and from the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the craft file in case you wish to muck around with my design/take a closer look.
