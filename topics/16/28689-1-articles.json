BOOM! Station pieces flying everywhere. Have to go to the space center and select the station; does not blow up if I do it this way. Is this an issue with the 2k draw/relevant distance? Only 4 struts on my station, and nothing clipped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I do the impossible, decouple the orange tank arm, dock the tug with it, deorbit and land safely the Kerbals in the \u0027arm\u0027 delivery vehicle (mostly there for the SAS torque), and dock the transferred arm to the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Above is the station core with one\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIssue #2\u003C/strong\u003E - Nothing lines up correctly. The orange \u0027arm\u0027s\u0027 light towers are not at 90 degrees like they were in the VAB, and the tug did not connect to the \u0027arm\u0027 in the rotation it did in the VAB. With only vertical rotation in the VAB, why do the connections via docks in space not line up the same way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIssue #3\u003C/strong\u003E - after connecting the orange \u0027arm\u0027, I left the tug connected to it, in order to place the other 3 arms coming later. Returning to the space center, there is no longer any station piece as a flight, only the tug. I cannot select the station core pod (T-Can) for targetting, and hence cannot change it\u0027s name/etc. It\u0027s as if the station decided the tug was the main part, and not the initial pod. I\u0027m guessing this is a bug; both the tug and the station should be target-able.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what could I have done differently? Could I have constructed things differently to avoid these issues?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
