Lately I\u0027ve been experimenting with pure sabre powered SSTO\u0027s and I\u0027ve found that with big or small designs I\u0027ve hit a speedcap of about 1700m/s on Kerbin.

Even with both of these craft I max out between 1700-1750 m/s at around 25km. I am just wondering if I am reaching the maximum efficiency I can with sabres in the atmo or if it\u0027s a design flaw. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just realized that because I am using FAR it could be causing this speed cap.

Like if I have a 15 ton SSTO and I place a SABRE-M on it, yeah I am going to blow it to space with the least amount of fuel use. But on a 100\u002B ton application it loses a lot of that benefit, but that could be said for any engine at that point. I honestly have a love hate relationship with SABREs. I love them for the saving of parts on a craft, not having to place a second rocket or jet engine is nice, but I also hate them because they are so heavy and fuel hungry in rocket mode not to mention they are a bit overpowered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022How2FoldSoup\u0022 data-cite=\u0022How2FoldSoup\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you again for the replies and more input is always appreciated! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoup\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t ignore the rocket capabilities at all, they are good, but fuel hungry. On many of my other SSTO space planes that use the SABRE I use the rocket ability only to get into space, once I am there I usually use a more efficient engine to circularize. One thing I noticed about your two craft, you are using the intercooler between the engines and the hull. I have found they do nothing currently and this was confirmed by others in the B9 mod thread, so they are just wasted mass, unless you are using them as structure to move the COM back or space out your engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reason why I list KSPX as one of the mods, is because I don\u0027t remember what all I have used the KSPX parts on or what is stock and what isnt part of the KSPX parts list. That is one mod that should definitely be part of the stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
