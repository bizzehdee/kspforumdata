Center of mass vs. center of drag issues.\u00A0 First, if you\u0027ve got wings, this is almost always something to deal with.\u00A0 Second, you mention that this happens when you use a probe core instead of a command pod.\u00A0 The command pod likely puts more mass at the front of the craft, which promotes stability.\u00A0 This is also consistent with the idea that when you launch the second stage by itself, this problem does not occur -- that be because the fuel you\u0027ve burned to get to that point has removed mass from the bottom of the craft.\u00A0 If this is the case, solutions are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMove the center of drag further back by moving back the wings, along with any other draggy parts you can move (landing legs, etc).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMove the center of mass further forward by swapping the order of your parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKeep drag at the front of the craft to an absolute minimum.
