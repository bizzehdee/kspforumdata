This takes more delta-V, but that\u0027s delta-V when you\u0027re not pushing the asteroid so it\u0027s cheap fuel-wise. There\u0027s a tutorial on how to meet asteroids in solar orbit but the key idea is to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI in the direction the asteroid is set to come into it.\n\nOnce you\u0027ve met it, course correct for an initial aerocapture. Give yourself a margin of safety, for example aim for a periapsis of a few thousand km. Alternatively, correct for a gravity assist from the Mun into a closed Kerbin orbit. Either way this should not require much delta-V.\n\nMake final corrections in Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Again, not much delta-V needed unless you have an awkward desired orbit.\n\nI captured a 500-ton class D using [this tug](https://flic.kr/p/nVTQZ7) with nuclear engines and half an orange tank of fuel. Extrapolating from that, three orange tanks should be good for a class E. Double that if you\u0027re using chemical engines.\n\nAs for how to handle the asteroid, I used detachable control sections dotted round the asteroid. They turn the rock and the rock turns the tug.

The effect of this is that, even with massive reaction wheels, you have to keep your thrust down when pushing an asteroid. The design implications of this are that TWR is not your friend - add more reaction wheels, and leave off the extra engines.

I prefer wide, though is harder to bring into orbit. Is less likely to snap in half when torqueing asteroid! \n\nSo you have grabbed asteroid with tug. Is good! But only first step. Class E is heavy as great many potato, or even more. If RCS and reaction wheel is powerful enough to get Class E rotating, will break locking pivot on claw and tumble out of control. If ship survive, will be useless for stable orbital insertion burn. How you do, is bring along remotes tug. Just claw, cheap flight computer, reaction wheel, much RCS, power systems. Place one on opposite side of asteroid of main tug. Is ok, but even better place two to four more same kind, spaced evenly at 90 degrees to axis of towing. Then have much RCS to rotate Class E around itself, is very stable, will not stress pivot if done carefully. If spacing is not perfect, is OK as long as is close since when docked to asteroid, all count as one ship and RCS system is smart enough to coordinate. Better spacing means can burn nuclear engines at higher power without tumbling, make good orbital insertion burn.\n\nI hopes this is helpful.

In fact, if you put more engines on the asteroid you absolutely have to make sure you have the center of mass and center of thrust lined up or you will be put in an uncontrollable spin when trying to move the asteroid. As you can imagine, it is hard to do that outside of the VAB.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T09:03:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 09:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Frostea**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T11:51:02Z","Content":"On the other hand if you do have multiple engines - even all on the one tug - you can tweak the thrust limiters on them to compensate for any misalignment.

Any ship designs would be appreciated.\n\nHave a look at this thread: [How to Steer an Asteroid](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100591-how-to-steer-an-asteroid), especially [the last post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100591-how-to-steer-an-asteroid?p=1552276\u0026viewfull=1#post1552276).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E When you latch ships, and RCS modules to a roid, Is it all treated as 1 large ship so that all the attached ships work together?

Also, What about using struts and parts from KAS mod to better secure ship/s and control modules after the claw latches on?\n\nYes, if you attach several pieces to one asteroid it becomes a single vessel. It\u0027s no different from docking several craft to make a large ship.\n\nThe main problem with moving large rocks is that the claw makes a comparatively weak connection. It doesn\u0027t take very much force to make it flex and bend. **Bending the claw is Kraken-bait** ([bugtracker](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/2349)). Building you vessel short and stubby like **Jsouders** did, above, is highly recommended. Even then, you should keep the forces low: he has two large reaction wheels on his vessel and the mod engine he uses has 450kN of thrust (equalling 8 stock nukes or 2/3rds of a Skipper), and I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s truly possible to run them at full throttle.\n\nThe burn times aren\u0027t even the worst. Usually you don\u0027t need more than a few gentle nudges; I haven\u0027t recovered that many asteroids, but so far, it never took more than ~300m/s over several maneuvers. Jsouder\u0027s vessel if perfectly up to that task: if I get the numbers right, one tank will apply 50m/s even to the heaviest asteroid and refueling it\u0027s tanks will take about twenty minutes. Seeing as there is a single engine, it may even be possible to run the converter during the burn.\n\nWhat\u0027s truly annoying is how long it takes to bring the vessel around. You may want to look into **torque pods**: basically nothing more than a claw and a few reaction wheels stuck to the asteroid. The last time I did that (in 0.25 IIRC), five large reaction wheels were already more than a single claw could handle well, and even with 25 large wheels spread over the rock, it still took 5\u002B minutes to turn.\n\nSo, be patient, and bring MJ to assist you with turning and maneuevring. You may also consider Kerbal Join Reinforcement for a more resilient claw (then one claw can handle ten wheels or more), or KAS to allow you to strut the vessel to the rock.\n\nI have no experience with pulling asteroids. It may allow you to apply much more thrust, but I guess you\u0027re even more limited in the torque department."},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:23:36Z","Content":"Drill \u002B ISRU \u002B nukes spaced as far out as possible, so that you can tweak their thrust to reduce your torque.\n\nI\u0027ve only moved class Cs, but it shoudl work for Es as well.\n\nMJ or Engineer to show you your current torque.\n\nKAS/KIS to add struts to the roid, if that\u0027s even possible.
