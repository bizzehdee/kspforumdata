He is in a huge elliptical orbit that goes from just inside Jool orbit at apopapsis to inside of Kerbin orbit at periapsis. He ended up stranded without gas, and after all these years I\u0027ve decided to try and go rescue him. No luck. I get decent ships with ample delta-v out there but I just cannot seem to line things up correctly. The rendezvous technique I typically use is to null relative velocity, point at target and accelerate, then repeat until I\u0027m close enough to use RCS. At these distances, that just won\u0027t work, I need to fine tune this, I need to do the math I think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know a good calculator or process for approaching this problem? I\u0027m sick of eyeballing it, I want to get this Kerbal home so he can take a shower!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gromaz","CreatedById":57688,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T07:51:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way I can think of would be to achieve the same orbit as the thing your are trying to dock to, very similar to dock to something orbiting Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse RCS when you are about 50m from the object and at a releative velocity of 0.0m/s (\u002B/- 0.1m/s) as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s difficult to say something more specific without seeing the orbit of the rogue object, can you post a solar system picture with the orbit perhaps?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally it would seem that it would be best to catch the rogue while close to Kerbin but I think that is much harder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T08:02:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
