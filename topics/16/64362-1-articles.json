The upper part of the rocket seems to hold the lower part, not the lower part supporting the upper which causes a lot of problems and headaches. Not the number of struts is important, but from where to where they go to avoid problems with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first big problem i see is that your inner ring of asparagus rockets is connected to the payload module.
