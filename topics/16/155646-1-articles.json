Tedious, as I have a dozen missions to several planets/moons that take years, but I like it. I\u0027ve gotten pretty good at it. Even my first Tylo ship worked (2ND landing, though. First landing was at about 80 m/s). Eve, however, is evil. My lander worked and made orbit, so I reloaded and sent Jeb on his way. About a year later (game time), I came back to him. Meantime, 1.2 had come out. Landing went fine, but I cannot make orbit. Tweaked the fuel flow to normal, so that\u0027s not the problem. I do my own flying, so I\u0027m obviously in a different spot. Fine. I will send a rescue ship, and rover to reach it. Money means nothing at this point. I want Jeb home. My method is this: Launch behemoth, refuel at Minmus, see if it works. So, finally, to my question: How do you test an Eve ascent vehicle without going all the way to Eve?

During the initial ascent out of the soup, the most important aspect of an engine is its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, and since its recent buff, the Twin Boar surprisingly takes the cake at\u00A0~23@5atm, ~33 Vac (for comparison, the vector now comes in at ~18@5atm ~25vac). The advantage of vectors is they\u0027re very compact, so you can fit them in a more streamlined package. You\u0027ll often see Eve lifters with a single Vector on a 1.25m tank surrounded by droppable (asparagused) fuel tanks that get ditched early in the flight. If you can land it though, the twin boar is much simpler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next big question is how many stages to use, and I\u0027ve found 3 has worked well, but I see a lot of people go with two . I\u0027ll echo what others have said, that the terrier makes an excellent upper stage for the long push from subortial to orbit. The middle stage has always been a tricky pick because there\u0027s not a lot of good 2 ton engine picks. To be honest, my favorite is a hammer \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E- it works great! If you insist on a liquid fuel rocket, you can put a couple aerospikes \u0027radially\u0027 on the bottom of a fuel tank, and a decoupler on the same tank shifted down.

Most ships I\u0027ve launched from Eve can\u0027t handle more than a little gentle steering on the way up, but airplane control surfaces on the rear of the plane really help to keep you steady on that nice gravity turn. If your ship is suddenly flipping out during ascent, it\u0027s probably because as the fuel tanks up front empty, they become draggier relative to their mass and can get pulled back due to aero forces, a bit like on a weather vain. We could say that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E shifts back while \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Drag\u0022\u003ECOD\u003C/abbr\u003E stays forward. Control surfaces in the back help against this problem immensely. So does draining your bottom tanks first now that that\u0027s an option. Lastly, make sure you have atleast one reaction wheel with plenty of battery.... Neither the hammer nor the terrier have an alternator, so what you bring is what you got!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComing back to aero forces, the drag along your rocket plays a huge roll in how much up going you do. Try cones, the pointier the better! When in doubt, the fuel carrying adapters tend to work much better than their structural counterparts. eg. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/C7_Brand_Adapter_-_2.5m_to_1.25m\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022C7 Brand Adapter - 2.5m to 1.25m\u0022\u003EC7 Brand Adapter - 2.5m to 1.25m\u003C/a\u003E \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Rockomax_Brand_Adapter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Rockomax Brand Adapter\u0022\u003ERockomax Brand Adapter\u003C/a\u003E despite looking roughly the same.

It\u0027s nearly impossible to guide the rocket cleanly during flight, so the trick is to try to line up on a well-chosen bearing and let your trajectory slowly drift down. Fortunately, this can be done by trial-and-error from a quick save rather than hyperedit. For reference, I found in v1.2 that 10-15 degrees at 3km and 45 degrees at 20km were good benchmarks. Mileage may vary pending your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. Somehow, it\u0027s always felt pretty low to me when done right. Also, keep it full throttle! You waste more to gravity than to drag.

I have no doubt you would conquer them too, but if you\u0027re in \u0022Just get \u0027er done\u0022 mode, there\u0027s a few other things to mention that could make your road a bit smoother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like your min-maxing of the top stage. Using a Spark\u002BOscarB as an extra top stage (in addition to the terrier) is a great way to get a ton of extra deltaV. Pretty much all of my missions have something like that tacked on. If you\u0027re willing, you can push the effectiveness of that final stage by replacing the command pod with a 1.25m service bay with a command chair in it. Throw in a tiny reaction wheel and a battery, and it\u0027s the lightest, toughest, most flame-retardant and maneuverable command pod out there! A small important detail,\u00A0 putting the seat on the bottom of the service bay with its feat facing straight up makes the nav ball read correctly. OscarBs work great in this roll, but I eventually found I got the best results with FLT-100 or FLT-200 tanks instead. Regardless, any tiny top stage is a great idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easiest way to attach a heat shield to the Twin Boar is using a radial attachment point or some form of strut attached right in the center on the bottom of the rocket. Sadly, it looks a little silly because the mesh makes it float a half-meter away. Fortunately, it\u0027s practical to truss the whole thing together with struts anyway, so it doesn\u0027t wind up looking too weird in the end! Just make sure to include a decoupler somewhere, or you\u0027ll find yourself with a very heavy anchor during final descent. Speaking of which, especially if you use a tiny top stage for extra deltaV, you should have plenty of extra fuel in the Twin Boar to make minor corrections to your descent after dumping the heat shield (in order to push your trajectory to flat ground) and also slow down your descent just before landing. Even with parachutes, I can never quite get it to fall slow enough without using a bit of thrust to help out. Maybe your design will wind up a bit easier, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also been surprised how often an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E is a decent choice. It doesn\u0027t feel like they should be, but their high T/W can be critical trying to accelerate away from a massive planet like Eve, and deltaV-wise their low dry mass can nearly make up for their abysmal Isp when the payload is small.

Here\u0027s a group that went on an R\u0026amp;D mission to see how small they could make an eve lifter. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140246-lightest-eve-lander-challenge-v11x-v12x/\u0026amp;page=1\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ELink\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 I think I\u0027ll stick to simple in this case, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the hardest parts of Eve missions for me is getting the Kerbal back up to their command pod / command chair. A nice alternative to coating your rocket with ladders is placing command pods on cubic struts on radial decouplers near the bottom and (optionally) top of your ship. Instead of climbing, simply (never simple in practice) get your kerbal into the bottom pod and then transfer them straight up to the top! If you\u0027re using a command seat for your launch and so have a decoupling top command pod, it will probably need a couple sepratrons to help it decouple without ruining your day. Just make sure the top command pod is close enough to the command seat that your Kerbal can \u0027board\u0027 the seat easily from the pod\u0027s ladder. I remember once my Kerbal couldn\u0027t quit make it, so I needed to bring the detachable pod halfway up to orbit and transfer in freefall. My mission had the margins, but it was very silly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I think that\u0027s everything, though I\u0027m sure Eve will still contrive something to make your experience a Kerbal one.

I love that they have great power and a large built-in fuel tank. The lack of an underside attachment point presents a challenge, but from experience I think you have to get creative with shielding to survive Eve anyway. You have to be really small or really slow or you just burn up. At about 2300 m/s regular heat shields usually overheat and explode spectacularly. Inflatable shields work even at about 3500 m/s, which is perfect, but you can\u0027t get rid of them without blowing up half your ship. I\u0027m not worried about shielding, though (I\u0027ll bring enough fuel to slow down to a crawl if I have to), and I think the Twin Boar will provide the power I need. It\u0027s the aerodynamics on Eve that are killing me. I haven\u0027t used fins or winglets in so long, my attempt at using them was disastrous. I\u0027ve gotta work on it. I like your idea of draining tanks backwards, as well. I think it\u0027ll help.

You need power to get your speed an altitude up in a hurry (I love Cunjo Carl\u0027s idea about using the Twin Boar for liftoff), but you have to get small in a hurry if you wanna make orbit.
