Then when you hit R on launch, only the LFO-vernor system will work. Once you stage, you\u0027ll have to right-click on the payload tank and turn it back on before its RCS will work, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe alternative is to use mono on all stages instead of vernor engines on the lifter. Then put some small mono tanks on the lifter. The way mono works these days (it seems to change every few builds) is it starts draining the lowest tank in the rocket and works its way up to the nose. Thus, you can make it so the lifter is using its own mono supply instead of the payload during the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis latter method is what I do all the time, and it doesn\u0027t take much mono at all on the lifter. Even big 3.75m lifters with multiple RCS thrusters on all stages only need 2-4 of the small round mono tanks during the typical ascent. So I typically put the small lifter mono tanks on the last stage under the payload (typically the transfer stage) and all stages below that have RCS thrusters, and that\u0027s sufficient for all maneuvers prior to payload separation. And the payload ends up with all its mono tanks full without having to muck about with action groups or disabling the payload tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psyper","CreatedById":90641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T14:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou should be able to set up a custom action group to toggle the rcs thrusters - go to the launch pad - toggle them off - launch and then when you stage toggle them back on again\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FennexFox","CreatedById":111279,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T14:27:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHmmmm....... \u003Cp\u003EWell, in the VAB, you can right-click on the payload\u0027s mono tank and disable it that way.
