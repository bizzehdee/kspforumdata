You put a decoupler on (say) the front attachment node inside the cargo bay in the VAB, with\u00A0a small ship or rover attached to the decoupler. Some struts to keep it from wobbling around during launch.

If you set the root properly on the payload ship, it will attach to the decoupler -- but that last step of getting things to attach properly inside a cargo bay is very fiddly and annoying.

They have there normal uses like space shuttles and cargo planes, then there are other uses. They can be used for hangers by tweaking to 50% open. Ramps can be used to hide LV-N\u0027s for safety.
