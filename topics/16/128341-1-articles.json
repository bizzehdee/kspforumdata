Plant flag obviously needs a Kerbal. Rescues most definitely don\u0027t need you to send a kerbal to pick up another - you just need to get a controlled vessel close enough to switch to the rescued Kerbal. Crew reports need a kerbal on board, so if you get a contract for a survey you need to do it in person. Tourists are Kerbals. And some world firsts are things like stepping foot on another moon or planet - and that foot is generally attached to the Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the common theme is that to get credit for all of these things, or to get them to work, a Kerbal is necessarily involved. Any other unmanned flights are just that: unmanned flights that may or may not qualify for progress. I\u0027m prettry sure that the \u0022fly by a new planet\u0022 world first can just as well be done by a machine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THobson","CreatedById":97709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T08:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for this. \u00A0I now see the document refers to \u0027manned progress\u0027, whatever that is, and not manned vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a related topic: \u00A0Under Leadership Initiative Strategy there is reference to Milestone gains. \u00A0What are these and where would I find a list of ones achieved and ones waiting to be achieved?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-22T08:44:42Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2015 08:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by THobson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
