The problem is, I\\\u0027m having trouble getting it to work with KSP. Although I\\\u0027m able to get buttons to correspond, to a command, I don\\\u0027t know how to get the game to recognize either the throttle, or the movement of the stick itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept for helicopters, the stick works pretty well with FSX, so I\\\u0027m sure it\\\u0027s not a hardware issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll help is appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-14T05:51:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI went to Windows Start, control panel, hardware, devices, it should be listed there as Logitech Attack 3, then right click on it, choose game controller settings (the first menu option), then properties, and a calibration screen should pop up. Run the stick around and the throttle up and down, and it should be okay.
