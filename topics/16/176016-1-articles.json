There are many things in a plane\u0027s design that can cause it to veer. Mostly they veer to the left. If yours is veering to both sides, that is usually caused by \u0022wheelbarrowing\u0022. If you search for that term here on the forums, you will find a lot of information about fixing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-20T03:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshots would help diagnose the problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most common cause is what bewing describes, where the rear wheels break contact with the runway before the front wheel, leaving the craft to wobble like a unicycle down the runway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashyMcCrashFace","CreatedById":187039,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-20T19:09:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMine do that too. The bigger the plane the worse the problem. They always start left and then slowly oscillate. Even when not moving. I\u0027ve tried a lot of stuff. Even back to my auto racing days of toe in/out on the rear. Toe, camber, caster, spring tension, dampening, relation to GC, front rake, different LG sizes, etc. Nothing helps.
