Specifically, adding niceties like parachutes and ASAS (or, really, anything that can be counted as \u0027payload.\u0027) will exponentially increase how big your rocket is. Small increases in ?V require large increases in stage size, and this gets worse as the stage grows. At some point, you need to stick on a decoupler and add another stage. Excluding parallel staging (typically solid/liquid \u0027boosters\u0027 or drop tanks), lower stages should be substantially larger than upper stages. Otherwise, the additional stages will add little (and may end up reducing available ?V).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore thrust (especially in the form of more SRBs) is not always the answer.
