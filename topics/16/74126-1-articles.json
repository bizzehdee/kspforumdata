You should see two lime-yellow tabs on your orbit. These are the ascending and descending nodes - the points at which it\u0027s easiest and most efficient to change your inclination. So set a maneuver node at whichever node comes first, then play around with the normal/anti-normal (up and down) vectors of the node and watch what happens! When you get the inclination change you want, burn at the maneuver node when specified and you\u0027ll be good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pursuedtank","CreatedById":50078,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T18:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou will have to change your inclination at either the ascending node or descending node.

Go to map view and look at your orbit from the side so the orbit looks like a line. The far side of the orbit, and the near side of the orbit should be in line, and the view of your orbit becomes a line rather than a ellipse or circle. You should be viewing from almost the equator. Using the left or right arrow keys, rotate your view around Kerbin until Minmus\u0027 orbit also becomes a line rather than an ellipse or circle. The point where it appears the two orbits cross is where you want to do your burn. Create a node at that point and use the pink triangles (normal/anti-normal) to align your orbit with Minmus\u0027 orbit. After you\u0027ve done this, you go to Minmus just like you would the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other way, is go to map view at Kerbin\u0027s equator and turn until Minmus\u0027 orbit is a line as I described above. Wait until KSC is under that line, and then launch into orbit, but rather than making your gravity turn at 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, make it at 76\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA or 104\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA (I think Minmus\u0027 inclination is 14 degrees).
