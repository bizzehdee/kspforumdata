Make sure your decoupler is one size smaller than the upper stage tank, so that it doesn\u0027t interfere with the fairing. If you have Editor Extensions, you can even offset it down as much as you want to avoid having to use a girder. Then, place the fairing base directly below the decoupler, and build it so that it closes onto the edge of the upper stage tank. A fairing in this configuration provides additional support to the joint, so having your upper stage hinging on a small decoupler (or girder) will no longer be an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
