This whole phase is fairly easy, but most novice players just can\\\u0027t seem to get it. I was the same way. No fear....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should already have built a rocket with the capabilities to get to the mun, so I won\\\u0027t go into that. But if you sincerely can\\\u0027t make a moon rocket, just modify all your .cfg files like a cheater and give yourself a low burn rate, infinite fuel capacity and high thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt T-1 second, you should lift off from the pad and head straight up until you are 6,000m from the surface of Kerbin. At this point, you want to begin a yaw to the left. Your rocket\\\u0027s nose should be pointed to the right of your screen. The degree on this is going to be no more than about 60 degrees. If you\\\u0027d like, roll your rocket until \u0027W\u0027 points you in the direction of orbit, but I recommend just pressing \u0027A\u0027. Engage your stabilizers and adjust if you have to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen up your orbital map and look at your Apoapsis rise above the Earth. If you\\\u0027re yawed over enough, your blue line indicating your trajectory should be extended fairly quickly. If you can get your blue line all the way around Kerbin to establish a PE before your AP reaches 100KM, that\\\u0027s your best bet. But regardless, shut your engine down (MECO) when your AP reaches 100KM. The wider your blue line is wrapped around Kerbin the better. Now sit in your parabolic trajectory for a little bit. Open up your orbital map and look at your Apoapsis. Warp a little bit until your rocket gets very close to that Apoapsis. When you reach it, pitch your rocket over until it\\\u0027s perfectly horizontal (on the right artificial horizon of your NAVBALL) and burn at 75% - 100%. You should see your blue line wrap around and have a PE extend out really quickly while your AP remains constant. When the two spin around each other and both say ~ 100KM, MECO your engine. Now you wait...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMAKING A TRANS-LUNAR INJECTION BURN\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the phase where you launch to the mun. Sit in orbit, carefully pointing the nose of your rocket in your direction of travel (pro-grade burn coming up) and wait. You will constantly have to correct to keep your rocket on line. Warp for a little bit until you see the mun JUST START to rise over the Kerbin horizon. Return to normal time-rate. Point straight towards the mun -- if low over the horizon -- or just burn pro-grade. Your T.L.I. (Trans Lunar Injection) burn will be at 80-100%. Watch your Apoapsis extend outward towards the Mun\\\u0027s orbit around Kerbin. When your apoapsis reaches about 11,200KM (just below the mun), shut your engine down. You have approximately 4 DAYS in real time to adjust it exactly how you want it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETRANS LUNAR COAST\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring this phase, you are essentially doing NOTHING. A good use of this time would be just to take a look at your fuel gauges. If you\\\u0027re doing a landing mission, inspect your Lunar Module and make sure it\\\u0027s in good condition. If all of your systems are a go, go into your orbital map view and warp until you get \u0027captured\u0027 by the Mun\\\u0027s gravity. This will be evident by the green line that goes over the Mun. Congratulations, you have just exited Kerbin\\\u0027s gravity, possibly for the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELUNAR ORBIT INSERTION\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis burn is very important. It\\\u0027s called an L.O.I. -- or Lunar Orbit Insertion burn. Basically, what this will do is put you from a hyperbolic trajectory around the Mun into a circularized orbit around it. Watch your rocket head out towards your Periapsis above the moon. The closer you are the better. Execute a Retro-Grade burn at 100% and you will see those green lines extend RAPIDLY out into space on either side of the Mun. The will come together and turn into a blue elliptical line around the mun. Continue the burn until your AP and PE move into a fairly circular orbit around. If you have a PE that is too high, wait until you reach your AP and burn retro-grade. This is indicated by the little yellow circle with an x through it on your navball. If your AP is too high, wait until you hit your PE and burn retro grade. Both of these will circularize your orbit, which is called a \u0027Circularization Burn\u0027. Burn Retrograde at each point to establish an orbit around the mun of about 15KM above the surface. Congratulations, you are now orbiting the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two things you can do here. You can either make a \u0027Trans Earth Injection Burn\u0027 and return to Earth, or you can land. Since you\\\u0027re just learning, I\\\u0027ll teach both, but cover the return first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETRANS-EARTH INJECTION\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Trans-Earth injection is not much different than the Trans Lunar Injection. Once in orbit -- you should be moving from west to East over the Mun -- you will have to point your rocket perfectly horizontal, ready for a Pro-Grade burn. Wait until you see the Kerbin rise above the Mun\\\u0027s horizon and point pro-grade. Execute a 100% burn. Watch your Apoapsis extend outward and let it reach 13,000KM. Shut your engines down. Now it looks like it\\\u0027s pointed way to the left of Kerbin -- which it is -- but this is a good thing... In fact, it is just what we need. Here\\\u0027s what\\\u0027s happening. As the mun rotates around Kerbin, so does your Apoapsis. If it points to the left of Kerbin, when the mun rotates towards the right, your Apoapsis is right on track towards Kerbin\\\u0027s gravity. Open your orbital map and WARP TIME! You should get captured into a really high orbit above Kerbin. Something like 8,000KM or less. This is how you return...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERE-ENTRY INTERFACE\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\\\u0027ve gotten this high orbit around Kerbin, point retro-grade and burn at full speed. Your orbit should head back down to Kerbin and make a return trajectory. Execute what I call, \u0027ALLSEP\u0027 or \u0027All Separation\u0027. Jettison all your stages except your parachutes and get ready to reenter just like you do on any other mission. Once you\\\u0027ve come back to Kerbin, deploy your parachutes and enjoy the fact that you\\\u0027ve possibly made your first Mun mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELANDING ON THE MUN\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on the Mun requires a little bit more skill than a simple orbital mission. Once you\\\u0027ve established your orbit around the Mun, burn retro grade at full speed. We won\\\u0027t even bother with precise landing spots on your first mission. If anyone wants to know, I have a full notebook filled with drawings of orbital mechanics and ways to get to Mars and the Mun that I\\\u0027ve drawn, and so I can send you a screen shot of how to determine a precise landing spot from orbit, but there\\\u0027s no need to right now. Burn retrograde at 100% until your orbital trajectory goes into the surface like a return to Kerbin. Here is where it gets good. Jettison all of your stages except your lunar module and burn retro grade until your velocity equals about 100m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simple list of the velocities as you come down for powered descent is this-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2,000KM - 200m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1,000KM - 100m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1,100M - 50m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.6 KM - 20m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.2 KM - 15m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.1 KM - 14m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E500M - 10m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E200M - 6m/s \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100M - 5.9m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E71M - 4.2 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELunar Contact - 4m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour retro grade indicator will constantly dance around your navball.

Lunar Gravity is very low, so establishing an orbit is like a walk on the park. Burn straight up for about a second and then quickly pitch to almost 170 degrees. Burn at 50% and wait until your Apoapsis reaches 100KM. Your ascent stage should have a lot of fuel. Shut the engine down and wait until your rocket hits your Apoapsis and burn Pro-Grade. Like on Kerbin, this will wrap your trajectory into a near perfect 100KM orbit around the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo see how to return, check the Trans-Earth Injection section of this tutorial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you had a good (first?) mun mission and it will allow you to have a lot more fun with this game.
