Very, very slow, but efficient. The DSM mod has an upsized ion engine, and one or two of them on an interstellar craft can provide respectable thrust for adjustments on an interplanetary trip. However, it\u0027d be good practice to keep a much more powerful liquid engine for injection burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worthy of note that on satellites, the ion engine from MMI.S is quite respectable. It pushes around a satellite well enough, but most importantly allows one to make as many changes to an orbit one wants, without wasting valuable RCS or liquid fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-26T09:40:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2012 09:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by phoenix_ca\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bradley101","CreatedById":39760,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T06:18:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aphox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aphox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey\u0027re also nowhere near being powerful enough to even lift a command pod off the ground.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep space missions ion engine can be used for Lunner landings i use it all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
