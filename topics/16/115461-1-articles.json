I have progressed to the point where I can get into orbit (albeit in an inefficient, non-circular orbit with a high apoapsis - still trying to work out how to get into a near circular LEO of about 100km). However, no matter how shallow my re-entry, the mk16 parachiute always overheats and is destroyed on re-entry.\n\nHow do I renter successfully with just a mk16, which is all that\u0027s available to me at present?"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T07:21:22Z","Content":"Hello, and welcome to KSP ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nOpen it just as you slow down to 300 m/s.

Use the shift and ctrl, or right click on your engine to thrust limit it, to fine tune it as you near circular and you should fine it easy to get a near perfect orbit. The trick is to a) have the mid-point of the burn as close as possible to the periapsis ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) burn in exactly the retrograde vector and c) get the burn done as quickly as possible, without overshooting it too much."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T15:38:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m wondering if the OP has mucked up his staging and has managed to deploy his parachute while in orbit - in which case, yes, you\u0027re doomed and the parachute will be destroyed.\n\nActually, nope. Turn the deployment pressure up as far as you can (0.5) and save some fuel to perform a braking burn somewhere around 10,000m (before atmospheric pressure kills your TWR) - maybe 300m/s dV, enough so that at 4000m you\u0027ll be below 250m/s.\n\nBTW, don\u0027t sweat about circular orbits. Keeping the orbit *mostly* circular if it\u0027s a space base or some vehicle that will be the subject of rendezvous (other vessels moving in to meet them) is nice though not necessary. If you\u0027re just passing by though - there\u0027s almost zero benefits of circularizing your orbits. (the benefit is that maneuver nodes are easier to plan as your planned apoapsis doesn\u0027t change as you move the node. The disadvantage is fuel spent on circularizing it. So a volatile benefit of less stress of your wrist on the mouse, for a substantial cost of actual delta-V).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T15:45:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 03:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T15:46:52Z","Content":"The problem is that by default KSP puts the chutes in the same stage as the last decoupler.
