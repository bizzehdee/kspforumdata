It\u0027s even surprising that you got up a while before it happened. Go in the VAB and look at the CoM versus the CoT with and without your boosters, you should see what goes wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the aerospike engine can\u0027t gimbal, making it a LOT harder to keep it together hear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle is a miracle of engineering, but a nightmare in KSC. Mainly because engines can not gimbal apart. The shuttle\u0027S engines could gimbal over 10 degrees, and the platform on which they were fixed to the shuttle was also angulated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem here is that the trust of your skipper is way too unbalanced regarding the aerospike. Removing the skipper completely might be a better solution. And thus, to keep going up, you will need more engines on the shuttle. Normally a tricoupler with three LV-T45 does the job. But then the other side is unbalanced, so you might want to change the liquid boosters to SRBs, that offer a way better TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever you do, you have to be ready to accept that your space shuttle isn\u0027t going to look like it\u0027s real world equivalent. Usually the further it looks from that the better it works \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people use radial engines at key places to make it work properly.
