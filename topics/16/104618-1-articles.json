I know that I can change the values in the config files, but there are so many, especially when you take mods into account. Is there a plugin or a separate config file perhaps, that can \u0022overwrite\u0022 the other config files? \n\nThanks in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T21:06:30Z","Content":"Except for Goo and Material bay, you can send the result once and redo the science but keep the second one. It should be not far from maxing anything."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T21:15:55Z","Content":"Returning three results will return 98%\u002B of the available science points. I call that \u0022good enough\u0022.\n\nAs to your question about modding it, I guess the answer is *Module Manager*. Know too little about using it to tell you anything of substance, though."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T21:17:48Z","Content":"Mhhh, what I often do is store the experimental data in the command pod (EVA with a kerbal, get close to the experiment in question) and then do the experiment again, leaving the data in the experiment. This does however not work with goo canisters or material bays, as these need to be cleaned out to repeat (using the mobile processing lab)."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T21:20:02Z","Content":"Does it work to bring back 2 exact same experiment (with same starting conditions) ? Do they add when back on Kerbin ? I\u0027m not sure."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T21:23:49Z","Content":"You can get eg. three goo pods from the same biome in the same situation and they will all give you science, however not three times the full value, you will get one for full value, one for (just guessing) like 30% and one for 10%. I am completely sure of this, however I never bother returning more than two samples for one experiment\u0026biome\u0026situation."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T21:27:38Z","Content":"Ok I thought that only the first one would count. nice to know.
