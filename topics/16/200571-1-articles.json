class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure there\u0027s a mathematical solution to this: if you\u0027re planning to send a ship out of Kerbin orbit, is it better (or is there a trade-off) to launch it into a lower or higher parking orbit prior to the transfer burn to the destination?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a little more complex than a simple higher/lower choice.\u00A0 Yes, as others have said, the Oberth effect is important and yields great returns for expended propellant, but there is more going on than a straightforward relationship of \u0027go lower = go\u00A0faster = go better\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing to keep in mind is that there are different requirements for different destinations.\u00A0 In order to make an interplanetary transfer, you need a specific hyperbolic excess velocity\u00A0that\u00A0is different for each planetary destination (and different for each transfer window, too, owing to inclination and eccentricity variations).\u00A0 This excess velocity is called that because it is the velocity that your escaping craft still has at the point of escape from its original sphere of influence (i.e., Kerbin\u0027s), and thus is \u0027extra\u0027 velocity not needed to escape.\u00A0 However, because you need to add that velocity in with the initial ejection burn (in essence, \u0027storing\u0027 it\u00A0for later), it interacts mathematically with the other energy of the burn and thus affects the outcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, in order to effect a transfer from any closed orbit, you need to reach escape velocity first--otherwise, you can\u0027t leave!\u00A0 Therefore, any manoeuvre to escape a closed orbit about a planet or other gravity source has to account for \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E the escape velocity (to begin the transfer and break free from the parent body) \u003Cem\u003Eand also\u003C/em\u003E the hyperbolic excess velocity (to finish the transfer and carry the vessel the rest of the way after leaving the parent).\u00A0 \u00A0The equation that combines these yields a value called the burnout velocity, which is the velocity your vessel needs at engine shutdown.\u00A0 Burnout velocity, in turn,\u00A0is the sum of your orbital speed and your manoeuvre delta-V.\u00A0 Rearranging it a bit, your manoeuvre delta-V is thus the required burnout velocity minus whatever assistance your orbital speed can give you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis implies that either decreasing the required burnout velocity or increasing orbital speed saves delta-V.\u00A0 This is true, but the Oberth effect only affects the second part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbital speed increases as altitude decreases,\u00A0but so does escape velocity.\u00A0 To illustrate the\u00A0concept better, consider this:\u00A0 at infinite distance, your orbital speed is zero, because you\u0027re not in orbit.\u00A0 At infinite distance, your escape velocity is also zero, because you\u0027ve escaped.\u00A0 However, when in a closed orbit, your orbital speed must be\u00A0less than escape velocity, because it\u0027s a closed orbit.\u00A0 Therefore, as your orbital altitude increases to infinity, both your orbital speed and escape velocity go to zero, but escape velocity goes to zero slightly faster because it\u00A0starts\u00A0from a higher value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour needed ejection delta-V is a combination of three values.\u00A0 First, there is the hyperbolic excess velocity, which is a constant for a given transfer.\u00A0 Second, there is the escape velocity, which is inversely proportional to altitude.\u00A0 Third, there is the orbital speed, which is also inversely proportional to altitude.\u00A0 At low altitudes, orbital speed is high\u00A0and so is escape velocity.\u00A0\u00A0Specifically, the escape velocity dominates the burnout velocity term.\u00A0 As the altitude rises, the escape velocity decreases faster than the orbital speed does, so the orbital speed gains a slight edge and that reduces the manoeuvre delta-V costs.\u00A0 However, soon after that, the escape velocity reduces to a point that it no longer dominates the burnout velocity term--eventually, the constant hyperbolic excess velocity portion takes over.\u00A0 Since hyperbolic excess velocity\u00A0is not dependent on altitude, increasing altitude after this point only reduces the orbital speed and thereby increases the manoeuvre cost, which is the Oberth effect in action (albeit in reverse).\u00A0 The concept is called the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Egate orbit\u003C/em\u003E, and is built entirely on the notion of striking a balance between the Oberth effect and the ejection requirements at different altitudes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, I took the first\u00A0Kerbin-Duna transfer window and a fairly typical hyperbolic excess velocity of 920 m/s.\u00A0 With that value in mind, the optimal transfer altitude to conduct the ejection burn is 7,745 km (as seen in the altimeter; the distance-from-centre is 8,345 km), and a transfer from this altitude costs 650.5 m/s.\u00A0 The best transfer I could find in that window has a hyperbolic excess velocity of 855 m/s, and its optimal altitude is 9,062 km with a manoeuvre cost of\u00A0604.6 m/s.\u00A0 By contrast, transferring from a 100 km low Kerbin orbit on that same transfer costs 1,060.9 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem, of course, is that it costs 1,200\u00A0m/s to get to 9,062 km\u00A0from 100 km.\u00A0 That trade-off actually trades away all of the savings from choosing the optimum altitude and costs extra besides, but the information is still useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, if you are assembling a large interplanetary vessel in orbit, there\u0027s something to be said for assembling it in the gate orbit.\u00A0 The cost of putting the vessel there is borne by the assembly craft and propellant tankers, not the vessel itself.\u00A0 Also note that the gate orbit for Duna is reasonably close to the Mun, which is a reason for having a fuel infrastructure there--and if you want to transfer from the Mun directly to Duna, then you can multiply the effect (that is to say, choose the gate orbit for a Mun hyperbolic excess velocity equal to an ejection burn to Duna from Kerbin at the Mun\u0027s altitude) and see even greater savings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna and Eve gate orbits are fairly high because they don\u0027t have large hyperbolic excess velocity requirements for the transfer.\u00A0 A gate orbit to Jool, on the other hand, is at about 270\u00A0km (but that makes it a good place to put a Kerbin-Jool propellant depot or embarkation station if\u00A0you want one).\u00A0 This is because, as the hyperbolic excess velocity increases, you need to get more from the Oberth effect to supply that velocity.\u00A0 Alternatively, to use my illustration from above, a higher hyperbolic excess velocity comes to dominate\u00A0the burnout velocity term that much sooner as altitude increases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other reason that gate orbits are useful is because they assist with interplanetary operations at the destination.\u00A0 Suppose that you want to send a vessel to some distant place, but you also want to return it to Kerbin.\u00A0 Sending it to the gate orbit at the destination\u00A0allows you to \u0027start\u0027 at that higher orbit for the return trip and thus obtain all of the delta-V savings that you can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

a lower orbit is better. Ideally you\u0027d want to be as close to the atmosphere as possible - and if your craft is properly drag optimized, you\u0027d even want to be inside the atmosphere. I\u0027ve seen missions that circularized at a 10 km orbit to maximize the Oberth effect as much as possible, since the crafts had so little drag. I prefer a 72-75 km orbit, except for when I\u0027m feeling particularly lazy, in which case I go into a higher orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLow \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E actually isn\u0027t an issue for low orbits, as long as you plan properly. Even if you don\u0027t have the requisite thrust to weight ratio, you can split the burn into multiple smaller burns so you don\u0027t accidentally do an atmospheric dive. This also does more of the burn at periapsis when you\u0027re moving faster, taking extra advantage of the Oberth effect. This also has been addressed in previous comments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main problem with periapsis kicks is that if your destination is outside Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, you need to perform an ejection burn, which might take a long time. If your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is low enough, then something like a 10 minute ejection burn just isn\u0027t going to work. However, if you\u0027ve needed to optimize cost and/or mass enough to require that low of a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, then you are probably going to benefit from gravity assists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing gravity assists, you can actually get anywhere in the Kerbol system for only the cost of the initial Mun transfer. This means that all you need to do is wind up your orbit to the Mun\u0027s orbit, which doesn\u0027t suffer from any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E limitation. This is actually the cheapest possible way to get anywhere in the system, so it\u0027s a very useful trick even when you don\u0027t strictly need it. I\u0027ve done a bunch of missions using this flight path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first step is to get an orbit that is just below the Mun\u0027s orbit, and get a gravity assist that passes behind the Mun, throwing you into a higher orbit of Kerbin. Then, do it a couple more times to eject from Kerbin with as much energy as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a problem with this, however: the energy from Mun assists isn\u0027t actually enough to get anywhere by itself. It\u0027s just short of an Eve or Duna transfer. This means that instead of ejecting with maximum energy, you need to eject into an orbital resonance with Kerbin. What this means is that the period of your orbit, divided by the period of Kerbin\u0027s orbit, forms a nice fraction, like 6/5 or 5/6 or 4/5. Then, after a few orbits, you\u0027ll encounter Kerbin again, letting you do another gravity assist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gravity assist won\u0027t be off of Kerbin, however, Since you left Kerbin with a certain velocity, you\u0027ll encounter Kerbin with that same velocity. You won\u0027t gain any extra energy from swinging around Kerbin. Instead, you use the Mun another time, passing behind the Mun while you\u0027re on a hyperbolic trajectory. (To encounter the Mun in the right place in its orbit, do a burn one or two orbits before, in order to adjust your orbital period).

Normally, when you do multiple assists from one body, it\u0027s because you have a deep space maneuver half an orbit away, in order to increase your relative velocity. While this is more efficient than a naive direct burn, it\u0027s still less efficient than a completely ballistic trajectory.

You want to do as much of the burn as close to periapsis as possible for this exact reason. Cosine losses aren\u0027t actually a problem because gravity is redirecting your velocity. If cosine losses were a problem, then doing two prograde burns on opposite sides of the planet would cancel each other out. Instead, they raise you into a higher orbit (Hohmann transfer).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to compound the pedantry (sorry; I couldn\u0027t resist), but my example was to illustrate that the benefit of periapsis kicks over a single burn does not come from the Oberth effect.\u00A0 Yes, as the apoapsis rises higher, the speed at each periapsis encounter for subsequent kicks increases, and therefore the Oberth effect also increases;\u00A0however,\u00A0these increases occur whether you do it in one burn or in ten.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe principal benefit\u00A0of doing periapsis kicks is that it allows one to concentrate the manoeuvre in space (at the cost of time) at the periapsis, thereby coming closer to a practical realisation of an instantaneous burn than would be otherwise possible.\u00A0 In that respect, since the proximity to the periapsis means that the velocity at the time of the burn is closer to the maximum possible, it is also true that there are tiny increases to the Oberth effect from kicking over not kicking.\u00A0 However, I contend that these increases are irrelevant\u00A0because failing to kick results in far greater cosine losses, and the point of kicking is to avoid those losses.\u00A0 Furthermore (for the sake of completeness), a more powerful engine that does not need to kick \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E concentrates the manoeuvre at the periapsis, which also means that the velocity is closer to the maximum possible, which gives the same increase to the Oberth effect--in other words, the principal benefit of kicking is still in that it allows a weaker engine to pretend that it is a stronger one by burning multiple times in (nearly) the same place and with reduced cosine losses, not that kicking in itself somehow grants more benefit from the Oberth effect than one may otherwise realise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut in a different light, consider the vis-viva equation.\u00A0 The orbital speed at a specific radial distance on an orbit, given that the primary is constant (for simplicity\u0027s sake, let\u0027s assume that we\u0027re just working in Kerbin orbit) is dependent only on the semi-major axis and that radial distance.\u00A0 Unless you are at an apsis or on a circular orbit, any valid radial distance corresponds to only two points on a given orbit.\u00A0 Let\u0027s further assume that the radial distance we\u0027re interested in is that of the periapsis, since we\u0027re talking about periapsis kicks.\u00A0 That reduces the number of corresponding points to one.\u00A0 Since the vis-viva equation is in three variables, and one of them (the radial distance at periapsis) is held constant for the purpose of periapsis kicking, the other two variables can only vary with one another.\u00A0 What this means is that for a given orbital speed at a given periapsis, there is only one possible semi-major axis, but it also means that for a given semi-major axis, there is only one corresponding orbital speed at that periapsis.\u00A0 As you kick at the periapsis and increase speed, the semi-major axis increases with that speed (and so does the Oberth effect), but that will\u00A0happen anyway whether it is done in one burn or a pulsed series of kicks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason that this is important is because it means that the interval between kicks is irrelevant.\u00A0 By necessity and the requirement of burning at the periapsis, the interval is limited to a discrete integer number of orbits, whatever the orbital period may be, but\u00A0that\u00A0interval can be zero and it still works\u00A0because a single (instantaneous) burn can be considered as the limiting case of an infinite number of periapsis kicks with an infinitesimal\u00A0interval between them.\u00A0 The Oberth effect operates on that orbital speed regardless of whether the speed is reached in one burn, which is to say that the Oberth Effect does not increase because of periapsis kicking.\u00A0 It increases because the periapsis speed increases, however one may choose to accomplish\u00A0that and no matter how long it takes to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, I contend that cosine losses are a problem precisely because gravity is redirecting your velocity.\u00A0 Prograde burns at the apsides are efficient because the prograde direction at those points is exactly perpendicular to the force of gravity.\u00A0 Outside of those points, either the prograde direction is not perpendicular, in which case some of the burn is lost fighting gravity, or else the perpendicular to gravity\u00A0is not prograde, in which case some of the burn is lost fighting the orbit.\u00A0 This is mathematically inescapable because the perpendicular to a tangent of\u00A0an ellipse (this tangent corresponds to prograde) does not go\u00A0through the focus except when it is\u00A0the major axis (which is the line of apsides for an orbit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, the reason that burning prograde at opposite sides of an orbit does not cancel out is not because of the direction, but because velocities in orbit are not strictly additive.\u00A0 There are certainly exceptions at various times and places, to be sure, but it is the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eenergies\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0that add, not the velocities.\u00A0 A prograde burn at periapsis and an equal prograde burn at apoapsis are burns in opposite directions, but they both correspond to an energy increase in despite of their cancelling directions.\u00A0 Total specific orbital energy is time-invariant (meaning that it is constant for a given orbit), but that total is the sum of a perpetually-shifting exchange between specific potential and specific kinetic energy.\u00A0 Specific potential energy at a given point relates only to your radial distance from the primary,\u00A0specific kinetic energy relates only to your speed, and total specific orbital energy relates only to the semi-major axis of the orbit.\u00A0 Burning prograde at the periapsis raises the apoapsis because it increases the specific kinetic energy, and since the specific potential energy does not change (since you are still at the periapsis), it must also increase the specific orbital energy, which is reflected by an increased semi-major axis.\u00A0 Burning prograde at the apoapsis also increases the specific kinetic energy, and since the specific potential energy does not change (since you are still at the apoapsis), it also increases the specific orbital energy by increasing the semi-major axis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camacju","CreatedById":207172,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-24T21:32:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t actually put that much thought into this.
