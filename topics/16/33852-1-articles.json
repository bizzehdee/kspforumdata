It\u0027s not that I consider mechjeb users kids with training wheels, it\u0027s I would consider it training wheels if I used it for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways I now have Eeloo and Moho intercepts and returns under my stock belt and figured I would share what I have learned and learn what others do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo figure an intercept I start with Alex moon\u0027s calculator which gives a departure window. From there on the appointed day I use the node finder by picking a spot and then progressing it up to about where Alex\u0027s calculator says I should be burning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I select my node finder and move it around my current path (selecting the center of it and dragging it around kerbal) till I get a peraposis close to my target planet\u0027s path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then pan over to the planet I want and ensure that my vertical angle on the node finder is correct to cross the planet\u0027s path with my own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I select the planet I am aiming for and target it. Then I go back and Move the pro grade / retro grade on my node finder until the little tags show up to show how far apart my ship and the planet will be in the future at the intercept point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there it\u0027s just a matter of playing with the prograde/retrograde as well as the 90/180 degree markers to push the two tags together until I get an intercept (ie push your orbit out with prograde and then in with the 180 degree burn several times). If it is really off you might even have to increase your vertical axis (goig out of the plane of the planets) to get the desired intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that I check my final DV and confirm its similar to Alex\u0027s calculator\u0027s calculated amount and burn for my target. No mechjeb needed and I am typically within 5% of optimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you other stock navigators do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T22:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the funny thing: MechJeb does nothing to help with this.
