Your docking ports are stack attached to the fuel tanks on the engine pods whereas the OPs docking ports are radial children of the fuel tank. Fuel can only flow radially from parent to child. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in your design the tanks in the stack can feed the engine, but the forward radial tanks cannot since they can\u0027t feed fuel back into the main stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe OP\u0027s design should not need many fuel lines, on the engine modules running from one set of docking ports to the fuel tank should do it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/853/4vzb.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img853.imageshack.us/img853/4163/4vzb.png\u0022 alt=\u00224vzb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming of course that docked ports behave the same as assembled ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T10:29:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had similar setup, just with engines in the middle and fuel tanks on sides.
