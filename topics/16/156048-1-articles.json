First, you know that if you start your target spinning, you can stop it by timewarping for 1 second? Second, speed doesn\u0027t matter. It\u0027s all about touching your target at a nearly 90 degree angle to its surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKlaws are extremely powerful devices -- being able to dock to things that don\u0027t have docking ports. Grabbing debris. Picking things up off the ground. They make up for that by being finicky about making the grab. 90 degrees is the key. Come in very slow, make sure you know which control direction is which, line things up in one dimension at 90 degrees, and at the last second make whatever adjustment you need to line things up in the other dimension. If you bounce off, kill your retrograde velocity, timewarp to stop any rotation, and come in very slowly again. If your target has a flat side, it can help to maneuver around until you are facing the flat side. It\u0027s much easier to touch something flat at a 90 degree angle than something curved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love klaws. I use them all the time, and I prefer them to docking ports for almost all things.

If your vessel is 2.5m profile, your Klaw is good for grappling asteroids. And not the small, class A ones either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMK1 pods are very good against heat, I\u0027d worry about the rest of the vessel more. You need to grapple a relatively flat surface, so you should do it from the MK1 pod\u0027s bottom side. Grappling the cone will be a challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAngle matters, speed not so much, as long as it\u0027s not too high. You may throttle up minimally right before contact, that way if alignment is not perfect, the target instead of being bumped away, will \u0022ride\u0022 on the klaw and may hopefully align itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut primarily, make a dedicated rescue vehicle. Or a whole carrier of these. Terrier, a medium 1.25m tank, parachutes, drogues, airbrakes, klaw, probe core, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, reaction wheel, antenna, solar, light, all that jazz. For \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E that\u0027s more than enough. For Mun and Minmus add one more stage of large 1.25m tank and Terrier. Put four, or six, or so of these under a single fairing, launch on a 2.5m launcher into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, every time you have a rescue contract separate one and do your contract. Be it part, part\u002Bkerbal or just kerbal recovery. Airbrake gently, PE of 53km or so, multiple passes if needed, burn the rest of fuel before reentry, and with airbrakes\u002Bdrogues\u002Bchutes you\u0027ll land anything - the heavy parts like MK3 cockpit or passenger cabin are durable enough that they\u0027ll survive the mistreatment of landing on too few parachutes. Anything lighter will be slowed to safe speeds - maybe except the lab (still need to find one in orbit) - in which case, just dock another rescue drone for more drag and more chutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Acolyte","CreatedById":173922,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-06T14:48:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThx for the tips.
