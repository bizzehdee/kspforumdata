Somehow I balanced this for Mk2 but still I want hear some tips about it since I know I will have this issue in future.\n\nI find it helpful to build spaceplanes using the same sort of mental process used to build a rocket---think in terms of \u0022stages\u0022. Even though the spaceplane itself is an SSTO, switching from jets to rockets is analogous to staging boosters.\n\nSo as with a rocket, first I build the essential mission payload package (cockpit, docking port, RCS fuel, SAS, probe core, antenna, electrical stuff, plus whatever cargo and/or passenger space). This wad of parts needs sufficient rocket dV and TWR to reach orbit from where the jets die and then either rendezvous with a station or de-orbit, so now I start adding the LFO tanks and rocket/RAPIER engines to the payload. I use either MJ or KER to make sure I have the TWR and dV necessary for this \u0022stage\u0022. If you assume the jets will give you about 1200-1500m/s, then the rockets will need to add about 1000m/s to your speed to reach LKO, plus say 500m/s more for orbital maneuvering. However, given atmospheric drag and Isp effects, and the fact that I haven\u0027t yet added jet fuel tanks, wings, landing gear, etc., I need at least 2000m/s for this \u0022stage\u0022 at this point in the build. More is helpful. Also, TWR with full LFO tanks needs to be at least 1.5.\n\nNOTE: If using RAPIERs, you\u0027ll probably have to right-click on them and change them to rocket mode so you get the proper numbers in MJ/KER. Don\u0027t forget to switch them back to jet mode before proceeding further.\n\nWhile building the payload/rocket \u0022stage\u0022 of the spaceplane, I also use RCS Build Aid to manage my CoM. Ultimately, I want the full and empty CoMs to correspond so that trim doesn\u0027t change during flight and RCS translation when docking doesn\u0027t cause rotation. Also, it would be nice if the CoM was near the middle of the cargo bay so that moving things in or out of the bay doesn\u0027t hose the trim. So I rearrange the order of the parts in the core until I get close to what I want, bearing in mind that when I add the jet fuel tanks, wings, and whatnot later I can fine-tune CoM position.\n\nOK so now it\u0027s time to build the jet \u0022stage\u0022. This consists of LF-only tanks, intakes, wings, and (if needed) separate jet engines, plus landing gear. Also lights, ladders, and whatever other doodads you want. You don\u0027t need a whole lot of jet fuel but you do need a TWR of at least 1.3 with full tanks (more is better), and remember the \u0022precooler\u0022 intake part holds some. In general, for a Mk2 or smaller spaceplane, a single Mk1 fuselage LF tank \u002B 1 precooler \u002B 1 shock cone intake per jet/RAPIER is sufficient for both ascent and any atmospheric flying you need to get back to the runway. Again, use RCS Build Aid to manage your CoM during construction, then adjust wings to put the CoL where it needs to be.\n\nThe final touch, once all the major components are in place and the CoM is how you want it, is to add the RCS thrusters. Again, use RCS Build Aid to balance them out so you don\u0027t get undesired roll when translating. That\u0027s about it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) Some general tips about building Mk3 space plane?\n\nI build them exactly the same way as Mk2 and Mk1 spaceplanes. It\u0027s just more tedious because you need to spam a lot of small engines. We really need a 2.5m RAPIER ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) I have Mk3 space plane in work and currently I am having issues of plane that after 20km has nose down tendency.

Somehow I balanced this for Mk2 but still I want hear some tips about it since I know I will have this issue in future.\n\nI do this by trial and error. Launch with full tanks and once you\u0027re in orbit see how much surplus LF or OX you have left. Then revert to SPH and take out that amount from your tanks to achieve balance.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) Some general tips about building Mk3 space plane?\n\nUse lots of engines ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif). What I do is attach intake-LF tank-jet combos to the sides of the fuselage. This helps keep the dry COM from moving too much. \n\nAlso, since your craft will be big heavy, you want to minimize drag as much as possible. I\u0027ve found that in 1.0.2 you generally need less wing. Use the least wing as will get you off the runway. For example, in one of my designs I was able to lift a Mk2 plane with only its body lift, the small wing strakes and the rear stabilizer fins \u002B control surfaces. Especially if your TWR at takeoff is higher than 1 you can definitely pull off a design that uses very little wing, therefore less weight and more importantly less drag.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) I have Mk3 space plane in work and currently I am having issues of plane that after 20km has nose down tendency. CoM is always a bit forward of CoL checked that in SPH. Tried with forward canards but not much of help.\n\nWhat I\u0027ve found is that, for some reason, no matter how close your COL is to your COM, in heavier designs the nose will always want to point down and you need to counteract this with control input. In your particular case, if you\u0027re not able to keep the nose up and your COL and COM are already vlose enough, you probably just need more control surfaces."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T21:24:00Z","Content":"Clarify nose down issues: are you having nose down issues when you attempt to pitch up or at all times? (IE can you dive quickly) If you only experience issues when diverging from prograde, you need to either increase control authority (add more surfaces) or decrease craft stability (move CoM back and/or CoL forward). The other less common cause is torque caused by engines, check CoM alignment with thrust vector (RCS aid does this well)\n\nFor air breathers conservative planning dictates 150 LF units per engine. For accent and landing. My gut says a real number is half that. The amount needed is dictated by flight profile. Note landing LF and tweak downward as needed. Budget an extra 40-50 units for cross range on landing if desired.\n\nMk3 is an interesting beast.\n\nModules are heavier than they appear. Plan the Mk3 body to be at least 30 m long. Those parts are draggy and short craft have bad drag to mass ratios. That kind of mass requires a lot of thrust.\n\nYou can mitigate part of the engine count issues by supplementing your design with a rocket engine larger than 1.25 m and optimising your aerobic engine configuration more. You can also leverage that large node at the tail for a more efficient OMS engine and use RAPIERs for supplementary thrust. Regardless, you will need a bunch of aerobic engines.\n\nControl is a constant issue for Mk3 craft. Similar to the volume vs surface area scaling issue, they require a lot of control surface in atmo. In space, despite being near empty, there is still a lot of mass there. Plan to supplement the command module with at least 2 large reaction wheels or use RCS for attitude control. You may want to upgrade RCS translation thrust.\n\nI\u0027m testing out my first career Mk3 plane to deploy payloads. It uses 8 turbo jets and 1 mainsail for thrust. I recon it has about 32 lift from the wings. It flies nicely which is good because it is a bit laggy in atmo.The numbers suggest that it won\u0027t be capable of delivering a full orange tank to LKO, but that\u0027s a future test. It was intended to deliver \u0022small\u0022 nuclear Mk2 space craft to LKO with lower total launch costs.\n\nIn a true tragedy, I design and fly space planes better than rockets. Once you learn their accent profile, they are more forgiving than executing an optimal gravity turn from surface due to the crazy efficiency of jet engines.\n\nDo RAPIERS actually ignore cross-feed rules in rocket mode? I thought it was only for aerobic mode."},{"CreatedByName":"seaces","CreatedById":131939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T09:11:27Z","Content":"Nose down issue solved. was due the engine torque.\n\nI have managed to make some tinny Mk3 that put in LKO 9t of payload.

Mk2 in hour was ready. \n\nWhich engines are good for Mk3 use turbo jet and then switch to rocket or all way rapiers? This one that put 9t in orbit had 6 rapiers and 1 turbo jet it can do with just 7 rapiers too.\n\nBtw 9t of payload how does that sound too little for medium mk3 cargo bay?
