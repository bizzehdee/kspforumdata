To keep this simple fuel is supposed to flow from the center core to the outer boosters. But I\u0027m not getting any flow to one of the outer tanks. It\u0027s working for the other one. The lines are running in the right direction. I\u0027ve tried replacing them and changing them up but for some reason I\u0027m just not getting any flow to one set of tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore detail, Central core for half of a refueling section. It has a big clampotron on the bottom. There are four boosters around it. First attempt had the central core with two fuel lines running out wards to the first set of booster to drop. So it drains the core then drops in asparagus. There is also a tank and engine on the bottom that also feeds off the last set of tanks so that after all the boosters drop it is still fully fueled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried resetting all the lines. Adding those first center lines individually or simultaneously as a pair. I\u0027ve tried doing four lines to all outer boosters, odd but I thought it might work. For some reason it all works fine with all but one tank. All boosters were added simultaneously. All tanks on the boosters were added four at a time. Every thing seems to fit as it should. I could try to up load pics on it but it would take a dozen for you to be able to look at all the connections and more to show one tank draining in flight while the others don\u0027t. I don\u0027t think it would do much good unless you could play with the thing in the VAB your self.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo have you ever seen an asymmetric problem like this? I\u0027ve done radial engines from a central core before. Are there any rules about how the fuel lines work that might affect this? I\u0027m running out of ideas here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tortoise","CreatedById":68002,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T06:33:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA screenshot is worth a thousand words.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-22T06:54:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2014 06:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tortoise\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T07:07:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou talk about several attempts and what happened to them, so it\u0027s very hard to understand what the current configuration is.
