I do know how the mechanics work and how the nodes are setup manually, but it is a lot easier to click \u0022Hohmann Transfer to Target\u0022 and get the node, than moving the node around trying to find out if you have to advance it three or four orbits.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as said by the players who are against MechJeb. If you use it exclusively and extensively - you will not learn things you can learn. MechJeb is - at least that is my personal opinion - great to see how things should work (then you take over and do it yourself) - and later when you played hours and hours, you can use it to automate repetitive tasks.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-20T09:08:58Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2018 09:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by EricPoehlsen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leopard","CreatedById":167666,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-22T19:42:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you try to play on a mac, when they say you need 4GB of ram, they mean you need 8GB of ram\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you try to play on a console... price up a PC to game on and wait until you can afford it, you\u0027ll still have problems, but there will be a leopard in hells chance of them eventually being fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus it appears to be roughly the same price, and you can game while the domestic authorities are watching programmes that make you want to claw your eyes out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn game:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. learn to dock, its not actually that hard but its more of a knack than a skill, you practice a bit and it clicks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. don\u0027t overly worry about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E, until you\u0027re very good (I\u0027m not) its easier to take more than you need and cope with the extra mass - you can refine later\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. career mode, on \u0022hard\u0022 mode will teach you the game a lot faster than sandbox will\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Flying Kerbal","CreatedById":171547,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-25T03:49:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA little trick I have is when I\u0027m testing some rocket, wanting to take it well up into space and try a few things out, when I have rolled it out to the launchpad but before I launch, I hit ALT F5, saving it as a named quicksave.\u00A0 This means I can then use regular F5 during the test flight, which would mean I would lose the Revert option if I then hit F9, as often as I like, knowing when I\u0027m finished with the test flight, I can reload the named quicksave.\u00A0 It saves cash which I would have to spend if I didn\u0027t do this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-26T14:24:12Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2018 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by The Flying Kerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaotic Evil 42","CreatedById":158416,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-11T02:43:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most important thing I think I learned playing KSP was that I wanted to\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0be\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Wernher von Kerman, a passion I\u0027m still pursuing through college.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, there\u0027s a list of gameplay related things I learned that are really important (to me)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

The range of tutorials, spacecraft, and stupid inventions never ceases to amaze me. The best part, though, is the modders. Kerbal wouldn\u0027t be the same without its mods. The base game is incredible (worth the 20 dollars I sunk into it a million times over) but the addition of everything from life support to future stuff to 7.5m parts to entirely new solar systems and realism overhauls make it something truly special.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. The little things count:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\na. Check your staging. You will blow yourself up on launch.
