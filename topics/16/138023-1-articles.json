Awhile back, I did a very large Jool mission, and I am planning on doing a second one. On the first mission, I barely got home (and actually had to cheat a little bit) due to the lack of fuel. For my second mission, one of my goals is to set up a refueling system for my ships.

One with the crew and equipment and the fuel to get to Jool... and one with the fuel to get you home. You will have two spacecraft: one is your primary mission craft, the other is a fuel tanker. They both take the same transfer window to Jool as two separate spacecraft (hence \u0022flotilla\u0022). You park the tanker somewhere easily accessible (i.e. Tylo) and then go do your stuff with your main craft. When it\u0027s time to go home, you rendezvous with the tanker and fill up before you leave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince upper stages tend to be small, and your existing craft seems to make it most of the way home already without refueling, even a small tanker should help you. Like, just find a way to get a single FL-T800 to Tylo orbit, with a probe core, a docking port and some RCS (and don\u0027t forget that probe cores need power). That should already do it, and require only a small second launch. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-26T07:37:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2016 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T09:29:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of ore mining I would suggest Vall.

As long as you avoid those areas - which are plainly visible from orbit - you should have no problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeeping with your analogy, Pol\u0027s invisible colliders are also quite common near the \u0022mid-ocean ridges\u0022. \u00A0So yeah, they\u0027re predictable, but about 75% of Pol is near one or the other. \u00A0And even if they don\u0027t kill you on the way down, it\u0027s likely that if you leave the ship and return, it\u0027ll be way up in the air when you next see it, from whence it will fall to its bloody, screaming death. \u00A0And besides,\u00A0if you\u0027re mining, you don\u0027t have total freedom in your choice of landing sites--you have to go where the Ore is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, Plusck said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it\u0027s true that going to and from Pol is not without some cost. But I\u0027m not sure that it is greater than the cost of rising out of Vall\u0027s gravity well. And the plane change is minimal.
