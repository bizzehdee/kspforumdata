Basically it can dump heat away faster than standard nacelle.\n\nHmm, looking at cfg files, it seems nuclear engine has emmisivity of 0.85 while this precooler has 0.95... Folks, this is something to attach a nuclear engine to. For vacuum uses ofc.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T23:27:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 11:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Radam**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T00:21:42Z","Content":"Might be good to attach a drill to also. would help keep drills cool??"},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T01:59:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I want to know this too.\n\nAre you asking about the physics or how to use this part in particular?"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T07:07:19Z","Content":"Just to avoid confusion from a resources standpoint, adding a precooler isn\u0027t going to change performance of the engines or IntakeAir system.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
