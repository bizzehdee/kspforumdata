The game puts a default limit (250, I think) to stop things from getting seriously out of hand. In real life, the danger is generally not from the big chunks themselves (spent boosters, other satellites, etc.), but rather from the uncounted millions of tiny bits of debris that gets shed by the bigger pieces: paint chips, metal flakes, etc. That\u0027s not a problem in KSP, which neither includes micro-debris, nor even tests for collisions at all except for the currently controlled ship and whatever\u0027s within 2.3km of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the only reason for dealing with debris is either out of a sense of tidiness, or just as an additional fun challenge to take on.
