Parts only break if they pass through the SURFACE of the water. If you build pontoons out of air intakes (which have minimal drag and weight and additionally big hit boxes so more lift), you can raise your ships out of the water, though maneuverable boats won\u0027t look like the stock battleships. They will look more like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Hydrofoil_old.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Hydrofoil_old.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
