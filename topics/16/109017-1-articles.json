Now, when I check out some videos on Youtube I find that many people are now using the LV-N engine on their crafts, even though a) it\u0027s pretty damn heavy ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) thrust isn\u0027t high therefore c) low TWR. The only positive I can think of is the high efficiency, but otherwise, why are many people using LV-N\u0027s on their spacecrafts? (Apologies for the noob question!)\n\nP.S.

I find a 28t ship with 2 nukes and 3 jets works perfectly. I have gotten it into orbit with 1900 m/s dV remaining.\n\n@Sean Mirrsen, I have edited my own Mk2 parts to have no oxidizer. It\u0027s not hard to do. Just make a new subfolder under GameData (mine is called \u0027LiqFuelParts\u0027) and copy over the relevant files from the Squad parts folder. For example to make a liq fuel only Mk2 bicoupler you need bicoupler.cfg. bicoupler.mu and mk2adapters1m.dds.\n\nThen edit the .cfg file as follows, deleting the Oxidant section and adding units of liquid fuel to compensate.
