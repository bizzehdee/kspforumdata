Lots of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E mods and a few other bits and pieces. But my question concerns Asteroids.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can attach to asteroids just fine, but I can\u0027t seem to determine what resources are on them. I have Community Resource Pack installed, and there used to be an indication of the type of resources an asteroid would have. If I remember correctly it was either by right-clicking the asteroid or using the surface scanner.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince 1.2 however, I can\u0027t seem to find any way to figure out what\u0027s on a rock. Anyone found out how? Without this, it\u0027s really difficult to determine the usefulness of an asteroid or what tanks/drills to bring to mine resources from it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T23:05:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt can\u0027t be from the stock surface scanner. You have to do an orbital scan before a surface scanner will work. And you can\u0027t do an orbital scan on an asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll other resources besides ore are handled by their respective mods. The mod has to place the required info into some menu somewhere. Or\u00A0maybe give you a mod-related part to scan the asteroid and give you the numbers. If your mods can\u0027t do it in 1.2, that\u0027s because the mod hasn\u0027t been updated to be 1.2 compatible yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kielm","CreatedById":82247,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-04T00:51:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0You\u0027re right of course, I feel like such a dunce.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI completely forgot how the mechanics of scanning had changed in the last few updates, it never occurred to me that it would\u0027ve affected asteroid resources too.
