First attempt with a plane, I inevitably then ran into the problem that anything parachuting or falling will be removed if you\u0027re more than 2.5km away! So, while I can manage when doing a low and slow flypast in a plane before going into a hard turn just after release, it does rather scupper my plans to scatter a load of parachute probes over EVE in a single grazing flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, is there any way to alter or remove this auto-remove range? Or could someone create a mod to do so? I realise it could potentially increase either game load or instability, but I don\u0027t have any particular knowledge of specifics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Oh, and yes I could just swap to control the probe and ride it down - but like I said, I\u0027d like to be able to scatter probes widely from a rocket or at greater altitude and speed from a plane).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-20T15:12:38Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2013 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nick Seafort\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"duncan1297","CreatedById":57230,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T14:49:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethere is a mod that increases that distance to 95km but i don\u0027t remember what it was called.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceGremlin","CreatedById":65961,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T15:02:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need Romfarer\u0027s Lazor System.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T15:05:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mod you are looking for is the Lazor system mod by Romfarer, though I don\u0027t know for certain changing distance works in 0.22 yet.

Although you can prevent your probes from despawning, parachutes stop working on nonpiloted vessels (I think the game stops simulating physics once you are X distance from something) and if you switch focus to them, you\u0027ll receive the message \u0022cannot switch focus while in atmosphere\u0022.
