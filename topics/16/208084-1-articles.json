I look forward to the comebacks every time seriously......\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-10T21:25:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224130135\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208084\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221652205328\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219852\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TokiGlassBlower\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, TokiGlassBlower said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts funny how every time I say I\u0027m on a Console everybody stops talking to me\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know of other instances, but simply there isn\u0027t anything more to say for this question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou asked how to improve your landing struts. you got a bunch of answers of things to try. that\u0027s it. your question was answered. the console business came as a consequence of me suggesting alt-f12 to test faster, and that\u0027s answered too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TokiGlassBlower","CreatedById":219852,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-11T00:21:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy question was not answered you said it yourself \u0022I got suggestions\u0022 which are not answers if you think I got an answer ill disagree, every question I\u0027ve asked since joining this forum have not been answered with a solid answer and an explanation as to why or the physics of why something should be done a certain way, I get suggestions or a well I\u0027ve never had that problem but here\u0027s what I would do or even I don\u0027t know but here\u0027s what I would do which are not helpful at all. who\u0027s the PS Moderator for this site? or where are the experienced PS for Xbox players?, this site needs a separate Console only forum \u00A0I feel?....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-11T12:39:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224130304\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208084\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221652228469\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219852\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TokiGlassBlower\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, TokiGlassBlower said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy question was not answered you said it yourself \u0022I got suggestions\u0022 which are not answers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthey are answers. perhaps not the kind you expected, but the only kind you can get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, all we have are suggestions because there isn\u0027t one single correct way to do things. if it was the case, then this game would be boring indeed. there is a problem, and there are many things you can try to fix that problem. You pick what seems most convenient, and you try until it works. that\u0027s how you troubleshoot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, we ourselves are not sure what could work and what couldn\u0027t. especially if you don\u0027t post pictures. making a spaceship work is complicated. an experienced player can put together a simple design that will do something simple and will work at the first try. For anything more complicated, we must go by trial and error too. We start with a design, and we refine it along the way. So we cannot just tell you how to make your eve lander works. how do you expect us to know how many landing legs you need for your lander when we don\u0027t know if you lander weights 5 tons or 50 or 500? If you want more detailed instructions, you have to give us more detailed information. Else, if you just want to see a design that works, go on spacecraft exchange subforum and ask for some ready-to-use eve landers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, even if we actually knew exactly how to fix your problems, we wouldn\u0027t tell you \u0022just do X\u0022. This is your game, your choice. And as I said, there isn\u0027t one single way of doing things, so we present you with the different options on how you can do things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFourth, you say you don\u0027t get an explanation of the physics of things and why they should be done a certain way? I see those explanations scattered around the answers, maybe just because I know to recognize them? \u0022 \u003Cem\u003Ethe mammoth is very sturdy and well suited to the task. \u003C/em\u003E\u0022 is an explanation. it explains that you can land a ship on a mammoth engine because that engine is very resistant. \u0022\u003Cem\u003ESoft springs just wallow under load, which with Eve\u0027s high gravity just means they\u0027ll bottom out and break;\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 is another perfectly good explanation for why spring load settings work how they work. that\u0027s just in the first two posts. I don\u0027t know what more explanations you could want, but if you do want them, then you should make more accurate questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFifth, you get \u0022\u003Cem\u003EI\u0027ve never done that but I would try X\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 answers because this game is so vast, chances are nobody is doing what you are doing. A lot of people have landed on eve, but none of them has used your specific design. As for \u0022\u003Cem\u003EI don\u0027t know but I would do X\u003C/em\u003E\u0022, the first point should already cover why we answer that. those are very useful answers, and the best answers you can get. For reasons explained in the previous points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSixth, you using a playstation does not matter. as far as I know, it makes almost no difference. it certainly makes no difference on what ships work and what don\u0027t, and it makes no difference on the answers you can get. You may also notice that there\u0027s only a handful of people regularly answering questions in this subforum, if you want someone using your same console you may not find one. you using ps makes no difference anyway in the kind of answers you are getting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeventh, you started the thread by asking \u0022\u003Cem\u003Ewondering if I\u003Cstrong\u003E should increase? or decrease? the spring or damper strength for an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E landing\u003C/strong\u003E?\u003C/em\u003E \u0022. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199902-jimmymcgoochie/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022199902\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199902-jimmymcgoochie/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@jimmymcgoochie\u003C/a\u003E answered immediately \u0022\u003Cem\u003EMaximum spring, maximum damper\u003C/em\u003E\u0022. As in, increase them to maximum level. that answers your specific question fully. So, you can\u0027t even say we\u0027re not answering your questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEight, when you answer someone by asking additional details, you should quote them in your post. Your quoting ensures that they get a notification that you quoted them, making them more likely to read. if you just answer in the post, many people will simply never read your new question, because they already answered this thread and have no reason to look at it again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, you come here asking vague questions without giving us any details, and you somehow expect us to know exactly how your ship is made and how to fix it just by looking. You expect us to read your mind and give you exactly the answer you want. Even when you get an answer that tells you exactly what you were asking - a simple binary answer to a simple binary question you bolded - you are still somehow dissatisfied. You claim to want explanations for how things work, though you did not ask for them, but when you get them you are still dissatisfied. No, you do not make additional inquiries, or new requests for more details or explanations; you still expect us to somehow read your mind and answer you the way you expect. And you are now blaming us, and making up far-fetched conspiracies where we discriminate you because you\u0027re using playstation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsk better questions, and you will get better answers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
