I recently was doing an EVA and as I manoeuvred my Kerbal, the ship (now unmanned but with a probe core) that he was in close proximity to, moved in unison. I even noticed it\u0027s RCS firing. I\u0027ve noticed this with two ships that arrived at a destination as one unit, but then were separated (both with probe cores or Kerbal pilots). Is there an additional step taken to fully \u0022disconnect\u0022 two vessels (or vessel/Kerbal)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-13T21:48:46Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2015 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Project Pluto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T17:12:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWoah.
