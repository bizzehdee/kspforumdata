I\u0027m not quite a new player (~1100 hours). I still struggle with some projects, including getting larger projects to space, managing stations, and completing missions - both personal and otherwise. Although the KSP wiki is a great tool, I find it\u0027s quite vague and difficult to use for new players. I would like some assistance making a (hopefully) all-en\u003Cem\u003Ecapsule\u003C/em\u003Eing guide for new players. I am hoping to make this a fairly large project with tips and tricks given by as many members as possible. I might make this a youtube video, I might make this a wiki page. I don\u0027t know quite yet. If you would like to help - anywhere from a few tips/tricks to a full blown guide - feel free to comment here or send me a DM for further contact. Again, this is to expand on the tutorials and bring new members a little closer to the rest of the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really hope this goes better than my first attempt at a M\u00FCn landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more thing: if you would like to submit art for the guide, feel free to send me a DM. Don\u0027t worry, I will credit you if I decide to put it in the guide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-23T22:48:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223693341\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189224\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221571848717\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180361\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skywalket\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Skywalket said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na new player (~1100 hours).
