But then something wierd started to happen. All kinds of Parts got structural Failures, even while I had Unbreakable Joints turned on. This may be because I get around 2-3 FpS while launching this beast, but until now it worked fine. After a day of testing I coud not get it to work, so I decided to ask the community for help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the rocket with the heaviest Payload I got to work attached (Currently unstruted, but this picture will give you an idea)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aMzZ5V5l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aMzZ5V5l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now regardingles of what I do this thing keeps getting structural failures:(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So, maybe some of you are able to help me (Maybe also to get the Partcount down, currently it has nearly 900 Parts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29635270/Uranus.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E.craft File\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the Craft is completly Stock, as I have removed the Payload from this one, I just used the Spherical Fuel tanks for Payloads. You can attach any Payload you want, as long as it does not exceed 350 tons The Rocket should not fall appart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not want to Upload the Rocket with a Payload attached, since this would require several mods to load.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoToH","CreatedById":68428,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T21:34:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/31777-Rockets-randomly-coming-apart-in-20-Bug-or\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E can give you more info about your issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T22:13:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith hundreds of tons of payload, you\u0027re going to need a significant number of struts. Just keep strutting everything to everything else until it stops breaking. Especially strut tanks which are vertically connected to eachother, and strut anything capable of producing torque to the pod, or controlling part whatever it may be. But remember, 400 ton payloads are practically the limit of KSP.
