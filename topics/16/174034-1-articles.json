(other than getting a good look at the planet/moon) Are they good in sience/carrer mode? Are they worth the effort and money to put on planets/moons? I do have SOME guesses, but anything other than these, i simply cant find a use...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Transferring Stranded kerbals to bases: say if you have TAC Life support and a kerbal is stranded on Duna, Laythe, etc.\u00A0so you need to send the kerbal to a base to stay there till help arrives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Refueling Ships: By using a rover with a drill-o-matic and a convertotron, they could dock to a lander with no fuel, and fuel it up again. (with the advanced grabbing unit, as i highly doubt that you build your landers with docking ports specifically for rovers\u00A0)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than these 3 uses (which i\u0027ll most likely never take advantage of) i can\u0027t find a use\u00A0 for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-18T04:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, a \u0022probe\u0022 is a robotic ship that flies around in space, and I don\u0027t think that\u0027s what you really mean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as rovers goes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, people do put docking ports on their ships specifically for refueling rovers to attach to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe refueling rovers don\u0027t need converters generally. They usually just have a big fuel tank on them. You have a mining ship that does all the mining and conversion. You attach the refueling rover to it and suck out a full tank of fuel. Drive over to a parked ship that needs fuel and shovel it in. If you have a surface-based miner, there is often no other realistic way of getting the refined fuel out of the miner and into a fuel transport tanker than to use a rover to shuttle between them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor medium-sized\u00A0moons, a nice big stable rover is preferable to a hopper. Hoppers tend to be limited to maybe 5 hops maximum by the exponential cost of lifting all their fuel multiple times. A nice rover can visit every biome and anomaly on a moon, with no fuel cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRacing around at high speed on low gravity worlds can be\u00A0fun and silly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA spaceplane on the ground is a rover. And spaceplanes are very useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, small rovers can be extremely frustrating. They slide all around. On low friction moons, they can be very hard to steer.\u00A0 They can tend to flip over a lot. If you slide into a terrain crease you can break your rover completely. Sometimes they are unable to climb out of craters and end up stuck there forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-18T07:47:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223357373\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174034\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221524027408\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes they are unable to climb out of craters and end up stuck there forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd similar things happen IRL....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot of people play with LIfe support mods too, and using probes to explore planets is a good way to grind some science out before they have unlock all the parts neccesary to do interplanetary missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gogi","CreatedById":168144,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-18T08:16:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use them very early on.

Land one in a celestial body and start gather and transmit science to unlock stuff. If you find yourself in need of just a little more science to unlock the next node, just send your rover to nearest biome to add some extra science. By the time you landed a kerbal there, have them extract the gathered experiment from the rover, which should give you a lot more science to unlock even more tech tree nodes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-20T19:24:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody has mentioned that probes and rovers are a great way to get science early in career or science mode when you\u0027re still limited in terms of researched parts/facility capacity/funds.
