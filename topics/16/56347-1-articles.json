I am at the very beginning of my KSP career but I am already having a blast (actually I had several unwanted blasts already \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E). I have a question regarding the Communotron 16 and Comms DTS-M1. What is the actual difference between them, except the look and is there a way to improve the transmission quality like pointing the antenna towards Kerbal or something like that? I ask this because I am now at a point where I can build a Munar lander and I don\u0027t like the approach where you take all the labs and containers and stuff with you again from the surface, so I want to transmit the data and decouple my return vehicle from the lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMakeItSo!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T12:50:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 12:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MakeItSo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T10:22:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only real difference is weight and transmission time. The DTS-M1 weighs more, has a shorter transmission time, but takes more power than the 16. (This could change with .23). Also, if you have remote tech installed that changes how they work as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MakeItSo","CreatedById":96953,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T12:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
