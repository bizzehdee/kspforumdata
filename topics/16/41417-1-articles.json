Just beware if you detach it, leave it floating for a moment, and then put it back (presumably after changing something ahead of where it was mounted). It knocks down to a single unit while it\u0027s floating and if it was assigned to an action group, when you put it back only the single part that was floating will still be in the action group: all the additional ones placed via the symmetry mode won\u0027t be. It\u0027s really annoying, but easy to fix: You just have to reassign the parts to the action group.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
