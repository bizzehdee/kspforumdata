I\u0027m using the Fat-455 large wings.\u00A0 They hold a lot of fuel, but only liquid. Is there anyway, therefore, to have other tanks be oxidizer only? I realize I can drain liquid fuel out of tanks to save weight, but that still leaves me with a lot of bulk.\u00A0 I\u0027d like to get the most oxidizer in the least amount of space--approx 1200 units--to match what the wings will carry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, it needs to be stock, because I hope to share this mission and want to make it simple for others to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-14T20:32:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKlapaucius,\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0Sorry, no. There are no oxidizer- only tanks in stock KSP. If you modify a tank to hold oxidizer only (you can do that), it will no longer be stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest,\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Slashy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^ Also... you are aware that jets work on Laythe, right?
