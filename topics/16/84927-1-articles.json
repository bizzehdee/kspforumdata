I assume you can change any to rotation or translation to stop throttle control in the opposite mode. Either way, I now have throttle pos control in staging, and incremental in docking mode. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried remapping the trottle up/down for both keyboard and controller buttons and both the raw and increment axis for my controller, but the throttle goes to 0 and stays there no matter what i press.
