Solution?","CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T23:38:40Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T23:38:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am so close to a perfect RTLS capable rocket. Infact Ive nailed it with my first stage. The second is the issue. By time I get back around to the upper stage its already falling back down into the atmosphere. I\u0027m using MechJeb and BDArmory with an edited 750km load range. This way I don\u0027t have to do it the \u0022stock\u0022 way which is a ridiculously steep trajectory which puts the\u00A0first stage at like 100km to give you the time to manually boost the second stage to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo with that 750km load range and MJ I am able to model real life more appropriately with a much more favorable launch trajectory and a 50km staging. And it works. My god it works great. After the boostback MJ lands the first stage square on the runway. But MechJeb is having trouble with the second stage. I don\u0027t know whats happening. Either MJ is shutting down the engine not long after I switch away ( despite the massive load range ) or its hitting the target Ap of 150km ( which sucks I wish I could have this much lower ). I need that high Ap to give me the time to land the booster and switch back. But I also need that high Ap so that MJ with corrective steering can fly to orbit in one burn. Or ateast get close. 750km should be plenty enough. Theres no way I\u0027m hitting that mark and the vessels unloading. But something is happening where MJ cannot fly the upper stage down range far enough no matter what target Ap I set. I return to the craft, the engines immediately throttle up where I left them, but I\u0027m at 40km and falling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts ashame because were it not for this one quirk... this setup is go. Three times in a row this booster lands perfectly, but the upper stage is holding\u00A0it back. So what can I do? I understand this is a unique approach here, but I\u0027m just curious if by chance anyone has any ideas of what I can do. I\u0027m so close to just moving into RSS and doing this there. Because theres no way\u00A0MJ will hit my target Ap before I land and should just keep motoring on, but.. I don\u0027t know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBear with me here...I cant just chuck the second stage to some super high Ap. I need this to be efficient. The upper stage needs 1700 Dv left in orbit for a Duna transfer and injection. So in order for the upper stage to not only boost 75% of the way to orbit and reach low Duna orbit it needs something like 3,4 - 3,700 Dv. A large upper stage for a 3.75m rocket that had to fly back home.\u00A0Its easy to make, but that makes RTLS a nightmare. Because the lower stage needs 1,250 to return. So the heavier the upper stage is the more it cuts into the Dv I can put out with the first stage. Which in turn cuts into the Dv the upper stage needs to fly to orbit. So to help this I can fly a steeper trajectory ( which also helps with ultimate issue here ) But that then cuts into the Dv needed to rtls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat does this have to do with the aforementioned issue?\u00A0Funds is a factor and I cant just throw an overpowered second stage on an overpowered lower stage to 300km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow the \u003Cem\u003Eheck\u003C/em\u003E does SpaceX do it?! At this point its just like holy crap I can take off the landing legs, the thrusters, the rcs, the air brakes and put 30 tons to LDO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-04T23:58:56Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2016 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T00:16:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t have an answer for you because this sounds like primarily a MechJeb issue and I never use MechJeb.\u00A0 One suggestion, though-- when you use a jargon term that\u0027s not in common KSP parlance, like RTLS, it\u0027s not a bad idea to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.allacronyms.com/RTLS/Return_To_Launch_Site\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehyperlink it\u003C/a\u003E or something so that people know what you\u0027re talking about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, if \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/search?q=RTLS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egoogling it doesn\u0027t turn up an obvious answer for what you\u0027re talking about\u003C/a\u003E, you\u0027re likely to confuse people.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T00:23:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have to do it in two stage reusable SpaceX style or would you accept SSTO reusable?
