The last I knew (I think it was the version before the one you have now??) you don\u0027t have to land on any of them to get the first two trophies. For the first trophy, all you need to do is enter the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of the body and then leave the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E again.
