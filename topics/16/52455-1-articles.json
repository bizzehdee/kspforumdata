I like to have a station to science on and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most useful properties of a station is the possibility to house large amounts of fuel in orbit, allowing you to refuel your craft in orbit, greatly extending your operating range. It also makes that you don\u0027t have to deorbit your interplanetary ships, landers etc, and can just keep them in orbit for further use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing i also like is that stations allow you to keep multiple ships together. I dunno why, but i like it organised this way. It prevents me from having a whole bunch of stuff flying around, and allows me to always have fully fueled Munar/Minmus landers in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Collin Dow","CreatedById":64846,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T10:25:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use stations to compensate, I mean, because they\u0027re monumental challenges to the natural world.

Launch and build a station with the Hitchhiker cans, use a reliable launch shuttle to bring crew aboard, then you need only a reliable space bus with 1 or 2 LV-Ns to ferry crew from the space colony to any ship in space that needs to be manned. With a launcher that includes an unmanned probe brain, this allows you to launch new manned ships empty, so that if you didn\u0027t strut enough or pack enough thrust or what have you, you don\u0027t risk any Kerbal lives during the launching procedure. Just get it into stable orbit, ferry the guys from colony to ship, refuel the thing if necessary, and you\u0027re good to go.
