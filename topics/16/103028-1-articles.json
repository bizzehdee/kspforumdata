(i only get the message, that it\u0027s not avaiable in my craft...)\n\ncan someone help me or explain that? is that a bug?\n\nthx!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T12:42:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 12:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KingPhantom**"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T09:47:05Z","Content":"There is no such thing as a standalone SAS module (anymore. There used to be but that was years ago). You have probes, most of which have an SAS module, and you have reaction wheels, which are what used to be called SAS modules. These reaction wheel pieces have as much to do with SAS as RCS jets do. i.e., they don\u0027t give you the ability to use SAS, but if you have it SAS can use them to keep aligned.\n\nA small probe should get by with its own SAS module and its own reaction wheels if it has them. If not, the single smallest reaction wheel should more than suffice. Larger things need more.\n\nNo ship you could ever build should need 1000 of them ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T09:52:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 09:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T09:48:18Z","Content":"Does **the probe** have SAS capabilities?

Reaction Wheels lost SAS before 0.23.5 but you didn\u0027t notice it because every single probe core had SAS. That is not true now. As DeMatt says, the first 2 you unlock do not have SAS.
