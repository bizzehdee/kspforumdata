First post, huzzah!

I used to do that back when it was only 2.5km (it involved an annoying amount of circling) so it should be much easier now with the range 10x higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, you can switch vessels in atmosphere when they are very close to each other. You can conceivably switch to the probe right as you release it, watch it go all the way down and land, and then switch back to the plane. There\u0027s a chance your plane will have crashed by then though, so make use of SAS and trim to keep it flying straight. If the plane goes more than 22.5km away though, it will despawn (and kill any crew on board)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T15:08:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the previous posters said, you\u0027ve bumped up against a basic limitation of the game.

There\u0027s a mod for that, Stage Recovery, which gives you cash credit for the disappearing stages, but that wouldn\u0027t help with your problem because you need the probes to stick around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpryFox","CreatedById":153144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T00:26:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you all so much for the thorough answers!
