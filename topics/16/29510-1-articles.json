Adding batteries can allow your probe to still remain controllable while on the dark side of a planet, if you have enough of them, but they also add weight. If you\u0027re going for a minimalist probe, you can skip batteries, and just time your maneuvers so that your probe doesn\u0027t have to do anything on the dark side of a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
