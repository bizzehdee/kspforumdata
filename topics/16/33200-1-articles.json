Is there a way to get rover wheels (or other parts) to automatically snap to the same point so that they\u0027re all level when building rovers? Currently I just eyeball it, test on the lands around the KSC, then adjust in the VAB. Repeat and rinse.

If you want to launch it on a rocket in the VAB, you can simply save the rover in the Subassembly Loader and load it in the VAB and put a rocket below it, or you can save the lifter and put it under the rover in the SPH and launch from the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"El wonso","CreatedById":37011,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T13:48:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEditorTools:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/31580-Plugin-0-20-EditorTools-(EdTools)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/31580-Plugin-0-20-EditorTools-(EdTools)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
