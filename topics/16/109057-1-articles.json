I have used the shift tool to move them a bit, don\u0027t know if that hurts the strength. They\u0027re also attached to the batteries, don\u0027t know if that puts too much force on a small part or something.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T19:32:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 07:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ScottyDoesKnow**"},{"CreatedByName":"Oafman","CreatedById":110386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T16:21:45Z","Content":"I guess the wheels need to be more closely beneath the CoM of the rover, especially for Eve where it will weigh so much. Try adding a girder underneath the length of the rover, then attach the wheels to that. Then strut from each wheel\u0027s node to the main body. You will lose some stability, as your wheels will be less spread out, but it should be a bit more solid.\n\nIf you\u0027re prepared to mod then there are some great options. The Kerbal Foundries mod springs to mind."},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T17:27:32Z","Content":"Batteries are notoriously wobbly, and your wheels are mounted to them.

The rollover bars and bumpers help quite a bit.\n\n[![txyXR28.png](http://i.imgur.com/txyXR28.png)](http://imgur.com/txyXR28)"},{"CreatedByName":"ScottyDoesKnow","CreatedById":70796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T19:31:45Z","Content":"Thanks FleshJeb, worked like a charm!

I tested the crap out of that construction technique (100\u0027s of kms of full-throttle roving on Kerbin). I think the strength of the part they\u0027re attached to has something to do with the durability. Also, it looks like you strutted the front and back girders together, and that helps with overall craft stiffness. I think having a floppy craft really increases the potential dynamic stress on the wheel joints.\n\nMy only recommendation on your current design would be to move your second pair of wheels farther forward. The front pair takes the most abuse, so that will help unload them. It\u0027s far better to pop a rear tire than a front one.\n\nNow, jump that thing off the launchpad at full throttle and see if you can find areas that need reinforcement. ;-)"}]}
