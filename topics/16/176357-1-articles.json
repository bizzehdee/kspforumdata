A wonkyness I can\u0027t stand. A shock is supposed to dampen the landing a bit, not spring back up and take a craft that weighs tons with it off the ground a couple of times before it finally settles down. Just a poor implementation on Squads part as far as I\u0027m concerned. A rigid leg like the FASA LEM rigid landing legs doesn\u0027t do any of that nonsense. I actually still use those legs on anything I can fit them on for that reason.
