EVERY time I try to land, one or two of the legs explode. Even at speeds of 3.0m/s. I\u0027m landing on a slope of around 15-20 degrees, but this happens even when landing on all of the legs equally. Are these things seriously this poorly programmed? They\u0027re supposed to survive 12m/s.\u00A0 It\u0027s not unreasonable to expect them to survive even half of that. My craft is 15 tons, so that shouldn\u0027t be the issue. Is there anything I can do to fix this? Is there a file I can edit to increase their impact resistance? I\u0027ve seen posts with this exact issue from years ago, so apparently the developers haven\u0027t gotten around to fixing it themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-12T06:42:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2021 06:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by DockingHater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-12T10:03:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n15T is quite heavy for a lander?
