Once you\u0027ve circularised with the rescue vehicle, match the inclination by burning normal or antinormal at the ascending or descending nodes. After that you need to compare the orbits and see whether you need to speed up or slow down to catch him. Might be easiest to move to a much higher orbit and just wait for him to come around. Select him as the target and fiddle about with maneuver node until you get an encounter down to about 1-2km. At that distance Jeb should be able to jet over to the rescue ship pretty easily.
