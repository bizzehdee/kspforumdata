He parked up against the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks, climbed out of his mobile lab and--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026gt;warp\u0026lt; \u0026gt;stretch\u0026lt; \u0026gt;stretch\u0026lt; \u0026gt;poof\u0026lt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome bizarre physics error caused him to flick into the air, stretch wildly in one direction, then another, then explode in a cloud of dust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not complaining about the physics bork; I\u0027m sure someone is already working on that. The question is: my crewman is now listed as \u0022missing\u0022**. He doesn\u0027t appear on the list in the Tracking Station, and he definitely exploded into a cloud of dust so... my questions would be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIs he actually \u0022missing\u0022, as opposed to \u0022dead\u0022?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIs he recoverable?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003E* - But not, of course, the pond beside Admin.
