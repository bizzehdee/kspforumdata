Since you\u0027re usually going to make it reusable, it turns out to be pretty cost-effective to use nuke engines for them since you\u0027ll only ever need to launch one or two of them (two\u002B if you want to be doing multiple things at once). A related concept is a space train; basically a tug pulling a lot of other things stuck together.

View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned in the album, the spacecraft in the foreground is a Tugbot. It\u0027s powered by twin LV-Ns and draws fuel primarily from its rockomax-16 fuel tank. It has entirely too much monoprop, but I\u0027ve not yet gotten around to working up a smaller version. It either pushes or pulls payloads with its spinal-mounted Clamp-o-tron Srs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the background is a Cantanker, a self-powered Jumbo-64 with two of each size of docking port and enough monoprop to handle its own docking as long as it\u0027s brought close enough by something with real engines. The rugbots are buuilt so that they can freely draw from Cantankers docked at either clamp-o-tron Sr. In fact, pretty much every spacecraft I build is built so it can freely draw from a docked CanTanker, and I\u0027ve been testing resource mining gantries that can land a Cantanker on a Mun-class world and fill it up using Karbonite gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs seen in the second image, almost every moderate-sized payload I throw to orbit gets there with a full, or nearly-full Cantanker. Almost everything I throw that doesn\u0027t have its own engines also goes with a Tugbot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as seen in the last image, this sort of leads to a situation where there are a /lot/ of spare tugbots and cantankers hanging around, under my playstyle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T14:47:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have an RCS-powered tug at my Kerbin station.
