As he goes in the door, he empties his pockets into the storage area of the capsule automatically.\n\nor\n\nB. Right-click on the capsulre and select \u0022store data\u0022.\n\nYou can\u0027t move data around without an EVA Kerbal (unless you use something like the Crew Manifest mod, and that might even required a Kerbal aboard to work). So with probes, the data has to stay in the instruments unless you send a Kerbal to the probe to move it."},{"CreatedByName":"leocrumb","CreatedById":141389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T22:27:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E An EVA Kerbal goes up to an experiment, right-clicks, and takes the data.
