That will allow the outgoing ship to launch, refuel, and make a very efficient burn in low Kerbin orbit.

The only reason you might have for putting a tanker at high altitude is to get slightly further after refueling with the same interplanetary ship. But if you consider overall fuel consumption, it takes a lot of fuel to get the tanker to high altitude in the first place. You\u0027re better off having a slightly larger interplanetary ship (if needed), and doing all refueling and ejection burns at low altitudes, escaping your way out of Kerbin\u0027s SoI from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T03:24:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Uberick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Uberick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E If you make an ejection burn while very far out from Kerbin, you will not be able to utilize the gravity well(Oberth Effect) to make your ejection burn as efficient as possible.

I\u0027d probably use the term depart rather than launch just to try to be more clear about what fuel you\u0027re interested in tracking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat it comes down to is that if you\u0027re shipping all your fuel up from Kerbin, it will take more fuel total (including the fuel for getting the fuel into HKO) to depart from HKO than LKO, but the ship leaves the Kerbin SoI with more delta-v on board. If, on the other hand, you\u0027re mining kethane on Minmus, then LKO has less of an advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral months ago, before the forum rollback, we did a pretty thorough writeup on LKO refueling versus refueling in Minmus orbit. The conclusions were basically:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) If you\u0027re not mining kethane, the only times refueling anywhere but LKO made sense was if your delta-v budget was insanely tight or if the ship that needed to be refueled was somewhere other than LKO and couldn\u0027t easily return to LKO, and neither of those cases were common enough to really worry about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Departing from Minmus made sense if you had refueling facilities on Minmus and either were on a tight delta-v budget or you\u0027d need to refuel anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Departing directly from Minmus saved some post-refueling delta-v over departing from LKO, but there was an alternate strategy that did much better. Basically, burn away from Minmus like you\u0027re returning to Kerbin, keeping your periapsis at about 80km, then burning at periapsis to reach the necessary velocity for the transfer. The timing on this is tricky, but for a Duna transfer, it would mean using less than half as much post-refueling delta-v compared to refueling in LKO. Since that\u0027s a mostly linear savings, it\u0027s not going to make a radical difference if you\u0027re going to Moho, but again, if your delta-v budget is tight, it might be essential. If the delta-v budget isn\u0027t tight, it isn\u0027t worth doing it unless you\u0027re confident you can manage the transfer timing accurately, as course corrections can eat through your savings and then some if the timing is off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
