Hope this helps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/BMusSq3Timk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/BMusSq3Timk\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if you don\\\u0027t want to watch that, the basic explanation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Everything in space is moving, and speeds are all relative to other objects moving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Your speed and direction on the map is relative to the object you are in orbit of/landed on (the Sphere of Influence).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. So when you change SOI, you can seem to suddenly switch direction and speed because relative to the other object, that is the direction and speed you are going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[sorry if people actually already all get this or I did something stupider than usual or something...]\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
