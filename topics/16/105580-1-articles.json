That seems like tanks will now be wasting space with an empty oxidiser compartment on launch. The oxidiser in existing craft is also going to weigh them down until I can dock them to something to drain it out. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T09:49:13Z","Content":"There\u0027s the spaceplane tanks, a little unconventional I know but it\u0027s pure sweet LF ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T11:43:36Z","Content":"You can also use the modular fuel tanks mod change the tanks to pure LF (once the mod updates anyway)."}]}
