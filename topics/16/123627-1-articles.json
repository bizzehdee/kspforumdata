I\u0027ve received two contracts, one to rescue a Kerbal from an 80 x 80 km retrograde orbit and another to place a satellite in a polar orbit around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve attempted to launch a couple of flights to meet the parameters of the orbits and I\u0027m either completely underestimating the dV requirements or I\u0027m missing some orbital mechanics detail since I cannot reach these orbits without huge dV changes. In the first case, I\u0027ve tried launching directly into a retrograde orbit since I believe that launching into a prograde orbit and then trying to reverse it would be silly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second case, the 9000 x 9000-ish km, 90 degree target orbit is currently offset (rotated) from a direct launch to polar orbit by about 60 degrees but I can\u0027t seem to rotate my orbit sufficient without huge dV requirements. I\u0027ve resigned myself to wait until Kerbin moves around the sun until the target orbit can be reached with a polar launch from KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe these to be sort of the same problem. Am I correct and is there a better way that I\u0027m not considering? Do I just need to design more dV into my boosters?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI appreciate any help, but I don\u0027t need a detailed solution preferring to do as much as I can myself, i.e. please don\u0027t give me too much info.
