I have many questions, but I\u0027ll save them for later, I guess. Right now, I would like to know more about the lights, and specifically, how/where to place them. I grasped the concept of the Mk1 being \u0027thin and long\u0027, and the Mk2 being \u0027wide and short\u0027. However, I just simply don\u0027t know where on my craft to place them, or the angle! Anyone willing to help me out with the knowalls of lighting in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leopardenthusiast","CreatedById":26084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T14:18:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a lander, you want to place them as low as possible, and angled reasonably far apart.

I use them for two main activities, docking and landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor docking i tend to use the square lights to illuminate the target ship (it can be very frustraiting when you are in the middle of a docking attempt and you suddenly pass into a planets shadow). I place them on all my ships that are capable of docking, angled to illuminate the main body, but i do something the other guys don\u0027t seem to do, i exclude the actual docking rings from the ships self illumination. This is because i also fit spot lights to the front of my docking ships, this helps me with aligning the ships for a successful dock. Remember you can quickly switch ships in orbit to turn the lights on by pressing the square brackets \u0027[]\u0027 keys, just don\u0027t forget to turn them off!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second use i have for them is during landing. I place three symmetric round lights on the bottom of my landers, but crucially i place them so that the beams are not parallel, so that the spots will be seen to converge as you get closer to the ground. The spots on the floor give you a visual reference of your impending impact and with practice can be very useful for manual landings. It works in daylight too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you know that in the VAB you can adjust the angle (in 5 degree increments) of lights and any other part for that matter by holding SHIFT and pressing QE WASD keys?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T11:36:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use 2 sets of lights in my spaceships (that is, my lander/spaceship combinations that are intended to bring Kerbonauts to other planets/moons ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 illuminators each at the bottom of each fuel tank of my lander (i.e. a total of 8) to illuminate the ground in case of low illumination conditions during landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand 4 illuminators at the bottom of my spaceship that illuminate the lander as long as it is docked at my spaceship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latter set has been proven to be extremly helpful, for example if I want to transfer my crew to the lander while on the nightside of the planet/moon\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
