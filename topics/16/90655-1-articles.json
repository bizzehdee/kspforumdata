Every time I load this rocket, Jeb can\u0027t keep his ass out of the chair. I have to remove him every time I launch, so I have an empty lander can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I have a science ship I\u0027m trying to launch (with way too many reverts due to poor designs). Well, every time I revert to the VAB, all of my kerbals jump ship. I have to click on that tab and make sure there are two in the Lander Can, and 4 in the Hitch Hiker thing. EVERY time. Or else, because there\u0027s a RC-L01 in the build, I can launch without any kerbals if I\u0027m not paying attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you save the state of manning? If I put a kerbal in a pod, I want one in there every time I load the ship. If I save a ship without any kerbals, how do I keep them from sneaking in when the ship loads?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a small annoyance because I can just revert, but it\u0027s annoying to have to go back, especially with a difficult launch, and you finally get the ship in orbit to find your kerbal is either there when you want it empty, or empty when you want kerbals in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I nuts?
