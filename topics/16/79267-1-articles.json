So in general, treat the part you\u0027re testing as payload. You get this payload into the required position using other parts of the rocket, then you trigger the test part once you\u0027re there. Depending on what the test part is, you might then be able to use it for the rest of the mission, or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, because you\u0027re testing a small engine in orbit, you have the option of actually using the engine. But you\u0027d have to use it as your de-orbit stage. That is, get to the required orbit, test the engine, then use the engine to land with. But as mentioned by others, the part you\u0027re testing doesn\u0027t have to actually do anything. You don\u0027t need fuel to test engines, or intakes, or anything else that actually makes them work. Just performing the test, without the engine actually working, is enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: Be sure to read the contract carefully because there are 2 ways of triggering parts for tests. One way says \u0022normal staging\u0022 which is just what it sounds like. Slot the part into your staging list at the appropriate place so the rocket will be in the right position when you hit the space bar. The other method is to right-click on the part, bring up its context menu, and hit the \u0022Run test\u0022 button. This is common with things like landing gear and small engines, and the LV-1 has a tendency to use this method a lot. If this is the case here, then it doesn\u0027t matter where the engine is in the staging list, and you can actually use it on the way up if you want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to clustering a bunch of LV-1s (or any other engine) under 1 tank, you need the Cubic Octagonal Struts.

Usually the deadline is 1 or 2 years in the future so there is no rush at all to complete your Mun contract. And if the contract says \u0022Explore Mun\u0022, then it has no deadline at all.

This is because Kerbals can get more science than probes. If you send a probe first, you leave points on the table which means that if you want to get those points, you\u0027ll have to send a 2nd rocket with a Kerbal. This is more expensive than just sending a Kerbal in the 1st place. But be sure even the Kerbal doesn\u0027t have to back. Send him in a ship with 3-4 each of Goos and Materials, plus every other science instrument at your disposal. Don\u0027t just put 1 of each on the ship or you\u0027ll leave a large amount of points behind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T17:10:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the very helpful replies.

Either find a use for them in orbit, or just plonk one in a suitable position on your craft ^-^. You dont even need to have a use for it, it doesn\u0027t even need to propel anything. All you have to do is run it, under the specific conditions :-).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I find them very useful for small things. To be honest, i use the LV-1R more, but they\u0027re nice if you need small bits of fuel that dont need much thrust. I have a series of small communication satellites weighing under one tonne each. For these i\u0027ll usually attach either a can of xenon and an ion engine. It has a low specific impulse, so i usually dont use it if i can use something bigger. Ion engines have awesome specific impulse, but my probes dont usually carry enough batteries or solar panels to keep the engine going for more than a minute at a time, especially on the night side of planets. So i use two radial LV-1R\u0027s, cause i always like having some movement options. Even the smaller probe in-line engine is just a bit too big sometimes - lots of power, and it runs through the standard mini grey fuel tank i bring rather quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, awesome use for LV-1\u00AE\u0027s: Rovers!
