Why does this happen? If I have a target selected (as in, trying to intercept it), then if I turn to \u0022prograde\u0022 and burn, it doesn\u0027t actually point at prograde.\u00A0Somehow, it has set a new \u0022prograde\u0022 for my ship, one that is not actually prograde. If I unselect the target, the real prograde marker shows up again and I can point to it. But it gets really tiresome to, for example,\u00A0have to deselect a target, point to normal or anti-normal, and then re-select it to adjust your orbit so it lines up with the target. In fact, I don\u0027t think the normal and anti-normal markers even show up when you have a target selected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat sense does this make?
