I\u0027m trying to get it to orbit. (technically have in the past before changing wings.) I changed the wings so the front tips are at the original location and the back of the wings is slightly higher in elevation and are aiming slightly towards the ground(The front of the wing points down.). Is this a negative or positive incidence? Or does the angle have to be relative to do with the wings location above or below the center of the craft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is this wing design supposed to do in general? I was hoping it would help keep the angle of attack lower to get into orbit at higher speeds from reduced drag. Not sure if incidence does this at all now. I think it help keep the plane nose up though. It has some interesting effects like auto keeping the nose up during reentry and helps the plane auto slow down without inputs which is nice. Not sure on the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the wings angled so the back of the wing is above the front of the wing by the smallest possible margin.

(At least in KSP, which is rather simpleminded in this regards.) Having a slightly positive angle of incidence on the wings can help you reduce drag by giving you that positive angle of attack on the wings while the main body of the craft is pointed straight into the direction of motion and thus has the least amount of drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt higher speeds you need only a smaller angle of attack in order to have the wings generate enough lift to keep your plane in the air.

But for \u0022high and fast\u0022 craft the drag becomes more and more important. So if you have lots of parts with more drag than lift - like your typical fuselage sections - in front of the craft and the lift-generating wings more at the back of the craft, then the actual center of the aero-forces will move forwards when you get higher (into thinner air) and faster. I\u0027m not saying that this is a problem for your craft, but it is something to look out for.
