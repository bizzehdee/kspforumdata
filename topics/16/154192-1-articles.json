So I used to play KSP a lot before 1.0 but stopped and am just now getting back into it. Something new I\u0027ve noticed is that now when I go on EVA while I\u0027m in space my rocket goes into a spin. It\u0027s a slow spin, so it\u0027s just a nuisance, but it never happened before so is this intentional? Am I just going to have to start packing a probe core on ever rocket so that I can keep \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on while I\u0027m on EVA?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-30T06:10:39Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2016 06:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Wovejulio\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-30T04:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can always stop spins by timewarping at 5x for an instant. But otherwise, yes -- going out on EVA imparts a force on your vessel, and it\u0027s not that small of a force. You can say it\u0027s either intended, or a very low priority bug, because it\u0027s probably going to be a very long time until it changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-30T05:55:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can exploit this long-standing bug/feature; people here call it a Ladder Drive.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just leave it alone, let the ship rotate until the pilot gets back in\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wovejulio","CreatedById":158777,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-30T06:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlright, thanks for the info guys!
