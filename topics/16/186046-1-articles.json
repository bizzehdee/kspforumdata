I suspect that you are having trouble finding the right buttons to click to make it happen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you hold your cursor at the top of the altimeter, a button will drop down that says \u0022Space Center\u0022. If you click that, it will take you back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to build another spacecraft in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and launch it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternately, you can hit the ESC key, and a Pause menu will pop up.
