TWR is another good formula to know. Knowing how to calculate the Isp for a rocket with multiple engine types is handy, though almost always I have to look that one up still when it comes time to use it. There\u0027s also the full-to-dry mass relationship for most of the fuel tanks in the game (for every liquid fuel tank in the game except the Round 8 and the Oscar B, the tank weighs nine times as much full as it does dry, i.e. M = 9Md - this is a useful relationship to know when you\u0027re trying to solve Tsiolkovsky backwards, because with it and the knowledge of your deadweight, you can use it to calculate exactly how much fuel you need to produce a target amount of delta-V for a particular stage of a mission (and therein is the secret to making your rockets more efficient - why use three orange tanks per stack when for what you need you can get away with two oranges, an X200-32, a -16 and an -8?).
