When that completes, I\u0027m immediately able to do it again for the same amount of science. If I go back to space center, and go into my science archives, it\u0027s listed there as an experiment I\u0027ve done - but it says 0 science data (and as far as I can tell, my science hasn\u0027t changed)?\n\nDo you NEED to do the recovery of a vessel before transmitted data is \u0027received\u0027 back at KSC?\n\nEDIT: After testing things out a bit, I\u0027ve noticed that it is received back at KSC if I right click the antenna and press \u0022Transmit data\u0022 - but not if I do it straight from the popup where I can choose to send or keep. Is this intended behaviour?\n\nEDIT 2: This was due to a bug in the Science Alert mod! It has been fixed\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T18:34:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by dynde87**"}]}
