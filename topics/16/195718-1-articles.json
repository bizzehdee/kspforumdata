But you can get around that by using struts/autostruts to finish connecting the loop. So let\u0027s say that you build 3 sides of the \u0022box\u0022, then add the top of the box and use struts to connect the ends of the top to the exposed ends of the other sides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for how well it would fly -- the star citizen craft have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E from their wings in entirely the wrong place, with no canards.

Box wings will fly exactly the same as any other orientation of the same wing parts.
