Only just below the engine? Radius of the cylinder/cone?"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T11:24:44Z","Content":"I never tested it accurately, but from experience I can tell a thing or two. The retro-thrust is proportional with the distances. So if the blocking part is further away from the exhaust, you get more dV in the direction of the burn. Though still a lot less than you should. The visual effect of the engine doesn\u0027t matter - it will still block if the part is farther than the end of the flames.\n\nYour \u0027radius of cylinder/cone\u0027 assumption is correct: if there\u0027s an engine sized \u0027hole\u0027 below the exhaust - even if it\u0027s relatively far, you get full acceleration."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T14:29:11Z","Content":"Quite honestly, you should never place something below an engine you intend to use. For example, if you have a radially mounted engine on an upper stage, that does not get used until the lower stage is jettisoned you can place things beneath it. However, if you intend on using that engine before the lower stage is jettisoned you shouldn\u0027t place anything in the path of thrust. \n\nThere is a cylinder of thrust, but I couldn\u0027t tell you exactly how large it is."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T22:05:59Z","Content":"Well, I now realize I shouldn\u0027t, but it\u0027s too late for a mission and I\u0027m trying to fix it, hence the question... Fortunately it\u0027s unmanned so I can always suicide and get a new one, but still I\u0027d like to save the mission if possible"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T22:15:48Z","Content":"If you have any unobstructed engines, you can always just use those ones and do a manual transfer of fuel.\n\nAnother option is to make a fixed version and Hyperedit it to a short distance away, then transfer crew over."}]}
