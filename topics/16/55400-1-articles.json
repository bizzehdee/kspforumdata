It has just one jet fuel fuselage and some 800\u002B liquid fuel in the fuel/oxidizer tanks. I used 6-8 radial intakes, two RAM intakes, 3 jet engines, and a wide wing setup making the ship look much like a triangle. I tried several designs with LV-909s but had much more success with this one because of the low TMR (thrust to mass ratio) with the 24-77s. This means the engines aren\u0027t adding much weight to the plane. This allows the jet engines to take me closer to orbit. The faster they can go, the more air that comes in the intakes, and the longer the engines can run, the higher the jet can go, and the higher it can go the faster it can go. Small changes make a big difference here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get the plane up to about 25km altitude and flying nearly 1km/s, and then I shut off the two side engines (hotkey to shut both off at the same time so the plane doesn\u0027t spin out of control), then run on a single engine until around 27-28km and about 1200m/s when I can\u0027t get it to go any faster and I\u0027ve used almost as much liquid fuel as is in the jet fuel fuselage (the \u0022fuelselage\u0022, if you will). Then I turn on the rocket engines and leave the jet on to assist. After about 1500m/s I tilt upward and let the jet turn off if it needs to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would probably be possible to extend this further with the 48-7S engine, though I am unwilling to use this engine any time I can make do with others because its TMR is far too high for its Isp. It seems like a cheat engine to me. Also I\u0027m trying to figure a way to get the plane into orbit with engines of a higher Isp value. Give me a moment to try to fly your craft and I\u0027ll see what I can do with it, then I\u0027ll upload mine.

You might already be aware of these things. I haven\u0027t flown your latest version yet but I did notice that your craft controls really well. I\u0027m on the fence as to whether or not I find your AV-8 winglets visually appealing but they do seem to get the job done. I\u0027ll have to try something like that. As for making docking easier, I\u0027d suggest taking the unnecessary cockpit off the front and putting a docking port right on the nose, like I did with mine. Makes docking super easy. I only have 100 RCS fuel but it\u0027s more than enough for docking. Also, it doesn\u0027t need the batteries. I put 4 flat panels on mine, just to make sure it can pick up sun from any angle. I didn\u0027t bother with fold-up panels because they\u0027re unnecessarily large just to power a cockpit, and they don\u0027t work in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"angeldust","CreatedById":49069,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T10:47:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for your wonderful craft designs!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Fly-er 2 is just too small for a 200 x 200 Orbit, at least with my flying skills.
