When the jets loose in about 22-26k altitude thrust - mostly in one of it at first - they come in handy allowing you to set a higher thrust.

Sounds weard?\u003Cbr\u003EThat\u0027s right but: The less intakes you are carrying around you have less weight and drag witch slows you down, so higher airspeeds are possible. And with 1800 m/s \u002B you hit a mark in witch the stock enviroment allows you to use your jets up to 45k at least, even when the air-intake readout is zero in the recource-tab.\u003Cbr\u003EIf you slow down your ascend at 33-34k to 10 m/s - you may have to pitch down! - you can reach airspeeds up to 2300- 2400 m/s. Then orient you plane horizontally and \u0022let it go\u0022. Your speed will slowly drop with the altitude since your jet engines will be running at ever less thrust.\u003Cbr\u003EBut you should have an AP in space and an PE (within the atmosphere) as well at the moment you have to shut down your jets. So it\u0027s only a tiny thrust at the AP with your rocket engines for a full orbit.\u003Cbr\u003EThe backside of this is obvisiously the long time you stay in the atmosphere running on jets (nearly an quarter of an circumnavigation).
