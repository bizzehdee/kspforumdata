However its just designed to move around and sample at the biome intersect areas as in up to 10 km, the lander will then take it back to orbit, refuel and land in another area or it can do an suborbital jump, jumping require the drop tank.

These points could be as frequent as terrain scatter, or they can be terrain scatter themselves. Doing science on these points will net you small science, but occassionally you could stumble upon a point which gives you massive science. So you scan a rock, it gives you some science. You move to the rock next to it, and you might get different value of science.

You\u0027d plunk them down and let them do their thing in the background for days/months/years while you do something fun and interesting. Failing that, forget it. The only thing in the game less fun than a long-distance rover trip is scanning for Kethane, but at least scanning is a necessary evil. There is no point at all in subjecting yourself to a long rover trip because it will always be faster, easier, safer, and more fun to fly instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Algiark","CreatedById":83907,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T01:49:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo offense, but if driving rovers at full speed is already boring, wouldn\u0027t breaking the trip up with a bunch of repetitive, and largely pointless stops make it even worse? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome mechanics could be implemented to make it not so boring, one that I could think on top of my head is by adding many science report variations for terrain scatter so you get a different report every time (this could be fun of itself; finding trivia and backstories by doing science). And it doesn\u0027t have to be really that repetitive; another idea I have is that what you\u0027re looking for is basically the \u0027jackpot\u0027 point where you get the most science out of a biome. Jackpots are common enough that you wouldn\u0027t have to travel kilometers to find it, but rare enough so the chances of finding it the first time is low.
