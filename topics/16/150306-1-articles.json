This is career mode on normal difficulty.

That is without any engies underneath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith engines on the tanks (terrier for the outer tanks, Swivel for the core) the fuel flow still behaves this way, as can be seen here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://raventeam.de/resources/topsecret/ksp_corelowprio_withengines.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://raventeam.de/resources/topsecret/ksp_corelowprio_withengines.png\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to fiddle around with the higher/lower priority settings, which doesn\u0027t seem to work, no matter if engines are under the tanks or not, also the staging doesn\u0027t seem to have to do with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://raventeam.de/resources/topsecret/ksp_corehighprio_withengines.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://raventeam.de/resources/topsecret/ksp_corehighprio_withengines.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://raventeam.de/resources/topsecret/ksp_corehighprio_withstaging.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://raventeam.de/resources/topsecret/ksp_corehighprio_withstaging.png\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then put the fuel pipes onto the tanks, so it should flow from the outer tanks into the middle one. It seems to be ok and should work this way, but the display is still weird (to say at least).\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn these 2 pictures you can see the fuel flowing from the right tank into the middle one as if there were no pipes, and from the left one into the middle one it flows through the pipes. What\u0027s wrong with the pipes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://raventeam.de/resources/topsecret/ksp_corehighprio_pipes.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://raventeam.de/resources/topsecret/ksp_corehighprio_pipes.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://raventeam.de/resources/topsecret/ksp_corehighprio_pipes_otherside.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://raventeam.de/resources/topsecret/ksp_corehighprio_pipes_otherside.png\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough this \u0022pipe attempt\u0022 should work, I don\u0027t understand it, what am I doing wrong regarding those tanks, engines or whatever causes the fuel flowing from one outer tank into the middle and from the middle into the second outer tank, instead having the fuel flow from both outer tanks into the middle one?\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr is this just a display error I should ignore (I don\u0027t think so)? Is it because of the tanks, are the tanks just wrong and not cappable of transferring fuel that way?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf someone could please explain to me what is going on here and what\u0027s wrong with my setup, that would be nice. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-19T14:52:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2016 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by UnknownKSPler\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarheel1999","CreatedById":123965,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-18T20:09:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fuel flow arrows are \u00A0not reliable.
