Most notably an asteroid landing on Kerbin, though awesome, is terrible for getting science because landed on Kerbin has the lowest multiplier. On the other hand meet it in solar orbit and course correct onto a Mun flyby and you can rake in the science with separate readings for Sun high, Kerbin high, Mun high, maybe Mun low and/or Kerbin low.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
