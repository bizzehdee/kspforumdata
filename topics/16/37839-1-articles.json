Is there a way to step through being centered on different conic patches; or to center on different bodies; or to center on a selected target? Knowing this would really simplify my exploration; I\u0027ve kind of gotten in the habit of packing along insane amounts of fuel to permit course corrections whenever I enter various SOIs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help you can offer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-20T09:10:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2013 09:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nikolai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheebsta","CreatedById":74167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T08:29:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClick madly and repetitively on the object you wish to focus on.
