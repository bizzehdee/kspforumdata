Apparently there can be only one at a time, and right now, for me, it is a one-star contract, \u0022do a spacewalk near the Mun\u0022. I don\u0027t want to dedicate a mission solely to that purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to tweak it so that a) I can have more exploration contracts on offer and b) only get the more demanding three-star types.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly, how do? I\u0027ve had a look at Squad\u0027s Contracts.cfg and it seems as if exploration contracts are not defined there.

I only mention this because you will be unlikely to get your answer here. And I am also interested in the answer. I tend to leave ships/labs around mun and minimus so I can do these contracts as they pop up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy advice with your current mission would be to test a new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E or something with a min flyby.
