Sometimes they don\u0027t break apart though, which is most confusing, as I think I\u0027ve cracked it, relaunch for a \u0027serious\u0027 flight and find them breaking apart again.

I just wanted to add that it takes a little toying with their placement to get them to bridge it sometimes. What I do is move up the bottom tank until it jumps onto the top tank, click, and then go down just enough that the bottom tank lights green to finish it off. A lot of times the strut is so short it looks like just the two ends stuck together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T11:30:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t realise you could strut the seam itself.
