This prevents me apparantly from doing a succesful docking to the craft. When I detach the probe and try docking to the that dockingport instead, it works fine- anybody had this issue?

I also tried to delete the docking port and attach a new one, but doesn\u0027t make a difference :-( \n\n[http://imgur.com/O1Xy8yy,tSyIMvP#1](http://imgur.com/O1Xy8yy,tSyIMvP#1)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T15:31:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 03:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by silvanus**\n  \nscreenshots added"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T16:42:48Z","Content":"I\u0027m trying to understand what you mean by \u0022the GUI shows the other port as the target.\u0022 How can you tell?

Whatever port you right click on and set as target is the port you have targeted.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T18:20:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 06:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"silvanus","CreatedById":5307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T19:12:41Z","Content":"Okay strange, I thought you could always see the exact docking port marked.

That\u0027s what confused me in the initial post, I didn\u0027t realize you were trying to use that marker for docking purposes. Ignore the marker, it\u0027s not useful for short-distance work.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E My issue is that when I want to dock something to the other docking port and I set it as target, the GUI then shows the first docking port as target (the one where my probe is already attached). **This prevents me apparantly from doing a succesful docking to the craft.**\n\nThe **highlighted** sentence above is the crux of the matter. How does it prevent docking? Can you describe your usual process for docking?\n\nJust for reference, mine looks like this:\n\n1. Rendezvous with the target (end up very close to it, at zero relative velocity).\n\n2. Select the docking port on the target that I want to dock to, choose \u0022Set as target\u0022.\n\n3. Select the docking port on my craft that I want to dock from, choose \u0022Control from here\u0022.\n\n4. For convenience, switch briefly to the target and rotate it so that its docking port is facing directly at my ship\n\n5. Switch back to my ship and rotate it so that it\u0027s correctly *aligned* (i.e. its docking port axis is parallel to the target port\u0027s axis), though it may not be quite perfectly *positioned* yet (i.e. could be a bit off-center).\n\n6. Turn on RCS, press caps lock to turn on fine-control mode (because that makes RCS better, for [interesting reasons](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126721-Docking-problem-Ships-too-large-not-lined-up-enough-or-something-else?p=2041665#post2041665) that for brevity\u0027s sake I won\u0027t go into at the moment), and thrust gently prograde (i.e. towards the target), up to ~0.2 m/s.\n\n7. If I\u0027m off-center (i.e. if the target marker isn\u0027t perfectly centered in the crosshairs on the navball), use RCS to thrust laterally slightly to correct. The target will start drifting towards the navball center. When it gets there, I\u0027m perfectly lined up, so thrust laterally again to kill the sideways speed and I\u0027m heading directly towards the docking port.\n\n8. Dock!\n\nNote that none of the above steps involve \u0022look at the little yellow target marker in the main window\u0022, which is why I\u0027m curious why the placement of that marker is causing docking problems for you. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nStep 5 is the only moderately tricky part, because eyeballing the alignment can be difficult. That\u0027s the place where a docking alignment indicator mod can be really helpful. My personal favorite is this one:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54303](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54303)\n\n...it\u0027s super lightweight, has no UI to clutter up the screen, does exactly what I want it to: any time that my target is a docking port, it just adds a little red icon to the navball indicating the proper alignment. With this mod, step 5 is trivially simple: just rotate my craft so that the red icon is centered in the navball cross-hairs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T02:40:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T04:32:49Z","Content":"...OTOH yesterday I experienced an annoying bug.

That thing is seriously like 500m long, and a meter or two of off-center bend at the end is nothing unusual.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T04:38:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 04:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T15:42:00Z","Content":"My thought given the \u0027what is actually being shown\u0027 question above is to install navball docking indicator.\n\nIf you haven\u0027t yet restarted KSP also just flat out try that a lot of weird behavior goes away after a reboot, Squad got really good at sanitizing the kraken from save files, and this fixed one of my own docking nightmares."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T16:17:42Z","Content":"I just leave this here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86086-docking-woes-navball-parallax-error/page2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86086-docking-woes-navball-parallax-error/page2)"}]}
