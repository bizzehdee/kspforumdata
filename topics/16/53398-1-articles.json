Keeping the part count low in general is an extremely good advice - when you\u0027re ready for it, see Scott Manley\u0027s smallest interplanetary vehicle. Oh and very important: as someone mentioned above, when you found better ways of doing things, screw the rules and do it your way. If you can handle lower simplicity for instance, go for efficiency, etc - shaving off the 300kg of that handy reaction wheel you used on your interplanetary spacecraft for instance (not a great example though - rather lower the delta V budget of your payload/interplanetary stage to ~10% fuel margin first if you can).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlamedSteak","CreatedById":67223,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T11:19:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy no 1. rule is to spend a lot of time watching youtube videos of ksp when starting out.

If you want to see what I mean, try it on the ravenspear mk3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConnecting 3 to 6 struts from a 2m tank directly to the mainsail that is stack-attached to it\u0027s bottom allows the forces from the thrust-vectoring feature of the engine to be communicated directly into what is likely one of the most massive single objects on the ship, the center 1st stage fuel tank. Adding these inter-stack struts between every tank in the center stack until no single stack-joint is supporting more than about 10 tons allows you to use a TWR far greater than 3 Gs which is the point at which a lot of non-reinforced stack joints fail for 20 to 50 ton payloads, especially with perturbations from a vectoring engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConnecting struts from heavy parts directly to any force-bearing docking rings, (for example, in an orbital tug or it\u0027s payload) greatly mitigates the instability in a burn for those big ships assembled in orbit.
