As much as I love all that RoverDude has done for the community, I\u0027ve been using MKS from the get-go and have seen it deteriorate from a \u0022highly abstract\u0022 system that actually did what it claimed to do, into a highly complex, undocumented nightmare requiring way more micromanagement to make work than its supposed benefits are worth. If it even still actually works for anything other than a tiny outpost, which I\u0027ve come strongly to doubt. Plus, RoverDude gins out a game-breaking update every few weeks anyway. So, bottom line with MKS is, don\u0027t get into MKS (at least for the present) unless all you want to do in the game is be an MKS tester. If you instead actually want to play the game, then don\u0027t do MKS until it settles down into something that actually works without inordinate hassle. Which, given the ongoing trend, I don\u0027t think is going to happen anytime soon, if ever. If you want to do life support, it\u0027s WAY WAY easier just to send out periodic supply ships than it is to make MKS work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, on to your real question of base locations. Unless you\u0027re role-playing a science outpost or something, then exploiting resources iis the only reason to bother with a base. So, it all depends on what resources you want to exploit and why. Then you just position the base on a flat area conveniently located near the desired resource. If you\u0027re interested in fuel, then there\u0027s no point in building a base on Mun or Minmus because you can just launch from Kerbin. Fuel bases are only worth the trouble when they provide a significant savings over trucking out fuel from Kerbin, which means at other planets. And fuel stations positioned to avoid as much gravity and atmospheres as possible along the supply route usuall beat those on the ground, at least if the fuel is going to be used in space, unless there\u0027s no other choice (Moho, Dres, Eeloo). If you\u0027re going to use the fuel on the ground, then you need a ground fuel base as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve: you\u0027ll need a fuel extraction base on Gilly and a fuel station in LEO.

As much as I love all that RoverDude has done for the community, I\u0027ve been using MKS from the get-go and have seen it deteriorate from a \u0022highly abstract\u0022 system that actually did what it claimed to do, into a highly complex, undocumented nightmare requiring way more micromanagement to make work than its supposed benefits are worth. If it even still actually works for anything other than a tiny outpost, which I\u0027ve come strongly to doubt. Plus, RoverDude gins out a game-breaking update every few weeks anyway. So, bottom line with MKS is, don\u0027t get into MKS (at least for the present) unless all you want to do in the game is be an MKS tester. If you instead actually want to play the game, then don\u0027t do MKS until it settles down into something that actually works without inordinate hassle. Which, given the ongoing trend, I don\u0027t think is going to happen anytime soon, if ever. If you want to do life support, it\u0027s WAY WAY easier just to send out periodic supply ships than it is to make MKS work.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually in terms of MKS I would high recommend getting the full picture directly from the release thread rather than just one person. Judging by the large number of users of Roverdudes mods (including myself) Geschosskopf\u0027s experience may be more the exception than the rule.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T18:12:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile you said you\u0027re not interested in the Mun or Minmus, from a logic standpoint one of those would be the obvious choice. Your first offworld base should be a stepping stone. A proof of concept. You\u0027d want that close to home in case of unexpected problems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, minmus would be a great choice for resource mining. Reaching LKO with supplies or fuel takes at least 4500 m/s of dV from the surface. Reaching LKO from the surface of minmus takes about 500 to 750 m/s. Returning to the surface of minmus for your next shipment takes about 1500 m/s so a round trip still uses about half the dV that coming from the surface of kerbin takes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a lot of extra stuff on every trip and you still get to use Kerbins oberth effect for interplanetary trips\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option to consider is an OKS station. When you\u0027re on the ground half your time will be spent in the dark. An MKS command module consumes a decent amount of electricity when active. So does resource mining. With an orbital station your nights are a lot shorter and solar arrays are more practical. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn orbital station also give you easier access to more of the surface. A round trip to the far side of the planet from a surface base is a long trip that will consume a lot of fuel. From an orbital station it\u0027s just another landing spot. This lets you visit all the biomes for science with less fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll still need to put an outpost on the surface to do resource mining, but it can be a lot smaller and simpler since it would get it\u0027s supplies from the orbiting station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you weren\u0027t already planning on Universal Storage, you should have a look at it. It\u0027s a tidy way to store things on your station and if you use KAS you can swap storage wedges as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally keep in mind that a surface base is going to require precision landing skills to use. I usually use a small lander to scout the area for flat ground and place 3 flags in a large triangle containing the base site. Then I land all base modules inside the triangle and I\u0027ve got fairly flat ground to work with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile landing in an atmosphere is easy thanks to parachutes, precision landing is much harder since the upper atmosphere can have a huge effect on your final landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
