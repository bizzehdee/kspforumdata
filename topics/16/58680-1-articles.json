Basically, since you are near Kerbin, you don\u0027t have to burn with a nuke. You can, in theory, use a stage with moderate efficiency and good thrust for the ejection burn and carry just enough fuel on the high efficiency stage for mid-course corrections and your braking burn (and return if necessary).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T01:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the approach I use.
