This feature, while was created with good intentions, has been the bane of my existence. I no longer have the initiative to build Mun bases, stations, or even just Mun landers. Why bother when I could teleport there effortlessly? (of course I never use it, but cognitive dissonance, you know?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could just ignore it, which is what I have been trying to do. But having a way to effortlessly teleport to the Mun without sacrificing another dynamic like weight, cost, etc. upsets the balance of the game. It would be a little\u00A0like if one of the Administration strategies was \u0022add 100,000 credits\u0022 without having to pay in science points or reputation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I can tell, the majority of the console community didn\u0027t even want something like this. We wanted something useful like the \u0394V calculator (remember, we can\u0027t get a mod for that, so we needed it even more desperately than the PC players).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, how do I turn this \u0022feature\u0022 off (preferably while keeping the other launchsites \u0022on,\u0022 I like them and they don\u0027t upset the game balance.)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-25T06:23:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the console, everything that is settable is in either the miniSettings or the Main Settings or the Debug menu.
