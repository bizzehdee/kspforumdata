I have the design down- it has a total of 7 Whiplash Ramjet engines, but I have an unfortunate problem: the Mk1 cockpit At the front of the jet burns up in the atmosphere before I can hit Mach 5. How can I solve this problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-23T18:27:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/206910-pie-guy/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022206910\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/206910-pie-guy/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Pie Guy\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Maybe try using the Mk1 inline cockpit with a nosecone on the front.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-23T19:16:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mk1 cockpit isn\u0027t very heat-resistant, and if you have Whiplashes then you also have Mk2 components which can handle the heat better. I would suggest making your plane out of Mk2 parts instead of Mk1, as the Mk2 cargo bays can carry 1.25m (Mk1-sized) payloads inside them and the Mk2 passenger cabin and cockpits\u00A0can carry twice as many\u00A0Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re dead set on sticking to the Mk1 system, use the inline cockpit with some heat-resistant nose parts on the front to protect your pilot\u00A0from the heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"s_gamer101","CreatedById":205435,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-24T10:39:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr just put a light command module in a fairing. Fairings are way more heat-resistant than any cockpit.
