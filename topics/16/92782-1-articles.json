Now clearly, the extra weight required to increase TWR must be factored into the decision-- i.e. to choose mainsail or skipper engine, since skipper is lighter-- this makes sense. However, what doesn\u0027t make sense is if one is using boosters, what is the advantage of reducing their maximum thrust when using FAR? You do not reduce your weight, like you do when you switch from a mainsail to a skipper, so what is the advantage? What am i missing?\u003Cp\u003EAlso, i\u0027ve seen people post that having TWR=2 is terminal velocity. This is clearly silly. What they meant to say is this: having TWR =2 will ensure that your velocity will approach (exponentially) terminal velocity, but is guaranteed never to exceed it, since: m*a = T - Drag - m*g; at terminal velocity, Drag = m*g, and a=0, so T=2*m*g i.e. TWR = 2.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-14T20:01:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2014 08:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T03:56:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not familiar with FAR so I can\u0027t comment about that.

Riding the border of terminal velocity makes sense for the straight up portion of the launch, which in stock may be 5-15km depending on TWR. In NEAR/FAR this portion might be...200m tall? And you\u0027re probably (hopefully) not getting to terminal velocity that quickly. In stock, terminal velocity is attitude independent, but in NEAR/FAR craft orientation is a consideration. Too much dynamic pressure may make control of the rocket impossible (either too stable or too unstable), or your rocket may disintegrate; an \u0022optimal TWR\u0022 rocket which can\u0027t control itself through launch or breaks apart isn\u0027t optimal \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s the question of TWR \u003Cem\u003Ewhen\u003C/em\u003E? Asking for optimal initial TWR based on initial conditions is pretty unhelpful as stages have differing average TWRs, differing extremes of those TWRs, and different burn times. Also, with engines becoming more fuel efficient higher up, saving reaction mass for later in launch by not having a high initial TWR may allow you to develop more total delta-V, even if it costs more delta-V to perform this maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022best\u0022 TWR for a launcher in stock is relatively similar because the atmo model leaves launch profiles to be pretty consistent. In FAR there are more variables to factor in, and there are concerns outside of pure fuel savings. Besides, in FAR, drag losses are very small, so even a pretty \u0022unoptimized\u0022 TWR and launch profile (for minimizing drag losses) isn\u0027t going to cost that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Kraken help you if you\u0027re also trying to figure out an optimal launcher in career mode, having to pay for things...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, i think your analysis is spot on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you are saying with FAR, i should begin turning instantly?

And SRB\u0027s are dirt cheap, but have no throttle or thrust vectoring, making turning them difficult in FAR for that gravity turn, especially before you unlock reaction wheels and control surfaces... so i considered whether it was cheaper/easier to just launch vertically to the mun by strapping on cheap SRB\u0027s that didnt NEED to be steered...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T08:10:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt low tech levels, I get reliable launches by keeping the TWR at around 1.2-1.5 at the pad for the first stage.
