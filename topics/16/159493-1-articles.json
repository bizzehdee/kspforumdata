When you build spaceplanes the proper way like many on this forum do you use the whole body of your spaceplane including your elevons as an airbrake by facing the incoming air on a pitched up attitude (like the spaceshuttle)\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo you basically want to keep the nose high relative to the horizon (as much as possible for the greatest stopping power)\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith the proper heat tolerant parts this should work everywhere (also on Eve)\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis decceleration method works both by aerobraking and when you want to deccelerate at lower altitudes. Although don\u0027t be to aggressive on lower altitudes or your plane might brake apart. Airbrakes are good to quikly deccelerate when your flying in a straight line. However, it would be useless to you, because in ksp you won\u0027t give a rats butt to slow down more quikly in a straight line. Unless it\u0027s a way for you to show off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey can be usefull when guiding rockets back to land when your center of mass is to far near the top. Or the top of your stage is aerodynamicaly susceptible to tumble face down into the ground. Airbrakes at the top will keep the engine parts down and allow you to steer the body somewhat to have a little guidance.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf your rocket want to tumble during descent it will likely happen high up in the atmosphere, which is the part where your airbrakes will melt. So it will only fullfill this function if you manage to get to the lower atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey won\u0027t be very good at simulating grid fins either. Although that might be better explained due to the hard management to guide pitch and yaw control of a cillindrical stage. Something that is very hard to do in real life and requires computers in order to hit a barge at sea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat^ is a landing accuracy challenge that cannot be fullfiled routinely through player repetition (Although I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be successfull atleast once if you try long enough)\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith the inability to land that accurate it\u0027s far better to use a parachute (1 part) and land under engine thrust. Logical right? if all you wanna do is hit land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Airbrakes is a design choice. I mean, let\u0027s be honest, they look good. And sure, they can be usefull in the lower atmosphere. But essentially all it simulates is semi controllable spoiler. That could aswell be a Big-S Elevon control surface that is inverted and extended as a spoiler. Which has more surface area then a airbrake, and can be used for alot more purposes and creates probably as much drag as a series of airbrakes. Airbrakes do give more drag individually, but more elevons do the same. Elevons do give more lift, and more drag when not extended. But they are part of your planes wing surfaces to begin with. So you\u0027d have them on your spaceplane regardless. Again, my question, why add more airbrakes to them?\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo having control surfaces on my spaceplanes I see no reason to add any airbrakes to them. Only if it is a rocket I would think about it. And only on some specific stage designs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cu\u003EMy final conclusion\u003C/u\u003E is that you can create the aerodynamic stability and stopping power without airbrakes at all. I would even recommend to never combine spaceplanes and aibrakes. They cause more limitations then usefull applications.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh, I\u0027m just one man. I\u0027m sure I left out alternative method(s) for the aibrakes.

I only mentioned spaceplanes to highlight my inexperience with all things plane-related. I was trying different things, and when I saw the airbrake panel swing out on its own, I thought it was cool and wondered if it could help keep a rocket upright on the Eve descent.

It worked, but I don\u0027t wanna give in this time.

And my op was probably a bit misleading. I was at work and thinking about airbrakes and wondering how they worked, to know if I could use them on Eve, and just posted a quick question. The goal all along was Eve, though. Probably should\u0027ve put it as one of the tags at least. Sorry about that. I was just a lowly Bottle Rocketeer at the time. I have since been promoted to full Rocketeer, so I am thus more knowledgeable.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:kiss:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:kiss:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113764-foxster/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022113764\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113764-foxster/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Foxster\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0For whatever reason, the moment I saw one of the airbrake panels swing out for a course correction, I immediately thought it might be helpful on an Eve descent. I like your idea of putting more of them and keeping them out of the \u0022line of fire\u0022, so to speak. I only want to put a shield on the nose this time, because of the difficulty of getting rid of the inflatable shield in the gravy Eve calls an atmosphere. I\u0027ve actually landed a two-Kerbal craft there once before. My go-to method when landing on any planet\\moon for the first time is to bring drills along. That way, I only need to get there and I\u0027m assured of getting home. A bit different on Eve, obviously, but I had heard enough about it that I thought I could do it. Took a few tries, but I made it. Couldn\u0027t shake the inflatable shield with losing part of my ship with it. Ended up landing on it. Through some glitch I was actually able to drill through the shield and refuel. Left the drills and shield on the surface and took off. Was able to make orbit, but just barely. Had no docking ports or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, so I had to EVA my Kerbals to a rescue ship. It feels like I cheated and it still irks me. Technically, I\u0027ve never \u0022returned a ship from the surface of Eve\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot this time. Not only am I going to land a two-Kerbal craft, I\u0027m going to make orbit without drilling, and bring them home to Kerbin without refueling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll update with my triumphant (or disastrous) results and screenshots as soon as I have them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
