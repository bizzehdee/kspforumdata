My question is what do I use to decouple the 1st from the 2nd stages...I have tried regular decouplers, mechanical decouplers everything I have and nothing seems to work. I am ending up carrying the 1st and 2nd stages to orbit and having no fuel left over for orbital maneuvers. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T18:44:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPictures of your craft would help. There\u0027s plenty of different ways to use decouplers.

If your use to building rockets from the bottom up and the staging just worked in the correct order. Then you go to a rocket next to a rocket you have to play with the staging order because the game can\u0027t figure it out all on it\u0027s own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dingomedic","CreatedById":71311,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T19:26:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egot thanks for helping see it from a different angle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
