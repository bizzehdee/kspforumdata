The LV-N is objectively a much more efficient engine. That doesn\u0027t mean it will be the best choice in every situation. You\u0027re setting up a test that favors the LV-909, so of course the LV-909 will win. The LV-N is designed to push heavy payloads between planets. That is what it excels at.... certainly not pushing light payloads around in LKO or short moon trips. \n\nProblem #1) Your tank has dead weight in that you aren\u0027t filling the empty space once used by the oxidizer with more liquid fuel. That means there is empty tank mass... the LV-N is literally carrying an empty tank (ie, extra payload). You can use a mod to let you fill the empty space with more liquid fuel... the ideal solution... but the stock solution would be to use one of the liquid fuel only tanks. \n\nProblem #2) LV-N has a high mass on its own. It also has a much better payload fraction. If you want to compare properly, give the LN-V more fuel in proportion to its mass, not its thrust. \n\nThis was already beat to death in a thread yesterday that is still on the front page and should give you all the info you need:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121064-Are-LV-N-s-worth-the-trouble](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121064-Are-LV-N-s-worth-the-trouble)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dooz","CreatedById":74263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T13:51:35Z","Content":"Alright I will check it out with jet fuel tanks.\n\nAfter attaching the LV-N to a jet fuel tank (MK3 Liquid fuel tank)\n\nit does get 12,315 \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv Yep I did it all wrong Can a mod please lock the thread.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T13:55:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 01:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dooz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T13:58:43Z","Content":"It\u0027s because the LV-909 = Master Race.
