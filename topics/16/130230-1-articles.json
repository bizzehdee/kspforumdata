Both the periapsis\u00A0and apoapsis of my orbit and the orbit that my satellite\u00A0should be in are within 200 meters of each other, which I would call insanely close. However, the mission doesn\u0027t finish. What am I doing wrong here?

If you mouse over the AN/DN nodes they should be close to 0\u00B0. If it\u0027s reading 180\u00B0 you\u0027re perfectly aligned but going the wrong way around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nETA- looks like the contact says inclination 180\u00B0.
