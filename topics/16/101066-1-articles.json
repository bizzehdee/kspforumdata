I come back to messing around with spaceplanes to find that there is still something which I cannot master - Mk3.\n\nWhenever I try and takeoff with something that is Mk3, it will speed up to about 50ms and then start wobbling on the runway (rolling left to right more and more violently each time). Does anyone know why this happens?\n\nI put the wheels flat (as in perfectly vertical) this happens. Have them at a 45 degree angle, and the same happens. 3 wheels, 4 wheels, 8 wheels, doesn\u0027t matter, it\u0027s always the same. \n\nDoes anyone know of any tutorials, videos, etc. explaining why Mk3 is apparently so much different to Mk1 and 2 when it comes to takeoff. Seriously, if I launch the Mk3\u0027s off a rocket up a few hundred metres and detatch, it will fly and land just fine.

It happens when you have a heavy aircraft and your wheelbase on your rear wheels is too narrow, especially if you have any sort of significant weight past the wheelbase. It means that small sideways pushes on your plane cause one wheel to support more weight than the others, which means more friction, which at take-off speeds means an unstable plane and lots of pretty explosions.\n\nfor illustration, imagine a round mass which stands on 3 toothpicks which form a very narrow traingle. Give it a sideways push. The mass will easily tilt sideways, then rock from side to side a bit before coming back to a standstill. Now try it with the same mass, but your toothpicks form a wide traingle. The sideways push will be far more likely to shunt the whole construction sideways rather than tilting it. Same thing happens to heavy airplanes: narrow wheelbase --\u003E very unstable, will tilt side to side at the slightest provocation. Wide wheelbase: stable, will more likely be shunted side to side, but due to large mass the effect will be negligable.\n\nThis effect, combined with the fact that the wheels in KSP can handle super-heavy loads without buckling, it\u0027s better to use a wide wheelbase for the rear wheels and a single wheel on the nose.\n\nMoral of the story: design your planes to have a wide wheelbase. Design possibilities to do this include (but are most certainly not limited to): attaching more tanks sideways on the back of the plane to have more attachment surface or attaching wheels directly to the wings. Just make sure you put some structural element in between the wings and the wheels to make sure they reach down low enough to support the plane.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T11:39:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 11:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cirocco**"},{"CreatedByName":"TokiTech","CreatedById":131500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T16:00:17Z","Content":"Try attach the wheels to the fuselage.

As the ship gains speed, the wings try to lift off, placing a lot of pressure on the front wheels - lifting off of the back wheels, and this is unbalanced.\n\nDoes it wobble less if you apply full pressure on pitch-up? Also, because of your wing placement, your CoL is likely above your CoM. There\u0027s nothing inherently wrong with this, in fact, it can be quite useful for a stable build, but you want to make sure that your CoL is directly above your CoM.\n\nCan you post any side-views of this build in the Hangar with CoL and CoM turned on?\n\nEDIT: Also - 1.0 will include different kinds of wheels for various Splane sizes, can\u0027t wait!"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T18:20:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Double nose gear side-by-side is a recipe for disaster every time.\n\n I\u0027ve not had that problem.

You can also use \u0022wing parts\u0022 on the wings, strengthen them with struts, one left, one right and mount a gear on then. They\u0027re lighter and have an aerodynamic function.
