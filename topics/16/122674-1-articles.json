(Yeah!) The possible fly in the ointment is that fuel is tight. He has 1788 m/s and the listed requirement is 1300 m/s. So one is keen to be as efficient as possible doing this. Any orbit is fine (the oribiter can come get him) so I just need to get above 50km. So what is the most efficient acsent?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m landed at 3,500 km altitude. That is about the same as ~9,000 km on Kerbin? So I should pitch over something just under 45 degrees on launch? I\u0027m also thinking that since I don\u0027t have any velocity at that point, compared to the same pressure on Kerbin, I should have a higher thrust? Maybe a TWR off 2?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen as usual, I just pitch over a bit more as I get higher, get my apoapsis high enough, and circularize?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T01:05:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 01:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by davidpsummers\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T18:18:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most efficient profile is always the flattest possible trajectory. On airless worlds, you only need to go high enough to clear ground obstacles (such as, you know, mountains.). In the atmosphere you have drag to contend with as well, but the atmosphere on Duna is extremely thin. The last time I lifted off from the surface of Duna, I was pointed at the horizon by 20k and it took a lot less than I expected (definitely less than 1800m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ripper2900","CreatedById":146418,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T18:26:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe analogy with 45 degrees sounds fine to me, but note also that Duna\u0027s atmosphere runs out quicker than Kerbin\u0027s.

So for example, the first blue bar on the atmosphere gauge ends at around 8km on Kerbin. If I was launching on Kerbin, I would be pointing around 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at that time. So to lift off from Duna, I\u0027ll try to be pointing at 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 when I reach the altitude at which the first blue bar ends. I don\u0027t need to know how many km up that is, I just need to keep an eye on the blue bars. Similarly, on Kerbin I\u0027ll be going pretty much horizontal by the time the second bar ends, so I\u0027ll try to do the same on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T19:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Randazzo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Randazzo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe atmosphere on Duna is extremely thin.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my last visit (1.04) I found the atmosphere to be surprisingly thick, at least in it\u0027s upper reaches.

So I used ~50 degrees on take off. TWR about 2-2.4. I was maybe 30 degrees at 11 km and raised my TWR to 3. I think I came up a bit too shallow. I was at 20 degrees at 25 km when I reached the desired apoapsis and cut the engiens. From the losses as I coasted up to 50km I think I lost ~50 m/s to drag from there. Maybe a bit more. OTOH, I made it up in less than the dV chart said. 1200 m/s vs. 1300 m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was worried that my actually performance would relate to the theoretical value like it does on Kerbin, where I always need 30% extra, which would have made it tight and given little room for error.
