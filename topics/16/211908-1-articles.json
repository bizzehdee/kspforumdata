Only the vessel you are currently focusing on, plus everything around it in a bubble with a radius of 2 to 2.5 km, is physicalized. Everything else is packed up and put on rails, and only unpacked again if it comes close enough or you switch focus to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA vessel that is on rails does not have any physics calculations performed on it. It does not check for atmospheric drag, it does not change its speed or orbital parameters for any reason, and it does not process collisions. Not even with the ground. They phase straight through. Because that makes no sense, all celestial bodies have a certain altitude threshold below which on-rails vessels simply get deleted, as a stand-in for colliding with the ground and/or burning up in the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you left Bob behind, he was put on rails. The game then checked his altitude above Kerbin sea level, eventually concluded that he was too close, and deleted him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-06T07:27:47Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2023 07:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-06T20:35:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat Streetwind said.
