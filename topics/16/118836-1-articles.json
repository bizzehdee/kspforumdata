The Torguga above can push 700km, because once it\u0027s moving at a reasonable speed it can shut off the lift engines and close the bay, so it becomes pretty streamlined. Firebird V is a lumpen object no matter how you go about it, and won\u0027t break mach 1 because it can\u0027t get that streamlined shape.
