It needs about 4000m/s of DV and enough T/w to be able to safely navigate on kerbin (more than 2 should be ok) Ideally it should also be able to function using wings alone in an emergency although since it will primarily be operating on the mun they need to be light and small. It also needs a central docking port on the top and bottom to enable me to both dock with a station and attach it to the top of a big lifter to get it into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this will be my first Vtol craft I dont know where to start, I know that balance will be important and lots of RCS is a must. but I have no clue where to begin, what can you guys advise\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Osprey","CreatedById":93933,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T14:26:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds to me like you might be expecting too much out of one vehicle. My advice would be design something different for vacuum use from atmospheric, particularly if it\u0027s only for use in the Kerbin atmosphere, as then you can use air-breathing engines instead of liquid \u002B oxidiser. This means you save on fuel weight in the Kerbin version, and in non-functioning lift-generating parts on the vacuum version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the latter, I\u0027d experiment with a nuclear-engine powered lander rather than something that flies horizontally but lands and takes-off vertically. 4km/s Delta-V is quite a lot for a single vessel though, but not impossible for nuclear engines. Alternatively, try experimenting using Ion-power if we\u0027re talking about a teeny probe with only a couple of sensors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Osprey","CreatedById":93933,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T15:13:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere, made one using stock parts, unmanned of course.

But what you\u0027re asking for can totally be done. In fact, if you have Kethane installed, you might consider expanding your giant lander a bit further and make it pick up kethane at each landing site, as that can greatly reduce the logistics of refueling the thing every now and then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t worry about the wing mass, they\u0027ll be far lighter than the rest. Just worry about their size. If you aren\u0027t using FAR, then all you need for wings are a handful of canards or AV-R8 winglets. Just put your center of lift about midway between your center of mass and center of thrust, but have a frontal/upper set and a rear/lower set of control surfaces for better maneuverability in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that giant lightweight lab is going to be a major part of your structural design. If you want your craft to fly like a dart in atmosphere (and I assume you do), then you want to put the lab down low by the engines, and the dense fuel up near the nose. A perfect dart design has its own drawbacks though: it\u0027ll fly straight in atmosphere but is difficult to turn, and on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn it\u0027ll be easier to tip over. Alternatively, if you put the lab near the top and fuel at the base, it\u0027ll be difficult to put the wings far back enough to keep it stable and it won\u0027t turn as easily just because the front and back sets are so close to each other, but it\u0027ll stay upright on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn easily. So you just have to decide about how high you want your lab, and you might tweak it a bit as you go. Also consider the mass of the engines--most of them are pretty heavy too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d put on a single 750-unit RCS tank and two sets of 4 RCS thruster blocks, one near the top and one near the base--but this might be big enough to warrant more. You\u0027ll want to adjust them a little to be almost equidistant from the center of mass. If you\u0027re smart or mathy enough to figure it out, the best position is to put them equidistant from where the average center of mass will be, after accounting for fuel use. But to save brain energy you can just center your fuel mass at the center of mass of the rest of the ship, or learn to use short RCS bursts and not overdo it when it is unbalanced. SAS is your friend when using unbalanced RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll definitely want a good amount of SAS control. Given how big I see this thing in my head, I might go for two large SAS units. You should have enough SAS to turn it comfortably, but not so much that you can\u0027t make small course corrections. The large SAS are also lightweight and can affect your center of mass. If you\u0027d prefer something denser, use the smaller SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you want to consider your engine setup. You might want to use a variety of engines for different scenarios, and assign action groups to switch which engines are active. Or you might want to use one set of engines for all operations to keep it simple or reduce total engine mass. R.A.P.I.E.R. engines can help you conserve fuel in atmosphere, though they are pretty heavy and also lack thrust when you\u0027re close to Kerbin\u0027s surface or just going too slow in air breathing mode. Aerospike engines are also pretty efficient in atmosphere and are still powerful at any altitude. The LV-909 and Rockomax Poodle are pretty efficient in vacuum and make good lander engines, but are inefficient in air. The aerospike actually has superior attributes to the 909 and Poodle except that you can\u0027t attach anything under it. The LV-N nuclear engine is even more efficient in vacuum (but even less in air!) and is a great way to save delta-v. I think th LV-N is something you should definitely consider using for space maneuvers if you intend to be taking the ship very far. If it\u0027s just making short trips-like hopping to new biomes-it can go without them. And lastly, don\u0027t forget about the regular array of liquid fuel rockets. They are reasonably efficient in a wide variety of situations. They might end up being exactly what you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should be enough tips to get you through building what you want. Also go through this checklist to make sure you don\u0027t forget anything important and waste a ton of time going without them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) batteries\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) photovoltaic panels - the little ones if you\u0027re forgetful like me because you won\u0027t have to remember to extend them or put them away\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) either enough electricity storage or fast enough generation to power everything, like science or kethane drills\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) data collection tools: goo, science jr., thermometer, barometer, accelerometer, gravioli detector, even the atmosphere sensor thingy. And since you have a lab right on your lander, no need for more than one of each tool! Just stick the goo canister on top or something. Or use two. Or balance it with something of similar mass on the other side. Radial parachute works, if you want one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) antenna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.) if you have Kethane mod: kethane surveyor (or set up a satellite to do that), kethane drill, kethane storage tank, kethane converter. KE-WAITNONOSTOP-01 entirely optional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.) ladders if you\u0027re operating anywhere with high enough gravity that kerbals can\u0027t fly with the EVA suit. They can fly on Duna and Moho but not on Tylo or Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.) docking ports. I\u0027d recommend a large 2.5m on the bottom just to make it more stable. If you have KW Rocketry, try out the 3.75m docking ring. It\u0027s big and heavy but has a 2.5m docking ring inside it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.) balance your thrust to weight ratios. You want enough to take off reasonably quickly but not so much that you can\u0027t land smoothly. You\u0027ve got to be able to hover so you can line up your docking port with RCS. Alternatively, you might even succeed in making it able to take off all by itself and not need that lower docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.) lastly, re-check your center of lift/center of mass, and your action groups. Make sure they haven\u0027t shifted or been messed up. And before you launch, check your crew. It\u0027ll reset every time you go back to the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-23T17:45:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2014 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
