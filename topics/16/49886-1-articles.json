Does anyone know a way to stop them going abandoned or has anyone created a mod for 0.22 that allows some kind of missile type probe launcher for space planes?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaxal1","CreatedById":85315,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T19:10:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think currently uncontrolled objects in atmosphere are despawned more than a few kilometers from the active craft.
