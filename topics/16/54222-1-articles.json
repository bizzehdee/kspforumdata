Even when I do land on level ground, the parts on the bottom of the craft start shaking violently, or it tips over from the landing gear doing this. This leads me the question. Has anyone tried building a floating launch platform for Eve? I\u0027ve seen something like this used for Laythe, in which an escape craft is floating on pontoons in the ocean. The craft is then able to launch from the water and get into orbit. Part of the floatation device stays behind. Do you think that this method would be equally effective for Eve?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do think that this could work, please post any design ideas as screenshots below.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaveofDefeat","CreatedById":58539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T18:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood luck getting to orbit from sea level.

Your biggest problem (besides figuring out how to make a vehicle that can reach Eve orbit from sea level) is figuring out how to make it stable in the \u0022water\u0022 (or whatever Eve\u0027s oceans are made of). Rocket shaped things, (i.e. tall and skinny), tend to fall over in the water (this is also true of real life). This is something that you will need to think about when designing your vehicle. The solution that readily presents itself is to make something wide and flat, which is kind of a good idea anyway, since an eve lifter will probably need lots of asparagus staging. As for the lifter, one tip is to make the payload as light as possible (use seats if your aim is to launch kerbals). Also, that little orange Rockomax 24-77 has a really good thrust to weight ratio. Boosters aren\u0027t a bad idea either.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T00:43:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMay I suggest this design \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VROQupD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VROQupD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T03:16:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already did that... \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48503-Eve?p=629098\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post629098\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48503-Eve?p=629098\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post629098\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should check out. \u0022which something make you \u0022nervous\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T03:39:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been investigating this more, and found a different design that I think is superior. it keeps the vessel high enough that it never touches the water, so you don\u0027t risk breaking things on the initial sink.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big problem though is that when you launch from the water, KSP will still think you are slashed down even when you are in orbit.
