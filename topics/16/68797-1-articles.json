It looks a little off to me, and i usually put something underneath it. Are there any real-life equivalents with a visible fuel tank at the bottom of the booster?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T22:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Saturn_V_Rocket_Stage_S_IVB_-_1992.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurtvw","CreatedById":83214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T23:48:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot that the photo above requires any additional explaination -- But Yes, there are lots of examples.
