I first thought it was because I had such an enormous ship that it was overwhelming my PC or something,\u00A0but it turns out that my standard lander (called Manley) was causing it, or rather, its AE-FF2 Airstream Protective Shell. When that shell is removed, the rocket loads and launches just fine. With it, it explodes. I\u0027ve used this standard lander for quite a while, in fact on basically every mission, so this is a new problem with a tried and tested ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the log that pops up when everything goes to hell, the first thing to happen is that the airstream protective shell (hereafter named AE-FF2) collides with the part above it, which in my case is a separator. I switched separators from the TR-XL Stack Separator to the Rockomax Brand Decoupler, and then something interesting happened. Instead of exploding, the vehicle (lander inside the closed AE-FF2) bounces way up on the launch pad, and falls down again. I\u0027d say it goes a few dozen meters up or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems like the AE-FF2 is \u0022jumping\u0022 somehow, causing an explosion under unknown circumstances but a thrust upward under some other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe build ID from the config that the internet told me to report as the version is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[config]\u003Cbr\u003E\nbuild id = 01804\u003Cbr\u003E\n2017.05.25 at 19:56:39 CEST\u003Cbr\u003E\nBranch: master\u003Cbr\u003E\nlanguage = en-us\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat date, 25th of May 2017 is probably around the time I started having this problem.
