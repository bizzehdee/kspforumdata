Without giving too much away (I\u0027m trying to figure out as much of this game on my own as I can), what is an outpost? If I plop down a couple of hitchhiker containers with solar panels and an antenna, will that qualify? Wiki doesn\u0027t explain what they are, and searching forums didn\u0027t help.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T14:31:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 02:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity**"},{"CreatedByName":"3ntropy","CreatedById":142007,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T23:07:02Z","Content":"The contract should specify the requirements.

Lander cans, hitchhiker pods, command pods, mobile science labs. The exception is the External Command Seat, that one does not count I believe. So any combination of pods/cans that will hold the required number of Kerbals will suffice.\n\nThe power requirement actually means you need a means of *generating* power, such as solar panels, RTGs, or fuel cells. Batteries alone do not meet the requirement. So slap a solar panel on there.\n\nIf there is a docking port requirement (there usually is..), any of the three sizes of docking ports will work.\n\nThere is usually an antenna requirement. Any of the available antennas will work.\n\nAdditional requirements should be self-explanatory."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T02:42:45Z","Content":"When they say \u0022outpost\u0022 or \u0022station\u0022 or whatever, there\u0027s no special meaning attached to that word-- you can just substitute the word \u0022spacecraft\u0022.

If you accept multiple contracts to build a station in orbit of Kerbin/mun/minmus and to build a stationin orbit of or landed on mun/minmus then you can launch a single station and complete the first contract on your way to completing the 2nd contract. (Accidentally discovered when a kerbin orbit station contract completing during the mission to put it on minmus.) Just have to make sure both of them are accepted before you launch your station so they both qualify as \u0022new\u0022 and to maintain stability in the appropriate seeting for 10 seconds. And of course the fuel/capacity/charge requirements for both must also be met...\n\n2. You can mount small fully functional rescue ships/return vessels to your station with radial decouplers. Then the kerbal capacity and engine/fuel requirements of the \u0022outpost\u0022 aren\u0027t dead weight since they can be used later for other missions."}]}
