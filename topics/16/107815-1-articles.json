How about how to add a prebuilt satellite or lander to the subassemblies, then how to add that using a decoupler or separator (or a link). But I appreciate the reply.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T02:06:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 02:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by deafmetal**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T02:08:59Z","Content":"Just take a ship with a known payload that reaches orbit, and pull the stuff that isn\u0027t to-orbit payload and drop THAT in as the subassembly."}]}
