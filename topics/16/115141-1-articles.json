My tech level is quite low. I don\u0027t have the smallest engines, or anything bigger than a skipper.\n\n**Problem**: \n\nI was trying to put a mission together today in a classic Apollo stype; 2-man lander, 3-man command module with enough delta-v to get it and the lander to Mun, bring just itself back, and enough ascent stages to get the whole kerbang into LKO. It ended up weighing and measuring more than a tier 2 VAB and launchpad can handle - even after I grabbed the [ALCOR lander capsule](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54925-1-0-2-ALCOR-Advanced-Landing-Capsule-for-Orbital-Rendezvous-by-ASET-%2805-05-2015%29) mod.\n\nWhich ok, I\u0027ll accept, Saturn V was massive and the crowning glory of rocketry; but we all know that a tier 2 setup is plenty to get 3 kerbals to Mun and back, with an all-in-one command module and lander and return vehicle, or potentially a single-stage spaceplane. I\u0027ll redesign in a more conventional way to complete the contract, but it made me wonder...\n\n**Question:** **why are micro-stages like Apollo used, less efficient than brute force, in KSP**? \n\nSurface gravity of Kerbin and Mun are roughly terrestrial and lunar equivalents, so my guess is it\u0027s the delta-v required to get from one to the other is far lower. Return from Mun is a sniff at 280m/s, while the descent and ascent are around 6-800 each way. Making a lander that weighs less than a small fuel can is... impossible without an ion engine and an external command chair (if then).\n\nAny thoughts? Has anyone actually made a dual lander/return vehicle setup that was sensible? Is there an optimal flight plan? Are KSP\u0027s engines too heavy relative to the thrust/fuel use? Is it that Apollo\u0027s command module was a lot bigger than the lander and should be on 3.75m tech? Or is it really just a thing that you can do as a curiosity when you have enough tech and funds, but has now place in an efficient career?\n\nI\u0027m not really expecting a solution, but I am curious as to wherein the inefficiency lies.

My old Apollo 11 recreation launched on a 3.5m launcher.\n\nYou just have to be extremely careful about engine choice and how much fuel you bring.

Have a transfer stage with a fuel-efficient engine, leave it in orbit, land with very light engines, come back up, dock, use transfer to go back or siphon the fuel then go back with the light lander engines.\n\nvs.\n\n2. Just have a lander with a heavier engine than you require, drop empty fuel tanks along the way and on the surface.\n\nvs.\n\n3. Pretty much exactly like 2 but have a lander with light engines, spend a little more fuel on the transfer but a bit less during landing/ascent.\n\nSo I think the answer you are looking for is in engine fuel efficiency and engine weight. Basically option 1 is only better if the transfer dV is sizeable amount of the mission or if your mission is massive (engine weight negligible, need higher TWR anyways).\n\nA heavy but efficient engine would be Terrier/Poodle/NRV and a light but slightly less efficient engine would be Ant/Spark. So the fuel efficiency difference would be ~10-15%. if your lander\u0027s weight and fuel requirement fits for a Terrier or Poodle there would be even less of a reason to do the whole docking thing. In general I think most people probably just use these engines for vacuum landers (=option 2), thus foregoing all the hassle and their efficiency offsets a lot the engine weight.\n\nAre there fuel efficiency stats for the different stages used on the moon missions? I\u0027d expect the difference to be much larger than 10-15%."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T23:12:19Z","Content":"I think the low delta-V requirements are the main cause. The Mun departure burn from Munar orbit is so tiny it\u0027s not much extra fuel to take down the the surface, and the small size of the Mun means taking it down isn\u0027t hard. The mass of a separate orbiter - duplicate Kerbal accommodation and duplicate engines in particular - will end up worse overall. The three-Kerbal pod being a complete boat anchor doesn\u0027t help things either.\n\nIf on the other hand you\u0027re going to Dres, with similar landing delta-V but requiring a much bigger return departure burns, \u0022Destination Orbit Rendezvous\u0022 as I call it becomes much more appealing.\n\nBut even then, better still might be to leave a basic drop tank in the destination orbit, and pick it up again after the landing."},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T01:15:42Z","Content":"Well, what the others before me said is completely correct. But there are also many other reasons I did not see being mentioned , which are more or less these :\n\n1) Engineering constraints- literally, the engines were a mess to work with. Most engines were unable to be throttled at almost any degree, and could only be fired once (The S-IV actually was designed to fire twice, but even that feat was stretching it) : both problems are still a major problem for the space industry. Therefore,each part of both the Saturn V and its payload was designed to meet certain Propulsion needs at specific times. \n\nThe Decent Propulsion System (the LM\u0027s engine) managed to circumvent both problems at a certain degree, but with ways too experimental to be fully trusted, and the solution posed its own problems; the engine was pressure fed with helium gas, whose pressure would build up through the trip, until the system vented it into space- saving the engine from blowing up, but rendering it inoperable. This usually happened a while after the lander was safely on the Moon, which would not be a concern only if the Engine was not expected to fire again after that point. \n\n2. Celestial body diameter. Both the Moon and Earth are HUGE compared to the Mun and Kerbin respectively. While they have the same respective gravitational forces, the Delta -V requirements to circularisation are give or take four times higher. In those ranges, and along with the distance between Earth and Moon, that\u0027s when the \u0022every gram counts\u0022 rule really kicks in.\n\n3) Redundancy. Oh yeah, that\u0027s the big one. See, manned spaceflight is nowhere as simple and reliable as stock KSP has lead us to believe -especially since NASA didn\u0027t have other space companies to ask which way they did it. Systems may break up, engines may fail, tanks may leak, guidance may go haywire, connection may be lost, accidents may happen -and let\u0027s face i: I don\u0027t care how bonded you are to your little green big headed (literally) suicidal maniacs, a humans life is worth much more than the life of a digital character, and much harder to preserve in space. And when something as grand as a round trip to the Moon is done for the first time in the history of forever, the risks are huge. Therefore, you have to provide your pioneers with only one way to complete the mission, but dozens of ways to walk on the Earth\u0027s crust again.\n\nHere are some major examples of necessary redundancy on the Lunar Orbital Rendevous Profile, as demonstrated throughout the Apollo Program itself :\n\ni) As demonstrated on Apollo 10, the distinction between the descent and ascent stage provided the astronauts with a way to Abort a Moon landing while it\u0027s done; if the descent engine failed for whatever reason, the ascent stage could be separated and ignited while still on a suborbital trajectory (which would obviously not be enough after a certain amount of Velocity was shed) and circularise again, with the useless descent stage fully embracing the regolith in all its glory. \n\nii) Obviously, Apollo 13 is the greatest example of why redundancy was necessary. The Lunar Module served both as a lifeboat, providing communication and life support, and as a Propulsion System to head the whole Assembly back at home. \n\niii) During the Apollo 15 landing, the DPS collided with the Lunar soil, which obviously is not as easy to get away with IRL as it is in KSP. The engine bell was designed to crumple harmlessly in such a turn of events, but an engine without a nozzle is extremely inefficient and totally gimbal-free, which would be a problem if the Engine had to fire again."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T01:52:52Z","Content":"Two words: Dry.

It\u0027s just easier to make an all-in-one and recover a bit more of the costs upon return. One of the problems here is that KSP fuel cans are in such discrete sizes, and as pincushionman said above, the dry mass of the tank is very big compared to its fuel. Fine tuning your munar descent stage to, say, 650 delta-v, is easy, but the relative change is in mass when you drain a bit out isn\u0027t as big as it should be.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T08:25:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 08:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eddiew**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T11:01:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Some great answers here guys, thank you ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E Suddenly I realise why NASA *don\u0027t* scour these forums for good ideas - our ruleset is just too different vs reality to produce anything viable ^^;\n\nIt is, in fact, rocket science.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T21:40:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It is, in fact, rocket science.\n\u003E Wemb\n\nWell, KSP is not, NASA is ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T19:36:42Z","Content":"I did my moon missions this way.
