From there I usually have to use up to 30% of the terrier and its two\u00A0FL-T400 tanks\u0027 worth of fuel to achieve a stable orbit. For an escape to Mun\u00A0I usually need a deltaV of ~850 m/s and that doesn\u0027t leave much fuel to turn a Mun flyby into an orbit, back to a Mun escape, and back to a Kerbin suborbital trajectory. Is this a normal setup at this stage of the game? The remaining fuel I wind up with seems like it\u0027s barely enough to explore and earn more science. Is this upper stage too large? I can\u0027t see adding even more fuel driving even larger lower stages. Eventually I would need more than just a command module in a respectable mid to late game upper stage, no? How does one manage this? Is there some point in the tech tree that vastly opens up the possibilities of a more fuel efficient exploration of the solar system so my upper stage isn\u0027t one huge fuel tank?\u00A0I realize the Mk1 crew cabin is adding considerably to the mass being hauled around, but\u00A0this allows me to work some of the tourism contracts to at least stay afloat financially.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI missing some element and how to proceed.

I.e. when, after clicking on \u0022EVA\u0022, the Kerbal holds onto the capsule. As soon as the Kerbal is free, they orient themselves in space (IIRC head to normal or to north), and that usually includes hitting the capsule (with their hands or feet or whatever), which sends the capsule spinning. On crewed parts that don\u0027t have anything to hold on to (e.g. the MK1 crew cabin) this happens immediately after going on EVA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fierce Wolf","CreatedById":200019,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-24T12:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223731867\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191145\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221579868023\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197939\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AHHans\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, AHHans said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is that the kerbal leaving a hatch and hanging on the outside seems to produce a force that starts to rotate the vessel they were just in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, this happens more often in light craft.
