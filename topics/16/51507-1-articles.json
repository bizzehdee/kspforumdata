I was wondering about that before, but suddenly became painfully aware of how messy that linkage was. So I found lots of people agree, and the solution is agreed upon as well... but I guess no one expects their discussion of the remappings to be read by someone trying to figure out how to do a remapping...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found the key bindings page, but it left me with even more questions, like how do you change modes, as it seems the same keys do different things in different modes, in addition to operate dissimilar systems such as rudders, wheels, jets, and reactions wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty amazing that I can complete a single flight with nearly 1000 points worth of science, and I can\u0027t drive a darn rover a couple of clicks without blowing up, or rolling it real good... I tried a lot of different things for bumpers, roll cages, self-writing mechanisms... The best anti-explosion bumpers so far is some extra wheels. With a big tumble, using the wheels that look air filled, I frequently pop a tire, turns out you can fix blown tires with a right click menu. So my most robust rover so far is a capsule on a reaction wheel on a rover base, and the thing is covered with solar panels, some batteries shoved into the capsule walls with only the LED\u0027s showing, several antennas (so I can loose a couple when the rover rolls). a couple girder segments to protect soft parts of the capsule that get hit on rolls a lot, and wheels all around to protect bits that might snap off in a roll. I tried landing struts at first, but their impact tolerance is very limited, they just snap off if the thing tilts. The wheels and girders have very high impact tolerance, and I have some struts at the corners to keep the capsule from snapping off when the chutes deploy. But keyboard remapping so that RCS works for me rather than against me, would let me leave half of this stuff off, and have a roll-free rover with a lower mass, and a lower center of gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I wrote this I designed a new rover that doesn\u0027t tip over, but I still need to remap the wheels...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T13:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck this little guy out for inspiration.

I normally build fairly heavy rover, and ensure a low centre of mass and as large a width/height ratio as possible. You can pretty much test any rover design on Kerbin, but a major problem comes with finding a way to land your rover and jettisoning the engines that you used without damaging it. Also it is important to keep your speed as low as possible when driving your rover on the Mun - just because you can max it out to 20m/s doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s safe to drive it that fast.

I don\u0027t just want to move the flight controls to other keys, I want the wheel controls to not be flight controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne issue I am having is that during construction, the parts are forced rto fit together in a manner that my rover\u0027s frontside is at a 45 degree angle to flight geometry. When you move the wheels for the first time they seem ok, but after running for a while, the wheels start to become directionally unstable and jitter left to right while turning. Usually it is just one wheel at a time, but it cannot decide which way to turn. After running for a while all of the wheels start to jitter in the turns. So you can try to turn right, and sometimes you go right, and sometimes you go left. This rover is very stable, but with unstable turning action in light gravity, it will still go sailing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I could actually define left and right for each wheel, and bind those directions to keys, separate from attitude control, I would probably cure the jitter. I think the jitter is from the off-axis assembly that I am forced to use. I see stabilizer fins jitter in the same manner during flight, depending on where they are connected, and what flight control is trying to do. When flight movements don\u0027t cleanly translate to an obvious physical motion, the shifting between the two possible motion directions appears to be how the program deals with the ambiguity. I\u0027ll continue to try other construction methods to see if I can align the axis, but I shouldn\u0027t have to if I could define the motion of the wheels myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the clue on the docking mode.

But it would be nice if I could leave sas on and use it with the attitude controls to help the rover be stable during high-speed risky driving, while independently with different controls drive the wheels. People are talking about doing that, so I know it is being done... Ok, so I looked in the settings again, this time after exiting the game, and I can see the places to configure the controls. I looked in settings once before, but I guess it was during the game and it didn\u0027t show this page. It also has axis bindings, so if I can figure out how to use that, I can probably fix my turn jitter problem...
