What sort of trouble are you having? Solar orbit is just a stage, and a necessary one, between planets. The trick is to make that orbit meet the objective, which is a matter of matching planes and timing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe short and sloppy version is, match planes, set your ship\u0027s orbit slightly lower than the target planet (to have your ship catch up to it) or slightly higher than the target planet (to let it catch up with your ship), and fast-forward to an intercept. The scale can be deceptive, though. Planets have much larger SOIs than moons, of course, but on the map view you\u0027re zoomed out so far that it looks like you have to match exactly for a capture. It\u0027s actually very much like trying to get 2 ships to rendezvous in a planet\u0027s orbit. Have you tried that yet? It\u0027s very hard, but good practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Peppe","CreatedById":51446,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T19:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Leonov\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Leonov\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow does one get to another planet?, i have been to the moon many times and landed secessfully, every attempt to get to a different planet gets me stuck in the suns orbit, Ideas?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings to keep in mind, On the launch pad you are in orbit of the sun. You only notice it once you break out of the kerbin SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that, you can then time your burns in the kerbin sphere to benefit your target when you enter the sun\u0027s SOI. Take notice of the direction kerbin is moving around the sun, if you want to go to an inner planet burn on the prograde side of kerbin\u0027s orbital movement to exit on the retrograde side in a lower orbit than kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo go to an outer planet start your burn on the retrograde side of kerbin\u0027s orbit and you will exit kerbin\u0027s SOI in a higher orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime accelerate on the launch pad until the planets are in alignment for your launch.

Since once in space, thrust is force over time since there really are not any losses. Any thrust energy put into the system stays in the system. That being said, your engines take so much fuel to output x force. and it will take so much force to accelerate to the needed velocity. One engine will put out the same force as two engines, but over twice the time. Therefore it would consume the same fuel to get you to your orbit. So once you have your orbit and are looking to leave, you want the engine that has the highest specific impulse (nuclear) because the specific impulse is essentially how much thrust you get per unit fuel. Exact units I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, it really comes down to patience. Use alt\u002B\u0026lt;/\u0026gt; for your physics timewarping. Remember that you still need to get up to your velocity timely. One nuc on a heavy rocket means you might need to start burning months early in game time so having a few is beneficial on heavier stages. Your fuel to delta-V will drop a bit for the weight of each engine for all stages, so minimizing the number of traverse engines is highly recommended. So to sum, provided you have the fuel to get to yout orbit is the key. Remember less engines and more efficent will take longer to get orbit speed, but actually require less fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"draeath","CreatedById":25709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T20:13:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMass matters.

It\u0027s just a transitional state that you pass through between one world and another.
