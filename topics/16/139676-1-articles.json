Those same translation motions are already available using IJKL and H/N. It seems to be to be a very bad idea to train yourself to do two completely different things with the same fingers on the same keys. So I never use docking mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a shame because it isn\u0027t a bad idea in itself, and it does have the advantage of preventing you from firing your main engines by accident.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least, I think it does...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Broco","CreatedById":4320,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T13:16:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree. I would totally use docking mode if there was a docking camera that shows the approach from the docking port and you can adjust angles and speed and directions from that but the way it is now its just not practical, i just use IJKLHN as Plusck said. No annoying switching required, you have all controls at your hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
