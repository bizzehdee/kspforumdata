The airplane has a detachable rocket with enough delta-V\u00A0to get to orbit from high altitude, but not enough to get to orbit from the ground.\u00A0Currently I am doing my best to put the airplane in level flight, hit stability control, switch control to the rocket, then launch, but I find that in the time it takes to put the rocket in stable orbit, the airplane eventually hits the ground destructively. I\u0027m not even sure if I can switch back to the aircraft from the space control center if it survived (anyone know?). Perhaps this type of project is not even possible in KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have any ideas to allow the airplane to survive with low cost, or implement some career-mode-allowable autopilot functionality without mods, or mods that enable this functionality via coding or otherwise without seeming like complete cheating (mechjeb)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-13T16:42:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2016 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by orangesherbet0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"volcanicshrimp","CreatedById":139666,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T17:30:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like your plane is despawning (which happens if craft in an atmosphere get ~22.5km away from the currently controlled craft.
