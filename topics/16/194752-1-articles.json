My contribution is to mention that the decision if an asteroid is random is made when it is encountered for the first time. So one way to \u0022cheat\u0022 a magic asteroid into existence is to (quick-)save just before you encounter an asteroid for the first time (e.g. when you are 3km out), get close to the asteroid to check its magicness, and if it isn\u0027t then reload that save, rinse, and repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
