The Oberth effect says \u0022the faster you\u0027re going, the more energy you gain or lose by accelerating\u0022, and conservation of orbital energy says \u0022unless you make a maneuver, the sum of your kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy is constant\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe energy of a nice circular orbit around Minmus is much less than the energy of the capture, where by definition you have at least enough energy to escape Minmus orbit. So, you want to shed that energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere\u0027s the best place to do that? At periapsis, where Minmus\u0027s gravity has accelerated you to the greatest extent possible, so your velocity at the capture burn is maximal, so you can shed more kinetic energy per m/sec of delta-V.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere\u0027s the best place to have your periapsis? Scarily low, where Minmus\u0027s gravity will have accelerated you as much as it can without experiencing a lithobreaking event.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe length of the burn should simultaneously be very short (Oberth effect) and very long (engine mass is dead mass for the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation). It\u0027s a complicated optimization problem; I took a stab at the landing part of it a while ago and I think my conclusion was that the optimum was to have enough engine for about 2-2.5 m/sec^2 of acceleration (4-5 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for Minmus, ~0.2-0.25 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E on Kerbin).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding should begin at as low of an altitude as you dare, managing vertical velocity to avoid a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E event while shedding as much horizontal velocity as quickly as possible.

The periapsis of the approach trajectory should just touch the surface just prior to the point of landing.

Essentially, rather than killing off portions of energy and momentum at your initial circular orbit, you kill off nearly all of the angular momentum at a high periapsis point where it\u0027s really, really cheap, and then nearly all of your energy during the burn to landing at the lowest point.

You will lose some altitude during the braking if you burn purely retrograde for maximum efficiency. The exact amount of altitude you lose will depend on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is what makes this approach difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf instead you aim for periapsis\u00A0to be at the exact altitude where you want to circularize, you will spend more fuel, as you\u0027ll have to have a radial component in the burn. However, the difference is fairly small. You lose about 5% at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E = 1.5 and about 15% at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E = 3. This is just from your circularization budget, so it\u0027s an even smaller fraction from total for landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn practice, because it\u0027s easy to misjudge the height you need to aim for with the most-optimal approach, you\u0027ll end up losing more fuel on corrections. This results in landings with constant altitude circularization being more efficient when piloted by hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Flying Kerbal","CreatedById":171547,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-09T07:26:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few days ago someone posted a message seeking advice on reaching Mun in the Demo version of KSP.\u00A0 This tempted me to load a design I used in it, to reach Minmus with a separate lander attached for the descent onto the surface of Kerbin\u0027s second moon, a mission not unlike what the Soviets planned form their proposed lunar landing in real life in fact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I have a really bad habit, I tend to tip over to horizontal way too early while flying into a parking orbit around Kerbin.\u00A0 So I deliberately tried to resist this, and fly in a much more acceptable manner.\u00A0 The result was that when I finally completed my orbital insertion, and then my injection burn for Minmus, I had only a very small amount of fuel left in the stage which would also be used to get into orbit around Minmus and do the bulk of the descent before the little \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E powered lander finally ditched it and switched over to its own on-board systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurious I reverted to the launch pad to try again, this time flying my more traditional way-too-shallow flight profile to orbit, but from then as similar as possible to the first attempt.\u00A0 The results were totally different; I could see immediately after establishing my parking orbit that I had loads more fuel in the tank, and indeed when I finally ditched the last stage during the descent\u00A0onto Minmus, it still had a not insignificant amount in reserve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I do appreciate this was all in KSP Demo 1.0 and things have changed a great deal since\u00A0this was first released,\u00A0and I haven\u0027t\u00A0had time to try a similar experiment in 1.2.2 so it might\u00A0produce totally different results, but if these results do hold up in the full\u00A0game, then is there any advantage in not shallowing out your trajectory early, and thus increasing your velocity during the initial ascent from Kerbin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-09T13:23:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2017 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by The Flying Kerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-09T12:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is absolutely no reason not to try and get as much fuel reserve by the time you establish parking orbit around Kerbin.
