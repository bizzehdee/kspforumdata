Even if I hit F9 the second it starts to blow, I end up having to wait a minute or two (literally, go-make-a-cup-of-tea type delays) for the graphics to process before it even registers the keypress.\n\nIf the computer is doing anything else processor-intensive at the same time (such as, for example, recalculating the nuFAR voxel shape due to the suddenly altered airframe), it strains the computer so hard that the entire thing crashes with one of those \u0022shutting down to avoid physical damage\u0022 warnings.\n\nThe explosions are pretty and all, but they just ain\u0027t worth this much hassle."}]}
