There are various ways to attach a payload like a rover to a rocket, none of which are without their hazards. The easiest to build is to just plonk the rover on the top of the rocket with a stack separator so you can detach it when you land, but this means the rover has to fall from on top of the rocket before it can be used. Other options include using a skycrane (see the stock example) to drop the rover from beneath (like the Mars rover), or making the rover with VTOL rockets or RCS built in so it can land itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESPH symmetry is much better than the VAB for Rover designs. Start your design with a root part that represents where the rest of your rocket will be attached to the rover, and build the rover onto this part. When you\u0027ve finished building the rover, select the part of the rover that attaches to the root part (which will detach all of the rover parts as a subassembly) and drop the rover onto the subassemblies tab. This will let you save the rover to this tab so you can load it in the VAB and put it on your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might find that turning over your rocket is harder than you thought, because the low gravity on Mun means you don\u0027t get a lot of traction/grip from your wheels. Therefore, I suggest building a rover with several pairs of wheels, and consider adding some ballast part to gain extra grip. Of course, if your stuck lander isn\u0027t too heavy and is a nice round shape this might not be necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CmdrBone","CreatedById":129357,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T22:33:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) I have pictures, but I haven\u0027t figured out how to post them yet; I can only link to pics on the interwebs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) the lander is just an MK 1 Pod with landing gear, couple of batteries, 2 mystery goo containers and a SC-9001 unit attached - I honestly have no idea how the SC-9001 survived the crash, since they have a tendency to disintegrate upon normal landings on Kerbin (back before I used four parachutes just to make sure).
