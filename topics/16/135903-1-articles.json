While ascending (and high enough), try shifting your angle of attack in such a way that the close approach markers move closer to each other. Once in a stable orbit, if you are behind your target, move to a lower (ie. faster) orbit, if you are in front of it, move to a higher (ie. slower) orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf the Kerbal is in an inclined orbit, wait till the plane of your target\u0027s orbit is over the KSC, then launch into the inclination of your target orbit.

For a rescue mission, this is easy; the target is probably in a routine equatorial orbit, just launch east as usual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce your orbital inclinations are matched, you need to either speed up or slow down in order to catch up to the target or let it catch up to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is where it gets weird: lower orbits move faster than higher ones. If your orbit is the same height as the target, you\u0027ll hold position with it; if your orbit is higher, it will get farther ahead of you; if your orbit is lower, you\u0027ll catch up on it.\u00A0So, if you need to catch up with the target, you actually need to lower your orbit by burning retrograde. Conversely, if you need to slow down, burn prograde to raise your orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms or reading the map screen: first, set the rescuee as a target. After you\u0027ve done that,\u00A0the ascending and descending nodes are where the plane of your orbit crosses the plane of the target orbit on the way north (ascending) and south (descending). So long as your orbital plane is close to that of the target, these don\u0027t matter. If you do need to correct your orbital plane, the AN or DN is where you\u0027d make the normal/antinormal burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe intercept points show your closest approaches to the target in each orbit. Fiddle about with the height of your orbit until you get these down to docking range (the closer the better, but anything under a kilometre will do), then time accelerate to the rendezvous and dock (or just get close, match speeds\u00A0and spacewalk if it\u0027s a rescue mission). If you\u0027re starting a long distance from the target, it may require several orbits for you to achieve a close enough intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, for a rescue mission, there\u0027s no need to start a long distance away; just wait until the rescue target is a little bit short of passing over KSC, then launch direct to an orbit of the same altitude and inclination\u00A0as it. That should start you off fairly close together, but you\u0027ll likely need a bit of fine tuning. So, if the target is ahead of you, burn retrograde a bit to\u00A0lower and compress your orbit; if the target is behind you, burn prograde a bit to raise and expand your orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last complication is that you need to be matching the targets altitude when you meet up. This gets problematic when you\u0027re using the raising and lowering of your orbit to control your speed. So, what you do is make use of elliptical orbits; have one side of the orbit at the same altitude as the target, while the other side is higher or lower depending upon what is required. Careful tweaking of the orbit height allows you to arrange it so that the rendezvous happens on the equal-altitude side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike a lot of Kerbal, it\u0027s really simple once you\u0027re used to it and really difficult when you\u0027re not. But just try to keep in mind this basic point: big orbits are slower than little orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for the obligatory Manley:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHkY3FusJIQ?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe version of the game in that vid\u00A0is outdated, but nothing has changed in the basic methodology of rendezvous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-03T11:44:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2016 11:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T12:00:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecifically on the point of \u0022There are ... some Intersect points, but i don\u0027t know how to use them\u0022, and after reading through Wanderfound\u0027s post above, you might find the following useful:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might have one (orange) or two (orange and purple) sets of intersect points. If two, it\u0027s because you cross the target orbit twice per orbit. If you have the option, choose the intercept point that is in daylight... it\u0027s so much easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easiest way I\u0027ve found to get a very close approach in a minimum time and with minimum fuel, is to use \u003Cu\u003Etwo maneuvre nodes\u003C/u\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, drop a node by the next intersect chevron (the one that says where you will be, not the target, since it is the actual point the orbits cross). Leave it at 0 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrop a second node about a quarter of an orbit later. This is to make sure that you always see the intersect point \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eone full orbit later\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you need to judge whether it is reasonable to try to get an intercept within a single orbit. If the chevrons are far apart at this stage, it might be very expensive, so in this case \u003Cem\u003Eright-click the second node\u003C/em\u003E, and click on the \u0022\u002B1 orbit\u0022 button on the bottom right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow go back to the first node and add a small amount of prograde/retrograde to move the intersect chevrons closer together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can get them to line up with a minimal burn, then you\u0027re done, and you can burn at that first node, delete it and warp forward until you pass the second node, then delete that and warp to about 3 minutes before the actual intersect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they are still quite far apart, go back to your second node, right-click and add an orbit or two. Basically, at this stage, it\u0027s up to you to determine how much fuel you\u0027re wanting to use. If you\u0027re in LKO, you can always get a perfect intersect within one orbit by burning hard to a much higher orbit - but to slow down to meet your target you\u0027re always going to have to make an equal and opposite burn so this can be very expensive. Likewise you can catch up on a distant target by going into a much lower orbit but you could easily end up in the atmosphere...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy going back and forward between these two nodes, you will always be able to get an optimal intercept ... where \u0022optimal\u0022 means whatever porportions of expending fuel or warping forward you are prepared to suffer\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you have maneuvre nodes set, you can use the \u0022warp to next node\u0022 option when you click on your orbit. This takes away some of the dull and boring part of the process...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, once you\u0027ve burned the first node, deleted it then warped forward to the second node, and your chevrons are aligned for the next pass, warp forward to a point a few minutes before the intercept. This is where you should switch to target mode, and push the retrograde marker over antitarget. If you watch the map view while doing this you should see the intercept chevrons move closer together, but also move further away along the orbit. If they stop closing, stop burning and wait to get closer, rince and repeat.
