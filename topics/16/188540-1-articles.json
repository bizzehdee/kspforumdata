My recent encounter of exhaust obstruction was in a plane but with no clipping: I had the horizontal stabilizer on the tailplane in the path on the jet engines, i.e. the engines blew onto the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer. In KSP this doesn\u0027t mean that I get good pitch authority because I effectively have thrust vectoring, but that I don\u0027t have thrust at all... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
