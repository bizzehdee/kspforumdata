I\u0027ve got a few planes that fly nicely, and the most recent (a hybrid jet-ion) flies very straight as well, but whenever I turn on ASAS, it sends it quickly into a nosedive. At first I figured it was just unbalanced (even though I could fly it) - but now, when I let the controls go, it flies perfectly. If I turn on ASAS, still straight into the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat could cause this? Do I have control surfaces on upside down or something.

Sorry, no pics available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I took some advice and was able to get things flying. As someone mentioned, I was using an avionics package which might have been the trouble. Also tried various engine types, eventually getting it working. I\u0027m pretty sure my main issue to start with was the avionic package - it was as if the sas was \u0027pushing\u0027 it down, and that makes sense if it\u0027s some orientation issue on the part or placement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-08T23:42:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2013 11:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Krisism\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CCKinnison","CreatedById":71439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T05:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECockpit or probe core for controls?
