Kind of like\u00A0SpaceX\u2019s Starship. I just don\u2019t know how I could determine the size ratio between the two stages to make it as efficient as possible. Should the 1st stage be 4 times bigger than the 2nd stage? 3 times? What I\u2019m really asking is if there\u2019s an easy way of determining this or should I just experiment like always? Maybe adding more engines\u00A0or having it refueled in orbit more instead?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-17T02:33:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRule of thumb is that a stage\u00A0should have about 3 times the mass of everything above it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-17T08:42:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you would like to understand how the rule of the thumb that bewing mentioned came into being, and how to adjust it for your own needs and purposes,\u00A0I offer you \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140385-mass-delta-v/#comment-2598497\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis post about mass fractions\u003C/a\u003E for further reading. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fierce Wolf","CreatedById":200019,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-18T13:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI measure in Delta-V rather than size.
