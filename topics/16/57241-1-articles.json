In 0.22 i had a rocket on which the payload was not strutted at all before I put the fairings. Launch was quite funny...

To test it, you can launch something with insane TWR. While fairing is there (even the single piece of it), there will be no wobbling on rotation or contraction when you thrust it up. Drop the fairing and your payload will want to implode into itself. The key to toggle it was in the description of the base part, I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
