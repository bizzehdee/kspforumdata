I\u0027ve managed to get my rather large mother ship into orbit and dock all of my landers/tugs. I\u0027m using Nerv engines, which gives me a rather low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. Even so, I\u0027m not sure I can even use 100% thrust because I have several ships connected together via docking ports. As a result, a Jool ejection maneuver of ~ 2000 m/s will require at least 18 minutes, and possibly more. I put my mother ship into a 500-km orbit in anticipation of this, but even at this altitude the period is just over an hour. Given that the maneuver will require about 1/3 or more of an orbit, I think I need to split the burn over a couple of orbits, but I\u0027m not sure the best way to go about it. A 500 m/s burn puts me in an orbit with an apoapsis of 4400 km and a period of 5 hours. 700 m/s gets me an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E of 34000km with a period of over 10 days, and much more than that hits Kerbin escape. Given an orbital transfer window at time X, what\u0027s the best way to go about this as far as how to set maneuver nodes, when to start the first burn, etc. BTW, I\u0027m running an unmodded 1.6.1 with MH if it matters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the assembled craft:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SdPM1ns.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/SdPM1ns.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGrogs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-23T17:26:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2019 05:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Grogs\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed picture\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-23T18:14:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOthers will come along and post the best way to do multiple burns like you asked, but as for full thrust...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would make a quick save, go to full thrust, see if anything wobbles in a bad way (I think this design is going to wobble regardless), reload the quicksave and autostrut to heaviest anything that is moving too much.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow..... the problem with this idea.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 When you go to dock and undock, some/all of those autostruts will have to re-attach to another part.\u00A0 That is known to cause Kraken attacks and rip the ship apart.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if you only autostrut one central part from each docked module to the heaviest part, then when you undock, you only have to turn off one autostrut.\u00A0 The parts themselves should be attached solidly enough within each module, so one autostrut per module should suffice.\u00A0 If, though, you are docking or undocking the heaviest part, you\u0027ll have to turn them all off.\u00A0 Or quicksave, don\u0027t turn them off, and hope the Kraken doesn\u0027t notice you, if it does, load the QS, and turn them off manually.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-23T18:54:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t worry too much about the timing.
