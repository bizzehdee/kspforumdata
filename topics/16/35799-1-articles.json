By default, it will be set to 3, but change it to 0. Then, in game, when you get an encounter, the encounter trajectory will be shown around the current position of the planet you are encountering instead of its position in the future. This allows you to switch your camera view to the target planet and see if the trajectory shown is going prograde or retrograde. If the encounter trajectory is going counterclockwise, it is a prograde orbit. If it is clockwise, it is retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T23:40:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, if the Mun or planet show a a paragee after it passes your ship, you will be boosted further away if you do not do a retrograde burn at the paragee mark. If you do the capture burn, that orbit will be prograde. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Mum or the planet shows a paragee in front of it, your orbit upon the retrograde burn will be in the opposite, or retrograde, rotation. If you don\u0027t do the burn, your ship will be redirected towards Kerbin as its speed will be slowed down. The real Apollo missions did the retrograde capture so that they wouldn\u0027t be slingshot into a solar orbit if they were unable to make the orbital insertion burn at paragee. Instead, they would have been slingshot back towards Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, it is also possible to get a prograde orbit if your elliptical orbit goes way past Mun or a planet and you get the paragee in front of it on the return loop. That path, however, is quite wasteful on fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"njd80","CreatedById":73280,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T09:46:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Erryy is spot-on - Conics mode 0 is the way to go.
