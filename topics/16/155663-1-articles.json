It can be difficult to get a reentry pod to remain stable blunt end first when you add stuff like that. It winds up wanting to go pointy-end first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0My cures for that situation are twofold:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Make sure that the center of mass is as close to the ablator as possible. All the heavy, dense stuff should be back there, while the light stuff is in the nose\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Draggy stuff needs to be up near the nose so it can act like a drogue during reentry. My favorite trick is to use solar panels canted inward at an angle and mounted as high up on the nose as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0You can often fix an unstable design this way. If not, I\u0027d recommend ditching the Science Jr. and installing a science pod in the nose. Or simply go EVA and retrieve the science. Your reentry pod will be much more stable without it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck,\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Slashy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-29T02:17:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of the above taken into account -- your reentry path is still critically important.\u00A0 If you set up your return from Minmus to just about \u0022center punch\u0022 Kerbin, it\u0027s unlikely the atmosphere will be able to slow your command pod enough to safely deploy parachute(s) before you splatter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf, on the other hand, you set up a return trajectory that has a periapsis between (in my experience returning from fairly high Kerbin orbits and Mun only, since I haven\u0027t been to Minmus yet) 35 and 40 km, even if that leaves you with what looks like an orbit that\u0027s going to kick you way back out to another Minmus orbit crossing, if you\u0027re flying base first when you pass through, the drag of the atmosphere will slow your ship enough that, contrary to flying back out to the edge of Kerbin\u0027s sphere, in fact, you\u0027ll wind up dropping to lower altitudes and speeds, ultimately dropping below 300 m/s by the time you\u0027re down to 10 km or so -- and that\u0027s when you deploy your parachutes.\u00A0 For Mun returns, I usually aim for 37 km, but you may need to go lower for Minmus return, as you\u0027ll be coming in faster and might bore right through and have to wait another orbit to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d recommend always using a heat shield, but be sure to jettison it after your parachutes open; the weight difference adds up to a significant difference in descent speed under parachute.\u00A0 Also, for the 3-Kerbal Mark 1-2 Command Pod, you\u0027ll want to mount three of the blue radial parachutes (assuming you have those available) to get a reasonable descent speed; the single-seat Mk. 1 is okay under a single Mk. 16 or blue radial, but the heavier Mk. 1-2 needs more...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UnbeltedLyric38","CreatedById":174318,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-29T03:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for all ze advice I just put a experiment storage unit on the pod and a decoupler under it and it landed first time.
