What\u0027s the best inclination for it to receive incoming spacecraft from Kerbin for refueling as well as a staging area for a landing attempt?\n\nThanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T15:39:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 03:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xspotatoes**"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T21:33:53Z","Content":"I built one few days ago. Well, I built space station everywhere...\n\nI chose the Gilly orbital plan, at a high 2000km. I assume it\u0027s the only body I would go on a regular basis. For Eve, I set a probe carrier on a low polar orbit.\n\nWhen I\u0027ll got to Eve, it\u0027ll be with a heavy staged lander, so I don\u0027t reallyc are where I land. further more, If I\u0027m stuck in orbit, I can send a small ship from the station. they all have a docking port."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T21:46:13Z","Content":"i would say equatorial since gilly is not a place i would visit very often, and equatorial is the best if you want to do an Eve return mission. When doing one of those you will aim for an equatorial landing site so that you will get the much-needed rotation boost when lifting back up! this way, you will be on the same plane as your refueling station, refuel, and head back to kerbin !"},{"CreatedByName":"xspotatoes","CreatedById":148356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T21:50:34Z","Content":"Thanks for the advice! That\u0027s what I was thinking as well, but just about every one of my crafts manages to come in at around 17 degrees so I wasn\u0027t sure if that would be better."},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T22:31:27Z","Content":"You would want an equatorial or near equatorial orbit (possibly a few degrees toward Gilly but low inclination nonetheless.)\n\nIf you have an inclined orbit it will not help with inbound craft because it will not shift to accept craft coming in on Eve\u0027s plane, as the obit will remain static relative to Kerbol\u0027s cartesian grid. In other words, the inclination will only be helpful twice an Eve year (two spots in oposition), and even then they won\u0027t often coincide with an Eve launch window. \n\nSo the best inclination is 0 degrees. Unless you are a hipster and want a retrograde orbit. (This actually allows an ion powered craft to be in daylight for an outer system transfer burn)"},{"CreatedByName":"xspotatoes","CreatedById":148356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T23:25:55Z","Content":"What\u0027s a good altitude for the station?"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T23:33:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What\u0027s a good altitude for the station?\n\nNot too low, maybe 300 km?
