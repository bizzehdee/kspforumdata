I\u0027m new here but I have been playing KSP for a while. I want to build a base on Mun but I don\u0027t know what to use for the connecting elements. I\u0027m not sure how to describe them, they are long white-ish tubes and have docking ports on the ends. I thought at first they were fuselages but no. I don\u0027t have such element unlocked and the tech tree is almost maxed out. If you know what I\u0027m talking about please write it\u0027s name and place in the tree. \n\nThanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-19T08:34:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2015 08:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BW\\_Orion**"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T21:31:24Z","Content":"No parts have docking ports built in.
