This is fairly close to the Mun\u0027s orbit, which means getting a gravity boost from the Mun is doubly efficient for Eve transfers and that a refueling station around the Mun might be a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConversely, Hohmann transfers are least efficient for an intial/final orbit ratio of 15.8, which is again, very close to the ratio from 100km parking orbit to the Mun\u0027s altitude: (100km\u002B600km)/(11400km\u002B600km) = 17.1. It\u0027s worth noting that a bi-elliptic transfer is actually more efficient going from 100km to the Mun\u0027s altitude than a Hohmann transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T05:01:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFuel doesn\u0027t magically appear at high altitudes, you have to expend fuel to put it there.
