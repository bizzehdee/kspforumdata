I\u0027ve figured out A way to do it, by spiralling out to 7000m so that the orbital period is long enough the burn is practical, but I wonder if anybody might know a more efficient way I can finagle such an interplanetary transfer (this one will take an extra ~1300 dv, which I have cause wheee plasma, but I figure there must be a better way).
