(The planet is rotating on its axis, satellites in geostationary orbit simply orbit about the planet at an angular velocity matching the rotation of the planet. At the poles, the velocity of such a satellite would have to be 0, and would fall directly back to the planet. At any point other than the equator, the satellite will oscillate north and south relative to the ground as the plane of the orbit passes through the center of the planet.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour best bet would be to put a pair of satellites into a highly eccentric polar orbit with a Pe low over the south pole and an Ap high over the north pole (when I say high, you want it to have visibility to the north pole for \u0026gt;75% of its orbit). Both satellites should have the same period, but offset by 180 degrees in their orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose satellites will need to talk to a geostationary communications satellite with line of sight to KSC, or to a communications relay network, as they will not have direct line of sight to KSC for most of their orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: The usual first major step for remotetech is to get 1 geostationary satellite above KSC with a dish antenna pointed at Kerbin and a couple of extra (2 or 3), followed by 2-3 other satellites spaced equidistant in the same orbit with dishes pointed at kerbin and at each other. This will give 100% coverage of LKO up to some altitude with the exception of low over the poles, which is where polar satellites like I described above come in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative is to setup a belt of 6\u002B satellites in LKO at ~750km altitude with omnidirectional antenna. With that altitude and quantity, each satellite (assuming equal spacing and the same orbital period) should see its two neighbors, and one satellite should have a view of KSC. You can then add another belt at ~90 degrees inclination to get polar coverage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are pros and cons for both approaches.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-29T22:19:32Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2014 10:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Atragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMore info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperBigD60","CreatedById":76047,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T22:19:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Echeck out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra_orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETundra Orbits\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethey\u0027re like geo-sync orbits but more useful for northern latitudes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EsiriusXM sattelites use these I think\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
