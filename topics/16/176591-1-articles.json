experience drag and will burn up as desired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But that seems silly,\u0022 I hear you cry.\u00A0 \u0022Everything completely ignores atmosphere unless you\u0027re flying it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, yes and no.\u00A0 Yes, it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eis\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E a little \u0022silly\u0022, in terms of realism, but it\u0027s a necessary programming compromise.\u00A0 That\u0027s because actually doing all the calculations for drag, and applying them to moving ships, is heavily processor-intensive.\u00A0 There\u0027s no way your computer could keep up if the game tried to do a full physics simulation of the potentially hundreds of objects flying around-- that\u0027s why \u0022running on rails\u0022 is a thing.\u00A0 So they basically have to \u0022cheat\u0022 and make them ignore atmosphere when they\u0027re on rails.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, though, it would be silly if objects got down into \u0022the soup\u0022 (i.e. the thick, lower atmosphere) and were never affected, and the game uses a simplified model for this, as well:\u00A0 anything that gets \u0022too low\u0022 when on rails will simply vanish and be deleted.\u00A0 The threshold for \u0022too low\u0022 is \u0022higher than 0.01 atmosphere pressure), which on Kerbin happens at an altitude of about 23 km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, on Kerbin, it works this way for things on rails:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAnything
