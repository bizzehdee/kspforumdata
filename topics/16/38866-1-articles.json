During liftoff off my Apollo/Saturn V style of launching to the moon and back. I\u0027ve got a setup where the docking clamp is positioned within the craft. What happens is that around 15000 feet the craft starts to pull to the side at the docking point and rips the craft apart at this point. I\u0027ve tried using struts but nothing is helping. I need my lander to connect to the top of the craft to carry them both to the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the craft file here it uses KWRocketry, Chatter \u0026amp; Procedural Fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft File: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=95EF8AE748BCC910!13799\u0026amp;authkey=!AFUOArR8xaFNw6Y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=95EF8AE748BCC910!13799\u0026amp;authkey=!AFUOArR8xaFNw6Y\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1109.photobucket.com/user/Melkirth/media/2013-07-25_00001.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h426/Melkirth/2013-07-25_00001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-07-25_00001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
