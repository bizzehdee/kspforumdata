Without it, though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, achieve an orbit at the same altitude as Minmus. There are two ways you can achieve this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Slingshot off the Mun, using the patched conics as a guide. Then, just burn until your apoapsis is at 46,400,000m or thereabouts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. From a low-Kerbin orbit, burn until the apoapsis reaches 46,400,000m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, once you get to the new apoapsis, you have two options. To make it easier and quicker to get to Minmus without waiting for ages to catch up with it in its orbit, I suggest you burn retrograde at your apoapsis to change the direction of orbit entirely. If you want to, you can just burn prograde, but then timing is far more important, or else it\\\u0027ll take forever to catch up to Minmus. If you\\\u0027ve got your apoapsis this high from a low-Kerbin orbit, the velocity you\\\u0027ll need to cancel will be around 50m/s. Continue burning until your orbit is very close to circular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have a nearly-circular orbit at Minmus\\\u0027 altitude, you\\\u0027ll want to look at your map view. At certain angles, you can see points where the slanted orbit of minmus \u0027crosses\u0027 yours. Warp until you reach one of these. Depending on your orbital direction, you\\\u0027ll want to burn either North or South to change the plane of your orbit until it matches closely to that of Minmus. If your orbit is opposite to the direction of Minmus\\\u0027, the patched conics should already see an encounter by now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow comes the rather difficult part. Perhaps. Wait until you encounter Minmus, being very careful not to slingshot past it (it\\\u0027s very easy to miss it, particularly if you\\\u0027ve orbited opposite Minmus\\\u0027 direction). You may (or may not, depending on whether you orbited opposite to it or not) want to burn retrograde if the patched conics sees you leaving Minmus SOI. It shouldn\\\u0027t take too much fuel. Just burn retrograde untl you have a stable orbit around Minmus, or you\\\u0027re heading on a collision course to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, it\\\u0027s like landing on the Mun, only a ton easier, because the gravity\\\u0027s so low.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T22:05:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo it the same way as for the Mun, except that you aim for an Apoapsis of 46400km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\\\u0027ve got your apoapsis, you need to move your orbit up or down so that it intersects with the orbital plane of Minmus. To do this, point your ship north or south relative to the orbital plane (Normal \u002B and - in MechJeb) and burn until your orbit intersects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce it does, you should see the yellow orbital prediction provided by the patched conics system in the orbital map. From there, you can adjust the periapsis of your arrival in the SOI of Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T22:25:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that if you\\\u0027re orbiting in the same direction as Minmus, it can take a long time to catch up with it if you don\\\u0027t time it properly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T23:35:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve played with mechjeb before.

Maximum efficiency of inclination change is achieved at apoapsis right? So if you want to match Minmus\\\u0027s inclination it\\\u0027s actually better to perform the inclination change at the 46400km apoapsis than it is in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it was NASA planning a manned mission though they will probably go for inclination change in LKO because it\\\u0027s safer. If the inclination change fails for any reason in LKO then the spacecraft could fairly easily be deorbited to bring the crew back or a rescue mission could be mounted since crew will have enough provisions to survive for days/weeks in orbit. If the engine doesn\\\u0027t work at 46400km for the inclination change then the crew is going to die a slow and painful death in Kerbol orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"khenness","CreatedById":18973,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-02T08:19:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheers guys, going to try it out now and i\\\u0027ll post back \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarmenius","CreatedById":16990,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-02T17:13:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething else you can try is waiting until KSC intersects Minmus\\\u0027 orbit and launching to 96 degrees (or 84 depending on which intersection you\\\u0027re at), saving yourself a plane-change maneuver.
