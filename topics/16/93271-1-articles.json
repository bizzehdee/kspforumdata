That way you could also have a cancelation charge that scales up the closer you get to the required completion time. (with a short period for free at the start to allow you to simply change your mind about a contract).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe penalty for being late would increase the later you are, to the point of it costing more than simply cancelling the contract (the cost of which would also increase with time).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T16:42:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xub313\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xub313\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt surprised me too, but I did some testing and it is true.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually not quite as simple as this. I\u0027ve had a few cases where I\u0027ve cancelled a contract, and the penalty has been neither the loss of the advance money, or the loss from failure - it\u0027s been somewhere in between.
