Today, you still want to be pitched over to (more-or-less) 45\u00B0 by the time you reach 10km, but you start the turn sooner, just a few seconds after liftoff, and more gently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow about Eve: Heat is much more of a concern during Eve ascents than on Kerbin. \u003Cstrong\u003EThere is a strict speed limit in the lower/middle atmosphere\u003C/strong\u003E:\u00A0 starting at about 12km, anything that is faster than ~1200m/s will explode (with a sufficiently powerful rocket you can go faster below, only to instantly die at 12km). The limit only increases slowly, to perhaps 1400m/s@45km, when all of a sudden it goes away entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is the lower boundary for an ascent you can get away with: you want your ascent to be steep enough that you are close to, and preferably above, 50km by the time you reach an airspeed of 1400m/s.\u00A0 And later on, you want to be above ~70km when you reach orbital velocity -- you may go 3000m/s@60km, but only for a minute or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompared to what you can do on Kerbin, this is a rather steep ascent. Depending on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, you may go straight up for 3, 5 or maybe even 10km before you gently start tipping over. By the time you\u0027re 10 degrees off vertical, you\u0027re pretty much locked into your ascent. Let go of the controls if the rocket is aerodynamically stable, or turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E-to-prograde if it isn\u0027t. If it doesn\u0027t work out, try going steeper on the next attempt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, all of that said, it all depends on your launcher and how much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E you have in each stage. Some need to make steeper ascents, others have to take a shallow route and throttle down at some point in order to not burn up. Many cannot make it at all. From the screenshot, I cannot tell how much of that rocket is supposed to be the lifter, so I cannot be any more specific.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-23T07:02:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also depends on aerodynamics as well as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E -\u00A0 a skinny lander can punch through the atmosphere and accelerate out quickly better than a fat rocket can.
