Gilly is the smallest celestial body in the Kerbol system. Landing on Gilly is challenging due to its very low mass, steep slopes, and highly eccentric orbit, making it very easy to overthrust engines or send a spacecraft tumbling. Escaping Gilly, however, is very easy \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC the EVA jetpack can easily put a lone Kerbal into orbit or set him on an escape trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGilly has the least gravity of all bodies in the Kerbol system, with half of Jool\u0027s moon Pol due to its extremely small mass and size.
