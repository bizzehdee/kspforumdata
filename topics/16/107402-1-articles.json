How is it best to de orbit and return to ksc? I\u0027ve got plenty of monopropellant to deorbit using the oms, the question is where should I target, and what altitude? \n\nWARNING!

Hell, with 1.0.2 it got even easier.\n\nI can not tell you the exact periapse hight, as that varies with design. I\u0027d recommend you quicksave/load (F5 / hold F9) and try out different periapses over the KSC.\n\nDo S-turns in the upper atmo to slow down, without skipping out of the atmo."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T14:46:43Z","Content":"AIRBRAKES.\n\nAfter blowing up quite a few MK2 sized shuttles in 1.0.2 with any periapsis for reentry, I found only two ways of reentring safely.\n\n1. Semi-skip reentry: going down to ~35km and back up to lose speed until I am slow enough to dive safely\n\n2. AIRBRAKES.

Now, explain that...\n\nAnyway, retested in 1.0.2 and burning at around 72km apoapsis to a periapsis of 60km overhead KSP at the moment of the burn, almost brings me to the spot and with a nice unpowered glide, to ksc. Just make sure to reduce angle of attack to prograde or slightly above when speed is reduced below 800m/s to avoid stall spining the shuttle ( well, is depends on the craft, anyway)\n\nas a reference, in real world aircraft AoA should be kept below 18o to avoid stall\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nNote: I do not use airbrakes since they are not used in real world reentry crafts and I try to keep my space craft as realistic as possible (i\u0027d like to see an airbrake hold together on a mach 28 reentry...), this has also helped me port my 0.90 designs to 1.0 with minor changes too.\n\ns-turns yes, they do work both in game and real world\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI tried a 40o AoA, turned sideways in order not to bounce off atmoephere, the same the shuttle used in real life... The ship exploded in high atmosphere. All in one go, like the structure cluldn\u0027t hold the tensions ( but the atmosphere is so thin up there... 40km\u002B)\n\nI tried 0 angle of attack, and several other variations in between, the cockpit overheated and exploded in high atmosphere, but only showing faint signs of pink, the remainder of the craft reached surface, though, which is funny, since its drag, without the streamlined cockpit would be horrendous, still it glided well and the probe core did not overheated when entering the more dense layers of atmosphere, hell, maybe i should use my PC as heatshield for the pod... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nreally dunno what was with 1.0 and that design, the same design on 1.0.2 re-enters perfectly and I cannot even get the faintest signs of heat on my way down... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nOh, and by the way, 75x20 km is a pretty steep reentry angle, i always go for 75x60 and still it burned on 1.0, on 1.0.2 works wonderfully...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T23:40:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 11:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jaeleth**"}]}
