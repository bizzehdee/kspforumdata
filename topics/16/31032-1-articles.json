If you want to do it by yourself, you have to do each stage independently. Determine the m0 and m1 values for the stage and the average Isp across all active engines. The Isp should be weighted by mass flow if you really want a good value. Again, the addon is a much easier method.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T00:21:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor multistage rockets, you need to calculate each stage individually, counting the unused stages on top as part of the payload.
