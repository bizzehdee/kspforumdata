They are attached to a structural pylon attached to the distal fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther Edit: After increasing the size, and control authority of the rudder, I was able to rule out the rudder as an effect, as the problems persisted. Furthermore I saw that at 4 wheels, the back wheels tended to \u0022break\u0022 under the weight. Adding more wheels prevented the breaking, but didn\u0027t solve the yawing problem. At this point I believe it has something to do with using the small hardpoints themselves, since there were no wheels that were inverted or at an angle other than 90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal Edit: Look at these pictures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ip2kWQL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ip2kWQL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Mla87JA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Mla87JA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z7hU8Pd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022z7hU8Pd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing changed about the landing gear, was switching from a small hardpoint to 2 cubic octagonal struts.
