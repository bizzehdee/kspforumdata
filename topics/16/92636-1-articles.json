With experiments I found that landing is very simple, you can pretty much just do it unpowered. Taking off is also trivial.. That is as long as you have the infinite fuel cheat on. It just takes a very long time to get through the lower atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not a purist, I don\u0027t mind using any mod as long as it\u0027s not a blatant cheat. I\u0027d prefer something in the karbonite direction though. I\u0027ve seen scot manley do it, but the engines he uses are a bit OP and high up in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know of any examples I can look at that are able to do it?
