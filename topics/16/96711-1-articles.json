Basically, the different draw modes are ways to visualize on the Map Screen your spacecraft\u0027s trajectory. All of them say the same thing, fundamentally, but represent your trajectory in different ways on the Map. Each one has its uses (esp. mode 0, which allows you to plan gravity assists and close-approaches within your target SOI), although some people may prefer one over another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlocking so that you can use Mode 0 is pretty much essential if you want to do any interplanetary travel. That way you can Focus View on your target body, see where you trajectory is in relation to the body, and fine-tune your trajectory from very far away, minimizing dV needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-14T22:31:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2015 10:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NASAHireMe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T23:23:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JHadden123\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JHadden123\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t grasp explanations of what they are, so instead can someone explain why it\u0027s useful to unlock them?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn gameplay terms, patched conics is what lets you see your trajectory \u003Cstrong\u003Eafter\u003C/strong\u003E SoI changes - for example when you encounter Mun - as well as telling you when that will happen \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.
