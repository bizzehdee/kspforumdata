After spending some time playing around and learning the basics, I\u0027m now no longer \u0022reverting\u0022 missions and trying to set some goals. My first is to land unmanned (err, unKerballed) probes on every body in the system. The mun and minmus were easily achieved. I tried for Duna last night and am learning how to adjust my orbital inclinations, etc. However, one problem is that when I\u0027m playing with the maneuver mechanism and trying to visualize how that will alter my orbit compared to my target, all of the planet orbits \u0022get in the way\u0022 and make it difficult to discern my current orbit from my intended orbit from Duna\u0027s orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to temporarily hide the orbits of the other planets? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-29T14:35:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/29/2013 02:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Project Pluto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T18:48:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENone that I know of.

If it\u0027s an issue of multiple SOI changes you can change CONIC_DRAW_LIMIT to something higher than what it is. Also, i suggest using axlemoon\u0027s interplanetary transfer window calculator (I think thats it) so that you have a far more efficient interplanetary transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
