However, they can be partially simulated by orbiting at the same orbit as e.g. the Mun, but with a certain distance in front of or behind it (outside the SOI).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I found that they are not very stable; my comms relay that was about 2,800 km from the Mun got swallowed into its SOI and thus changed orbit drastically. I suppose this happened when I was warping my interplanetary probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone tried this (I\u0027m sure you have)?

Best place to put it to avoid is probably around L3, opposite side of Kerbin to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T14:36:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t have to be super-exact circular orbit. You only need to match Mun\u0027s orbital period. You can calculate your orbital period by subtracting timestamp at your AP and PE and multiplying that by two. Mun\u0027s orbital period is 138\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0984 seconds, i.e. 38h 36m 24s. Just put your probe anywhere along Mun\u0027s orbit (outside its SOI) and make sure its orbital period is as close as possible to that value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the safest place is opposite to Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T15:54:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, period-matching is the way to go.
