Only the mainsail is bad for interplanetary travel, the Poodle is actually quite good. The nukes are the quite sucky really. You do need many to reduce maneuvre time but even with 5 of them an interplanetary injection will take forever. And 5 nukes is getting very heavy. Their weight and low thrust offset the low fuel use. Maneuvres that stretch over 20 minutes are also to require corrections so sometimes it\u0027s better to have a punchier engine. They are not my ideal choice for heavy stuff though sattelites and probes are a little better. Also, if you wish to send fuel tanks across IP distances, then nukes are almost mandatory because you want most of the fuel to actually get to destination, rather than be used for travel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T06:32:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eanother disadvantage of nukes is their size.
