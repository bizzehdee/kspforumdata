However, many of them are functional for upper stages. In most of the mounts I included two floating nodes under them that you can use to attach the lower stage, then use struts to properly connect them together. This usually ends up making a stronger connection, in anycase, engine fairings tend to cause wobbliness at times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T20:23:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne way to do this is to have a central engine or component that the decoupler can attach to between all the engines.

My head hurts but it will be easier next time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is my solution - an engine enclosure fairing part. Here are a few pictures - the model and paint job is pretty noddy, and it looks like some guy on work experience has had a go with some blue paint in the bottom of the fairing attachment plate, but you can\u0027t see it too easily as it is mostly obscured by the engine cluster.
