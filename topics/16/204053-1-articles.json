Okay so first, for example let\u2019s say you wanted to attach 4 radial decouplers by using the radial symmetry 4 function\u00A0on\u00A0a ship and after putting them on\u00A0it shows that decoupler/division\u00A0symbol on your staging along with a little green 4. So basically that would obviously mean all 4 decouplers\u00A0would\u00A0decouple in whatever stage they\u2019re in. But how are you suppose to \u201Csplit\u201D\u00A0those decouplers in their stage? And what I mean by split is turn that one decoupler\u00A0symbol with a green 4 on it into 4 symbols\u00A0with 1,2,3, and 4. I don\u2019t know what this is called and have no idea how to really do it on console.\u00A0What do I have to do in order to \u201Csplit\u201D them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TIMEFORSPACEPEOPLE","CreatedById":212789,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-27T16:06:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo anyone that came here\u00A0I\u00A0actually figured it out.
