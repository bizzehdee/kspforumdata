So, the distance between your starting planet and destination planet is constantly changing, as are their relative positions around the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you time things right, waiting for an ideal alignment of the planets, you can travel there with very little fuel expended on a minimum-energy Hohmann transfer.
