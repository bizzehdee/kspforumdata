Yesterday, I decided to fly the stock vehicle Osprey. (I DID replace a structural fuselage with a precooler, but that\u0027s it.) Suddenly, Yaw control is good enough to change my heading by 45 degrees in less than five seconds.

This has a huge effect due to the lever principle. Also, could be that it\u0027s not that aerodynamically stable (so doesn\u0027t want to fly straight as hard as a really stable one would, thus more maneuverable) or that it\u0027s got a lot of thrust vectoring. I\u0027m not familiar with the stock vessels, but all these can affect how well it turns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-22T04:33:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep, IIRC both of those, plus that it uses an all-moving tail (like the RA-5 Vigilante) rather than just control surfaces on the trailing edge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-22T10:49:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGameplay question moved to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mk1980","CreatedById":163203,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-22T15:39:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni tried that Osprey stock plane. it\u0027s really nice to fly. it\u0027s very light (only ~7 tons), has pretty large wing area ( \u0026gt;10 m\u00B2) and fairly big control surfaces for its size.\u00A0it also uses the panther jet engine which has quite a bit of thrust vectoring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso it\u0027s extremely maneuverable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni think there are 3\u00A0things worth pointing out (that may not be imediately obvious at first glance)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- it uses dedicated control surfaces (pitch/roll is disabled for the tail fin, roll/yaw is disabled for the BigS elevons, yaw is disabled for the outer elevons). such a setup can help a lot with making control inputs more precise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- most of the fuselage elements are lightweight structural fuselages. there is only one mk1 fuel tank on that plane somewhere in the middle of the fuselage\u00A0(which is also why it\u0027s so light and easy to control).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- the small mk0 fuel tanks on the bottom are empty. they serve as floating bodies (the plane can land on water and also take off from water)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-22T17:31:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a detailed writup about plane design, if you want to go into a lot of detail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe comments about KSP\u0027s drag model are outdated since 1.0 though, afaik.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/47818-basic-aircraft-design-explained-simply-with-pictures/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-22T17:31:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2016 05:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
