It was very time consuming to reattaching everything, but it had to be done cause the old tanks have the new dry mass, which makes them awful to use."},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T09:52:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The way I did it was straight up delete the old tanks and put in new ones.
