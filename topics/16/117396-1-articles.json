Then (when i have all the data from all bioms) i fly my lab home and get the data to Kerbins surface.\n\nBuilding as usual in 1.0.4 poses a little problem now tho: i cant transfer the mystery goo and materials bay experiments anywhere. I just noticed that there is a \u0022collectable\u0022 flag not checked with those two. So am i correct that there is no way of retrieving the data to its full potential without landing the Container itself?\n\nIf thats the case: if i am, say around Tylo right now, my mission-science ratio will take a serious hit, right?\n\nHow do you guys handle that change? Doesn\u0027t this kind of nullify the use of the \u0022clean experiment\u0022?\n\ngreez\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T16:19:18Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 04:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Grossbeer**"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T16:10:09Z","Content":"No, they can be collected, but you need a Scientist to rerun them.
