My own self, I started with the VAB and then moved to spaceplanes once I felt I had rockets down. I also preferred to play around in the sandbox before heading on to career mode, but then again I\u0027ve been around since 0.18 (when career mode didn\u0027t exist).\n\nNow, if what\u0027s happening is you\u0027ve tried building stuff to launch through trial and error and haven\u0027t had success, and you want success, you\u0027ll have to learn how to do the math. The math isn\u0027t hard - really, it isn\u0027t. I\u0027ll go through a general design process later; right now I have to get somewhere.

I recommend being reasonably good at atmospheric aircraft before worrying about the space bit.\n\nIn science or career mode planes can be a bit tricky. But you can make a rocket plane or a rocket-launched glider as soon as you unlock winglets; launch vertically and land with chutes. The range may be short but such a craft can be useful for completing visual survey contracts."},{"CreatedByName":"QuantumInc","CreatedById":137889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T23:27:41Z","Content":"The only real reason to avoid the space plane hangar is in career mode where the related parts are simply unavailable at first. A lesser reason is that getting a space plane into orbit is far trickier than getting a vertical launch rocket to orbit. Of course a space plane that can\u0027t reach orbit is simply an air plane, which are plenty fun and useful in the game.\n\nA lot of people decide that they greatly prefer using space planes to get things into orbit. The drawback is that building and flying one is more complicated, and more expensive, but the advantage (in career) is that if you can land it safely it is vastly cheaper.\n\nThere are different skills to develop in this game. Like any good \u0022sand box\u0022 game you can go in any direction, there is a wide range of things to do, and often different skills you as a player will have to develop in order to do them. There isn\u0027t a specific order that you have to learn these things.

Once you\u0027ve unlocked solar panels, separators, reaction wheels, and LV-909s from other branches, you can pretty much spend your science wherever you like, and if that\u0027s aerodynamics then that\u0027s fine. It takes a little more science to get to useful spaceplanes than to decent sized rockets, but Mun landings are entirely possible on 1.25m parts if you build with an eye to minimalism; you\u0027ll just have to send quite a few to bash out as much science as you can ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T09:08:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 09:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eddiew**"},{"CreatedByName":"UnusualAttitude","CreatedById":129962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T09:44:56Z","Content":"With all due respect to them, ignore the experts and get designing your spaceplanes if that is what you feel is fun. The only thing you need is the basic jet engine and some wings: aerial surveillance contracts will then provide you with plenty of cash and science to unlock the turbojet, and meanwhile allow you to perfect your airframe design and practice take offs and landings. Personally, I\u0027ve never designed or launched a large rocket in KSP. All my \u0022firsts\u0022 (Mun, Minmus) were with small landers launched by spaceplane. It\u0027s just what I like to do.

What you may really be asking is \u0022should I try to build around mirror symmetry and learn to balance a ship for horizontal flight before I\u0027ve mastered radial symmetry techniques and axially distributed centers of mass and thrust?\u0022\n\nIf the above sentence didn\u0027t make any sense to you, then yeah maybe you should build in VAB for a while until you understand how to balance a rocket for flight. Does it wobble at any point in its arc? Whether or not it does matters less than whether you know WHY it does. Once you understand how to balance mass and thrust and can think about adding lift to the equation, the SPH is your new playground. \n\nI\u0027m primarily an SSTO driver myself, so I love the SPH. Whenever I start a new save I am getting science as quick as I can to unlock the aerodynamic parts I need to bring kickass vehicles to the runway."}]}
