You can burn at 10% for 10 minutes, or 100% for 1 minute. So long as your ship is stable and can take the forces involved. If you\u0027re doing this with a maneuver node, make sure to center your burn time around zero seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few cases where it\u0027s more efficient to make a short hard burn than a long burn. For instance, in a gravity well (in other words, landing). Because you\u0027re fighting the planet\u0027s gravity for every second you\u0027re not on the ground, it is most efficient to minimize that time. Meaning you burn at full throttle for just long enough to kill your motion relative to the surface. Ideally, you reach 0m/s just as you touch down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may also wish to use shorter burns for orbital plane change maneuvers (the thrust will be most efficient when closest to the crossing node). And I use a series of short (4 minute) periapsis kicks to push my interplanetary missions out of Kerbin orbit. Due to the Oberth Effect, your rocket is slightly more efficient the faster you\u0027re moving. So doing these burns at periapsis is better. Also, starting a burn too far before your ejection will push your path into Kerbin, which is sub-optimal if your intent is an interplanetary voyage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anglave","CreatedById":62706,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T16:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tuguley\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tuguley\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know about everyone else, but the following statement is what helped me out the most:\u003Cp\u003EThe perfect landing is the perfect liftoff \u003Cem\u003Ein reverse\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an airless world, this is a great image. An ideal landing kills your vertical and horizontal speed relative to the surface in the minimum time, such that your speed is 0 m/s (or at least low enough for your landing legs) when you reach the surface. This means almost all the thrust should be applied at the very end of your landing (or the very beginning of your launch). Landing this way is going to be scary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtmosphere makes things substantially different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunching from a body with an atmosphere, we attempt to balance the thrust lost to atmospheric drag with the thrust lost to gravity drag. We use the throttle to keep our speed low while we\u0027re low, while trying to spend as little time close to the planet as possible. But we end up thrusting for a couple minutes, to fight atmospheric and gravity drag and get our speed up to orbital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on a body with an atmosphere, you can rely on atmospheric drag to slow your rocket down substantially. Even without parachutes, on any body in the Kerbin system, you\u0027ll probably only have to kill a couple hundred m/s with the engines. And with parachutes you can make an entirely unpowered landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
