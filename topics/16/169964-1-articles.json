Basically I\u0027m wondering what is the most efficient way to conduct a land and return mission to Pol. I\u0027m in career mode so I\u0027ll likely try to\u00A0scrape\u00A0it as close as possible.

Use Tylo for the free capture (Laythe works as well, but since you\u0027re going to Pol, probably better to stay further out). Once you see that you have a projected orbit, you have all the time in the world (about a year and a half) to mess around with maneuver nodes to line up the best Pol encounter you can. Either burning in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of Jool or Tylo itself should get the job done for pretty cheap. And Pol\u0027s gravity is so low, the land and return to Kerbin can be done with a very small lander. Even a larger one is pretty straight forward if you wanna bring along some extra Kerbals to gain experience. And since this is a career game, it wouldn\u0027t hurt to send a detachable probe with a survey scanner to scan Pol for ore. It\u0027s a pretty good insurance move for future exploration. Pol is a great place to set up mining operations to refuel\u00A0Jool missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-23T15:15:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to try something a bit more complex, Eve can give a reasonable boost without increasing the flight time that much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, for most game purposes, a direct transfer to Jool is simpler and effective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
