The trick is to use a two and half stage design, where the first-and-half stage is composed by cheap srbs attached to a liquid fuel core. The core is kept at low thrust, to have a longer burn, while srbs provide the extra thrust to mantain a proper twr in the early ascent. The core flames out while the apoapsis is near the edge of the atmosphere, at an altitude that it is kept on-rails by the game while falling away from the upper stage. That upper stage burns for a few seconds to push the apoapsis just outside the atmosphere, then it coasts to the circolarization burn. When circularization is finished, the first stage core is still on rails, at an altitude of about 30km. Then it\u0027s focused again and landed with the help of few chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mystique","CreatedById":95628,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T16:07:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStageRecovery mod is just fine, especially if you don\u0027t want to babysit every decoupled piece of your booster stage and make bets on whether you\u0027ll be able to switch to falling stage before it disappears or not.
