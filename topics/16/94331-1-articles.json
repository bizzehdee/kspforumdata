Perhaps dial in a bit of attack angle on the main wings - ie. a slight ~10 degree angle - move the wing angle from present --- shape toward a \\ shape (but nothing like that sharp). This will aid in take off and allow the wings to generate optimum lift whilst your nose is pointed to the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve an awful lot of yaw authority on there, and I\u0027m not entirely sure the canards on the wing tips are helping in that regard - though I may well be wrong here. Possibly experiment removing those main wing canards and instead giving an upward inflection to the delta wing tips, a little like the wing tips on a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_Next_Generation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E737-NG\u003C/a\u003E. This should help encourage the plane to keep it\u0027s tummy pointed toward the ground and it\u0027s top toward the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuspect you can also daisy chain the fuel lines under the wings from the body, to one engine pod to the next, to keep things looking neat too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E Occurs to me that we haven\u0027t actually asked the problem you\u0027re having. If it\u0027s one of stability in flight then the suggestions above might begin to put things right, but like I say you\u0027re definitely on the right track. If it\u0027s a case of bouncy wings, well that does indeed get a little problematic, easiest solution is one you\u0027ve already started - moar struts. If it\u0027s a case of insufficient lift then your options are bigger wings, or less mass. On the mass front, there\u0027s at least one part in your plane which by default comes loaded with oxidiser - the Mk3 to 2.5m slanted adaptor part toward the back of the plane - assuming you\u0027re not taking this thing to space and all your engines are air breathers then you have no need for that oxidiser and removing it prior to launch will reduce your mass quite noticeably.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-24T14:46:20Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2014 02:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MiniMatt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"captain_fiddlesticks_","CreatedById":98189,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T15:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I was waiting I was bored and redesigned it!
