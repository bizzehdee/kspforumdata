This is basically the slope of its descent path because that\u0027s what gliders do---they go down. To maximize L/D, you want as much lift and as little weight as you can put into 1 plane of practical size. That\u0027s pretty much all there is to it, apart from the usual balancing of CoM and CoL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe aware that there are no air currents in KSP, so you can\u0027t climb in thermals like real gliders do. Thus, any glider needs some form of propulsion to get up in the air to start with. This can be a conventional engine or, if playing stock, the glitch/cheat \u0022infini-glide\u0022 thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso be aware that there are no stock airbrakes or spoilers so planes that glide very well can be difficult to land. They just don\u0027t want to quit flying and you have to force them down, but this can inadvertently cause some \u0022infini-glide\u0022 propulsive effect from the repeated control inputs. If you use FAR, you can\u0027t infini-glide even accidentally, and you can put spoilers on the plane to force it down without it gaining speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"endl","CreatedById":119320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T03:09:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyea i just wanted to get a more accurate measure of how much wing i need so that i can land without engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T03:50:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022endl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022endl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eso is there a preferred ratio for lift/drag or do you just want to be in the positive? in which case is there a mod that tells you total drag?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou just want to be in the positive, the more the better.
