They do it for me. Could You elaborate on this? maybe a screenshoot? Are You sure that You are placing them ON the decouplers, and that when You are trying to do so, the booster doesn\u0027t collide with any part that might be sticking out from the rocket above or below it?

Also, symmetry sometimes for no good reason, prevents You from attaching parts (I usually battle with it when adding RCS blocks). You just need to move the mouse around ever so slightly, millimetre after millimetre.
