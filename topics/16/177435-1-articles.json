The KSP version a craft was \u003Cs\u003Ecreated\u003C/s\u003E last edited in is saved in the craft file, and KSP checks this at loading.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn general, older versions of KSP will refuse to load craft files created in newer KSP versions, identifying them as \u0027incompatible\u0027 in the load dialog, to avoid compatibility problems.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou can fool older KSP versions to read newer craft files, by editing the craft file. BEWARE: the craft may have issues affecting its performance that are difficult to spot/debug; the game can/will often not identify this for you.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn general, KSP is programmed to load, and where needed convert (*2) craft files from older versions. The game will generally show some message or error if it cannot correctly load an older craft file... but not always.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBEWARE: KSP has little to no intelligence built-in to deal with parts that have changed significantly. Eg. parts that changed size will end up clipped or leave gaps, if resources changed the old values will be retained, etc.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome differences across versions/patches will cause weird loading errors, where no error is shown but a craft ends up loading only partially, or never finishes loading.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIMPORTANT:\u003C/strong\u003E Make backups of your craft files before unleashing a new version of KSP on them. KSP can and will overwrite craft files, sometimes silently, and you may never be able to return to a working file unless you have backups.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is very hard to make specific statements regarding craft compatibility across versions, because it all depends on the exact changes made and whether the craft\u0027s parts, design, and/or configuration touch any of those changes. It is more likely for craft files to work within the same major version, but don\u0027t trust on that (\u0027minor\u0027 patches have regularly made changes with big impact on crafts).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(*1: warranty void if you actually attempt to load a craft file.
