I know that now pods no longer function as an SAS module anymore. I have a very small satellite that I would like SAS on, but the current modules are way too big and mess up the look of my satellite. Is there some smaller module I missed, or am I going to just have to suck it up and use the big SAS modules?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
