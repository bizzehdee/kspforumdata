If your rocket is ever vibrating from launch to landing, shaking even, the reason is because somewhere there is a part clipped. Examine your rocket closely and you\u0027ll find it.\n\nJust wanted to point this out because I spent 45 minutes on a clipped decoupler just now ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Anglave","CreatedById":62706,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T21:01:10Z","Content":"In particular, the Service Bays cause problems if anything is clipped in/near their doors."},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T21:06:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In particular, the Service Bays cause problems if anything is clipped in/near their doors.\n\nYup, modded thin decouplers \u002B service bay = a rockin good time!"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T21:39:26Z","Content":"Also, if you put a probe core inside a service bay, always mount it on the floor (or on something else mounted on the floor).
