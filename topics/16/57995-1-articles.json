I found that 45 degrees is a good angle for spot lamps when aiming for ground illumination and 5-15 degrees for standard lamps when illuminating exterior craft surfaces. The lights are just really finicky and you have to play with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T08:38:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might not actually want them to be parallel, but it depends just what you mean. As far as I can see, they emit a cone of light, so you get the largest area illuminated by having them angled a little outwards, as they tend to be by default. That\u0027s assuming you\u0027re attaching 3 or 4 of them around the body a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T09:04:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can switch on the light while at VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork_werewolf","CreatedById":90749,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T09:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can switch on the light while at VAB. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E I think the point is you can use this to see what the light will illuminate and if it is pointing straight.\u003Cp\u003EYea all lights start a bit off centre about 10-15 degrees I think, so yea turn sideways rotate 2 or three times and rotate back for it to shine straight up or down.
