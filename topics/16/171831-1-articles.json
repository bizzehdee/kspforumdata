I\u0027ve play about 40 hours and just completed the rendezvous contract/mission. The last thing i got before the docking contract was the Mun landing contract. Now after completing that contract i got a new one saying to do the same thing on Mun. But when am i going to get the Minmus mission? In all tutorial series on youtube they\u0027ve all gotten the Minmus Mission right after the Mun mission but i\u0027m just not getting it. Is there any reason for that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in Advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IncongruousGoat","CreatedById":157062,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-08T20:25:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe order the Explore missions appear in is somewhat random. Essentially, after you complete any given Explore mission the game randomly picks a new one out of the pool of Explore missions it thinks you\u0027re ready to do. That pool is, in turn, determined by what missions you\u0027ve completed thus far, including World\u0027s Firsts bonuses and similar automatic rewards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally speaking, I usually don\u0027t bother with the Explore contracts after the very early game, as they tend to have one do some rather silly things that I\u0027d rather not be doing. It\u0027s usually possible to function off of the income from other contracts (satellites are especially nice), and from World\u0027s Firsts bonuses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, welcome to the forums!
