This one is supposed to complete Explore contracts for Pol and Bop. Now, I\u0027ve done the approach to Jool many times before, but this time I\u0027m curious - what is the best way to approach the system\u0027s outer moons? I see two options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Bi-elliptical-style transfer, where you fly in close to Jool to maximize Oberth effect and fire your engine until your periapsis is near where your target orbit (I think I\u0027ll do Pol first) is, then do what you have to do to reach the moon in question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The \u0022Casual approach\u0022, where you put your approach periapsis near your target moon\u0027s orbit (or so), then burn to circularize. This \u003Cem\u003Eseems\u003C/em\u003E easier, at least at first glance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, does anyone know? Also, would a high-speed (al-la New Horizons) trajectory have an impact on how you capture?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-28T21:40:14Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2015 09:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by moogoob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGot it answered.

Your ships will not explode, and you can be (fairly) sure the orbital paths predicted by patched conics will be true. You can - from KERBIN - nail a Pol or Bop encounter (though getting your resultant Jool orbit up near them is really the best you should try for).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When you leave Laythe or Tylo, your Jool periapsis will be a bit higher than it would have been after an aerocapture, so the eventual burn out at Pol or Bop will be all the lower for it. Not only is a Tylo slingshot easier, it\u0027s cheaper! Not too many of the easy ways are cheaper in KSP.
