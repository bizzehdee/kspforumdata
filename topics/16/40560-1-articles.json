I am dumb, I suppose, and I should have been patient. Turns out the issue was not that I could not select Jool. Hiding the other craft, or tabbing through the planets, allowed me to highlight Jool but not actually set it as my target. I checked other craft that were \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E on a trajectory to intercept Jool, and they \u003Cstrong\u003ECOULD \u003C/strong\u003Eset Jool as a target.
