Even if after several course tweaks en route you still have a retrograde (clockwise) orbit when you enter Duna\u0027s SOI, it still costs very little dV (on the order of 50-80m/s) to switch it to prograde (clockwise) if you do this as soon as you enter the SOI. The easiest way to is to burn radial inwards and just pull your Pe all the way through Duna and out the other side to the desired altitude. It\u0027s best to do this without a node, just point radial inwards and burn at like 1/4 throttle while watching your Pe move. When you get very close to the desired altitude, fine-tune it with RCS.\n\nOf course, the above only matters if your Duna lander has to dock with a mothership after landing, in which case it\u0027s important that the mothership be in a prograde (counterclockwise) orbit. If you don\u0027t have to dock and the lander is going to fly home by itself, then the direction of its orbit prior to landing doesn\u0027t matter. Once on the ground, you can take off towards the east and be in a prograde orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T04:47:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The direction of your orbit is **irrelevant** when transferring to another planet.\n\u003E The direction of your orbit changes nothing except which side of the planet you are on when you make your burn.
