Questions are unrelated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, I\u0027m thinking of setting up a challenge, but it\u0027d require any challengers to download a mod. I\u0027m wondering if I can simply offer them a GameData folder with the mod included for download, or whether that\u0027s a non-distribution violation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I\u0027ve recently gotten into interplanetary travel, and there\u0027s one thing that\u0027s been frustrating me: I seem to have no control over what my inclination is when I enter a planet\u0027s SOI. It\u0027s seemingly random. I\u0027d really like to know how to consistently do transfer burns where I\u0027ll end up on an equatorial, or close to equatorial, trajectory. Or, better, just being able to \u0022pick\u0022 what inclination I enter at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T18:09:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the inclination question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing you need is \u003Cstrong\u003ECONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = 0\u003C/strong\u003E in your settings.cfg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, you must match your target\u0027s inclination in interplanetary space. You need to perform appropriate burn in An/Dn node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, get an intercept with the target. If your inclination matches, you should enter its SOI at equatorial plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZoom at your target and using small thrust or RCS fine tune your approach to get the required inclination. Repeat after you enter its SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need polar orbit, there\u0027s no need to match orbital inclination. Enter from any direction and just adjust the approach to end on polar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually if you already have an intercept it might be easier to adjust your inclination after you\u0027ve established orbit around the planet. Keep your orbit highly elliptic (don\u0027t circularize) and adjust the inclination in the more distant node. Note that you need to eyeball those nodes because the game won\u0027t tell you where you cross equatorial plane of your target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
