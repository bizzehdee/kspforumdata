Take off, while engines on max thrust (better to use all the runway).\n2. Pitch up to 30 degrees until you reach 10,000m high.\n3. Pitch down to 20 degrees until you get to either 25,000m high, or the jet engines automatically go off due to no air.\n4. Close intakes, and activate the next stage on max thrust.\n5. Keep at 20 degrees until you reach your desired AP, then while ascending to the AP point, re-distribute fuel to the front part of the plane (specifically the side tanks, the ones directly next to the intakes and the large one in the middle - there is a small round-8 tank in the cargo that has some oxidizer you can use as well).\n6. Once you are sure about fuel distribution, and got to about 20 seconds away of AP, start burning to get your PE high enough to establish an orbit.\n7. There is some mono propellant to be used in orbital maneuvers.\n\nAction groups:\n\n1. Close/open intakes\n2. Jet engines on/off\n3. Liquid engines on/off\n4. Open/close docking port\n5. Open/close hangar doors\n6. Extend/retract solar array\n7. Mono-propellant engines on/off\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Thrust to max, and take off, watch out while pitching up at the runway.\n2. Pitch up between 30 to 45 degrees as you wish to have your ascending profile.\n3. You can disable pitching on the front canards and use only the small elevons on the sides of the wings, if you want slower pitching control.\n4. Due to the massive force of the engines, DO NOT get nut with it as the MK1 cockpit will overheat and explode if you go at a very high speed for a while (above 1000m/s).\n\nAction groups:\n\n1. Extend/retract flaps on the plane (only if you want a slow take off and turning to head towards your target area)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
