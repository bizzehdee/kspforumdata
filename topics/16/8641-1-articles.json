It can be a tad frustrating to set up an ideal position for a module you want to link up with later, only to have all that hard work get thrown out the window because your OP decoupler threw your module into the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockets can go bump in the night, and only through the kerbal science of try, try again and paying attention to how rockets and modules behave when they are detached can we figure out how to cut down on the bumping. If you are detaching radially mounted stages that are a tad bit long, where the decoupler is makes a big difference. I have had ideal progress with putting the decoupler on the upper end, and then bracing the lower end with a strut or two. That way if there is a tad bit of thrust going on for whatever reason, there are better odds of the stage overshooting the remaining stages instead of being directed into them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\\\u0027t recommend multiple radial decouplers per stage, as one hiccup in your staging can make things real kerbal real fast.

Radial decouplers are typically used in first and second stages, in the atmosphere, well before getting involved in any rendez-vous or docking. It would be stupid to plan staging during a precise rendez-vous manoeuver. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you want a 0 force decoupler, just use a 0 force decoupler.
