I want to send a kerbal to Eeloo and back in career mode. It\u0027s going to be sort-of Apollo style, except for seperate launches. Dock the lander and main-ship in kerbin orbit, use the main-ship to fly the lander and itself to Eeloo orbit, undock the lander, land the lander on the surface, get back to Eeloo orbit, dock with the main-ship, decouple all of the lander except for the science and command pod, fly lander and main-ship back home. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.

Correct me if i\u0027m wrong, but flying to Eeloo requires only a slight bit more delta-V than a flight to Jool. However, there is no atmopshere for aerobraking, and it\u0027s been awhile since i\u0027ve journeyed out there. But, you\u0027re mothership looks like it has enough. Heck, 9,000 m/s is really enough to get you anywhere in the system and back, and you have more than that. I don\u0027t want to drone on for hours, though, so i\u0027ll just say yes. Good luck with your mission! And remember, if it doesn\u0027t work, just add more boosters.

Does Whack a Kerbal work in space? The middle stage of the lander that was only meant to help with docking got stuck on even after i decoupled it, too many struts of some thing. I tried to shoot something at it to get it off, but nothing would happen with Whack a Kerbal?
