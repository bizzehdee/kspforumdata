Which takes some practice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith solid boosters, you need a basic design -- and you need to know how high it goes when full of fuel. You can adjust the fuel load downward in 10% increments, which will reduce your altitude and speed a little. You can play with the thrust limiter which will reduce your altitude and speed a little. You can add fins or science devices or other draggy bits to reduce your altitude and speed a little. And you can always add a little mass, which will reduce your altitude and speed a lot. So the trick is basically that you know which booster you need to get above the requested altitude and speed. And then you do these little things to reduce it down to the exact number you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut after you get practiced a bit at it, you can get it right in just a couple launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-02T21:01:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMr \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E failed to extend this courtesy so, sadly, he will be fined and chastised at the next staff meeting.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, everything he said was right.
