When my jets top out its at 25km with about 1400 velocity.\n\nNow some things are puzzling me. \n\nThe orbital speed is given as 1400 at 25km and as i get to the AP, which is about 2 to 3 min away it slows down to below 1100. This is not due to drag but because i am exchanging E\\_kin with E\\_pot (its what i am thinking, plz correct me if i am wrong).\n\nNow if i want to follow oberth, i should thrust prograde asap at about 35 km when the drag is almost zero. However prograde now is about 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 up and if i thrust there, my AP rises and wastes energy.\n\nIf i aim down at -20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 i can lower the AP and move it a bit away from me, buying me time with low TWR engines. But then i am about 40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 off prograde making oberth less effective.\n\nIf i wait until about 1 min from AP and then do my about 2 min thrust it would be the standard but my AP will stay at 100km and for the challenge i only need 70. \n\nThe initial 100km AP is a given, so lets assume i can\u0027t do anything against that, only maneuvers after 25km are possible and the deltaV budget ofc is tight.\n\nI know the theory about all the stuff... but i am lost right now and don\u0027t know where to start.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T07:23:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 07:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NikkyD**"},{"CreatedByName":"Orbital Vagabond","CreatedById":145561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T17:44:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The orbital speed is given as 1400 at 25km and as i get to the AP, which is about 2 to 3 min away it slows down to below 1100.

This isn\u0027t so much an issue with the Oberth effect as it is that you\u0027re canceling out velocity with a non-parallel thrust (basically vector math).\n\nWhile thrust in your direction of travel is the most efficient way to add energy, it won\u0027t necessarily put you in the orbit that you want to be in. If you want a circular 70 km orbit, I would perform your orbital insertion right at 70 km thrusting mostly prograde, and slightly radial in (below the horizon). That way you won\u0027t go any higher than you need to, and will minimize losses due inefficient radial burning since your radial/vertical velocity vector will be lower (less vertical velocity to cancel).\n\nIf the suborbital trajectory with a 100 km Ap is locked in stone, I think this is the most efficient method to get a 70 km x 70 km orbit.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T17:46:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 05:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Orbital Vagabond**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T17:44:35Z","Content":"One thing you need to bear in mind here is that you have not just one, but *two* things you need in order to make a stable circular orbit. Energy is one (you\u0027ve already got that covered in your post above), but the other is *angular momentum*. To be in an orbit that has a periapsis that\u0027s high enough, you need *both* \u0022enough energy\u0022 and \u0022enough angular momentum.\u0022\n\nIn an ideal world where you don\u0027t have to worry about aerodynamics at all (i.e. if Kerbin had no atmosphere), then your theoretical optimum minimum-dV way to get in a circular orbit at some altitude would be:\n\n1. Have a craft with insanely high TWR (the higher the better)\n\n2. Take off nearly horizontally, using a single momentary burst at extremely high acceleration (the higher the better), powerful enough to raise your apoapsis to the desired orbit height\n\n3.

But essentially, you want to follow these rules:\n\n- Always burn exactly prograde; this optimizes energy efficiency.\n\n- To raise your apoapsis, do as much of your burn at as low an altitude as possible; this optimizes Oberth effect.\n\n- To raise your periapsis, wait until apoapsis and then burn prograde (this optimizes angular momentum efficiency).\n\nWhen I say \u0022angular momentum\u0022, I\u0027m referring to this:\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_relative_angular_momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_relative_angular_momentum)\n\nDoes this help?"},{"CreatedByName":"Orbital Vagabond","CreatedById":145561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T17:49:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In an ideal world where you don\u0027t have to worry about aerodynamics at all (i.e. if Kerbin had no atmosphere), then your theoretical optimum minimum-dV way to get in a circular orbit at some altitude would be:\n\u003E 1.

For example, if your only goal is \u0022be in orbit\u0022 (i.e. raise periapsis above atmosphere, and you don\u0027t care what the orbit looks like otherwise), then sticking to prograde is still the best option.\n\nTaking your example, where you\u0027re currently at 10 km and your apoapsis is already up at 225 km:\n\nIf you just coast up to 225 km and then thrust prograde to raise periapsis to 70km, you\u0027ll need to do a burn of 1958 m/s.\n\nHowever, if you do a prograde burn while still at 10 km to raise your apoapsis to, say, 50,000 km, then you only need a dV of 1645 m/s to do that... and then once you\u0027re up at 50,000km, a dV of only 43 m/s will raise your periapsis to 70 km, for a total burn of 1688 m/s.\n\nSo even in that case, sticking to prograde-burns-only will save you a few hundred m/s of dV.\n\nThat said, there can be cases where burning off prograde can make sense, depending on the goal. Getting to a particular desired orbit can mean adjusting both your angular momentum and your energy, and while it\u0027s always most desirable to do burns at periapsis/apoapsis to maximize efficiency for both, sometimes you don\u0027t have that choice (e.g. if burning at periapsis would be the theoretical ideal, but you\u0027re on a suborbital trajectory and your periapsis is deep underground, then you may have to compromise if you\u0027re not a fan of lithobraking). ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"}]}
