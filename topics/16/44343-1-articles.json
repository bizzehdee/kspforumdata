But, first of all, I don\u0027t even know what the darn thing is supposed to look like when it is properly put together! I have googled it and looked for it on YouTube and everything an I cannot find a picture of it completed or a video of it anywhere. Can someone please point me in the right direction.

I hope this kind of helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T04:26:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022General Add-on affairs\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
