So I just bought the game and I am having problems with the construction of ONE ship. When ever I place a piece and ask the Symmetry node to duplicate it all around, it places the duplicates vertically. I tried the \u0022W,A,S,D,E\u0022, but they rotate the pieces individually rather than the plane they are fixed upon. I can guess I probably hit the wrong button somewhere along the way, but I already ran through my entire keyboard, and apparently nothing reversed the process.
