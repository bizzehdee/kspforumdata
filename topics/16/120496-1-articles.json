A bugfix has been announced for the next patch. For a temporary workaround, you can try pressing Alt\u002BF12 and select \u0022ignore max temperature\u0022 in the Cheats tab. This will not stop the buggy heating, but it will stop your station from exploding due to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also try launching a new module with some Thermal Control Systems. Specifically those, the extending ones; using the static Radiator Panels will not help you, since they only do passive cooling. The thermal control systems will actively look for hot parts to cool down, so they may (or may not) be able to keep the heating in check.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T10:57:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsider installing STOCK BUG FIX modules, stickied in the addon releases, it may help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0060s a random bug, maybe restart KSP helps in Stock installation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rustle","CreatedById":149855,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T15:47:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFixed!
