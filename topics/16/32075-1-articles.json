Also, I would recommend switching the RCS translation controls from the default to the arrow keys and Right shift and control. This is much easier to see and understand. A small craft is best, with 4 RCS units as far away from the center of mass on the top and bottom. I also put 4 mono directional RCS thrusters on the center of mass to increase maneuverability, but it is unnecessary. Be sure to add on lights for a night rendezvous. Using chase camera will make the craft oriented so up on translate makes the ship go up relative to the camera, so you don\u0027t have to rely on the navball. Also, once you get closer, I recommend setting the docking port as target, as it makes the NavBall icons more useful. I use the arrow keys for Forward, backward, left, right, and the Rshift and Rctrl for up and down. Feel free to configure it to your liking, but I would like to emphasize not using the default controls as they are confusing and are an extra thing to learn and mess up on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what it sound you have never rendezvous before, so I\u0027ll help you out. Since the KSC is on the equator, you will want your station in an equatorial orbit. You should know this is at 90 degrees, but don\u0027t worry if you are off a degree or two, as you can adjust this while in orbit. By setting the mun as a target, you can make and equatorial orbit because it is in one too. Burn normal if the node is descending (-) or anti-normal if ascending (\u002B). Normal is roughly north in an equatorial orbit, but you want to burn in between the prograde and retrograde markers to not chance your apoapsis or periapsis. Next circularize your orbit by burning at the respective locations and be sure to burn at 90 degrees to not tilt your orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext launch an intercept ship so KSC is roughly 45 degrees ahead of the orbiting target. Set the station as a target and fly normally but, cap your apoapsis at the target\u0027s orbit. It is good to have a long trajectory by burning east longer so it is easier to make an orbital trajectory. Fiddle with your maneuver nodes until you get an encounter under the optimal 5 km. Quick save frequently (F5) and quick load (F9) as you might screw up, and trust me you will. Time warp to T - 20 seconds until closest encounter, then select \u0022target\u0022 in the velocity display by clicking. It could do this automatically if you are close enough. Burn at the new retrograde until your relative velocity is nearly 0. The two orbits should look the same. In map view again, burn toward the purple (at least I think purple) circle that indicates the direction of the target. Watch until the intercept is under 200m (.2 Km). Warp carefully and remember to quick save before each move, but extra practice can never hurt \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the closest encounter cut all relative velocity again, shut off your engine so you don\u0027t have any misfires by right clicking on your engine(s) and pressing \u0022shutdown engine\u0022. Use RCS for future maneuvering. I recommend switching to the station, clicking \u0022control from here\u0022 on the target docking port, setting the approaching ship and target, and rotating to face the purple circle again. You can cheat and time warp to 5x just for a moment to stop an rotational movement. Switch back to the docking vessel and re-set the ship as target, or your selected docking port for more accurate flying. Refer back for details on controls and camera angles. If you did the previous step, you should have a straight shot at the docking port move forward, but slow enough that you can stop on a dime. Time warp CAREFULLY in needed. Quick save, then make any final adjustments before going in for the kill. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour prograde marker should be over the purple circle still, and be sure to decelerate to .2-.1 m/s right before docking. The ports are magnetic so you don\u0027t have to be spot on. If you continue to wobble, turn on SAS when centered over the port. You will be docked when the camera shifts to the new center of mass. Beware, if you have a large station of many SAS units, the station can shake itself apart. I just use time warp to stop any spinning. The size of your station is limited because of the # of parts, so don\u0027t go overboard with crazy decorations or lights, but don\u0027t worry about that yet. Congrats if you got this far! If not, don\u0027t feel bad, just give me a ring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
