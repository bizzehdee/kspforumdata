For those who are math-adverse, I suggest you skip down to the bottom where I summarize the whole thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear engines have a thrust of 60 kN each, so four of them would give you a total thrust of 240 kN. Gravity on the Mun is 1.63 m/s^2, so in order for your ship to have a TWR of exactly 1, it needs to be 147 tonnes. However, you want a signifigantly higher TWR, something like 2 or 3, so your actual weight will be decidedly smaller, something in the range of 50 tonnes. However, the nuclear engines weigh 2.25 tonnes each, so you will have at least 9 tonnes of mass initially. The three-man capsule weighs a lot as well, 4 tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo our total mass so far is 13 tons. That still gives us a good amount of space left for fuel. To find out the amount of fuel we need, we can use the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelta-v = (specific impulse)(9.81 m/s^2) ln[(initial fuel mass/final fuel mass)]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of delta-v required for a landing on the Mun is ~640 m/s. Giving you a bit of a margin of error, let\u0027s assume 700. Doubling that, you want to take off afterwards, right? Our final delta-v required for a lander is going to be about 1400 m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear engines have a fantastic specific impulse, 800 s in vacuum! Therefore, plugging in our values and solving for the fuel ratio gives:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1400 m/s)/(800 s)(9.81 m/s^2) = ln(fuel ratio)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.1784 = ln(fuel ratio)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efuel ratio = 1.195\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, the final fuel level will be equal to the initial level divided by 1.195, or 0.8366 times the initial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel appears to weigh 1 ton per 90 units, so we can calculate how much we need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(mass of fuel \u002B dry mass) = initial mass of fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Einitial mass \u002B weight of parts = fuel \u002B dry \u002B 13\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efuel ratio = initial/final\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[fuel \u002B dry \u002B 13]/[dry \u002B 13] = 1.195\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can simplify this to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[fuel/(dry \u002B 13)] \u002B 1 = 1.195, or fuel/(dry \u002B 13) = 0.195\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe want to solve for the mass of fuel, while assuming a dry mass of half a ton (the assumes we require the fuel tank with stripes on the side; if we obtain a value for the fuel that fills a smaller tank, then we can use this)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efuel = (0.195)(13\u002B0.5) = 2.633 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince fuel weighs 1 t / 90 L:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.633t * 90L/1t = 237 L of fuel are required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnalysis of the weights and capacities of the fuel tanks, I would say that this is vastly under capacity for our stripy tank, which holds 360 L. While we could use it, as it would give us a final weight of 17.5 t, well within our 50 t weight limit, we want to save costs. Adding the smallest fuel tank gives us a fuel capacity of 270 L, which is a little more than what we calculated, but will be useful for extra delta-v. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now, using the awesome power of math, we have determined that the following rocket can land on the Mun:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/cafvefm3j/full/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s3.postimg.org/xwuvvgko3/screenshot429.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot429.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice my helper, the Kerbal Engineer in the corner saying that this rocket has a TWR of 9, and almost 1.6 km/s of delta-v.

The total mass of the final design was simply 9 tons, which is within a normal-sized rocket\u0027s ability to lift.
