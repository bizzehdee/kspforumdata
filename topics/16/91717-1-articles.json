I use aerobraking a lot and in some cases it\u0027s very important due to limited dV budget to slow down in a single pass through the atmosphere. I noticed that with FAR I should go deeper than with the stock aerodynamics, but right now it\u0027s trial and error. I wonder is there any similar aerobraking calculator that takes FAR model into account?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr at least, can anyone explain the math involved in calculations?

You are getting vastly different results depending on the orientation of your vessel. Even a craft without wings will create lift. AoA (angle of attack) basically describes the orientation of your vessel relative to the direction it travels. It directly affects how much lift will be created. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding aerobreaking: if you point your nose upwards you get a positive angle of attack and lift, which will reduce the effect of aerobreaking (you won\u0027t dive as deep down into the thick air and therefore you are not losing as much speed; the lift will keep you higher in the atmosphere -\u0026gt; less drag). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you point your nose down you will dive deeper tlinto the air and will experience more drag. That will slow you down and it might even get you suborbital. The trajectories mod usually gets it about right but you will still have to check it in map mode while you are passing the atmosphere. You can change your AoA to stay in control and do some corrections. And btw if you don\u0027t do that, your craft might bounce, whoble or changes it\u0027s orientation as a result of drag, lift, etc on it\u0027s own. As explained above, that affects your aerobreaking result (significantly). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat could be an explaination, but I can only guess depending on what you wrote earlyer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, precise aerobreaking with FAR can be very difficult to predict depending on the craft. I usually don\u0027t do aerobreaking with FAR within one maneuver as it leaves too little space for unpredicted stuff. I pass the atmosphere multiple times (with a higher periapsis on every pass). That leaves enough room for correction and makes everything easyer if you use deadly reentry like I do \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T12:50:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA quick example, to show why you should change the settings in Trajectories depending on orientation: Try a taking the small black command pod into lko.
