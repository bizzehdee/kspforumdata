That is my SSTO so no matter where I touch down, there is no debris or launch problems. The ship is smaller, lighter and more efficient.

A nice idea, it would certainly provide the rapid deployment I require and should be easy enough to make a 4 seater. I will consider this as an option, thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ Tank Buddy, I can see your point about the SSTO downsides, dragging about the extra weight of oxidiser and in-efficient rocket motors, especially if you need to break atmos twice in a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrop tanks would be quite difficult to engineer into a balenced craft I think, they would lead to quite a sizable shift in CoG between being fully fueled and dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you explain to me how you are flying an airbreathing aircraft at 30km? I havent been able to fly above 21-22km and even then only when I am about to light off the rockets for my spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do not have to rescue them, this is something I am doing for my own entertainment, End flight is still an option, I just want to return my crew to the space centre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ Sauliukas, That is a nice looking plane, and you have some pretty big claims for its abilities. I can see the equivilent of ~600 jet fuel and 720 rocket, what is your flight profile like to get 2 flights that break atmos out of that? Also you have 8 of the small radial rockets, 160KN, is that it? but from what I can tell a lot of rocket fuel for them, how long are you burning the rockets for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ TheFod, That is certainly a Kerbal looking aircraft! have you any details available for it? Most of your screenshots are nose on so I cannot see a lot of detail regarding fuel distribution and wing loading, could you provide some detail into the design behind this craft as landing on Minmus certainly equates to being able to circumnavigate Kerban \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Is it able to escape Kerban twice though as that would be a requirement of my aircraft?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankyou guys for all the replies, I will get to applying as many of the ideas as I can to my designs and hopefully get some planes that meet my needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T18:13:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERandom question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are OK using an oribatal plane (like the SSTO\u0027s mentioned), why not simply oribt your lander before you land?

Take a fuel tank of any size, place a few parachutes and a docking port or RAS refueling port (if you use it,) and build a rocket underneath it. Yes, a rocket. Next, launch it on a sub-orbital trajectory to some point roughly half way between KSC and your Kerbal. Next, build a plane that can reach that point on a one way trip. Repeat this process until you have enough \u0022gas stations\u0022 to get your plane to your Kerbal and back to one of them.

However most often I return from outside the Kerbin gravity well and go directly into a deep aerobrake such as I do not achieve orbit, thus I land wherever I happen to be at first encounter. Because I know I have so little control of landing location, I do not bother building powered re0entry vehicles, accept the inaccuracy in exchange for lighter vehicles in total. In regards to your final question, it is both, I do not carry fuel because my aim is bad so I do not bother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ rpayne88, RAS fuelling port? is that a mod? if so then no I do not use it.
