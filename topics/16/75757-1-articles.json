There are a few ways to fix it, depending on your preference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Disable the torque modules via the right-click menu.

(My personal choice.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI became used to having separate controls.

Whichever way the command core/pod is facing - and it certainly helps to have forward-facing - SAS will detect any gradient or camber as unstable pitch/roll/yaw and attempt to \u0027correct\u0027 it by steering all over the place or flipping over.
