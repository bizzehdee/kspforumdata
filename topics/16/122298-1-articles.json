You don\u0027t want to induce any roll, pitch or yaw when you just want to translate. Placing thrusters an even distance either side of the stages CoM really helps. Also, place them 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 apart so they don\u0027t \u0022fight\u0022 each other. In flight, when looking at your ship from one end, the pattern made by the exhaust from the thrusters should make a square/diamond pattern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep your speed down. It\u0027s better to move in at a low speed and use the time warp to speed things up.

The prograde marker can really help show if you are just moving towards or away from your target, or if you have movement in any other plane messing things up. Moving a couple of m/s towards or away from your target should place the prograde/retrograde marker in the middle of the NAV ball. If its a little off, you can use the RCS thrusters keys to centre it and stop any unwanted movement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clear Air Turbulence","CreatedById":149987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T15:50:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E:cool:\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E:cool:\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edon\u0027t ask me how\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow I got both ships\u0027 noses to touch - not at all aligned \u0026amp; then we sort of nuzzled like drunken whales until the magnetism of the docking port finally took over\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout the docking port alignment indicator, which somehow does not want to work on my system.
