The bay has a green ball attach point in the middle of each section and unless i stick the docking port on that and rebuild a probe every time from there It wont attach. if I stick a clamp on the top of the carbobay it works immediatly. I find this quite frustrating as i would preferr it to have sensors on the nose rather than a docking clamp. Am i missing something or is this a bug or general game play gotcha?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T04:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ea picture of your probe would help greatly, but the issue could very easily be that the parts on your probe are clipping the decoupler/docking port, or if you are not using a decoupler/docking port then they could be clipping the end of the cargo bay, and you will not be able to get your probe out again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T04:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECubic octagonal struts are also your friend here.
