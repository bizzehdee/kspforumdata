It adds fairings, but also a lot of other parts. The same goes for AIES or NovaPunch, though NovaPunch wasn\u0027t updated last time I checked. Or you could just make them out of stock parts. No matter how you use them, though, fairings are actually gonna increase the drag of your rocket, unless you use FAR (Ferram Aerospace Research), which introduces realistical aerodynamics to the game.
