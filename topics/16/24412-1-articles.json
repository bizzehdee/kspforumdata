It\u0027ll make your rover far more stable.

A key binding to toggle can be useful so you can turn tighter circles at low speed when you want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) - Some RCS pointing skywards work very well on low grav. Have keybinds to toggle RCS clusters on an off so you can use only the skyward ones for example. When struggling to move off on a low grav world, thrusting the RCS will push you onto the surface getting a stronger grip. If you\u0027re starting to \u0027wobble\u0027 on your wheels, thrusting the RCS will again push you down, hopefully stabilizing you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) - Use a light touch on the keyboard, small smooth movements, and if you feel it start to lose control stop accelerating. Be ready on Q and E on a low grav world to fix any spin if you start rolling\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tom1499","CreatedById":38308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T09:51:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet out and push!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-28T09:54:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2013 09:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tom1499\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warscribe","CreatedById":58388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T09:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETristavius: well, except for the previously mentioned symmetry problem, my rover actually fulfills all your criteria.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tom1499","CreatedById":38308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T09:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol rovers can be annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T10:20:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing something?
