Try doing most of your meetup maneuvers from the map view, and if you are early in the campaign it is worth upgrading the Tracking Center to level 2 before you attempt anything like this -- in fact it\u0027s almost impossible if you don\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of hacking difficulty, returning a wayward \u00A0Kerbal to the Astronaut Complex is relatively really really easy but you would still be dealing with a technical file and if you aren\u0027t very good with spreadsheets and stuff it might be best to leave it alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a small amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E will help get Jeb home (like say you\u0027re stuck in a 75x75 orbit over Kerbal) you can actually have Jeb EVA and push the rocket to slow it down; when he gets low on fuel just pop him back into the capsule and he\u0027ll refill. Be careful to leave about 1.5 units of your EVA fuel for reserve though, because sometimes EVA is a little glitchy and you might need it to get back into the pod. You will have to upgrade the Astronaut Center to level 2 to attempt this if you are in early campaign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that happens to me sometimes is if I\u0027m closing with a docking maneuver, and I alt-tab or timewarp, when I tab back in I\u0027ve flown past the target. In that case your target reticule will be somewhere to the side of or behind you; try rotating around 180 and see if you can spot it. That is sort of what it sounds like when you say you approached to 3.7km and he disappeared; he probably moved off to one side because you flew past him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-09T17:35:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2016 05:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by dire\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
