Realistic being relative to all of the other movies out there, the most obvious being Armageddon. Now in my humble opinion the Messiah is one of the nicest ships in all of science fiction mainly because it utilizes mostly real parts that exist today cobbled together TO SAVE THE WORLD! Now looking at the pictures I have determined a few mods make it possible to recreate. The Component Space Shuttle, Tiberdyne Shuttles, FASA parts, Bobcats American and Soviet Packs. Now here is the issue. How do I put it all together. Now I can spend a few hours in the VAB testing launching and maybe put it all together cheat and get the thing launched into orbit cheating. But I don\u0027t want to do that. I want it to be as realistic as possible and I want it to be functional. I also want to strap the ARM to the top or front and use it to redirect asteroids. That last part is optional but I want to realistically assemble this thing in orbit like they did in the movie. I suppose all the little bits are relatively simple but how do I launch what looks like Space Shuttle SRBs and Energia Boosters into orbit without using the fuel in them. Now I can use the SRBs from KSO because they are liquid but still how do you launch an SRB? So I am just looking for ideas and advice, pictures would be greatly appreciated and if someone has a mod or is making a mod for this I am very interested. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany Thanks, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v102/McTodd69/Deep%20Impact%20Messiah/x_5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022x_5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.fantastic-plastic.com/Messiah7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Messiah7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.fantastic-plastic.com/deep_impact_model.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022deep_impact_model.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v399/Broncorancher/14.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vindelle_Sunveam","CreatedById":70755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T01:21:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recommend you to move this to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/20-The-Spacecraft-Exchange\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/20-The-Spacecraft-Exchange\u003C/a\u003E.
