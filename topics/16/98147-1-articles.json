You can see the eight arms of the craft in the picture below, side by side. They are intended to be undocked from one another and then attached radially to a large fuel tank, each arm using two docking ports. I\u0027m now wondering, since aligning one docking port is already pretty tricky, is this going to be near impossible?

The tricky bit, as has been mentioned, is to get them all to line up so that they all suck each other in at the same time and make a solid connect (otherwise you wind up with only one properly connected and then the thing is just as wobbly as it would\u0027ve been had you just used one port).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most common solution back in the day was to put the ports on both craft on a Tri-Coupler - the triangle shape was the easiest one with which to eyeball the alignment, and it made a pretty solid connection. Tri-Adapters would also work for the same purpose (but of course, they were released in 0.21 and by then Sr. Docking Ports were in use).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether you\u0027re adverse to mods or not, using the tri-coupler or tri-adapter is probably your best bet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T19:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryxal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kryxal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo long as you align one with zero rotation, you should be good ... after all, they\u0027re placed so you CAN attach both, so it should just happen with the right alignment.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep - that\u0027s why I suggested adding a reference mark component somewhere.
