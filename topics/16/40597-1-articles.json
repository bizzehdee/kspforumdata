The best solution is to just not use the long structural parts; instead, rely on empty fuselages and the like. Also, struts. Struts, struts, struts. If wobble then strut.

Gosh this community is helpful. I did use alot of struts although this pic does not show it. My part count is alil high, but that was just to make sure I could get it up there.
