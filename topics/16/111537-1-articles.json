After asking on here for some advice about good goals, most people said to go to the Mun/Minmus. I decided to do this, and I was going to do the in-game tutorial \u0027To the mun, part 1\u0027 I do the part where you plot your maneuver and do the burn, but this pretty much uses up all my fuel! I do not have enough to burn prograde near the Mun in order to get into Munar orbit. I tried it many times, and I barely have any more fuel. How can I save fuel and actually complete the tutorial? Thanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T21:11:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainApollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T20:32:51Z","Content":"I have just tried that tutorial again to see what they give you to do it with. The supplied ship has enough fuel on board to do the burn to get you to Mun, and also to burn retrograde when you get there to establish an orbit. Once in orbit, you should still have fuel left, though I found it wasn\u0027t quite enough to actually land on the surface, though with slightly better flying it might just be possible.\n\nHaving said all that, you say you are virtually running out of fuel after your first burn. I found that with a correctly positioned manoeuvre node, with the prograde handle pulled out far enough to get a good Mun intercept, the indicated burn was less than 800 m/s. If yours is showing a lot more than that, then you need to juggle the manoeuvre node to give you a more favourable burn. I can\u0027t imagine that there is anything you are doing during the burn itself that would waste fuel unnecessarily, so have a play with the node, and let us know how you get on."},{"CreatedByName":"mrklaw","CreatedById":143639,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T20:35:10Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t bothered with the tutorials - unless you get some reward from them, they seem poorly produced and don\u0027t explain things that well.

An ideal Hohmann type transfer is an wide ellipse whose apoapsis just barely touches the sphere of influence of the body right as it arrives in that same spot. This saves you fuel both accelerating as you leave and decelerating as you arrive.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E At the moment, my burn is 1886 m/s.

For the Mun you only need to wait in time to leave orbit at the right phase [angle](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/File:MunarTrajector.png). For other bodies, you will usually need to also wait for the right time window due to the relative inclination change. Another way to judge when to leave for the Mun, is that the right time is just after Mun rise over Kerbin when you are in LKO.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T20:54:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 08:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cybersol**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T20:51:58Z","Content":"Whoops, fail.

You are passing over, and then coming back to, the Mun\u0027s SoI. Ideally you want the Mun to capture you as you head out, not when you start to fall back. Lower your apoapsis (by pulling the retrograde handle) and move your node around until you get an encounter, if your Mun periapsis is too high you can burn radially just inside the SoI to fix it for only a few m/s of dV, which would still leave you plenty for the capture burn."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T21:05:24Z","Content":"Taki, I posted yet another image above, I think it\u0027s better now.
