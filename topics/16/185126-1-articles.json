help!\u00A0 In the interests of posterity, here are some of the important things I learned...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E1.\u00A0 Rotor Mast Tilt and Blade Pitch Angles\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the mast must be canted backwards slightly.\u00A0 I found an angle of 10^ worked best.\u00A0 But how to solve this causing the blades to spin backwards and creating negative lift?\u00A0 By counter-intuitively giving the blades a -5^ (nose-down) pitch.\u00A0 Then they move through the air forwards and create positive lift to fly with.\u00A0 This was the critical break-through to get things into the air and able, if controllable, to stay there.\u00A0 This is when I started killing test pilots, as now they could get high enough to crash badly :).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E2.\u00A0 Controls\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReal autogyros tilt the rotor disk for pitch and roll control so I tried that, using stacked hinges under the rotors and tied to the control axes.\u00A0 This MIGHT possibly work if you use a joystick but I use the keyboard and it didn\u0027t work at all.\u00A0 Part of the problem is that for some reason, the axis controls aren\u0027t self-centering with the robot parts like they are for control surfaces.\u00A0 Instead, they stay where you left them when you release the key.\u00A0 This made control response way too slow, and trying to remember how many taps I\u0027d used in each direction too complicated, for controllable flight with the keyboard.\u00A0 Also, the \u0022medium\u0022 in-line hinges (the biggest currently available) aren\u0027t strong enough for the aerodynamic forces, which bodes ill for trying this with a joystick.\u00A0 Thus, after many crashes, I gave up on this and equipped the autogyro with lots of reaction wheels and aerodynamic control surfaces.\u00A0 Ultralights don\u0027t need ailerons (torque alone suffices if you have 2 reaction wheels) but anything bigger needs ailerons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E3.\u00A0 Rotor Design\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReal autogyros have a single rotor with 2 blades, and these blades are on free-moving teeter hinges.\u00A0 The idea is, the advancing blade will tilt up on its hinge to balance its lift with the retreating blade.\u00A0 So I tried this but it doesn\u0027t work in KSP.\u00A0 Even with stupidly large amounts of hinge travel, the lift would never balance and the craft would leave the ground, immediately roll over, and crash.\u00A0 So, I went with the blades rigidly attached to the hub.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, having a single rotor left the fatal lift imbalance in place, so I countered this by having stacked, co-axial, counter-rotating rotors.\u00A0 As both are unpowered, the only difference is that the blades face in opposite directions.\u00A0 Then I experimented with the size and number of blades.\u00A0 Because there\u0027s nothing to force the blades to always spin at the same speed, the relative positions of the blades will vary during flight.\u00A0 The more blades you have, the more any such lift imbalance averages out.\u00A0 HOWEVER, more blades make more lift, which limits forward speed before you get an uncontrollable pitch-up.\u00A0 So in the end, I settled for 3 blades per rotor as the best compromise.\u00A0 YMMV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE:\u00A0 the rotor blades are made of control surfaces.\u00A0 Be sure to disable ALL their control axes.\u00A0 Bad things happen if you don\u0027t :).\u00A0 For larger autogyros, using wing parts for rotors might work, in which case you wouldn\u0027t have to worry about this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E4.\u00A0 Horizontal Stabilizier Downforce\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost real modern autogyros have a fixed horizontal stabilizer that creates downforce on the tail.\u00A0 This is believed to cure\u00A0 a fatal problem various tail-less designs had/have.\u00A0 I found this feature absolutely essential for maintaining basic stability.\u00A0 Autogyros in KSP have a strong tendency to pitch up uncontrollably even at moderate speeds without it.\u00A0 So, put a 5^ up angle (so it\u0027s like down elevator) on your horizontal tail surface, whether it\u0027s fixed or flying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E5.\u00A0 Separation of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAutogyros require the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E (rotor hub) to be noticeably farther behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E than conventional airplanes.\u00A0 This is also to keep the nose from pitching up at low and moderate speeds.\u00A0 Apparently the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E marker shown in the editor doesn\u0027t take rotor rotation into account.\u00A0 The actual \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E seems to be\u00A0ahead of the marker and gets farther ahead as forward speed (and thus, lift) increases, eventually getting in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 So you have to put the rotor back a ways from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E to give yourself a decent range of speed before uncontrollable pitch-up occurs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of this moving \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E, all autogyros with a fixed rotor disk angle have a maximum speed beyond which their controls can no longer keep the nose down.\u00A0 This means you don \u0027t need (or can\u0027t use) as much engine as you might want.\u00A0 It MIGHT be possible to put the rotor mast on a robotic part that would allow trimming it for higher speed by leaning it slightly\u00A0forward from its normal position of 10^ back.\u00A0 But as mentioned above, the inline hinges aren\u0027t up to the aerodynamic forces so I\u0027m not sure this would work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E6.\u00A0 Miscellaneous Stuff\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIn level-ish flight, you need to be gentle with the pitch inputs.\u00A0 Just like with real authogyros, rapid pitch changes does strange things to the rotor\u0027s speed and thus your lift.\u00A0 Making turns of up to about 45^ are best done with a gentle bank, lots of rudder, and elevator used to maintain nose attitude.\u00A0 However, you can turn very rapidly and tightly by banking 80-90^ and yanking the thing around with lots of elevator, using the rudder gently to maintain nose attitude.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSteep, power-off descents up to about 45^ dive angle work fine.\u00A0 It\u0027s almost like parachuting.\u00A0 You gain little if any speed, especially if you spiral down using the rudder to increase your side area to the wind for added drag.\u00A0 Just be careful not to get TOO slow doing this or you won\u0027t be able to pull out.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTurn off the rotor brakes.\u00A0 Applying the wheel brakes also brakes the rotors and their sudden stoppage imparts a lot of torque to the craft, which can roll it over.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E7.\u00A0 Some Results:\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the Autogyro Mk1 Mod 37, the initial test bed which learned all the bloody lessons above.\u00A0 It started out with a fixed rotor tilted forward and didn\u0027t fly much if at all.\u00A0 Then it got hinges on the mast and the blades, which were eliminated over time, and had numerous rotor and control surface configurations.\u00A0 In this form, it ultimately reached a point where it could be flown, although it was squirrelly and required constant hands-on flying to go approximately in the desired direction.\u00A0 Landing was only rarely successful--usually, 1 or more parts would hit the ground and break, and landing on the desired point was quite difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227MrRMQA.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

start, and also downsized a bit as I really wanted something smaller.\u00A0 That led to the Mk2, which flew beautifully from the start.\u00A0 But it had the smaller, spherical fuel tanks which provided insufficient range for a round trip to Airfield Island.\u00A0 Thus, the only change with the Mk2 Mod 1 was the larger fuel tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

slightly less well with 2 Kerbals compared to 1.\u00A0 Slower and not QUITE as laterally stable, which is strange given the drag is symmetrical with 2.\u00A0 But it\u0027s still good enough to

causes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThis always happens with a single rotor.\u00A0 So if you have only 1, add a 2nd that turns in the opposite direction.\u00A0 Be sure it\u0027s otherwise an exact copy of the 1st (same blades, same hub) as the different rotary parts seem to free-wheel at different speeds.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf this is happening with counter-rotating rotors,\u00A0 the problem is likely caused by the rotors going at different speeds due to changes in airflow from maneuvering.\u00A0 If the autogyro is constantly twitching around the roll axis in straight-ish flight at low-moderate speeds before flipping out, you probably need more rotor blades to balance out the lift more evenly.\u00A0 But adding blades increases lift, which will require adjusting the issues relating to pitch instability.\u00A0 If this happens in a turn, then probably either the rotor mast isn\u0027t angled back enough (this decreases the sensitivity to airflow changes) or you let the nose rise or fall too much too fast during the turn.\u00A0 Even with co-ax rotors, 1 will feel the effects more than the other because of their difference in height above the autogyro\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Anyway, 1 rotor will get enough slower than the other (or even stop or reverse direction instantly in

in airflow direction and doing bad things to your lift, which then often causes the roll issues noted above and you just tumble out of the sky.\u00A0 So, if this is happening well below 100m/s you probably need to increase the autogyro\u0027s speed limit.\u00A0 If this is happening above 100m/s (= 194 knots), then you have too much power because autogyros shouldn\u0027t be going that fast
