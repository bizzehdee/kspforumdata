I\u0027m trying to efficiently park a command module in orbit to some early-career science. I\u0027ve parked satelite contracts around the Mun, landed on the Mun (didn\u0027t have enough fuel to escape again, though. R.I.P. Jebediah Kerman), etc. I\u0027m guessing I usually make up for my craptastic launch piloting by my ability to put every maneuver node I fly to 0.0 m/sec without overshoot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the current vehicle consists of two vertically stacked SRBs (BACC initial stage, RT-10 2nd stage) and then 3.5tons of final stage including a -909, T200\u002BT100 fuel, science jr, quad landing pods, capsule, mk-16, one PV panel, and a 2HOT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKER says 4,878 dV. By my understanding of the dV map, this should give me 328 more dV than I need to attain a 75km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launch, @2km alt I tip about 2 degrees to start the gravity turn. The rocket does not keep tipping. @~10km I ditch the BACC and light the RT-10. Now I\u0027m tipping the rocket manually towards 45-deg as I accelerate. RT-10 quits @~25km and I light a full-throttle -909. At this point my Apoapsis is nearing 75km so it doesn\u0027t need to burn for long. I set a maneuver node for a prograde burn at the Apoapsis to circularize. Burn time comes up: 1m 52s. I have barely that much fuel full. As I climb to apo- my velocity is dropping into the 600m/sec range, and I end running out of fuel before I\u0027m anywhere /near/ circularized. 4,878 dV becomes a suborbital flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m flying the ascent wrong, but I can\u0027t find any guidance for getting to orbit efficiently - just people saying \u0027add moar boosters.\u0027 Is the dV map wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Great analysis has helped me adjust the thrust on the solid stages, and change how I\u0027m gravity turning.

That\u0027s about half the budget. The other half is consumed in order to offset four sources of losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Steering losses. Anytime your rocket is not pointing fully prograde, your ascent is inefficient because you have a radial or normal component in the thrust vector that isn\u0027t helping you accelerate. This includes gimbaling the rocket engines to keep yourself pointing prograde, because that causes them to point away from prograde. The closer to prograde you stay, and the less control input you need for it, the smaller your steering losses will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Gravity losses. Anytime your rocket is not burning flat towards the horizon, your ascent is inefficient because a part of the thrust is wasted simply on keeping you from losing height... \u0022maintaining the status quo\u0022, if you will. Only the remaining thrust will actually contribute to accelerate you. The closer you come to burning flat towards the horizon, the smaller your gravity losses will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Aerodynamic losses. Any objet moving through an atmosphere is slowed down by drag, which is a force that depends on the thickness of the atmosphere and increases with the square of your velocity. The slower you move through the atmosphere and the thinner the atmosphere is, the smaller your aerodynamic losses get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Oberth Effect, and the Rule of Constant Speed. The former says, simplified: the faster you go, the less effort you need to go even faster. The latter says: if you keep your speed constant, then for the same amount of effort you will fly farther and get there quicker if your speed is higher. Or, in other words: if at any point your engines are off and your speed is going down, you\u0027re doing it wrong, because when you re-light your engines, you will be much slower than you were when you turned off your engines, and thus you will get much less out of the effort you expend! Should have just kept your engines on!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you\u0027ll quickly notice that these points contradict each other. You gotta stay slow - but you need to reach orbital velocity! And the slower you are, the less you get out of your engines! And you also need to burn towards the horizon - but you\u0027ll fall back down to the ground if you do that. Unless you go really fast. But you gotta stay slow! Also, how are you supposed to fly without steering?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why the optimal way to orbit is a compromise between all four of these factors. It is called a \u0022gravity turn\u0022: you touch your controls exactly once for a split second shortly after launch, creating a tiny flick to the side, and then zoom hands-off all the way to orbit, with the rocket turning itself for you through gravity pulling the nose down at exactly the same rate the prograde marker drops towards the horizon, ensuring you stay fully prograde at all times. And of course, you never stop burning for a single second except for staging. By the time you turn your engines off, you are already circularized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is, of course, a fairly difficult feat to pull off without computerized aid - it\u0027s the crown jewel of rocket piloting. And also of rocket construction too, because not all vehicles even lend themselves to this profile. Many of the creations possible in KSP simply can\u0027t do it, because your engine TWR curve needs to be exactly right and your vehicle needs to be shaped in a certain way. As such, pretty much everyone \u0022fakes\u0022 the turn by steering manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 4500 dV figure quoted by dV maps is a figure that\u0027s valid for a pretty well-flown fake gravity turn into a fairly low orbit. If you need more to get there, then you need to look for where you have losses that exceed those expected from an optimal profile. Based on your description, I\u0027d say the following are your issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You go too fast too early, where the atmosphere is still thick and soupy (as orangexception already said)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your steering is not close enough to a smooth, gradual pitchover (but this is probably by far the smallest problem)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Because you burn too hard too early, and don\u0027t turn naturally, your apoapsis rises too quickly and you need to turn your engines off, causing you to be really slow upon reaching apoapsis and needing a huge amount of fuel to accelerate again\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Also, due to your coasting you\u0027re spending a longer time until completing orbit insertion, thus losing more speed to gravity than you would normally do\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-13T19:57:49Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2015 07:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T19:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny chance you can post your craft file, qoonpooka?

Geez, I haven\u0027t flown stock aero in ages, and it shows! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad the BACC set to 1.6 ignition TWR, the RT-10 to 1.3. This turned out to be very little, especially on the RT-10, and I had to do a super slow turn to avoid the prograde marker dropping like a rock. I was barely even at 45 degrees by the time the RT-10 burned out at ~26km or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA third try with the BACC at 1.64 (77.5%)and the RT-10 at 1.49 (42.5%) went much better, I was able to fly a flatter turn and got into orbit with 276 m/s left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad to hear you worked it out in the meantime, too! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qoonpooka","CreatedById":134904,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T22:03:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022UmbralRaptor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022UmbralRaptor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat said, what are your goals? Replacing the BACC with a pair of RT-10s that use explosive staging would likely reduce costs and enhance performance. If you\u0027re merely acquiring science from near/far kerbin space, I would lean towards an all-solid suborbital design. If you want a long term science return sat, I would skip on the materials bay and if crewed thermometer.
