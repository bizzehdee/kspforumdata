Ive recently taken interest in the NASA shuttles, especially the last one flown in 2011, the Endeavor. I have been trying to make my own style of it but I have been having troubles with the unpowered flight. I am in the testing phase at the moment so I am not attaching the LF tanks or SRF Boosters atm. I have tried two different designs, one with the wings seating under the carriage of the shuttle, as well as the attached on the sides but can\u0027t seem to get it quite right. I am looking for some tips to improve my design. I have not provided any pictures as I do not have a solid model to build off yet, but will as I go on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently using the following plugins to build my shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25241-0-22-B9-Aerospace-Pack-R4-0c-New-pods-IVAs-engines-fuselages-structures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EB9 Aerospace\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55985-0-22-01-Dec-Space-Shuttle-Engines-V0-8-Performance-and-smart-parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpace Shuttle Engines Pack\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EShould this be in the wrong forum section, I give full permission for this thread to be moved.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-12T15:49:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2014 03:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by bulletrhli\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bulletrhli","CreatedById":55960,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T15:30:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBumpity bump\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T15:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re going for realism, at the bottom near the undercarriage.

I did all the balancing in regards to the aerodynamics with the assumption that the fuel tanks were going to be empty on re-entry. This means that if you have left over fuel, you will have to burn it up somehow. This seems to have done the trick for me as far as the unpowered flight is concerned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow with the wing design, I did not do a realistic, classic shuttle design. I used more of a gull wing type configuration stuck straight on the side. It\u0027s not realistic, but in KSP it works wonders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick recommendation, grab the EVA parachutes mod: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25305-0-23-Vanguard-Technologies-EVA-parachutes-23!-Sry-4-not-fixing-earlier-%28Dec-30%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25305-0-23-Vanguard-Technologies-EVA-parachutes-23!-Sry-4-not-fixing-earlier-%28Dec-30%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way, if worse comes to worse, Jeb can say \u0022screw the landing\u0022 and simply bail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klingon Admiral","CreatedById":69090,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T16:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Raven.\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Raven.\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShuttles in KSP, even with the listed mods, are not easy by any stretch of the imagination.
