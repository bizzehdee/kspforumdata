It has a science lab for boosting transmit research. As it turns out that\u0027s useless as the total amount of science you can send is still way short of returning it via a pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I am wondering if it would be possible to bring a 4 command pod craft to my mun station in order to store four sets of surface samples for return all at once. Keep in mind the pods have to return in one piece and I have found multiple pods dropping at once causes pod deaths if your not controlling each one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would guess that that you could keep all four command pods docked in a line and give plenty of radial chutes to slow down the chain enough to survive impact in the ocean.
