I believe it is due to the lack of air at higher altitudes but because I only have the small intake and have reached my parts limit, I\u0027m not sure what to do to get around this. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.mediafire.com/file/xqz8ys033zctc7u/New_Design.craft/file\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0is the craft file to the aircraft.

The primary flaw is that it\u0027s arguably overweight/has so much fuel, so unless you want to go a very long ways in-atmo, you should drop a tank or two from the design. Other lightening can be done by draining the cockpit of monopropellant, though that doesn\u0027t matter much. I\u0027m also partial to disabling the reaction wheels by default to give a more aircraft-like feel (especially with your rather well-defined control surface choices)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that for completing high altitude contracts, a common trick is to bring some rocket engines along so an aircraft can (briefly) get much higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
