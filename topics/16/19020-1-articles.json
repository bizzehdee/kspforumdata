I think i need some good tips for landing on the exact spot i want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eduring this week i\u0027ve tried to land on specific spots, especially near other rockets i had already landed, to do so i usually landed in some random spots and then while taking off i started moving around to see which was the trajectory needed, it works pretty well but i always land to a distance of 2-10 km from the target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T03:28:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom a distance: On the map view, put your trajectory line directly over but a little beyond the target location. As you approach and brake, the curve will gradually fall onto the spot where you want to land. There\u0027s nothing magic or necessary about this; it\u0027s just that since you\u0027re braking anyway, your trajectory will tend to fall, and this helps prevent it from getting out of hand. When you get close, it\u0027s easier to brake harder and come down straighter than it is to find yourself coming in too low, which requires speeding upwards, wasting fuel, possibly over-correcting, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal approach: Set the camera looking past your ship at about a 45 degree angle to the target location. From that vantage, it\u0027s very easy to see if your ship is drifting to the sides or up/down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeither of this is the \u0022correct\u0022 technique, but just things that I have found helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hillstache","CreatedById":47444,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T12:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can concur that Vanamonde\u0027s methods are the ones I use as well. It\u0027s a bit of practice to know how far to have your initial decent past your target (especially if you\u0027re coming in on an atmosphered body) but failure and learning are half the fun of the game!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JackAz","CreatedById":46219,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T12:25:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, thanks alot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
