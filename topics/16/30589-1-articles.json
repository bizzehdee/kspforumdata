This requires a fair amount of extra fuel beyond what it takes to get into LKO. The easiest way to learn how to do a planetary transfer is to create a maneuver node and increase the prograde burn until it just crosses the Mun\u0027s orbit. Then you can move the node around until you find a spot that gives a good interception with the Mun. You\u0027ll know that you have this when it displays a periapsis for the Mun. If you just burn at the node accordingly you\u0027ll be well on your way to the Mun. Another node can be placed at the Mun\u0027s periapsis burning retrograde so that you get captured by the Mun instead of shooting by on an escape path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf any of this isn\u0027t clear I recommend reading (or rereading) the wiki article on the nodes: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Maneuver_node_explained\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Maneuver_node_explained\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T06:37:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can look at my moon mission tutorial and just skip the steps after achieving Munar orbit: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25029-A-moon-rocket-for-newbies\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25029-A-moon-rocket-for-newbies\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T09:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did a few screenshots of my last Mun mission, which shows the steps I took to achieve a Mun orbit.

Making an intercept is a lot easier if your orbit is on the same plane as Mun, and the inclination nodes will tell you how far off you are. Using the manoeuvre node to set up an intercept path will give you a blue target on your nav ball, and if you line up with this and do your burn an equal amount either side of the t=0 countdown, you should be on a flight path that will give you a Mun encounter. Once you get to the Mun encounter, burning retrograde (the yellow symbol with a cross through it) should be enough to put you in orbit around the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are struggling to understand the nav ball, I really do recommend that you look up some of the Youtube tutorials that are out there, as they are extremely helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T14:11:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easy, seat-of-the-pants way to do it is to park in a normal equatorial orbit, then wait until the Mun is visible on the horizon.
