It also needed to be fully assembled on launch. Halfway to Duna I discovered I did not have enough battery power to transmit 500 science points from the MPL. I reloaded a quicksave where the station was still in orbit around Kerbin and sent a probe with some extra batteries inside. My on board engineer did a quick EVA, added the batteries and I sent the probe off again. It wasn\u0027t until I circlerised at Duna that I noticed the first green tick was gone.
