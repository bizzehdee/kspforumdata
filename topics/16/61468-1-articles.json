I\u0027ve run into this before and I don\u0027t think any of my mods are causing the problem since it does the same thing in the base unmod version. I\u0027ve tried saving the storage container part as a subassembly but it doesn\u0027t help. I\u0027ve also tried this with other things such as tanks with the same result.
