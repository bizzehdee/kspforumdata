I launched, made my initial burn, and warped along the route until the Mun capture burn. Nothing at all amiss. \n\nThen I came out of timewarp, throttled up...and nothing happened. Ship also no longer responded to any w/a/s/d/q/e commands. Solar panels are deployed, batteries have plenty of juice, SAS is on, reaction wheels are online...nothing.\n\nI went back out to the tracking station and then back to the ship, and the engine works but I still have no SAS and only minimal attitude control (pitch and roll authority were ok, yaw was nonexistent). The autopilot stability control icons you usually see to the left of the navball simply aren\u0027t there.\n\nI get it in a lopsided orbit and quit to desktop, then re-load. Hop back into the ship and presto, everything\u0027s fine. All icons there, responding to commands, etc.\n\nHas anybody else experienced something like this? Is there some \u0027break everything\u0027 button I accidentally hit without realizing it?"}]}
