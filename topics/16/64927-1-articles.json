Regardless, none of the posts explained exactly how KSP uses these elements so I did some quick experiments to find out. Hopefully this\u0027ll come up for anyone else searching about these in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003Elct\u003C/span\u003E (LaunCh Time) - this is the number of seconds that have elapsed in the game up to the launch of the mission. In other words it is equal to the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003EUT\u003C/span\u003E parameter at the time of launch. So if you launch your mission on Day 2 at 12:30:06, the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003Elct\u003C/span\u003E for the mission will be 131406.xxxxxxxx (the x\u0027s being the floating point precision, which you can ignore and just change the integer portion). The game uses this value to calculate the MET you see displayed in the Tracking Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003Emet\u003C/span\u003E (Mission Elapsed Time) - this is the number of seconds the mission has been ongoing, and is only updated and used when you have actually loaded the craft in question. This is important to understand, as if you want to change the MET for your craft you should only edit the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003Elct\u003C/span\u003E value for the vessel as the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003Emet\u003C/span\u003E value will then be updated when you next load the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that changing the LaunCh Time will not affect the position of your craft\u0027s orbit, just your MET.
