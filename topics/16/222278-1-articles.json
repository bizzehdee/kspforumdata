The only real problem is that the lifting surfaces the aircraft needs will strongly draw the rocket \u0022upwards,\u0022 and you\u0027ll need to account for that. Give the ship lots of control authority and maybe rotate it so that this trend works in your favor and helps make the gravity turn. Or you can use the really messy fix\u00A0 of making the craft symmetrical by copying the plane part on each side. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruskiwaffle1991","CreatedById":226401,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-30T04:31:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, but like I\u0027m playing on career and I barely have any good control parts.
