In testing in orbit, once I EVA to the unmanned pod, all that is available is the RCS thrusters. I have Mechjeb installed on the debris. Do I have to mechjeb each individual component of the debris to take control of it? Right now it is connected to the top of the unmanned pod; should I attach it somewhere else? Will that make a difference?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hillstache","CreatedById":47444,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T17:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince no one seems to have an answer here, maybe you should ask in the post for that mod (if you haven\u0027t already)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T17:34:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t possible yet.
