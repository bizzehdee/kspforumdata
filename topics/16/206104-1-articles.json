I would like to upgrade to OSX Monterey (skipping Big Sur), but wanted to check and see if anyone is currently running KSP on Monterey before I do the upgrade. Probably OK, but it never hurts to check, and since downgrading the OS is extremely difficult I want to make sure that I can still run KSP before biting the bullet and upgrading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NevB","CreatedById":218988,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-30T02:30:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am having major problems on a MBP i7/16GB/macOS Monterey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game installs and loads ok, but it often freezes and causes the whole OS to reboot a few minutes in. \u00A0There are also other bugs noted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking for support but that\u0027s not proving to easy at the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone else having issues?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nN\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
