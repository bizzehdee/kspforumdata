The ship has 6 landers attached, with one kerbonaut in each, so I didn\u0027t have to waste fuel manouvering the mother ship more than I needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far so good...get to Duna high space orbit, with 6 contented kerbonauts. I undocked one of the landers, intending to drop it into a low space orbit, but here\u0027s the thing. The mothership shows me that I now have 5 kerbonauts on board...so one has left. That makes sense, because he should be on the lander. Except he isn\u0027t. When I switch to lander, there is no kerbonaut window in the bottom right of the screen, so I can\u0027t go EVA. Using the keyboard shortcut, C, I can go IVA and look around and see his feet and mitts...but I can\u0027t get him out of the lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have version 0.23 plus the right MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas where Bill might be hiding?

For instance, the Kerbal\u0027s picture won\u0027t show up and you\u0027ll see all engines from all parts of the docked ship in the staging list even though the undocked part you\u0027re controlling obviously doesn\u0027t have them all. Switching back and forth between the 2 ships usually clears these problems up, however.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Behemoose","CreatedById":87982,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T18:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if there was not a full crew in the lander, the game might have \u0027forgotten\u0027 that there were Kerbals in it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T20:57:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very rare bug that I have only seen once or twice.
