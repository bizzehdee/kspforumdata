I\u0027m using the modules from the nova punch addon. The one that has hatches at both ends and then two sets of 4 along the sides. I\u0027ve got two kerbals in it but it says the hatch is obstructed. There are 10 hatches! I carefully avoided anything in the way of each hatch. They have docks on them though is that the problem? It looks like they\u0027re able to open the hatches even with the docks in place and all of the docks are in \u0022hatch\u0022 mode. I then attached a science unit, airlock, and the observation window thing to it. Still they say hatch is obstructed. My poor kerbals, is there no hope of letting them stretch their legs on an Eva? I\u0027ve gone to each hatch as well and chosen \u0022control from here\u0022 still no luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T14:20:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPictures, Please...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clr4ils","CreatedById":102024,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T14:53:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is just the core beginning of it but hope it helps.

Just easier right now with my kids running around to use photobucket app. I just have this thing open all day and get to it when kids nap. So even with that open docking system where you can individually select the hatch door it still considers it an obstruction? So you think if I just have one open hatch it will let them out or does it have to be a certain hatch. When I select the internal view it looks like the kerbal is sitting right in the middle of the two modules.
