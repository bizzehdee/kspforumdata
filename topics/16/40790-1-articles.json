Obviously, the primal suspect is graphic card drivers (I have nVidia), but before I jump to conclusions, I\u0027d like to see some numbers in form of FPS to support this claim. It is easy to use applications like Fraps under Windows, but I haven\u0027t found any way to show FPS under Linux, should that be using debug menu (I\u0027m pretty sure that is not possible), using 3rd party tool or even making Unity to show FPS somehow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody know how to show FPS in Linux?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I have mentioned drivers.
