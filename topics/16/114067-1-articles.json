So either put them in a fairing or service bay then you wont have a problem; else use occlusion to keep them save (seems to work but less certain than the other two).\n\nAlso ensure drag isn\u0027t going to flip your craft - air brakes are excellent at keeping you pointed the right way and also for varying drag (and consequently your orbit). They can start to overheat at high speeds when fully deployed (in 1.0.2, no idea how they will manage now).\n\nAerobraking into eve orbit in 1.0.2 had to be done fairly high"},{"CreatedByName":"Signo","CreatedById":103766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T13:43:18Z","Content":"Engines (imo) are the best heatshield you could find around at the moment. About Eve, if you go to a lower altitude than 45000m at an airspeed of more than 2300 m/s your ship will explode, no matter the skin or core temperature of the parts. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

You should pretty much always aerobrake in the retrograde position, you\u0027re remaining fuel is at the back of the craft so it\u0027s likely the heavier end and you\u0027ll likely have shed any wings you had as they\u0027re normally on early stages meaning that the back of the craft is now the heavy end and the front is the draggy end meaning it\u0027s much more aerodynamically stable flying backwards.\n\nAlso engines have really high heat tolerances!"},{"CreatedByName":"1of6Billion","CreatedById":46191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T09:43:45Z","Content":"I am trying to aerobrake in Jool\u0027s atmo.

It\u0027s not just 3000 m/s like Kerbin or the inner planets. It\u0027s a whopping 8000\u002B in most cases. Now that\u0027s not just more than 2 times the heat, but it means about 8 to 10 times the heat because of the way heat is calculated.\n\nEven though you will hit only the very thin upper layers of the atmosphere, it\u0027s still incredibly fast, and since the speed of an air molecule is more important than it\u0027s mass, the aerobraking maneuver with such high speeds is very difficult.\n\nTo aerocapture at Jool, better try to approach the planet at the lowest possible speed. If you can\u0027t use the moons, try to reduce your orbital speed BEFORE you hit the atmosphere, not AFTER you hit it. Every m/s of velocity you can reduce before the aerocapture will greatly improve your survivability.\n\nIt\u0027s generally much better to use high drag parts and only gently touch the outer atmosphere layer than to enter deeper with a streamlined ship. The drag is not the factor that will rip your ship apart. It\u0027s the heat."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T13:23:39Z","Content":"seems like a laythe aerobrake maneuver is a much better idea.... you don\u0027t have to go so far down the gravity well and reach such high velocities.\n\nI \\*expect\\* Eve to be rather difficult to deal with... but I hope Duna is still relatively benign... if for nothing other than the low transfer dV and the low orbital dV.\n\nI\u0027m told drag decreased.... thats going to make it harder to capture though"}]}
