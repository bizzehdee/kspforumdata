And am looking to set up a \u0022gas station\u0022 of sorts in low to mid kerbin orbit where most of my craft\u00A0 tend to be parked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis poses a question. How would I go about making a tanker capable of taking large amounts of fuel from minmus, to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E? Recovery and funds are not an issue as this is a sandbox run. Thus far my best idea is to just haul a bunch of empty tanks into space, with seperate stages/sections with full tanks for actually moving the vessel. But at what point does the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E just become unacceptable for something like this?
