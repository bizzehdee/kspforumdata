The best bet I can see for getting a \u0022time to node\u0022 value is to place a ship in equatorial geostationary orbit at the longitude of your launchpad, and set a maneuver node on that orbit to get an approximate time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-27T18:22:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuess the tundra orbit is inclined 110\u00B0 to the equator (KSP doesn\u0027t really handle axial tilt of bodies, in reality Earth has 23.4\u00B0 tilt and orbits could be defined in relation to the ecliptic instead of the equator as a reference plane; if this was in relation to the ecliptic the solution would require a different approach tied to spherical geometry).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is required is to launch, at the correct azimuth (which is already known, e.g. using \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.orbiterwiki.org/wiki/Launch_Azimuth\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eequation here\u003C/a\u003E) when the launch location lies on that orbital plane (or rather, just a bit before, to allow for the amount of time while ascent brings to match inclination with the orbit from the initial inclination = 0\u00B0; generally by the time a vessel gets suborbital inclination is matched, the burn to bring to orbital speed shouldn\u0027t change inclination).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnowing where an orbital plane crosses the equatorial plane is easy: the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E nodes of the orbit give that.
