It carries pretty much all the science stuff available in the game that you could want on a rover. It uses the old Clever Bobcat Cart as a base. The mod itself is way outdated now, but I still love how the cart looks, so I still use it occasionally. The Clever Bobcat base allows for cruise control, so you don\u0027t have to keep an eye on your rover all the time. It\u0027s also a fairly stable base assuming you put some stuff underneath. That specific configuration of equipment and such on Embarker I actually worked pretty well, but at speed it LOVED to tumble all over the place.

These rovers were later given a much wider wheelbase, and two of the eight wheels were removed. They are able to carry a single Kerbal a short distance, but are designed to be used as unmanned rovers to construct a base on a planetary surface before the Kerbals inhabit it. After construction, they roll themselves exactly 3 Kilometers away from the base site, so that their RTGs will not irradiate the Kerbals over an extended period (and the rovers won\u0027t add to the lag caused by the base hue hue hue). The project never ended up going through, and is being redesigned currently from the ground up. They are good only in lifting/pulling capacity and extended operating life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PNPso3E.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PNPso3E.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is Arcturus-I. Arcturus-I was the first successful Duna mission performed by M5000. Arcturus-I has its panels in a horrible configuration and is generally a horribly designed rover. It was designed for the sole purpose of being a rover on Duna. The mission was later abandoned after Arcturus-I parked itself in a crater several kilometers away from the landing site. Do not build a rover that looks anything like Arcturus-I, you will be sorely disappointed in anything the rover can do. It has horrible battery life, can\u0027t even power its own wheels without draining the battery during high noon, and is incredibly topheavy.

While it looks like a phallus from the top, the massive battery banks allow for full operation during night hours, without resorting to RTG power that will irradiate crew over long periods. It can store 9 Kerbals comfortably, with a maximum capacity of 11, and can even operate completely unmanned. The project to send a manned long-term rover mission to one of the planets was abandoned after experiencing seemingly random explosions on Kerbin tests. The lifter was also scrapped and a new system is being slowly developed. The original mission planned to aim for Duna, Eve, Vall, Pol, or Eeloo. If a lifter would have been properly designed for the MEG-HAB, it surely would have proven mission goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JcVBAUz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JcVBAUz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis little number is the pride and joy of Nexus\u0027 rover development operations. It is a Planet Crawler III rover, with this specific rover being the Tortuga-II/R. The Planet Crawler III is designed to operate on any world it is thrown at, assuming the delivery vehicle is appropriate. The rover itself is entirely stock and can easily power itself for long periods, and almost throughout the nights. It contains a single headlamp and a full science package, with an appropriately sized battery underneath the computer systems. It can climb almost any grade thrown at it. The Tortuga-II/R was the first iteration sent to another world and was sent to the absolute harshest world possible, Eve. It survived the pressures encountered and could make it up most grades, though it struggled on steeper grades and had to turn slightly to zig-zag its way up, instead of straight up. The Planet Crawler III is a good basic rover design for those looking to build a small, unmanned rover that can handle any planet, and carries a full science package.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aeshi","CreatedById":33076,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T12:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried using the structural panels as a body? using those you can basically make your rover as big or as small as you want by adding extra panels attached to the first one. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://img203.imageshack.us/img203/3153/minir1.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s one such\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/6961/minir2.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERover I\u0027ve made\u003C/a\u003E.

This particular model shown here doesn\u0027t have the RCS in the front, but it can easily lift off the ground on the Mun, Minmus, and the like. It can safely cruise at around 20/30 meters per seconds, depending on the environment, and easily reach 60ish if going down a slope (really risky!)
