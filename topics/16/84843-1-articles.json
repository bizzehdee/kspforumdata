You want to fly till your intake air is low but not gone, level out to gain speed (don\u0027t be afraid to go back down to get more air), and depending on the engines your using, pitch up just before your speed is too fast for the engine (TurboJets apparently die around 1800m/s, Rapiers 1700m/s) If you start seeing reentry heat, try to climb a little higher, unless that takes you out of the air in which case your done with the air breathers, pitch up and go till the die (or for dual engines, shut them off just before they die). Just be careful not to pitch too hard at those speeds, however in that high an atmosphere you shouldn\u0027t have too big a problem. I can get my apoapsis to around 40k before switching, with NEAR installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you switch, your basically doing the same as a rocket, no punching out, that\u0027s not good.

(Fifth Image) When your apoapsis hits 70-75km, your periapsis should also be positive, in fact your periapsis might just exceed the apoapsis and they will flip, if that occurs you won\u0027t be able to maintain 1 min to apoapsis anymore, it will jump way up, but that\u0027s a good thing.
