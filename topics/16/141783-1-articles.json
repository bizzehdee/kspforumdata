Any kind of aerobraking I\u0027ve used (periapsis as low as 23k) will not slow any spacecraft I have built. Even those built before this started happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeat shields do not ablate, surface speeds continue to increase until I pass my periapsis, g-forces on Kerbals do not increase as we enter the atmosphere, changing craft orientation does not help and will continue to rotate as if in zero atmosphere even traveling at over 3000 m/s, but heating still works and certain parts (antennas, decouplers, and extended solar panels) will explode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have several mods installed. X Science!, Active Texture Management, Aviation Lights, EVE, Chatterer, Community Resource Pack, Crowd Sourced Science, Distant Object Enhancement, DMagic Orbital Science, Firestarter, K2 Command Pod, Raster Prop Monitor, KAS, KIS, Kerbals Aircraft Extension, Kerbal Engineer, Kerbal Mechanics, Kopernicus, AVC, KW Rocketry, Docking Port Alignment Tool, Final Frontier, Outer Planets Mod, Planetary Base Inc, Precise Maneuver, RCS Sounds, AMP Year, ScanSat, Scatterer, strobe-o-matic, station science, texture replacer, TAC Life Support, Wheel Sounds, Kerbal Alarm Clock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo I need to uninstall and then re-install the whole game and start over? I really don\u0027t want to due to how far I have finally gotten in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speadge","CreatedById":145302,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T13:11:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif on steam - try \u0022verify game files\u0022-Option.. might just be the physics config file\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T17:49:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can copy just a single savegame from your current game into a brand new fresh install, and you won\u0027t lose any of your current progress.
