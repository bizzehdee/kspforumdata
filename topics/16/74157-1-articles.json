Probably the most appropriate examples are nuclear submarines which may stay submerged (~in space?) for many months. They are, as most people are aware, notoriously cramped and submariners are definitely a special breed because of it but they do demonstrate that a great amount of space is not required. Obviously each person needs a \u0027duty station\u0027, which in KSP would be the seat they\u0027re assigned to in a command pod/lander can. A similar amount of space would be required for sleeping, but you can use \u0027hot bunking\u0027, assuming the crews are standing multiple watches. Finally, there have to be circulation and relaxation spaces connected those (ie; corridors, messes, kitchen, hygiene).
