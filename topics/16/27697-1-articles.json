It had a few sensors on it for fun, an antenna and a few solar panels. I decoupled the final fuel tank and I was done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when I tried to return to the space station (through the menu) the button was disabled. I had to \u0022End Flight\u0022 instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy? My satellite was now marked as debris and I couldn\u0027t go to it to see the readings/check out the kerbin view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing something? I\u0027d like to fix this before I move on to bigger challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for your time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xiphos","CreatedById":60680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T16:23:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi and welcome! A ship will become debris when it is not connected to a command pod. Etiher manned or unmanned. If manned, put a kerbal inside(ie: hitchhicker storage) and the part will remain active. So just make sure your satellite has power and has an unmanned pod built in. Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
