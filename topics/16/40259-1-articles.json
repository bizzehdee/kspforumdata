Unlike cars, airplanes, etc, a spacecraft has \u0027unlimited\u0027 range but changing vector velocity either in speed or direction requires fuel OR an outside force (gravity \u0026amp; drag being the two most common). Delta-V is the measurement of how much change in vector velocity is available.

The equation also accounts for the engine efficiency, or ISP (Ve / g) and provides a measurement that can be treated as linear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat Delta-V allows you to do is compare rockets and probes in a normalized manner. As an example, after some practice (or mechjeb) you can find out how much Delta-V is needed to reach a specific orbit. As an example, lets say you place your orbit at an altitude that requires 3000m/s (if I remember that\u0027s between 80km and 120km but its been a while since I flew stock, I\u0027ve got FAR installed). Your other rockets intended to reach that orbit should have that much delta-V (not counting propellant for use on orbit). There will be some variability for drag and gravity losses, but this gives you a baseline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the amount of delta-v needed to change orbits will (with few exceptions) be the same regardless of spacecraft. As a simple example, it will take the same amount of Delta-V to go from 80km circular to 100km circular. Larger rockets will require more fuel by mass (assuming same engines), a craft with more efficient (higher ISP) engines will require less fuel, and one with a higher thrust-to-weight ratio will take less time for each burn, but the delta-V should be the same or very close.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T23:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Specialist290\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Specialist290\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo put it yet another way: Imagine you have a rocket standing still in a perfect vacuum, with no other forces acting on it.
