So, im trying to get enough fuel together for a trip to Moho and after watching a video about cluster engines it appeared that this was the way to go. In a test that was conducted 1 engine (I forget the name but its stock and has 1500 thrust) was strapped to a single orange tank and launched straight up and the apoapsis height was recorded, lets say 2 million meters as an example.\n\nThe same test was done but this time with 3 LV engines in a cluster formation and the apoapsis was way over 4 million meters. Great I thought, but when I replicated the test .I found the single engine reached a far higher apoapsis than the cluster by over 2 million meters? Why is this? Is it because the test in the video was on an older version of KSP and not 1.0.4?\n\nAlso, should I just use cluster engines in space as apposed to using them on launch?\n\nIm just having a hard time getting the required dv to Moho so trying different things.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T19:03:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 07:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maceemiller**"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T17:10:39Z","Content":"Well, each additional engine adds a lot of extra weight, effectively lowering the dv. You really only need to cluster them when you don\u0027t have enough TWR at that particular stage. If the TWR is already 1.0\u002B, then you shouldn\u0027t need any additional engines, as they will end up (basically) as dead weight. Let\u0027s say an engine weighs 4 tons. if it\u0027s able to lift the payload by itself, then it\u0027s fine. If you now add two extra engines, that\u0027s basically 8 extra tons that aren\u0027t helping it do anything it couldn\u0027t before.\n\nI recommend installing a mod like Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb that will give you a dv/TWR readout.

Design it to go to Moho, through space.\n\nYou *then* want a launch vehicle that will deliver it to orbit in the first place. Design it to go to orbit, through atmosphere.\n\nThose things are very different and require different engines. Some are great for working in a vacuum but they usually lack thrust (LV-N or Ion) so are useless for lifting all the mass of a large vehicle into orbit. The KR-2L has both vacuum efficiency and thrust, but uses *huge* amounts of fuel at sea level. Other engines, however, are very good at launching things but not efficient in space.\n\nSeparate stages. Separate vehicles. Separate engines. Once you\u0027ve chosen your engine you might find you need more thrust than one can provide so, then, it *might* be worth clustering them.\n\nDo yourself a favour too - install the KER or MJ mods so you can see deltaV and TWR stats for your vehicles. Squad won\u0027t give them to us in stock because \u0027some beginners might be overwhelmed by the numbers\u0027 but as soon as you start *designing* vehicles, instead of just throwing stuff at the sky to see what stays up, you need the figures. KER is probably the most popular but MJ can also double as an autopilot for various functions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T23:53:27Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan**"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T00:04:18Z","Content":"^ The Pecan is good, the Pecan is wise. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n While I\u0027m personally an advocate of learning the math and applying it instead of using KER or MJ, I also know that not everyone can realistically just jump in and do that.

More thrust allows you to more effectively use delta V to attain orbit, but every engine you add reduces delta v. A single reliant engine powering a 400t ship will produce a lot of delta v (if your in space), but it certainly wont lift that spacecraft off the ground. The only reason to cluster engines is that you haven\u0027t unlocked the bigger engine yet, or your using a LF- only spaceship powered by LV-N\u0027s that require more thrust then the 60 units of thrust that it provides (such as for landing or escaping sub-orbital trajectory). \\*fingers crossed that squad makes a jumbo LV-N\\*."},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T02:54:53Z","Content":"Well thankyou all for your replies.
