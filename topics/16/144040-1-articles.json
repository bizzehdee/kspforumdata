So while you will be able to see the animation, you will not be able to test the jetpack much there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise: the jetpack is an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-based system. So you click the \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 button on your navball to activate it. The Kerbonaut will reach down and rotate the jetpack controls into position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn space, unless you do some very special things, the Kerbonaut\u0027s helmet is always forced to point North. You have control of all the other axes. On a PC, you use the mouse to rotate the Kerbonaut\u0027s point of view. This may also rotate the Kerbonaut, depending on your settings. I suppose it might be the \u0022cursor\u0022 that does the same thing on a console, maybe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, one of your joysticks should allow you to thrust forward, backward, left, and right. There should also be two more buttons somewhere that allow you to thrust up and down -- but I have no idea which ones those might be. It\u0027s very important to find them! And please tell us all which ones they are when you find them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have 5 units of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel, which is enough to change your speed by 600 m/s in level flight. Boarding any craft will refill your jetpack\u0027s tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelpful hint: if you slam\u00A0into something\u00A0and start to tumble out of control -- activate the timewarp for an instant, and then cancel it. This will stop the tumbling and return control to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-18T04:30:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2016 04:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-18T13:57:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hardest thing about learning to EVA is the rotation controls. There\u0027s some kind of weird click\u002Bdrag scheme that\u0027s the default on PC, but it\u0027s always baffled me. You may not have a similar option on console, unless it\u0027s a hold-button-plus-stick kind of thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E found to work, though, is if I re-orient the camera pointing the way I want the Kerbal to face, pressing the \u0022jump\u0022 key (space on PC) prompts him/her to rotate to that orientation.
