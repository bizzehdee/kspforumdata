I downloaded Protractor and Mechjeb. I built a craft capable of getting to Duna. I also put a craft (rover) on the surface of Kerbal so I can time warp. Using this site \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E it tells me that the angle is 44.36\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. So I time warp until Protractor says Duna is 44.36\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. But it doesn\u0027t look like 44.36\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, it looks closer to 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. I launch anyways and get into orbit, but I couldn\u0027t get a good encounter. So I start over and this time i use Mechjeb Manuver Planner and it wants to wait till 54 days to launch. I time warp 51 days (to give myself so time). and take a look at Protractor and it says that Duna is 3.20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. I find a Windows Onscreen Protractor and sure enough it says Duna is 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ish.(on screen protractor isn\u0027t perfectly aligned) I do get some decent encounters with Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a picture \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LP2MXUv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LP2MXUv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why does Protractor tell me 3.20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen videos that show Mechjeb with Protactor like screen but I cant seem to find it, does it still have it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have updated Kebal to .22 and both protractor and mechjeb are the newest versons ( i think, there so much on spaceport ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lheim","CreatedById":62665,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T17:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI could be wrong; I haven\u0027t used protractor in a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I believe it uses a kind of \u0027count down\u0027 approach to angles.

If you stay too low you can\u0027t time warp high enough, if you go too high you\u0027ll lack the benefits of the Oberth effect. In this case I would go to roughly 500*500km equatorial.
