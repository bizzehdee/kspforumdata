I just updated to 1.1.3 (from 1.0.2)\u00A0and now I seem to be unable to control rescued Kerbals on EVA from their original ship onto the rescue ship waiting nearby. I can move them up and down the (short) ladder on the original capsule just fine, but they don\u0027t seem to have a jetpack that I can control, despite having 5.00 Eva Propellant listed on the fuel display. Their light toggles just fine, also.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is, as they say, problematic, especially since due to fuel constraints I can\u0027t get much closer than ~200m with my rescue ship. Definitely not\u00A0enough to position my ship directly beneath the EVA so I can just walk off the ladder... I\u0027ve been looking around and can\u0027t find anything about this on the wiki or on the forums.
