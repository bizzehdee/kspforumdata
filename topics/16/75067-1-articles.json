The antennas don\u0027t effect how much science can be transmitted, only how fast (I think) and how much power they consume during transmission. The resulting science points gained are a percentage cap based on which experiment is being transmitted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T00:40:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the stock game it makes no difference. The lower-gain antennae transmit more slowly, but you can run a small experiment, click transmit, and immediately rerun it, there\u0027s no need to wait until the transmission finishes. So even in a busy time, such as a Munar flyby, slow transmission needn\u0027t be a problem. The only case it would be is if your craft is an impactor and you need to send off the science before it\u0027s destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs regards other considerations, the higher gain antennae use more power. Do try and make sure your battery doesn\u0027t run dry when transmitting or the interruption can cost you a little science. Currently the low gain antenna (the red-and-white straight one) and the high-gain antenna (the orange dish) are both physicsless, meaning their mass and drag is disregarded in flight, while the medium-gain antenna (grey curved one) is not. Besides those factors, antenna choice is down to aesthetics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to boost science transmission, your only option is to use the Mobile Lab. But that\u0027s quite big and heavy, and needs a crew, so it\u0027s not always useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtremespino","CreatedById":63473,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T09:43:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETheres no difference currently, but the speed is different and power consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asb3pe","CreatedById":112330,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T13:02:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood question, I had the same one looking at the new antenna I just unlocked in Career mode.

I still don\u0027t have a good grasp on science yet, so it isn\u0027t really any surprise to me when things don\u0027t make sense.
