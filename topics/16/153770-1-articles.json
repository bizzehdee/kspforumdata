However, there have been many many threads on these forums giving generic about getting spaceplanes to reenter successfully.

Which flight profile is the correct one\u00A0depends tremendously on what parts your spaceplane is built from, especially their heat resistance, aerodynamic lift,\u00A0and drag properties. The flight profile includes: what do you set the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to before reentry, and what \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E do you maintain through the extreme upper atmosphere, the middle atmosphere, and the point of greatest heating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, your original post gives the impression that\u00A0you\u0027ve tried every possible combination.
