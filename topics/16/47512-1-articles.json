If an aircraft has insufficient lift, you will not be able to get it off the runway. However, that is not the problem. The issue is the pivot point of the craft. When taking off, your plane is essentially a lever that pivots on the rearmost wheels. Your lifting surfaces must move the lifting force sufficiently forward, relative to the pivot, to make the nose rise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two ways to do this. You could add more pitch-control (force) or move the pivot further forward. I\u0027d recommend trying the second.

The closer your rear wheels to the CoM, the easier it will be to rotate and lift off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T14:35:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAttach a series of downwards-facing separatrons to your command module. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027ll still be SSTO as they don\u0027t detach. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T14:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JiWint\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JiWint\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHah,that\u0027s what happens when a newbie uses MODS.
