Then, at 10km, turn to 45 degrees. At 20km, get to 60 degrees. At 40, go to 70 degrees. At 60km, turn to 90. By then your Apoapsis should be somewhere in the 100km range. At the apoapsis, create a maneuver node so that the Pe and Ap are clsoe to the same altitude. Burn at a bet less than half of the actual burn time. So, for a 60 sec burn time, burn at 23-27.

The camera shouldn\u0027t affect how you get a circular orbit at all -- all it matters is that your predicted AP / PE is close to each other (and to get it most efficiently, you usually place the maneuver node right at the AP and burn prograde until the PE matches the AP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn time is estimated by the game by dividing the delta-V of your maneuver by the maximum acceleration your engines provide the last time you fired them. It messes up when you stage or switch to / from the craft, however. You minimize the burn time by having a high TWR, though I think there was analysis done that showed burns up to 6-8 minutes would be considered reasonably efficient. If you need more, you can burn over multiple passes at PE, though it really complicates how you make the maneuver nodes. Making sure you have short burns will usually cost you (in everything except time), because you need to carry more engine, which lowers your available delta-V and raises your rocket\u0027s cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-22T22:17:59Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2015 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Empiro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"obi_juan","CreatedById":89945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T22:17:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA circular orbit have the minimum of energy to reach that altitude...

Here\u0027s how to get to an almost-perfectly-circular orbit after launch:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Do your launch, gravity turn, etc. so that you\u0027re coasting on an upward trajectory with your Ap at the altitude that you want your circular orbit to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. While you\u0027re coasting upwards towards apoapsis, set a maneuver node marker right at apoapsis. Make it as close to exactly there as possible. (It\u0027s best if you can wait until you\u0027re out of the atmosphere, or at least over 45km, to do so, because if you set the node while you\u0027re still deep in atmosphere then velocity loss due to drag will mess things up.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Drag the maneuver node\u0027s \u0022prograde\u0022 marker until you get orbit.

When you get close to a circular orbit, your Ap and Pe markers will start to slide around the orbit. Slowly drag until the Ap and Pe markers are 90 degrees in front and behind you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You should now be pretty close to circular, and may be able to stop there. Mouse over the Ap and Pe markers to see if they\u0027re close to equal altitude. If they\u0027re off by more than 1 km, you can fine-tune it: Is Ap ahead of you, or behind you? If Ap is ahead of you, drag radial-inward; if it\u0027s behind, drag radial-outward. Do so very slowly and carefully. This will rotate the Pe marker closer to you. Stop when it gets to where you are. You\u0027re now about as perfectly circular as it\u0027s practical to get without excessive fiddling-- the difference between Pe and Ap should be a few hundred meters at most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practice, you don\u0027t have to be \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E perfectly circular.
