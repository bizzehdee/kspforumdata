It happens about 1 out of every 3 landings. The F3 log is useless as it doesn\u0027t tell me which one (or ones) are failing so I don\u0027t know where to strengthen the weak joints with struts. I dont want to put them on willy-nilly, because the lag is already pretty bad \u0026 too many more struts will make the game unplayable. (anyone else notice the joints on the Mk3 cabins appear quite weak - especially when attached to fuel-tanks).\n\nSo, my question is, are there any mods, CFG/logfile hacks or other tricks that can help?\n\nCheers!

What hit what? And most crucialy, was there a part between them? If so thats the break.\n\nYou also mentioned this happens on landing, without seeing the rocket its hard to diagnose, but if your legs are mounted to radial tanks rather than a core tank then its likely the radial attachment flexing and possibly knocking two cans together. I like to use girders to space things when this is happening, it also gives more parts for f3 to squawk about. Parts that are clipping into each other can also react with violent disapproval when they are loaded like this, just because they dont mind being merged in flight, doesnt mean they wont blow if 1 shifts and the other doesnt."},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T12:52:56Z","Content":"Take a look at this.

Moreover, at 850 parts lag is becoming a real issue (struts are one of the biggest culprits here), so i\u0027m loathed to put to any more on. Feel a bit of a failureusing mods though (I only use Mechjeb).\n\nI did an earlier 180 seater BTW using 11 Mk3 parts (even docked it), which worked fine after lots of strutting. It maxed out at 756 parts, but the extra couple of Mk3-ers are causing a lot of trouble.\n\nBelow are some picks of the beast - that last few being the successful 180 seater\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/Zp6Qq#0](http://imgur.com/a/Zp6Qq#0)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nNote to tg626, just read you message - deffo give that a go many thx!"}]}
