Method 2 suffers from burning at high altitude, while method 1 suffers from the extra cost of circularizing (but gains boost from lower altitude final burn). Low thrust vehicles should stick to method 1 so they can benefit from oberth effect.

During this time, you do most of the accelerating you\u0027ll need. Remember gravity is pulling you in the direction of Kerbin\u0027s centre, but relative to your rocket this is now much nearer \u0027sideways\u0027 than \u0027backwards\u0027, so it isn\u0027t really reducing your forward acceleration anymore, but it IS increasing your sideways acceleration. In other words, your total acceleration is now a synergy, rather than a subtraction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase three: acceleration at thrust - gravity again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy now, you\u0027re going so fast that you probably don\u0027t have that much accelerating left to do.
