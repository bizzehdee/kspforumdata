The yellow MET means that that there is not enough CPU power to complete the physics calculations on time, slowing down the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe A4-3300M is designed to compete with Intel\u0027s Atom line (which are now rebranded as Pentiums) and as such is very far back in terms of CPU performance despite being a new processor. It\u0027s designed for low cost and low power usage, with a decent integrated GPU to help with things like 1080p video playback. For reference on CPU performance, the dual core A4-3300M is roughly the same as my old AMD Athlon 64 Dual Core 4200\u002B which I bought in 2006 and replaced 2 years ago after the power supply blew up. Of course there is a big price difference (the 4200\u002B was top of the line for AMD when it was new) and the A4 uses just a third of the wattage to deliver the same performance plus a GPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA super budget laptop just isn\u0027t going to play KSP as well as even a mid range system. You can do a few things to improve performance. Turning off the anti-virus can help if it is something like Norton or McAfee, though others like Microsoft Security Essentials are normally only using CPU when it is actually needed. Turning off the internet is probably not going to help unless there is some other piece of software we don\u0027t know about. In the Kerbal settings you can adjust the maximum physics frame delta to 0.1 to improve performance. This will make the physics a little less stable if you are creating massive 400-500 part launchers, but with your CPU you can\u0027t really do those well anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T16:57:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to make note of is that KSP\u0027s bottleneck is always the CPU.

However, there will be situations where your craft appears to be either floating above or below the water\u0027s visible surface.

That will not help with a CPU bottleneck at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso regarding replacing your CPU: There is a damn good reason low power CPUs have different sockets than their high-wattage desktop brethren, and it\u0027s to prevent just that. Even if you could shove a higher wattage CPU into your laptop, you\u0027d do irreparable damage. For one, the motherboard wasn\u0027t designed to deliver the power required, so it might not even start. If it did start, it would damage itself within seconds and you\u0027d have a ruined CPU because of heat dissipation problems. I\u0027m not kidding when I say that an improperly cooled CPU can kill itself in seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReplacing your CPU isn\u0027t an option. Unfortunately in this case if you want to see any really big gains at this time in performance with KSP, you\u0027ll need to get (or build) a desktop. It sucks but thems the breaks. Settings tweaking will only get you so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough on the plus side, you can build a respectable mini-ITX gaming PC for about $1,000. Less even, depending on parts. (But NEVER EVER EVER skimp on the PSU. EVER.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of this is still a moot point though until Unity 5 is released and KSP is updated to it, and physics multithreading is a thing. Until then, the best way to eke out more performance for KSP on any system is to build a custom liquid cooling loop and overclocking the CPU as much as possible. Hell, I\u0027m running on an i7 (okay, it\u0027s from 2011 but that doesn\u0027t matter much in this particular case), and it\u0027s no slouch, but the fact that Unity 4 can only use a single core for physics in KSP makes it behave like a piece of crap. Given that you only have a two-core processor, I wouldn\u0027t expect any significant gains if/when KSP gets updated, unfortunately. Some, but not much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Comrade, your problem is completely different.
