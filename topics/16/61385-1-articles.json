You want to be pointing at \u003Cem\u003E45\u003C/em\u003E degrees. Generally, during my ascents, I begin to slowly tip toward the horizon, and depending on my rocket design, end up fully horizontal at 35-50km, depending on the design of my rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe prograde marker just points to where it would be most efficient to enlarge your orbit by increasing the periapsis.

This signifies 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 mark on navball, which points to east (to steal some delta-v from planet rotation). Do not turn your ship horizontal, turn it about 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 from vertical \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 in direction of 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 mark.

Best would be to accelerate straight up, to get off atmospehere as fast as possible, but youd end with very little time to actually attaing orbital speed before falling back to well. Other best would be to just start horizontaly and only work on orbital speed, but air friction will rob you. (This is first phase of most SSTOs actually.) So, you do both \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 start straight up to get out of thickest air, then pitch a bit to get some orbital speed while still speeding up. You don\u0027t get much of a real orbital speed this way, but you get on flat balistic trajectory that should give you enough time outside atmosphere to do some real speeding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, in reality this is not so pronounced, all phases blend into each other in a complicated curve.
