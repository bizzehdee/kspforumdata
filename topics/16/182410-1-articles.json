Once I get gravity sensors and dedicated relay antennae (RA-50 is usually first oddly enough) I build a One-Size-Fits-All lander thing with immense relay ability and turn the mun into my personal ball of commsats like Dannny\u0027s 1.2 preview video. From there I can go to any planet I need to usually and have already done something on Minmus (probably a manned lander there if not a small hopper), etc etc. I think one time I even did the whole \u0022chain of relays\u0022 on Eve\u0027s surface before I built my massive commsat package for Eve and Gilly (Single launch left something stupid like 8 commsats in that system and farmed every possible science point I could transmit from gravity scans). By that point I had been to Jool, put an accidental\u00A0Cassini style orbiter there, and had 2 rovers on Duna (fun fact, the Jool Orbiter was supposed to be a Duna Orbiter that turned into an Eeloo flyby after I had to go afk while the ion engine burned).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-24T01:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-24T03:12:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI generally go for #3.
