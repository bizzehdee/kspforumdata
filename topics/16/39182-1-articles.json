The efficency means that I have a ton of flexibility in my missions. That is... once I can get the nuclear-powered transit stage into orbit at all. And that\u0027s often the problem...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPre-0.21, I would use the tri-splitter, attached to that flat adapter piece, then sorta fudge decouplers onto the bottom of all three engines (it often had clipping issues), attach another tri-splitter to bring things back together, then just strut the hell out of the entire assembly. This tended to work on about half of my launches, with the other half having engines randomly breaking off or exploding at separation. With .21 and the shiny new large-size quad separators, I thought my job would be easier. Indeed, there were no clipping issues with separators anymore... but now I can\u0027t get staging to succeed at all. Every dang time, I blow those separators and most or all of my nuclear engines go flying, often with their staging sheaths still attached. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmusingly, my most successful design so far didn\u0027t even use separators on the engines... they just hung free above the main body, with the separation handled by a convoluted framework of cubic struts holding the top stage suspended above the lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... my fail-designs aside, how do folks here go about launching nuclear powered orbital vehicles?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T19:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you using the stack separators or the decouplers?
