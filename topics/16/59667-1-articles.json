Real rockets often throttle down (or, in the case of multi-engine rockets like the Saturn V and Falcon 9, shut down some of their engines) close to stage burnout to prevent the acceleration getting high enough to cause structural failure. It\u0027s possible that this happened to your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trueborn","CreatedById":65830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T20:35:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it happens again, check the end of mission report or press F3.

If your ship JUST blew up, chances are it wasn\u0027t a Kraken attack.
