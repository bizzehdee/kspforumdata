But I\u0027m unsure exactly how docking works. \n\nCan you put a docking port on any section of a craft and transfer fuel and/or kerbals through it? Eg I have a cupola on the top with a docking port on - I assume I can transfer kerbals through that, but can I also transfer fuel that will magically go to the fuel tanks? Likewise the bottom of the ship is a fuel tank. I assume I can transfer fuel there, but can I also transfer Kerbals\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T11:46:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 11:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mrklaw**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T10:45:23Z","Content":"Everything will move magically through everything, yes."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad_Scientist","CreatedById":145581,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T11:02:43Z","Content":"If the two tanks are connected via ports, you can transfer fuel (it seems that only liquid, not propellant) by pressing ALT-right-click on each tank.
