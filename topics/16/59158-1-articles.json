When you try to pitch up, your control surfaces are applying a downward force on your aircraft\u0027s tail, making the craft pivot around the axis of the wheels. The center of mass is on the other side of the wheels, exerting a downward force on the aircraft\u0027s nose. To pitch up, the torque from the control surfaces must exceed the torque from the aircraft\u0027s weight. Moving the wheels closer to the CoM and farther from the control surfaces makes the torque from the weight smaller and the torque from the control surfaces bigger, making it easier to lift the nose.

This is usually caused by trying to lift off at too low of air speed and a bit due to kerbal \u0022lift\u0022 physics. Once you are able to get that pitch up, let the SAS do some of the work and hold the nose pitch upwards. If you have enough lift, once you get to speed, the ground will just start to fall away......
