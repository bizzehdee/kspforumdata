And it doesn\u0027t matter how slow or fast I go up or pitch over.\n\nCan someone please tell me what I am doing wrong? I have attached the .craft file here: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw4vIGGr3npPLXF4aVl3SGEzenc\u0026authuser=0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw4vIGGr3npPLXF4aVl3SGEzenc\u0026authuser=0).

Not sure if that will break it for non-KER installs.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nP\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T10:51:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 10:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by scola\\_p**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T20:55:04Z","Content":"It\u0027s probably the usual front-loaded drag issue.

What aerodynamics are you using? Are you using stock fairings, procedural fairings, or sitting there wondering \u0022what\u0027s a fairing\u0022? (Just trying to eliminate that as a potential source of your problems there; not trying to be a wise-ass...). I\u0027m assuming your booster is attached to your payload in your craft file; I\u0027ll know more about it when I can get access. Could be something as simple as insufficient nose-cones or fins on the booster, or it could be that the mass of the booster is greater than the mass of your payload...you are trying to lift a payload in the vicinity of twenty tonnes, after all, just from the description.\n\nNot sure if it\u0027s entirely necessary, but if I understand your grand master plan here, you might want to be sure to include some lander legs for your core. That way the completed structure is fully supported once it\u0027s on the ground."},{"CreatedByName":"Justicier","CreatedById":89671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T21:05:09Z","Content":"I\u0027m unable to get the craft file, but I may be able to talk through the issue. Does the lifting rocket use winglets? Is the payload encased in a fairing? Do you pitch over the rocket slightly after clearing the launch clamps? (or right after liftoff to clear the pad) At what point are you starting your gravity turn?\n\nThere\u0027s a bunch of things that could be going wrong, but in my own experience 9 times out of 10 when my rocket flips out it\u0027s due to poor ascent profile. Its a delicate balance because I have had rockets that if I were to launch and perform NO gravity turn and just keep it pointed straight up, it\u0027ll flip every time. But... with the same rocket, if I pitch over a few degrees at the pad just after liftoff to prevent possible damage to KSC and also to build up some lateral momentum to the rocket... it doesn\u0027t flip at all when I start my gravity turn at 30,000m. Its really tricky to diagnose since I am essentially flying blind."},{"CreatedByName":"scola_p","CreatedById":114770,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T21:17:23Z","Content":"I have just made the file available to all.

Your CoM shifts towards the rocket in flight, and it becomes a dart thrown backwards; aerodynamic forces spin the wrong end towards space. Moar fins if you want to keep this design. Especially on that core stage...\n\nThe booster is definitely over-engineered as well; you don\u0027t need five mainsails and a 415 tonne rocket to lift twenty tonnes (unless you\u0027re trying to do it SSTO, in which case more power to you; keep adjusting your throttle down in flight once you\u0027ve made your turn so that your G meter is at the top of the green and you\u0027re golden). A good asparagus design would get that up into orbit - the rocket would have a mass of just over 130 tonnes and it\u0027d require 1960 kN of thrust at launch. Though they\u0027re quite old now, https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/28248-Is-asparagus-the-best-staging-system-%28might-contain-science%29?p=346702\u0026viewfull=1#post346702\u0027\u003ETemstar\u0027s guidelines for asparagus are still largely valid; the main differences these days are that you want to shoot for a launchpad TWR of 1.5 in stock (1.2 in FAR) and that nosecones and fins are no longer just a good suggestion. And of course, there\u0027s nothing wrong with a serial-staged rocket either, depending on how far up the tech tree you are (the serial staged rocket would almost definitely reduce any problems you have with tumble, as by their very nature the mass of serial rockets stays up towards the nose).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T02:53:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 02:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"scola_p","CreatedById":114770,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T05:16:03Z","Content":"Ahhhh!\n\nMy smaller rockets had noodle based problems with extra fins, so I was trying to avoid overdoing the controls. \n\nI will pop some more on and see about reducing the insane liquid boosters to something more cost effective! \n\nOf course, I will post updates when I can.

Though if you wanted to keep it at two booster pairs (five engines total), you\u0027d be able to do the job with an X200-32 in each of the five stacks; change it to three booster pairs (seven engines total) and you could get that down to an X200-16/X200-8 combo easily enough. Plus nosecones and fins and whatnot. \n\n--Asparagus--\n\nFive engines (all Skippers): set the center to 68% thrust and the side engines to 60%. An x200-32 in each stack.\n\nSeven engines (all Skippers): set the center to 68% and the side engines to 40%. An x200-16 and x200-8 in each stack.\n\nNine engines: The center is still a Skipper set at 68%, but the side engines become Swivels (LV-T45s) set at 100%. The center stack remains an x200-16 and x200-8; the side stacks become two FL-T800s, an FL-T400 and an FL-T100 each.\n\nCouldn\u0027t tell you which is the least expensive option...\n\nThen here\u0027s a two-stage serial option:\n\nUpper stage: Rockomax Decoupler, X200-32, X200-16, Skipper Engine - 1751.837 m/s, 1.33 TWR\n\nLower Stage: Rockomax Decoupler, Jumbo64, X200-32, X200-16, Mainsail Engine - 1752.212, 1.30 TWR\n\nTakeoff Mass: 118.2925 tonnes\n\nYou\u0027d need fins on the lower stage to keep the rocket steady on course as you approached first stage seperation, which *would* cut into the TWR a little bit more than what I\u0027ve calculated here. The TWRs of the design are sub-optimal, but not so low that you wouldn\u0027t make orbit. Beauty of the serial design - it\u0027s simple, and you wouldn\u0027t need nosecones.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T13:23:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dilli","CreatedById":142986,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T13:21:23Z","Content":"I\u0027d put 4 way symmetry delta wings on the core of the first stage - they make good fins; surprisingly I have not had a problem with them being hit by the side boosters on separation in similar setups."},{"CreatedByName":"Acet","CreatedById":123646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T14:13:43Z","Content":"To lift 20t in payload all you need is 1 orange tank with a Skipper under it and 8 side columns of FL-T fuel tanks with a reliant engine under each, paired in an asparagus configuration.
