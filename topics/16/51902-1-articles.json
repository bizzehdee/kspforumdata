I\u0027m pretty sure MJ\u0027s new warp helper has a phase angle mode now, but I haven\u0027t used it yet so I cannot comment on its accuracy. Otherwise Otis has a good suggestion. I mainly use Kerbal Alarm Clock. I cannot remember exactly right now because I haven\u0027t done any interplanetary stuff in a while, but there are two modes to calculate transfer times. I think MJ uses one mode for inward travel and the other for outward. I wish I could log on right now and check to help out more, but I can\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
