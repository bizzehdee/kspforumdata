The reason I ask, is that I\u0027m always so anxious about making things, because I\u0027m afraid the turn out will be impossible to use, due to low FPS. Now my computer is a relatively high end machine (CPU: Core i7 4790K. GPU: GTX 970. Mobo: MSI Mpower Z97. etc.), but I once tried to download one of Overfloaters planes, to test in with FAR (Which as expected, didn\u0027t go well xD), and my FPS tanked to unplayable levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow in that case, I\u0027m assuming FAR is the cause, making more demanding then stock (assumptions, I have many), but beyond that, is there parts I can use without too much fear of FPS tanking?

FAR does require additional compute time, but not much: again, it\u0027s number of parts which kills you*. Engines are more demanding than other parts as well, because they have to scan fuel tanks each tick.
