After a few minutes after launch the focus on my ship starts jolting back in consecutive intervals usually every 6 km consistently. I have no clue as to why this happens. I am aware that it may be operator-error but it occurs with every rocket I create, even with the simplest SRB vehicle. Once I loose focus on the craft there is no way to recover it, and I loose all possible way of seeing it. I need help finding out why this problem might occur and/or a way to fix it.
