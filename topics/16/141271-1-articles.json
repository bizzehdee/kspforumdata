My machine has a rather nice GPU (Radeon R7 240 4Gb) but the CPU is a little lower tech (AMD 6 core 3.5GHz). Just for fun, during beta testing, I had all the scatters turned on fulll. I ended up landing a jet on a plain that had at least 10,000 trees in view. And boy oh boy did that stall my system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
