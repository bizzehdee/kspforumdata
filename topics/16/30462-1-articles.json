Even using bicouplers and docking collars getting Orange tanks to dock up to each other perfectly symetrically with both collars engaging has proven to be hard.

One center, two side tanks with each docked to the other in seperate launches. The side tanks get jettisoned once down to 1/3rd fuel remaining in the tanks (then all is transfered to the center tanks and the side tanks and engines are kicked loose).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I need to go back to my prior design of a seperate drive section of NERVA engines (1.5m jobs since I am back to all stock), but maybe with the fuel tanks either docked out from a node connector up front on seperatrons (and/or spin up the ship before seperating tanks) or else a semi-pusher design. From front to rear of mission section, drive section, fuel section. Maybe with a few of the engines of decouplers as well so that once I burn through some of my fuel and eject tanks I can eject engines to balance TWR and increase efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tokay Gris","CreatedById":58301,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T19:29:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rascal Nag\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rascal Nag\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd even if we did have ropes, it would not be wise to use them in rocket assembly.
