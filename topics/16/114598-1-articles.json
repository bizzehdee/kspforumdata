If the timer began before the time the contract was accepted, it will not count. (assuming this mechanic has not changed)\n\nDoing things like docking with other ships/stations can break this tracking."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T06:42:04Z","Content":"I thought it is fully tracking launchID of each parts now so that undocking will not count - meaning that even if MET of at least one of them would count from the point of undock event, both will be counted as old as the original one, so that you can\u0027t trick the system by performing actions like undocking."}]}
