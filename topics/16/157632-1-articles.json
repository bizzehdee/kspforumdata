And \u0022in range\u0022 can of course mean different things, because there\u0027s this concept of range-based signal strength, and bonuses associated with having lots of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe minimum size for a ring of satellites that fulfills these criteria is three, in a triangle configuration. But that configuration also results in the maximum distance between the satellites themselves, so in order to keep that distance within the range of your antennas, you will have to put them in quite a close orbit. When you increase the number of satellites, then the distance between any given two satellites gets smaller, which means the constellation can inhabit a higher orbit while still staying in range of each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the answer to the question of \u0022how many satellites should I launch into an orbit of which altitude?\u0022 is based on the distance you can support between any two satellites. This distance in turn is based on your antenna technology, and the difficulty settings for the commnet feature that you chose at game start. Better antennas have more range, so you need fewer satellites in the same orbit. But, you can also stack antennas on the same satellite to boost the satellite\u0027s total range. So you need fewer satellites with two antennas each than you need satellites with one antenna each, even if the antenna is the same in all cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can find formulas for antenna range calculation as well as antenna stacking \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CommNet#Range_Calculation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere on the wiki\u003C/a\u003E. Unfortunately, I\u0027ve never found a reliable documentation for the combinability exponent that you need to calculate the latter, but I\u0027ve been led to believe that it is 0.75 for most antennas, and 1.0 for a select few.
