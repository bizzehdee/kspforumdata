You see, a rocket doesn\u0027t have a range; the limits to where it can go are based on how efficient its engines are and how much fuel it carries around, which is all wrapped up in a neat little mathematical formula called the Rocket Equation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelta-V = ln(M/Md)*9.8*Isp, where ln is the natural logarithm function (look for it on your calculator), M is the total mass of your rocket stage, Md is the dry mass of the rocket stage (i.e. how much it weighs when it\u0027s out of gas), and Isp is specific impulse (a measure of how efficient your engines are - look for this data on the wiki and in the VAB).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4,550 is the amount of delta-V you have to have available to have \u003Cem\u003Ea reasonable shot\u003C/em\u003E of making it as far as Kerbin\u0027s orbit.

You can have multiple pods, there are pods with more than one seat, there are external command seats, and there are docking modules which let you assemble multiple vehicles, etc. You can manage it with one of the tabs up near the top of the VAB. That said, for your first Mun mission, KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid. A typical first lander is going to be a Mk. 1 command pod on top of a fuel tank, an LV-909 engine, some lander legs, solar panels, batteries, lights, and other science/utility equipment (don\u0027t forget the antenna!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Delta-V refers to how much your rocket can change its velocity, and is tied to amount of fuel, fuel efficiency, and vessel dry mass. Ignoring gravity and atmosphere, a rocket with 4,550 m/s of delta-V can change its velocity by 4,550 m/s. That figure is the approximate amount of velocity change you need to get out of atmosphere and get to orbital velocity: you need to go up ~70-80 km (edge of atmosphere is 69,078 meters) and get to ~2200 m/s, all the while fighting atmosphere and gravity. Missions outside Kerbin orbit have other considerations: efficiency depends on how much you can use the Oberth effect, gravitational slingshots, aerobrakes, bi-elliptic transfers, and how much you need to correct your orbital inclination before the transfer burn, and there are probably other tricks I haven\u0027t heard of. Learn about these at your own pace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the ascent phase, you absolutely need a thrust-to-weight (TWR) ratio of 1.0 or greater, and you typically want a TWR slightly \u0026gt; 2 (usually a bit less at launch, because as you consume fuel, your TWR goes up). The reason for this is that if you are going faster than terminal velocity*, you are wasting fuel fighting air resistance, and if you are going slower, you are wasting fuel fighting gravity. You also want to do a gravity turn: at around 10 km altitude, you want to start tipping eastwards, finishing your ascent pointing straight east. The last part of your ascent will be with engines off; you will generally circularize your orbit (get to orbital velocity) once you\u0027ve left the atmosphere. However, at this point, you should generally be only a few hundred m/s short of orbital velocity anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for this is that prograde burns (in the direction of your orbit) are the most efficient way to raise your orbit. In theory, then, one should point one\u0027s rocket straight east (in the direction of Kerbin\u0027s rotation, which gives you about 150 m/s for free) and start burning, but then you run into these pesky \u0022atmosphere\u0022 and \u0022lithosphere\u0022 things. Thus, you need to start by going straight up to get out of that thick, thick atmosphere, and gradually start tipping eastwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Terminal velocity is how fast you fall: it is the speed at which air resistance exactly matches gravity. Obviously, for rocket ascent, you would be going in the opposite direction. If you are not going in the opposite direction, your space car is not going to space today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3) You can always just do an orbit or two at 8 km and visually scan for good landing sites. Remember to have a lander with a low center of mass, with the legs as high up as you dare (you do need some clearance so that you don\u0027t crunchify your engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4) I\u0027d make a maneuver node about a quarter-rotation behind the Mun, set it prograde to get to about Mun orbit, and then play with moving the manuever node and increasing/decreasing thrust to get a good Mun intercept. If it will take your ship 30 seconds to pull off the transfer burn, start 15 seconds before the node: that is the most efficient and least inaccurate way to do it. To set up for this, I would select the Mun as your target, and make a maneuver node at either the ascending or descending node, and set it normal/anti-normal as necessary to match planes with the Mun (should not be difficult, as the Mun orbits exactly around the Equator with no inclination).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, one note: when returning from the Mun, what you want to do is perform your return burn slightly before your orbit points directly opposite the Mun\u0027s orbit, and set it so that your Kerbin periapsis will be at a good aerobraking altitude (37.5 km, in my experience, is reasonably safe for Munar returns). Think of your vessel as being in Kerbin orbit alongside with the Mun: to return to Kerbin, you need to kill a lot of the Mun\u0027s orbital velocity. This means exiting Munar orbit going in the opposite direction, and the faster you exit Munar orbit, the less time it\u0027s got to try to pull you back to itself. The reason for not burning at exactly that point is that the Mun will curve your orbit, such that when you exit, your trajectory will be going further out in Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerobraking is literally just using the atmosphere to slow your orbital velocity. You want to go deep enough in to reduce orbital velocity without engaging in unplanned lithobraking (complete re-entry, presumably followed by landing... or crashing, if you forgot the parachute and don\u0027t have any fuel left). Remember: parachutes don\u0027t work on the Mun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-19T19:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022figure 8\u0022 pattern is what\u0027s known as a free return trajectory.

If in doubt, try it out on Kerbin, then compare the gravity/highest altitude of your flight on Kerbin to the place you\u0027re headed.

Use maneuver nodes to get you into a close approach to the Mun, then, once your periapsis changes to one around the moon, plot another maneuver at periapsis that burns retrograde--away from your direction of travel, so that it captures you in orbit around the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, this is still the figure-8 maneuver from Apollo, just chopped up into pieces.

If you have a mod that shows your radar altitude you can read the altitude directly for those steps. I\u0027ve found that mun takes 2500 d/v in the lander stage to land and return to kerbin safely. This works out to a FL-400 with the LV909 with the Mk1 capsule, plus landing gear and a small science experiment (one Science kit).
