But the same principle can be used (the radial engines are from the HOME mod, but the stock version would work just fine, too). Just make sure you have room underneath to fit the rover without crushing it when landing. Another small decoupler and truss segment can be used below the rover to attach it to the main rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T16:01:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ruedii\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ruedii\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI usually stack my items one on top of the other, then surround them with a Fairing (You currently need mods for fairings.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI heard about fairing i wonder when we will have standard issue faring on stock parts, that would fix a loot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added me rocket project in attachment, i would glad for you opinion, does it possible to stack in it LM???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bx2uGwZ4w808LS1Vb0tscjRndW8/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bx2uGwZ4w808LS1Vb0tscjRndW8/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
