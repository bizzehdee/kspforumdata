You should always be using the ship. Once you can rotate your head into looking at it that way, it will make sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd no, your reaction wheels and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters can only produce some maximum amount of torque. The flip time is determined completely by the torque. The torque\u00A0depends on the number of reaction wheels, and the number and lever arm of the thrusters. If you want to turn faster\u00A0you need either more reaction wheels, or you need more and better positioned thrusters. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E system is not perfectly efficient at rotating your ship, but it\u0027s hard for a human to do it much faster. It\u0027s best to keep your entire ship pointed mostly target-retrograde through your entire braking process until you are within 30 to 50 meters of your target. Of course you need small readjustment burns through that process, but you can usually keep them within 30 degrees of retrograde -- or just use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E for doing the corrections and keep \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E locked to target-retrograde the entire time. That way, you don\u0027t ever need to flip your ship all the way around. But yes, you need to time the length of your approach run to the amount of time it takes to adjust your ship\u0027s attitude to do the correction burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"putnamto","CreatedById":184648,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-27T08:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnow i feel really dumb, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E orientation is relative to your SHIPS\u00A0 orientation, not your camera view.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nif my ship is upside down, then the controls will be upside down.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nthank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
