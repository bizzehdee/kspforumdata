Would the overall sum of all the science points from these transmissions be equall to saving the data and recovering the ship ONCE, or would it be equal to the sum of repeatedly landing on the same spot, saving the data and recovering the ship untill you don\u0027t get any more points from running the experimet again?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T09:54:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESingle transmisson gives you less science than single recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth repeated transmissions and repeated recoveries will eventually get you to completely depleting all science points available at that place.
