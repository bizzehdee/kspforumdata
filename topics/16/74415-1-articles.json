However, it doesn\u0027t always work for me and I can\u0027t find any reports of this problem or solutions. I\u0027ve been trying a mixed bag of tricks - returning to the Space Center, then double clicking on my ship to return to it... and using Alt-F5 quicksaves. Both of these methods have allowed a non-working \u0022R\u0022 key to suddenly re-enable itself, but it is intermittent and seemingly random. I\u0027m kind of at wits end here with this. Sometimes the R key works, and sometimes it doesn\u0027t. I have to enter the capsule to refill my jetpack fuel over and over, but when I exit the capsule, the R key usually doesn\u0027t work until I try these random things to solve it. Caps lock key is off, can\u0027t think of anything else to try.

Yes, my routine was to press \u0022EVA\u0022 then immediately press \u0022R\u0022 and only then would I move away from the ladder. What\u0027s odd is that sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, letting go of the ladder before I confirmed that my jetpack is actually working was NOT my idea of a wise decision... thus I never thought to even try that.
