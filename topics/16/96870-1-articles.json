The longitude displayed in the contract is celestial longitude, which is a different coordinate system. In the real world, geographic coordinates use Earth\u0027s equator as zero latitude and Greenwich, England as zero longitude. Real world celestial coordinates use the ecliptic as zero latitude and the direction of the vernal equinox as zero longitude. In KSP, Kerbin\u0027s equator lies within the ecliptic plane, so keographic latitude and celestial latitude are one in the same. Longitude is different, however. Keographic longitude rotates with the planet, while celestial longitude is fixed in relation to the stars. The direction of zero celestial longitude is not clearly defined and, as far as I know, does not correspond to any identifiable feature. However, you can get a rough idea of its direction by going to the map view and zooming out until you see the orbit of Eeloo. The celestial longitude of Eeloo\u0027s apoapsis is 130 degrees and its periapsis is 310 degrees. From this you can estimate the direction of zero longitude (longitude increases going counter-clockwise).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-16T22:09:20Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2015 10:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T21:20:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just observed something.
