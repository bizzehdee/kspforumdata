It\u0027s a great technique for aerobraking as long as you\u0027re not going so fast that you absolutely have to be hiding behind a heatshield.\n\nBody lift can be useful to avoid burning up, in places like Kerbin.  For Duna, I find that it\u0027s also useful, but for a different reason:  not so much because of heating issues (Duna reentry is fairly forgiving; the velocity tends to be low if you\u0027ve got a good transfer window), but because the atmosphere is so thin that landers have a tendency to faceplant at hundreds of meters per second, long before they\u0027re slow enough to pop chutes.  Body lift is one way to mitigate that, by helping to bleed off a lot of speed before plowing into the terrain.\n\n(Yes, there are other things that can help with that too, like airbrakes or drogue chutes, but body lift is a very handy tool in the toolbox.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 1/14/2016 at 0:15 PM, Dixi said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I dunno how to insert a picture here.\n\u003E \n\nOnce you have your image link (from imgur or wherever), you can insert a picture by clicking the gray \u0022Insert other media\u0022 button at bottom right, then choosing \u0022Insert image from URL\u0022 and pasting your image URL into the box that pops up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-16T16:40:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2016 04:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dixi","CreatedById":140278,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-16T23:11:15Z","Content":"So there is a way to aerobrake at Duna.

But even there, it\u0027s not a sovereign remedy-- you can get stuck in a place (such as you describe) that there doesn\u0027t exist any \u0022right\u0022 periapsis:  either you\u0027re too low and suddenly explode (even with heatshield), or else you don\u0027t get enough slowdown and go flying off into space.\n\nThe solution here is twofold:\n\n- Make sure that every bit of your ship is hiding behind a heatshield.\n- Have as many square meters of heatshield per ton of ship as possible.\n\nThe ideal shape for aerobraking is the exact opposite of the ideal shape for launch:  you want a big, flat pancake, that will let you decelerate enough to get captured, without having to dive so deep into the atmosphere that you go suddenly kaboom.\n\nSo... either lower the mass of your ship, or put a bigger-diameter heatshield on it.
