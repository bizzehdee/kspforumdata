Rockets can flip for a number of reasons, but the common ones are too much drag in the nose, maneuvering too aggressively, and accelerating too rapidly. Rockets behave better when streamlined, and even better with fins in the tail. And of course... don\u0027t taunt happy fun rocket.\n\n For reentry, I recommend a periapsis of around 30 km if you have an ablative heat shield and around 45 km if you don\u0027t. Falling straight down can easily blow you up.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T12:30:38Z","Content":"Pics of your rocket would help identify areas of improvement."},{"CreatedByName":"Cannon","CreatedById":109645,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T18:02:57Z","Content":"i can\u0027t upload pics because i\u0027m on a vacation and internet is slow here but you can find the craft file of my ship at [www.cannon-gaming.site90.com](www.cannon-gaming.site90.com)"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T19:24:10Z","Content":"![RTBkTZY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RTBkTZY.jpg)\n\nI guess you mean this one. The other is just bigger and has the same structural problems.\n\nYour initial TWR is 3.3. That is way too high and you\u0027ll hit Mach 1, the point where aerodynamical forces grow exponentially, extremely early and deep inside the atmosphere. Your whole craft is extremely long and its CoM is comparatively low and probably much lower that the center of pressure. That basically means you have a huge lever that the arodynamic forces can attack quite easily because you have lots and lots of unprotected draggy bits at the top of your rocket. You use next to no struts so those smaller boosters wobble horribly as soon as the physics load and the whole thing starts to drift and wobble in any direction as soon as you launch.\n\nI don\u0027t know if there\u0027s a good way to save that design. You carry way too much small engines around and that makes your stages somewhat heavy and overpowered. I\u0027d say ditch that twin keel design and build something that resembles a normal rocket (or at least strut them up vigorously). Use less stages with less parts, put enough juice in them and use upper stages that can actually keep the CoM from falling to low. Put draggy stuff like tail fins at the bottom of your rocket and either keep the top of your rocket somewhat clean or use fairings to protect the small stuff from the attacking wind. Your initial TWR should be around 1.5 to 2 (you might want to use one of the information mods like Kerbal Engineer Redux, Mechjeb or VOID) and start to turn slowly when you hit a speed between 50-100m/s and get to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at somewhere between 10-15km.\n\nEdit: Ditched the whole first stage and put struts between the next two. Throttled back to around 80% after a few seconds and got it to orbit with at least 5500m/s still in the tanks. A rough ride but still doable. Orienting the craft to the north-south axis at launch might also be agood idea.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-26T19:45:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2015 07:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Harry Rhodan**"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T20:12:20Z","Content":"Your craft looks like its going to land and return from the mun or minmus. My approach would be the second smallest 1.25 m lfo tank with the terrier, with some slightly longer tanks on a decoupler attached to that center tank. Outer tanks should be in 3 or 4 times symmetry, have nose cones at the top, be feeding into the inner tank to take advantage of onion staging, and should have terrier engines which should be a bit lower than the middle terrier so you can use them as stable landing legs. \n\nUsing that design should give you plenty of dv to circulize your orbit around the mun or minmus, de orbit and land, take off again and return to kerbin. You could probably use it to make some or all of the burn required to get an encounter with that planetary body, but keep in mind that you\u0027ll probably want to keep the outer tanks at least untill you take off and start returning to kerbin. \n\nascent, stage would either be A. a couple long 1.25 tanks with a 45 or 30 engine and a couple of srbs, or B. an adapter to go from 1.25 to 2.5, big orange tank and a skipper engine. \n\nRegardless of how you build you must remember that you rarely need more than 2 points to connect to make something stable(fuel lines act as struts FYI) and add fins to the bottom of your rocket to help orient you rocket during ascent\n\nOh and use Kerbal Engineer, its a lifesaver and makes you much more informed"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T22:47:48Z","Content":"First things first, lose those winglets where they are! I think they\u0027re placed high enough that initially they\u0027re going to angle the wrong way given pitch/yaw inputs. I also don\u0027t care for the rockomax decoupler straight to 1.25m, use an adapter and a smaller decoupler. For that matter, you could just turn the first stage into drop tanks, or use the S1 SRBs and vary thrust levels from the mainsails, or even remove them entirely and add another orange tank to the mainsail stage."},{"CreatedByName":"Cannon","CreatedById":109645,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T00:10:08Z","Content":"thanks for the responses, i\u0027m still trying to figure out how these new physics work, any help would be apriciated, becuase when i was playing on 0.25 version i was a pro, now i feel like an amateur ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Arkalius","CreatedById":40968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T00:42:58Z","Content":"Well, the biggest tip I can give you is try to design rockets that somewhat resemble real-life rockets.

The old kerbal-ish lifter designs wind up being draggy and unstable.\n\n Just design your stuff to resemble RL lifters and you should be fine. Watch the t/w ratio, avoid sharp diameter transitions, and beware draggy parts in the nose.\n\n Also, the old \u0022climb to 10k and hang a right\u0022 ascent profile is no good any more.

Then build on top of that. You have a lot of stuff to re-learn, but don\u0027t worry - everyone had to go through that since the move to 1.0\u002B, and it\u0027s not that hard. In fact, once you\u0027ve got the hang of it, you wouldn\u0027t know how you had ever managed to build and get those kind of monstrosities to orbit before."}]}
