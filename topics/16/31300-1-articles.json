But say I completely forget and I take off from the mun and uh oh my ships are travelling in the opposite direction (ship A: north to south, ship B south to north). I really don\u0027t want to abort and close the flight so how so I get these two ships in a position where I can dock?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny clues on what I can do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atanar","CreatedById":59913,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T12:39:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the simple answer is: You can\u0027t. Smashing into each other at over 4000m/s isn\u0027t healthy. You have to burn noth or south to completly rotate your orbit which takes quite some delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Syhrus","CreatedById":64839,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T12:44:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E be able to change your orbit by flinging one ship around the Mun at an angle to change it\u0027s Kerbal orbit. It really depends on how much fuel you have left in either ship.

By definition, if both ships are travelling in opposite directions it\u0027s impossible for them to be stationary to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way around this is to reverse your orbit on one of the ships, which is the same as doing a 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination change. This is going to cost A LOT of delta-V that you probably don\u0027t have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laphtiya","CreatedById":61211,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T12:51:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh I see, well this only happened once and my solution was to burn the cmd to mimnus and come back at the Mun and correct my rotation accordingly.
