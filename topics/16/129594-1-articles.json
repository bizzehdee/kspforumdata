You can set the Science Jr. on top of the command pod, you\u0027re not really giving up much by lugging it home (it\u0027s a tiny fraction of the pod mass).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I want to land a lab on the Mun, my typical construction is to put \u003Cstrong\u003Efour of the long skinny 4-ton LFO tanks radially attached around the lab, with a Terrier on each one, and a nosecone on top of each\u003C/strong\u003E (for aero when launching).\u00A0 That gives 16 tons of fuel, which is a nice stage amount, with enough thrust for landing on the Mun and a pretty good Isp.\u00A0 It also gives a nice squat stance for landing (put the landing legs on the radial fuel tanks, so that when landed the science lab is only barely above the ground).\u00A0 A Poodle would be lighter, more powerful, and slightly higher Isp than four Terriers, but I\u0027d have to sling it under the lab which makes the ship taller, and I prefer the low squat stance with Terriers; they\u0027re good enough for this.\u00A0 (Those radial stacks are also a convenient place to put things like reaction wheels, 1.25m batteries, etc.-- i.e. stuff that you want to avoid putting in-line on your main stack so you keep the central stack nice and rigid.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen put a Rockomax decoupler under the lab, with a 16-ton tank and a Skipper.\u00A0 Then under the Skipper is another Rockomax decoupler, a Big Orange Tank with Mainsail, and a bunch of radial Kickbacks for liftoff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can play around with the details, but the core idea is, don\u0027t try to land a lab-on-top-of-fuel-tank-on-top-of-engine, it\u0027s just too topheavy for a lander.\u00A0 Mount stuff radially to the lab.\u00A0 If it\u0027s just four 1.25m stacks, the drag\u0027s not too bad on liftoff (especially with nosecones on them), and it vastily simplifies the design of the ship otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s almost never a good idea to put one Big Orange on top of another Big Orange, or at least I\u0027ve never found a good reason to do so.\u00A0 If I need that much fuel I go up to the big 3.75m tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA favorite somewhat-heavy booster stage that I tend to use a lot for 2.5m stacks consists of a Big Orange tank with Mainsail, and an even number of Kickbacks radially around it (quantity depending on ship mass).\u00A0 If it\u0027s just 2 boosters, then they stage off together.\u00A0 If it\u0027s more than two (i.e. 4, 6, or 8), then I don\u0027t make one symmetry group; instead, I make two symmetry groups, with one group at 100% thrust and the other group at whatever percentage is needed to give TWR 1.5 on the pad (typically around 60-70%).\u00A0 That gives my SRBs some additional legs-- I take off on all SRBs at once, but the hundred-percenters run out of fuel and are jettisoned first, and I can continue flying for quite some time on the 2nd group before they run out and I activate the Mainsail.\u00A0 Sort of a \u0022poor man\u0027s asparagus.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxL_1023","CreatedById":152317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T22:48:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on the TWR you want, you can keep the\u00A02.5m tank under your lab and run fuel lines to the radial terriers. If your radial connections are on the lab itself, you can decouple the tank when it runs out, and still have your radial tanks full. It would be useful for a transfer burn to the Mun and\u00A0Mun orbit insertion where TWR is not as important as takeoff/landing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T11:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI initially didn\u0027t understand why you have the Mk1-2 pod \u002B heatshield \u002B stack separator on top there. Since there is no propulsion system attached to them, you\u0027re going to have to bring the mobile lab all the way back to Kerbin and then ditch it in the atmosphere if you want to bring anyone back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you really need to bring the pod home, it is possible to add the smallest 2.5m fuel tank \u002B radially mounted twitches to the command pod and have it lift off the top of the lab on the surface of the Mun. Alternatively, bring the top part down to 1.25m scale and just have a single-occupant command pod lift off (much easier on weight and fuel). If your contract imposes a 5-kerbal capacity, you can always add lander cans or command pods. Just don\u0027t forget the docking ports (radially on the MPL works fine).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo land an MPL on the Mun, I always use four radial rockets (similar to Snark\u0027s suggestion, except I generally put an X-200-8 on the bottom of the MPL and radially attach four FL-T200 tanks to it, with terriers underneath and fuel lines to keep them supplied from the centre tank, although this gives you far more fuel than you need). If you need more kerbal capacity, you can attach these in pairs and put lander cans or command pods on top of one of the pairs, and leave it all behind when you go back home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other advantage of reducing the Kerbin-return section to the 1.25m form factor is that it completely solves the Science Jr. issue, since you have a 1.25m section to house it (and even bring it home safely if you want). The other options would be under the docking port or in a 2.5m service bay: it does fit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, to future-proof the lab if you leave it on the surface, add batteries, solar panels (the retractable ones) and antenna to it. Then you can leave a scientist on it to generate science points, and come back later in the game to pick him up. If you don\u0027t have a spare scientist, just dump the lab on the surface and then come back to it once you have more staff. Whatever you do, you will not regret having plenty of batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also future-poof your lab to make it possible to complete a potential \u0022expand your outpost\u0022 contract. On the Mun, that generally means leaving a docking port fairly low down at a pre-defined height (the centre-line of the biggest landing legs is a useful indicator) so you can drive a future rover up to it. Be prepared for pain and frustration in the process though...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the Kerbin ascent part - I never build so tall, because that means I\u0027m lifting a huge amount of fuel \u002B unused rocket engine above a single engine. My centre stack tends to be X-32 \u002B X-16 (or rarely a single orange) with Skipper underneath, then asparagused 1.25 stacks (generally two side stacks of 2x FL-T800s) with Reliants or Aerospikes. That gives a relatively cheap and reliable (and efficient) middle stage for a wide range of payloads. Then add asparagus 2.5 tanks (with bigger or smaller engines, depending on payload) and/or boosters to get out of the lower atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-10T11:41:50Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2016 11:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JackBush","CreatedById":149535,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T14:35:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for all the responses!

I made this back in the pre-1.0 days, but it still works fine. Some aspects of it are overdone and could be removed to save mass, but it has the nice wide stance for low-gravity landings and enough dV to get you down to the surface (from Mun/Minmus orbit) and back to Kerbin in one go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for your design, it\u0027s not horrible, just overbuilt. You don\u0027t need that much fuel to get where you\u0027re going with that lab because you\u0027re wasting a lot of energy hauling extra weight. The first stage of your center stack is the right size, but you don\u0027t need the second stage. What is currently your third stage can become the second stage (with a Skipper) under your lab/lander to push it the rest of the way to the Mun. Get rid of all that stuff sticking out on the sides. Take the legs off the lab and pack 3-4 radial chutes instead -- being sure to leave yourself just enough fuel to soften your landing with a power-assist from the engines. Get rid of the heavy pod on top and replace it with a lander like what I\u0027ve made above. It\u0027s heavier than the pod, but if you lighten the whole launcher you can gain significantly more utility (and science for less total mass) by being able to land on the Mun while your mobile lab stays in orbit.
