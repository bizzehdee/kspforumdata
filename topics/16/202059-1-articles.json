I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s totally impossible to do, but I don\u2019t think Duna has the gravity to change your orbit enough to make it work without many orbits around the Sun and you\u2019ll probably need a course correction at some point anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u2019re talking about the ideal periapsis for re-entry, the only way to find out is to stick down a quick save and try different altitudes until you find one that gets you down in one piece without skipping off the atmosphere and flying back into space or burning up in a blaze of fiery explosions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wizard Kerbal","CreatedById":209063,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-30T14:55:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n25-35 km usually works, but watch your trajectory around kerbin.
