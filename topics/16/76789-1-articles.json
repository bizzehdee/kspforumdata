I\u0027m fairly new to KSP and don\u0027t have a lot of time to play, but I really enjoy the game.

The crew and EVA reports alone make the manned science mission gains well worth it. That said, there is way more science in the Kerbol system than the tech tree can support, so manned missions aren\u0027t needed for anywhere really (unless you want the crew/eva reports). It\u0027s a little easier to design a probe vs manned lander, but not there isn\u0027t very much difference. Also, there is a huge amount of satisfaction of sending a Kerbal to another body, doing all the fun stuff there, and then bringing him home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T03:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA return mission will always give significantly more science than a transmitting mission - though for unmanned return missions you may need to carry multiple small instruments. A kerballed mission will give somewhat more science than an unkerballed one (since EVA reports and Surface Samples are exclusive to Kerbals, and Crew Reports need a command pod though it doesn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to be occupied). These factors are independent: there\u0027s no reason you can\u0027t make a probe return mission. The bigger benefit is from returning rather than going one-way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever a kerballed ship will be several times heavier than an ultralight probe, and a return mission will need to be a few times heavier than a one way (how much by depends on destination).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs regards specific cases for one-way missions, well an Eve lander is the obvious one.
