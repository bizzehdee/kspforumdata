But since\u00A0Kerbin is a sphere, the ground is curving away from you as you fly, and over time this will make your plane pitch up relative to the horizon.\u00A0\u00A0You will need to make occasional adjustments when flying long distances.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-17T00:34:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223297042\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170992\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221518825385\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022176895\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022IanCanberra\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n34 minutes ago, IanCanberra said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I warp time the wings angle up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems to be the normal effect of physics time warp (i.e. the kind of time warp you can do in the atmosphere which is limited to 4x). This kind of time warp tends to exaggerate the effects of physics on your craft. In any normal airplane, the wings support the weight of the fuselage. When this effect is exaggerated, the result is that the fuselage will seem to sag down between the wings, or seen the abnother way the wings will seem to be angling up. This is a normal artifact of physics time warp and there\u0027s nothing you can do about it. The good news is that this effect is mostly harmless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-17T01:41:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the autopilot... you\u0027ve got at least two options: MechJeb (all hail! :P) and Atmospheric Autopilot.
