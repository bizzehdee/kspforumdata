The value of APe, therefore, tells you nothing meaningful about your real problem. Your problem is caused by your Pe altitude and your inclination, which are 2 things APe doesn\u0027t even take into account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why some folks have suggested you circularize at Ap. While this increases your major axis, it also increases your minor axis. Increasing the major axis moves the Pe further from your AN and DN. Increasing the minor axis moves the AN and DN further away from Kerbin. The combination of these effects makes it cheaper to do a plane change burn at AN or DN. During this process, your LAN won\u0027t change, and thus neither will your APE (unless you overshoot, which will change APe by 180^). Because of this, APe is irrelevant to this part of the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow assume you\u0027ve circularized (which probably isn\u0027t the best tactic--do what Kasuha says). Your APe is still the same as it was before but the plane change burn is now way cheaper because you\u0027ve moved your AN, DN, and Pe to a better configuration. So now you do the plane change. Here, you still don\u0027t care about APe because now it\u0027s all about inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
