So it would make more sense to leave the station as is, and let the landers do the inclination adjustments. Bulk them up a bit if you need to pack on the extra 1km/s or so they\u0027ll need for a round trip with payload. Who cares if they use a little extra gas...they can top up when they get back to the base, and then fill cargoes.
