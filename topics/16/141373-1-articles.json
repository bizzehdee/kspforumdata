This gives you a good estimation of burn time. Start your burn according to the given maneuver node value and watch your vertical speed. Once it reaches 0 you start falling back to Kerbin. Pitch up to counter to this movement and \u0022ride the apoapsis\u0022 until the camera flickers. Doing so you don\u0027t change your desired apoapsis as you maintain ~ 0 m/s vertical speed at the highest point of the trajectory. As you might play with KER or MechJeb for telemetry output you can burn until your periapsis will be at the same altitude as the apoapsis. You\u0027re guaranteed to be in a near circular orbit. All you have to do is to keep your vertical speed at around 0 once you reached apoaopsis. Beware though, this is quite the fine handling in stock system size. You can also throttle down towards the end of the burn so you get much more fine control over things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DChurchill","CreatedById":60282,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T16:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo circularization burns at apoapsis or periapsis. While not absolutley nesessary. you only have to fiddle with the prograde and retrograde handles to get a circular orbit.
