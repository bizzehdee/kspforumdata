The angles are measured relative to a fixed orientation in space, which I assume is related to the coordinate system the planetary system is laid out on in code. In other words, I believe there\u0027s some arbitrary line drawn from the Sun, down the plane of the ecliptic, which marks angle zero. For each planet, their reference line is parallel to that line (but inclined if their orbit is inclined.) If all of the bodies had a zero MAaE, they would start out all in a straight line (looking from above) leading from the Sun outward.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T22:21:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the surprise is that KSC isn\u0027t also aligned to that same orientation to start...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T00:43:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs Kerbin\u0027s prime meridian aligned to said orientation at the start?
