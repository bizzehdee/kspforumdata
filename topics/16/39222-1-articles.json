I\u0027ve got a nuclear tug design with two engines, the problem is it starts to spin (yaw, along the plane the two engines are in) out of control as soon as I have any thrust...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis suggests to me, one of the engines is either underpowered or they are angled in some crazy way. Surely if I\u0027d mounted them wonky or something (which I\u0027m pretty sure I haven\u0027t - used symmetry) it would spin on the pitch axes? Unless they were different heights... Anyway, rather than stab at it in the dark and have to launch into orbit every time I was wondering if anyone else has come across this problem with this engine configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks (this is the second to last stage, just the front bit is the tug itself:)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IKyYS0u.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IKyYS0u.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"krenshala","CreatedById":76062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T01:59:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre the three fins part of the part that spins? I see that the right RV-N (in the picture) is lined up perfectly to try and flame that fin off, and that may be affecting the thrust symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, did you check the centers of thrust and gravity when building that part? It may simply be that the two of them aren\u0027t lined up on the same axis, which would definitely cause it to spin. The farther apart for their axis, the more force needed to counter that spin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"espm400","CreatedById":71109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T02:11:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere is your CoM in relation to your CoT? Although I\u0027ve never experienced it before, I\u0027ve heard if the CoM is above your CoT it tends to reverse the gimbaling on your engines. Try locking the gimbals on your engines and see if it still wants to spin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlmarti","CreatedById":70037,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T03:35:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hanvyj\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hanvyj\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was wondering if anyone else has come across this problem with this engine configuration.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

When you see it go out of kilter, hit F3, see if you have had a structural failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

What happens then is that the thrust from the left engine works while the left engine\u0027s thrust is being blocked, and that causes the spin you see.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hanvyj","CreatedById":76145,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T13:11:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks everybody, I think you were right - reconfigured the winglets and all is good now.
