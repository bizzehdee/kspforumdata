Usually when you click the apothesis icon you get the \u0022course-meter\u0022 (you know what I mean \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) where you can click and drag to set a course for a orbit or something else... But I\u0027m not allowed to do that in the career mode, nothing happens when I click the icon... Most likely I\u0027m missing something... What is mandatory for being allowed to do that ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, more bad at the moment : \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just came back from a nice orbital flight... completed two small missions in orbit, and then landed back on kerbal very smoothly. Only capsule left, no damage, kerbal alive... But now I cannot end the flight, i will bite my ass when I loose this progress.... What I tried : I cannot click the \u0022recover button\u0022 or the \u0022spacecenter\u0022 button above the alt-meter... Everytime I do, I just get the \u0022no target\u0022 message. Also, when I hit ESC, I cannot \u0022end flight\u0022 (that option isn\u0027t even in the list) and I cannot go back to space center, I can only revert, which would be really unfair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe related : \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI landed very far away from my base, probably on the other side of the planet (in a big desert)... And I haven\u0027t actived the action (order) that allows recovery from far away... Is that the problem ? Yet still I should be able to end the flight and loose the kerbal itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know what is wrong ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T09:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022starman001\u0022 data-cite=\u0022starman001\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst problem : In the space map I\u0027m unable to set a course...

This one is new to me. You might want to try quicksaving and quickloading (that sometimes fixes certain types of jams), HOWEVER, that might be dangerous.
