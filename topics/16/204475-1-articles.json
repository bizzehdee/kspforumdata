I had three \u0027new satellite to target orbit\u0027 missions active at once, one mostly on the ecliptic around Kerbin and two in polar orbit around the Mun. I launched one ridiculously well-fueled von braun style probe, and noticed that it satisfied all three \u0027build a new satellite\u0027 requirements. So, I hit the Kerbin orbit, got a complete, and then sent it on out to the mun, planning on hitting both of those polar orbits with it as well. I got it much closer than I ever had to get on previous missions and it just would not give me the \u0027reach target orbit within reasonable deviation\u0027 condition. Everything else was green. So, I shrugged it off, assuming the missions had some way of \u0027claiming\u0027 individual vessels. I launched two more probes for the mun, and each of them also satisfied both \u0027new satellite\u0027 conditions. I sent the first one to the same orbit I previously tried, still no worky. Sent the other to the other, and spent the last couple hours squirting bee farts this way and that to get my orbit just as perfect as I could, absolutely perfect to visual inspection and with my ap/pe each within 30 meters of the target in elevation and visually right on top of each other, to significantly greater accuracy than the smallest change possible to affect with one radial bee fart. Still no worky.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stamp20","CreatedById":202020,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-22T21:12:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the requested orbit retrograde?
