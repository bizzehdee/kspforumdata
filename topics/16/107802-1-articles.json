What ratios have you found to work since 1.0?"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T02:59:43Z","Content":"In 1.0.2 for spaceplanes, 1 rapier per 12-13t seems to be around the optimal point I\u0027ve found for heavy lifters. My orange tank SSTO lifter saved a LOT of fuel adding 2 engines and intakes to get under 13t per. Optimal lift ratio I\u0027m still not sure about, but I have had success with 1 unit of lift per 4-5 tons of mass. However, I have a sneaking suspicion that the optimal value for this may be as small and amount of lift as you can use and still control the plane and land."},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T04:13:44Z","Content":"Thanks."}]}
