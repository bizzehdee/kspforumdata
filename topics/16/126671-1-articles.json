But the auto switch only kicks in after thrust falls down to zero.

Altitude is speed in the bank; milk those\u00A0hyper-efficient airbreathers for as much height as you can. Keep the AoA low so you don\u0027t lose too much speed [1], but try to float up to the jet ceiling before lighting the fireworks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI normally switch over from jets to rockets just below 30,000m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[1] Low AoA while the engine is low-thrust, that is. Crank it up over Mach 4 while below 20,000m (careful with the heat), then pull into a sharp zoom climb to boost your apoapsis close to 30,000m. But then lower the nose back down to prograde and keep it there while you wait to reach 30,000m\u00A0and switchover to rocket mode. Pull the\u00A0nose back up to 45\u00B0 when the rockets start, flatten off at the top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T06:45:43Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 06:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
