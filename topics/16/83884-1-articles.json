I know quite well that this creates a torque on the rocket. Now, suppose I slap on enough control surfaces or SAS units to counteract this torque and keep the rocket pointed in one direction while I fire it. My question is this: Will this have any impact on efficiency? I can\u0027t visualize the free-body diagram of the forces and torques well enough to figure out if the whole force of thrust will act in the proper direction through the center of mass without losing any energy in the process (electric charge notwithstanding). I think it will work fine, but torque is one of those things I never really understood that well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-05T21:35:49Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2014 09:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by VoidPointer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T18:54:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, it will have no impact on efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLYoyLcdGPc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T19:11:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the control surfaces would have a tiny impact on efficiency, they have more drag when not edge-on to direction of airflow.

Then I quickloaded, activated the middle engine and burnt all fuel prograde. Resulting orbits were the same within reasonable accuracy - Apoapsis at 1931 vs 1937 km.
