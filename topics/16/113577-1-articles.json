I know how to calculate the Dv, mostly.. Esp. with the help of charts... and I know how to rendezvous with a target. \n\nBut STILL... I can\u0027t seem to get to Pol without burning WAY more DV than I find in the online charts. Like 4k to line up with it even upon approach to Jool.\n\nHere\u0027s the frustrating thing: I know what I\u0027m doing, sort of. I have Mechjeb, and I\u0027m not afraid to use it. But even with my own knowledge of rendezvous strategy, and using Mechjeb\u0027s \u0022fine tune to 20 KM to target\u0022 etc, etc, etc ....I STILL can\u0027t get lined up.\n\nWhat are some good tactics for hitting Jool\u0027s moons, or any kinda thing in that realm? Here\u0027s what I know, so no need to repeat it:\n\nUse Porkchop transfer from Mechjeb to find the right date and angle to get to Jool.\n\nOnce you\u0027re on the way, check your encounter- the sooner you make changes the better, fuel-wise.\n\nIf you make it into Jool orbit, you can treat Pol like a \u0022target\u0022 and sync up your AN\u0027s / i.e. your respective inclinations... but even at this point this may be prohibitive.\n\nSo I guess here\u0027s the question: You\u0027re approaching Jool. What\u0027s the most DV efficient way to land on it\u0027s moons? How do you decide whether Aerobraking is a good plan for you or not, etc?"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T07:32:35Z","Content":"Aerobreak at 198km-195km jool atmosphere depending on your ship design and get into very high jool orbit. After that transfer to high jool moons should be very easy. You can always aerobreak at Laythe atmosphere which will cost you less dV in the end since you will be in a higher orbit than jool aerobreak."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPropelledGiraffe","CreatedById":143863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T09:23:27Z","Content":"Always consider gravity assists on Jool\u0027s moons be captured to a high Jool orbit. It will save you a lot of Delta-v, it is far less dangerous and more predictable than aerobreaking, plus it can also do the necessary inclination changes for cheap.\n\nAdditionally: Bouncing about Jool\u0027s moons is one of the most enjoyable things in KSP, but maybe that\u0027s just me.![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T11:27:06Z","Content":"Hello,\n\njust in case you didn\u0027t do it already: Make sure you enter the Jool system PROGRADE (counterclockwise), so you don\u0027t fly the other way round Jool than all the moons. If you can hit it in the first run, don\u0027t aerobrake at Jool but at Laythe. Much safer. As for Pol, treat it like Minimus. Pol won\u0027t help you much with it\u0027s gravity (because there isn\u0027t much), so try to encounter it at your Jool orbit apoapsis where you are as slow as possible.\n\nAs for the porkchop: Are you sure you selected the minimum Delta V option?"},{"CreatedByName":"cwalrus","CreatedById":146367,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T18:11:02Z","Content":"See these are great answers - which leads me to ask, HOW do you know this??

But practice with a maneuver node really is the best way.\n\nMake a node somewhere in a stable, slightly elliptical orbit. set a maneuver node somewhere (doesn\u0027t actually matter where). You\u0027ll need to do this at a few points.\n\nNow start adjusting the different nobs on the burn, and see what it does to your orbit. Recreate the node after each change, so it\u0027s setting from 0 each time.\n\nWith practice, you\u0027ll get to see that burning prograde at a point, raises the opposite side of the orbit (and may move apo/peri apses).\n\nRadial/anti-radial twist the orbit around the body being orbited, \n\nand normal/anti-normal change plane.\n\nFor efficiency, there are three things to remember: Aerobraking, gravity brake/boost, and transfer windows.\n\nJust like in the main system, there are transfer windows between jool\u0027s moons. For exactly the same reasons."},{"CreatedByName":"cwalrus","CreatedById":146367,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T19:10:47Z","Content":"Awesome answers - I knew what the different handles on the nodes do, but pointing out that there are transfer windows b/w Jool\u0027s moons points me in the right direction...!"},{"CreatedByName":"Lelitu","CreatedById":146287,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T22:55:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Awesome answers - I knew what the different handles on the nodes do, but pointing out that there are transfer windows b/w Jool\u0027s moons points me in the right direction...!\n\nAs far as getting around jool goes, it\u0027s the kerbol system in miniature\n\nand fortunately for all of us, without recursion."}]}
