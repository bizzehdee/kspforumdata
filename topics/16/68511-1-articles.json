Is it possible to adjust node location in similar fashion?

If there\u0027s a way to adjust the position, I don\u0027t know what it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see the delta-V of any closed maneuver node by mousing over it. This is not a new feature, but a lot of people don\u0027t know about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two small icons (which appear any time you right-click on a node, not just after you\u0027ve passed it) are to move the node ahead or behind by one full orbit. The main use I can think of is rendezvous, orbital transfers, or other maneuvers where timing is important. In the old KSP, you had to wait until the last orbit before a burn to set up a maneuver node, which was kind of annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third new feature isn\u0027t a maneuver node upgrade, per se, but that\u0027s when you\u0027ll normally be using it. If you click on any planet\u0027s orbit you\u0027ll get a new option, \u0022Focus View\u0022. This will center the map on that planet and show you your trajectory (with and without maneuver nodes) relative to that planet\u0027s SoI. Very useful for planning gravity assists, dodging moons, getting a specific inclination, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-07T07:02:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2014 07:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starstrider42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EZzzzz...\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xub313","CreatedById":57408,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T06:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother useful feature is the ability to view maneuver nodes in the Tracking Station. Just target the craft with the corresponding maneuver node in the tracking station and the press TAB until the camera focuses on the node.
