It is the key to success around here. Usually, a normal launch from Kerbin will use around 4500m/s of delta V, so you really want to plan your launch vehicle with at least that amount of fuel. Then you can sum up the delta V left in your ship and compare it to a delta V map and see if you have enough to go where you wanna go or if you need more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ultrarascal","CreatedById":74481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T21:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo as long as I have 4,500ish delta V and all my stages are 1.0\u002B TWR my little guys should regularly be making it to orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T21:29:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDelta-V is the name of the game (or at least it would be if KSP didn\u0027t sound cooler or at least like the name of a fried chicken chain). You need on average 4,550 m/s of available delta-V just to reach a 100k orbit. How much fuel that equates to is going to depend on a) the mass of your payload and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E the \u003Cem\u003Especific impulse\u003C/em\u003E of your engines. And the equation you use - the Tsiokolvsky Rocket Equation - has got one of those nasty-looking natural logarithms in it. It goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelta-V = ln(M/Md) * 9.81 m/s^2 * Isp, where:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EM = total mass of the rocket\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMd = dry mass of the rocket (your rocket\u0027s mass after its fuel tanks are empty)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp = Specific Impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I plan missions, I usually assume the 1 atmosphere specific impulse of my rockets (i.e. when they are least efficient). Isp will increase as you enter space (i.e. your rockets will become more efficient), so it helps to use this planning value. On average, liquid fuel rockets in KSP have an Isp of about 290s on the ground (some more, some less, some a good deal more or less). Plug that figure into the equation and solve it for 4,550 m/s, and it turns out you want your mass ratio to be about 5:1. So figure out the mass of what you want to put into orbit (easiest way to do this stock is to just put the payload out on the launch pad without any booster elements, switch over to the map view and call up the info window) and then plan to put about five times as much mass into the booster. Bear in mind that only fuel tanks are going to affect that 5:1 ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux (KER) or Mechjeb will do all the math for you if you\u0027re into mods.

Accelerate too slowly, and gravity will cause you to burn excess fuel to achieve orbit. Accelerate too quickly and atmospheric drag will cause excessive fuel usage for the first 20,000 or so meters. Engine efficiency as well as their power to weight ratio also affects orbital payload. Locking gimbals on outboard engines also increases efficiency as well as reduces shaking. Hit that right rate of acceleration and you will easily achieve that 5 to 1 payload ratio for orbit. 451 ton launch weight on my one Apollo design placed 51 tons into a low Mun orbit using onion staging, quad LV-30s on the onion stage, and quad LV45 for the center second stage in place of 7 Mainsails.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-16T21:58:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2013 09:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T22:58:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kerbal-engineer-redux-v0-5/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/a\u003E does a pretty good job on showing you the exact Delta-v you have, for any body in the system.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T23:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blizzy78\u0022 data-cite=\u0022blizzy78\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kerbal-engineer-redux-v0-5/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/a\u003E does a pretty good job on showing you the exact Delta-v you have, for any body in the system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelta-v doesn\u0027t vary by body, except in how the atmosphere affects the ISP.
