My first one using Mk3 parts, mind you. Getting into orbit went normally. As usual when flying a spaceplane, I only used pitch control all the way up, never had to turn (pitch nor yaw). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen reentering I overshot the KSC and that\u0027s when the problems started. As I tried to turn around, the plane promptly entered a flat spin. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m pretty sure my COM was in front of my COL because RCS Build Aid said so in the VAB, plus I put a small fuel tank right behind the cockpit and pumped all my remaining fuel into it for this very reason (why can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t we have a COM and COL overlay in-flight?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I turned on the aero forces overlay to investigate and discovered that every time I bank, the light blue arrows indicating body lift shift from pointing upwards (relative to the plane) to pointing sideways, parallel to the wings, in the opposite direction of my bank. I was able to somewhat remedy this by giving it a little rudder in the same direction of the bank, which would cause the light blue arrows to shift back to pointing upwards (still relative to the plane). Needless to say, keeping the arrows pointing upwards was real finicky, requiring very precise rudder input which neither I or the SAS module could manage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know a proper turn in a real aircraft requires a bit of rudder in the direction you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re banking but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve never had to do that in KSP before (normally just bank and pitch up to turn). In fact I very rarely even touch the rudder when flying a plane in KSP. And having the body lift arrows shifting around the longitudinal axis of the plane because of rudder input makes no sense to me. Note that I was doing a reasonable bank considering the size of this plane, not banking 90 degrees or anywhere near that, so it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not a matter of the body lift keeping pointed up relative to the surface of Kerbin while I banked, they were pointing sideways relative to the plane, parallel to the wings as I mentioned before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone seen this before?

What\u0027s happening is you have a lot of sideslip in the wrong direction. The plane is flying crooked with the side of the plane exposed to the airflow and that\u0027s causing the sideways body lift. Look at your navball. You can see it yawing away from the turn a lot. You definitely don\u0027t have enough of a rudder. Try a larger rudder (like a large delta wing with control surfaces) and put it as far back as you can. That should prevent the sideslip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T22:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust use the same part as the horizontal stabilizers.

You should have a vertical empennage to weathervane the fuselage into the wind, but active rudders only confuse the SAS. When you bank, the active rudder wants to resist changing heading when it\u0027s supposed to allow the turn. It dials in more and more cross- control trying to hold heading until you\u0027re side slipping and something like this happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You don\u0027t need active rudders in KSP.
