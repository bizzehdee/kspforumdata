Then go to map view, click on the target planet, and choose \u0022Focus View\u0022. It will now focus there *and will render your trajectory relative to the planet*, so you can see what your approach will look like.\n\nNow, while focused on the planet, rotate the camera around so you can see the maneuver node you just dropped. You can see it an manipulate it, even though it\u0027s not in the SoI of the planet you\u0027re focused on. You can fiddle with the drag handles (very gently!) to adjust your periapsis around the planet so that it is over the N or S pole.\n\nIf you do it when you\u0027re still way out in interplanetary space, rather than waiting until you\u0027re in the target planet\u0027s SoI, you can generally accomplish what you need to do with only microscopic adjustments, like a couple of m/s."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T13:06:44Z","Content":"Technically, you can adjust the interplanetary burn (or mid-course correction burn) in such a way that your injection trajectory will be close to 90 degree inclination. I did that a couple of times with MJ (maneuver node editor - conics mode 0).

Tiny burns from a very long way away can be an exercise in frustration, as they require extreme precision in both the burn vector and duration. That said, if you need 0.1 m/s precision on a very small burn, my tip of the day is to temporarily set your thrust limiter to 5% for the burn, effectively giving you 20x the precision and subtlety on your throttle (assuming that 100% thrust is a moderate to high TWR)."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T14:06:44Z","Content":"As others I usually use Precise Node Editor (dedicated mod of MJ\u0027s one) and focus on the body. I usually do that to get a better equatorial orbit, but polar are the same.\n\nOf course, if you can\u0027t do that way, the farther you are from the body the lower the dV requirement of changing to polar orbit. So capture on a very elongated elipse an change inclination at apoapsis. \n\nBut mid course interplanetary tweaks are much cheaper."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPropelledGiraffe","CreatedById":143863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T14:22:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Personally, unless fuel is really tight, I wait until the target SoI to pick orbit, making the adjustment immediately after entering the SoI.

You can do very precise maneuvering and if you overshoot the maneuver you can just thrust retrograde to correct the error. \n\nThat way there is no need to change the craft attitude for a correction."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T14:49:19Z","Content":"I remember that I made a plane inclination change around Laythe with RCS.

Shooting around Tylo and Jool to get your inclined orbit around Laythe is really satisfying...![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T15:36:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketPropelledGiraffe**\n  \ninserted quote for reference"}]}
