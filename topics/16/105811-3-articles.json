Whatever you have available so far in the tech tree you need to throw on there. Oh, and an antenna and plenty of power. \n\u003E \n\u003E Then you need a couple of scientists in there. Not sure this is totally necessary but I think the better the scientist the more science you\u0027ll get. \n\u003E \n\u003E Launch it. \n\u003E \n\u003E Now you run an experiment and make sure you choose to Process in Lab Module (the bubbling yellow flask). You should see after it finishes in the MPL that the Data has increased depending on how much science you got from running the experiment; not much at the launchpad, more on the Mun. You will also have some Rate of sci/day now, which is the important bit, its what you are trying to get high. \n\u003E \n\u003E You repeat this for all the experiments, max 6, one of each type. \n\u003E \n\u003E You will then have a up to 500 Data depending on how many experiments you used, how good the science was (have you already done all the science before at this location?) and the quality of your scientists. \n\u003E \n\u003E Hit Start Research and your Science will start to go up. Whenever you like can Transmit Science. \n\u003E \n\u003E If you leave it too long and Science maxes out at 500 then anymore will be lost. So be sure to check in regularly. \n\u003E \n\u003E Or something like that.\n\nThis is close but it\u0027s also way off. The science lab vehicle or base itself doesn\u0027t have to actually have \\*any\\* experiment modules on it. It just needs to have the result of other experiments brought to it. For example, let\u0027s say I sent a science mun lander to the mun and did a mystery goo and materials research experiment. Now, normally, I\u0027d then either transmit that data to kerbin or I\u0027d bring it back to kerbin and gain its benefit when I recovered the craft. Now I have a \\*third\\* option. I can bring it back to a science lab. In the example above, on my way back to kerbin, I\u0027d have my lander dock with say, my orbiting science station, then I\u0027d have scientists remove the results of the experiments and carry them into the science lab module. Now those experiments reside in the lab, and I can now activate \u0022start research\u0022 on the lab. It will now, over time produce research steadily. \n\nThe net result of this will be research that trickles in slower than I\u0027d normally get, but the final amount will be far larger than it would normally be. I haven\u0027t managed to successfully test how much more research a mobile lab gets you, nor have I determined if a lab in orbit or on another planet actually gives better multiplication than one on the surface of kerbin, but I believe I remember hearing this is the case.\n\nOne other thing you might be wondering: why not just build a stationary laboratory somewhere on kerbin, maybe even just outside the launch center, and bring my experiments back to that? Well, indeed you can do that! Just remember, it\u0027s still much harder, because you\u0027ll have to actually land near it and have a kerbal cart the experiments over to it. It can be quite difficult to land a lander close enough to KSC to make this feasible.

A surface sample worth ~200 science gives something like 450 data. That data is then used up generating more science (generating 1 science seems to use up like 1/4 of a data point), and how fast you convert data to science depends on.. well, I\u0027ve no idea. Some of my stations convert at a rate of like .03 science a day and others .3 science a day. The number and level of my scientists inside don\u0027t seem to make a difference. It seems like the higher the science value of the celestial body your orbiting or landed on, the faster your science is generated.\n\u003E Basically - mobile labs can quadruple the science you get from all sources, and you don\u0027t have to recover them or anything. You just have to set one up and fast forward a year or so to get a giant chunk of science. They give so much science that I haven\u0027t even been bothering to recover anything, I just let the lab examine it and then throw whatever it was in the trash while they transmit the results back to me."},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T18:46:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is close but it\u0027s also way off.

After doing the above and pushing the various buttons, yes I knew how to start the thing running, but I had no clue whatsoever as to what was governing the actual science output. \n\nI just tried it out, and even moving different Kerbal types with different professions in and out of the lab on my above pictured base doesn\u0027t change the amount of science the thing says it will generate. I assume that\u0027s because they\u0027re still within the same vehicle, but stuff like that can quickly lead to someone believing it has no impact at all.\n\nThere\u0027s been a laundry list of rules and sub-rules listed in this thread. I have no idea how someone is expected to figure them out on their own, especially if they are relatively new to the game.\n\nEDIT: Also worth noting is that I just discovered the thing can process science while in the background (like if you\u0027re operating another vessel or at the space center) but requires no electric charge to do so, leading down a highway to exploit-town.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T22:08:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"},{"CreatedByName":"hatterson","CreatedById":107383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T00:06:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, by having a potentially (with sufficient effort) science pool, more options for this currency are opened up for modders.\n\nIf a modder wishes to take a finite system and use it in an infinite manner, shouldn\u0027t it be their responsibility to implement a way to expand that system?\n\nI\u0027m not at all opposed to a system like this where a science lab is used to do actual research as opposed to simply increasing transmit value, but making the science system infinite seems to be a solution in search of a problem, especially given that it already was infinite via asteroids, contracts, and strategies."},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusF","CreatedById":142152,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T03:08:42Z","Content":"But something seems to be wrong about the amount of science created per day.

Should have gotten 15 science then, and the 4 Kerbal \u0022days\u0022 per day doesn\u0027t really account for getting 20 times that. I can\u0027t be certain of those numbers though as it\u0027s all from memory other than my current output rate.\n\nEDIT 2: Maybe the science output rate displayed is actually the data processing rate in Kerbal days? A 5X data to science modifier was mentioned earlier in the thread, and in combination with the 4X Kerbal \u0022days\u0022, that would add up to a 20X multipler per earth day.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T03:16:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 03:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T03:18:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So you immediately understood how your location was affecting the ratio of science to data?

Its perfectly logical that higher level scientists would make more science, or that a science lab would need to be staffed by scientists and that the location of the lab would effect the research its doing. Its a great system because its in line with common sense of how you would imagine things to work.
