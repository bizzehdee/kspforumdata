I had the demo on steam ,then i bought the full game on steam in August. It deleted the demo. Is there a way to download the demo without deleting the full game? Should i keep the full game on steam and get the demo from the website? Will it run any slower? Not very important issue, but i just want to bring back memories from the demo days. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T14:19:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have my main full game on the steam install. As you mentioned it overwrote my demo installation. I did exactly what you suggested, picked up the demo from the website and keep it as a seperate install. I had to use similar techniques in order to have multiple copies of KSP. I generally have my main steam install being completely unmodded and always kept up-to-date. I then have cloned copies all over the place with differing mod loadouts and even differing versions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour demo as grabbed from the site shouldnt perform any differantly to the steam install. It is worth noting however that as updates bring code optimisations the main game may well eventually speed up relative to the demo, which is a frozen snapshot of an older game version\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T14:23:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, you\u0027re saying as long as i do it on the main site, i can just hit the download button, and do no coding or backing up, and get the demo without deleting the full game?

You can run it anywhere, even off a thumb drive. Likewise, you can run different versions of KSP on your computer as they are also standalone versions. In fact, to be on the safe side, copy KSP from your Steam folder to another location such as a Games folder, create a desktop icon and use that to test add ons. All the screen settings are stored in the registry so they will apply to the copies when you run them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are allowed to install the game to other computers that you own.
