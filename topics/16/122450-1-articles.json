I usually stop at a 90x150km orbit (atmosphere is 130km high in RSS) because I like to let my booster stages fall back to Earth instead of leaving space junk, but if the final stage has already been dropped, I circularise in one burn, and end up with a roughly circular orbit around 150-180km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that this is so because you need really high orbital velocities in RSS (7.7km/s), and therefore spend much more time burning horizontally. The thing is, if you built your launcher correctly, most of this horizontal burn occurs close to your final orbit height (0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch at around 100km for me) and finishes when you are outside atmosphere. That way, you spend a lot of time with precise control of both your apo height and time to apo, while being really close to it during the whole process (between 1 and 2 min, with an orbital period of 90min): when you finish your burn, you are close to your apoapsis height, and therefore can rise your periapsis to above the ground before the apoapsis starts to drift off in front of you. Then, point a little towards the ground, and you can circularise in one burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do it well, you can do everything at 100% throttle (real engines don\u0027t throttle down a lot), though it is a lot less precise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn stock KSP, as the speeds are lower, you often end up reaching orbital speed way before being at your orbit height, and therefore it is less easy to circularise in one burn, but still very doable with some practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T17:52:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn real life, the ratio of total dV needed vs gravity, is much higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we had to accelerate to ~8km/sec to attain orbit, it would be easier to get it in one go, since you\u0027ll be burning nearly all the way to Apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere if you burn all the way to apoapsis, you\u0027ve way overshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you need a very powerful engine to fight against 1g, but then it would need to be throttled way back to have torbital velocity attained as you\u0027re nearly at Ap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA solution that works in game is a powerful first stage to send your apoapsis high, and then a weak 2nd stage so you spend the whole time to apoapsis burning horizontally.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T06:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELow TWR upper stage should do it if you don\u0027t give too massive a bump with lower stages.
