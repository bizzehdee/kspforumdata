it\u0027ll be slow to turn, but it will turn. \u00A0Second, this means avoiding the problem that got you into this mess in the first place, so I\u0027d suggest having an FL-T100 or ROUND-8 tank in your last engine stage, but with the tank locked so that you won\u0027t accidentally use up the fuel until you unlock it. \u00A0A low-mass rescue rocket should be able to reenter from any low Kerbin orbit\u00A0on the contents of a ROUND-8, but the FL-T100 has the benefit of being the same diameter as the Terrier and the Mk. I capsule. \u00A0Do that until you are comfortable with the idea of leaving a de-orbiting reserve, and then you can take out that tank--and if you forget and strand that crew, you\u0027ll know how to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, pick\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0pilot who is in a good, near-circular orbit close to Kerbin, and rescue that one. \u00A0Rendezvous with that pilot\u0027s capsule, set relative velocity to zero (or near-zero; it doesn\u0027t have to be perfect as you won\u0027t be staying for long), and EVA the pilot over to the rescue ship. \u00A0De-orbit the rescue ship and now you\u0027ve got a pilot. \u00A0Do this a few times. \u00A0You may be tempted to put together some kind of massive rescue mission that will save everybody at once, but don\u0027t do it! \u00A0You need to practise bringing one pilot home before you can get on to bringing all of them home. \u00A0Additionally, if you\u0027ve got your stranded ships on eccentric orbits, do your de-orbit burn at the \u003Cem\u003Eapoapsis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0as this will take less fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe sure to check your rescue rocket before launch;

it would be nice to use some of them more than once, especially after you\u0027ve hired a number of them and\u00A0hiring new staff becomes stupidly expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout knowing what kinds of missions you\u0027re trying to fly, I can\u0027t say much about your flying skills and how they are contributing to this, but even if you\u0027re a terrible orbital pilot,\u00A0I will say that the root of your problem here is resource management. \u00A0Obviously, you have the basics well-in-hand and can reliably fly a rocket to orbit (otherwise, you wouldn\u0027t have been able to strand\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eevery single one\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of your pilots in space), which means you probably have a good grasp, or can get a good grasp, on how to get back down again. \u00A0What\u0027s happening instead is that you\u0027re not taking enough rocket to orbit to manage efficient in-orbit burns, and you\u0027re not keeping an eye on the fuel gauge, either. \u00A0Knowing how much fuel you need to de-orbit and return to Kerbin is critical, and so is cultivating the ability to say, \u0027I need to re-think this,\u0027 scrap the mission, and get home while you still have the fuel to do so (especially if you\u0027ve saved and reloaded, which means \u0027Revert Flight\u0027 won\u0027t work).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this, I say that you should take an empty probe-controlled rocket\u00A0and fly it manually. \u00A0You may\u00A0need an antenna to keep a link to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (and thus be able to use nodes) and a bottom-tier probe core with Stability Assist would be nice (so no Stayputnik), but this is perfectly doable. \u00A0Good rocket design will give you something that can reliably make orbit with a little nudge right off the pad (of about three to five degrees prograde) and no further control input from you except to touch the throttle. \u00A0Designs for these kinds of rockets are all over\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbalX\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0but you\u0027ll get more out of it if you try it yourself--also, I don\u0027t know what tech you have unlocked, so there\u0027s no guarantee that someone else\u0027s design is something that you can even use. \u00A0Besides, given that you can reliably make orbit, this is a valid\u00A0next step in developing your skill set. \u00A0\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGo for tall, thin rockets with fins at the bottom and with fuel flow figured so that it drains from the bottom up--you want the mass to concentrate in the tip and the drag to concentrate at the base. \u00A0Try one, and if it doesn\u0027t make orbit, revert, redesign, and try again.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, you need to be certain that once in orbit, you can accomplish a rescue, so that means adequate fuel. \u00A0First, this means efficiently using what you have, so take out any monopropellant--you won\u0027t need it. \u00A0Rescue in this case means rendezvous, not docking, and you can accomplish that with a Terrier and thrust limiters. \u00A0Don\u0027t take science parts, and you likely won\u0027t need more than a single OX-Stat solar panel and one small battery for power. \u00A0Take out half the ablator from the heat shield to start and be ready to\u00A0take\u00A0more--you may not even need a heat shield at all, if you\u0027re careful. \u00A0Keep the orbital stage short and you can use the capsule\u0027s reaction wheels; it\u0027ll be slow to turn, but it will turn. \u00A0Second, this means avoiding the problem that got you into this mess in the first place, so I\u0027d suggest having an FL-T100 or ROUND-8 tank in your last engine stage, but with the tank locked so that you won\u0027t accidentally use up the fuel until you unlock it. \u00A0A low-mass rescue rocket should be able to reenter from any low Kerbin orbit\u00A0on the contents of a ROUND-8, but the FL-T100 has the benefit of being the same diameter as the Terrier and the Mk. I capsule. \u00A0Do that until you are comfortable with the idea of leaving a de-orbiting reserve, and then you can take out that tank--and if you forget and strand that crew, you\u0027ll know how to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, pick\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0pilot who is in a good, near-circular orbit close to Kerbin, and rescue that one. \u00A0Rendezvous with that pilot\u0027s capsule, set relative velocity to zero (or near-zero; it doesn\u0027t have to be perfect as you won\u0027t be staying for long), and EVA the pilot over to the rescue ship. \u00A0De-orbit the rescue ship and now you\u0027ve got a pilot. \u00A0Do this a few times. \u00A0You may be tempted to put together some kind of massive rescue mission that will save everybody at once, but don\u0027t do it! \u00A0You need to practise bringing one pilot home before you can get on to bringing all of them home. \u00A0Additionally, if you\u0027ve got your stranded ships on eccentric orbits, do your de-orbit burn at the \u003Cem\u003Eapoapsis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0as this will take less fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe sure to check your rescue rocket before launch; the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E likes to auto-crew your rockets and that is a problem if you need a free seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.: \u00A0This all assumes that you\u0027re stuck in Kerbin orbit. \u00A0If you\u0027ve managed to throw your pilots into solar orbit, you may be better off starting with a clean\u00A0slate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do you make fuel drain from the bottom up?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThx\u003Cbr\u003E\njonpfl\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ManEatingApe","CreatedById":151354,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-26T12:48:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n...in regards to Macbert, what did I do wrong when building ship? \u00A0How would I lower the\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither stick something heavy on the end you want to point forward (usually a heatshield or engine) or better yet add some fins to the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(You can check \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E when you\u0027re assembling a craft)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor something as small as your pod a pair of basic fins should be enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want it to resemble a dart -
