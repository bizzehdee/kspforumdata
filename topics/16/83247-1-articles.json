Can anyone tell me if there is a trick to connecting structural panels, because I just can\u0027t seem to figure it out. They have a green connection marker in the center, but they only ever want to connect to the edge. Which is fine, but why show a connection marker in the center when nothing will ever connect there? But what really drives me crazy is that no matter how hard I try, I can NEVER get one structural panel to connect to another without it being a little bit off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I just can\u0027t accept that.

You can actually get them to attach in the center (to either make a stack of panels or attach other inline parts to them), which seems to work better for me if you view the panel you\u0027re trying to attach to edge-on in the VAB/SPH. Attaching them edge-to-edge with any degree of precision is even harder, and while I have managed to make a few of them connect nicely, I can only conclude that those monstrosities you see people make out of them must have required some combination of witchcraft, thaumaturgy, or reality bending, not to mention a mad mad gaming box to run that smoothly with a ship with a part count that high. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice is to set your mouse sensitivity a little lower and play around with the WASD keys in the VAB a bit more (as well as viewing the target part from different angles) to see if you can get anything to meet up nicely.

Pick up the panel, rotate it the right way to stick to the node, and approach the node with mouse carefully without pointing at any parts till it snaps to the node. By carefully moving your mouse away/towards the node you can affect which of the two points will be used - a lot of time it tries to clip the panel into the ship and attach the opposite node which you usually don\u0027t want to do. Moving the mouse by approximately width of the panel you can switch to the other node. It can be a little easier if you can zoom in to the node until the width of the attached panel becomes substantial. Another option is to put the panel on some clear node first, attach the long I-beam to it, tear it off the node together with the I-beam and then place it by that I-beam. A little more work but since such part has just one attach node it is given which one will be used. It also gives you longer handle by which you can manipulate the panel without pointing at any parts of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M4ck","CreatedById":74138,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T08:49:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you use Editor Extensions, vertical snap lets you place them co-planar, so they are flat against each other, with no vertical offset.
