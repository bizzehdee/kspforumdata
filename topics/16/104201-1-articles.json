The two encounter limit is there because of the whole floating point error thing and the third encounter is likely to be so far off that the accuracy would be questionable. In the case of the Kerbol system, a third encounter would likely be many years off.\n\nAs for the orbit stopping after a single encounter, that\u0027s because you\u0027re on a collision course, usually."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T20:28:33Z","Content":"KSP uses patched conics to project future trajetories and encounters. I don\u0027t know the math or whatever behind it but one problem with this system is that the further you go into the future, the less precise it becomes.\n\nIn the settings.cfg file in your ksp root directory there are two lines reading Conic\\_Patch\\_Draw\\_Mode and Conic\\_Patch\\_Limit.
