So far so good. But how do I do it to map the entire planet? So far it only maps one stripe. And if I change the inclination (Nml\u002B on MechJeb) There will be some sinus wave, but still it will pass over the same spots. How do I map everything without constantly changing my orbit (thus, applying thrust)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T18:19:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sinus wave will move as the Mun rotates, covering everything on those latitudes. The usual tactic is to go for a polar orbit and let the Mun rotate under you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T18:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to map an entire world without having to change your orbital inclination, put the mapper in a polar orbit, and let it run. There will be overlap; that\u0027s completely unavoidable. For some objects, (especially the ones that rotate swiftly) it will require that you keep mapping for several revolutions for full coverage. Mapsat can map at up to 50x time acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho rotates slow enough that a polar orbit will get everything in half a revolution (which will take about 12 hours of play time at 50x). When mapping the other bodies in my game though I started with a polar orbit, and let the object rotate underneath for two revolutions or so. I then looked at the latitude of the highest unmapped region, and burned to set my orbital inclination at that value, and did a few more revolutions that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"angeldust","CreatedById":49069,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T22:24:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you ever so much, everything worked just fine!
