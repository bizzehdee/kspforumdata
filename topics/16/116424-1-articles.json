You\u0027ll want to reinstall KSP, either by having Steam verify the local game cache, or by reinstalling from your store download.\n\nI don\u0027t recall if Squad did any reshuffling between 1.0 and 1.0.4 (or, for that matter, between 0.90 and 1.0), but if they did and the part definition got moved, thus confusing your old ship designs, then I think you\u0027ll need to reconstruct them. Think of it as an opportunity to improve on the originals."},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T11:13:21Z","Content":"Validating the local game cache in Steam fixed the problem.
