to do all of your burn from low Kerbin orbit: one single big kick that sends you to your destination, with at most a small mid-course correction burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are tools to help plan for that; my favorite is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz\u003C/a\u003E. Just tell it where you\u0027re going from, where you\u0027re going to, and the altitude of your parking orbit at the source; it will tell you when, how much, and in what direction to burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven without such a tool, though, you can just play around with the maneuver nodes. \u0022Here I am in Kerbin orbit and I want to go to Duna\u0022-- drag a node to get something that you think might work, see where the intersect markers are, and fiddle with it until you get an alignment. Note that one of the ways you can edit a maneuver node is to drag the node itself forward and backward along your trajectory, by grabbing the circle in the center. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Handy to know, and not all that discoverable.

There are three strategies there:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. To heck with Oberth, just do a long burn. Conceptually simple, but it loses much of the Isp benefit from the nukes, and also makes maneuver planning harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Have an initial eject-from-orbit stage that uses something powerful to give you a kick. This is the strategy that KerikBalm mentions (using a Rhino for that initial wallop).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Periapsis kicking, as KerikBalm and Red Iron Crown mention. Don\u0027t eject in one burn: do a burn that boosts your apoapsis up a bit, coast back around to periapsis and do another burn, and repeat until you\u0027ve gotten your apoapsis up to around the Mun\u0027s orbit or thereabouts. Then do a final big burn at periapsis to go on your way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-19T15:37:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2015 03:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Melonfish","CreatedById":90990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T08:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBrilliant cheers guys, i\u0027m going to have a go at these tonight, I get the Idea behind raising the periapsis/apoapsis in increments and I like it, makes using Nukes much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027ll post results \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
