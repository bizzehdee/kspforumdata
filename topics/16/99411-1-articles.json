I have a station in mun orbit consisting of 2 permanent parts and currently 2 landers docked to it all in one line in this configuration:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E engine - command module - lander - lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth landers already had some missions on mun including successful undocking and re-docking. The engine and command module are connected for quite a while, actually the station was built connected to my kerbin station and then undocked and launched from there. Suddenly (after a supply visit from my \u0022taxi\u0022 on another sideways docking port on the command module) I realized the docking ports got messed up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually when I dock a small ship to a large one, the game decides which one to keep as for the name and so on, I guess the larger one. And then usually the docking port on the smaller ships side says \u0022undock\u0022 and on the \u0022mothership\u0022 side it doesn\u0027t say \u0022undock\u0022 but \u0022decouple\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy station now has this behaviour only between the two landers, and I can undock the outermost one. The other two links say \u0022undock\u0022 on the command module side (which I consider the wrong one) and no option (besides \u0022crossfeed\u0022, \u0022control from here\u0022 and \u0022rename port\u0022) on the outer sides. And when I click \u0022undock\u0022 this button gets erased but nothing happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried switching to another ship and back, to KSC and back, reload quicksave, quit game and restart, no change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a backup of my quicksave and edited any line that belongs to that vessel to say \u0022... PART { ... MODULE { ... EVENTS { Undock { active = True ...\u0022 which was \u0022False\u0022 before. But reloading the changed one also didn\u0027t change anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMythos\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S: Can someone give me a hint, how to deactivate automatic spelling correction in this forum input box?

I also see that the unshielded port is the (same vessel) port, what fits to it being on the stations cmd and the shielded one being on the lander and thereby the (dockee). Also that fits to the way I\u0027ve built them, both were connected on top of the root part during the building process, which was the 3-kerbal cmd in both cases. So the parent in both cases is attN at the bottom, where the unshielded one\u0027s parent is in fact the root part of the whole station, which should be number 0. So far I understand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut both were built top-down and then connected at each one\u0027s top side. Each port is only attached to it\u0027s vessel by that \u0022attN = bottom, x\u0022 relationship, nothing else is connected to these docking ports besides that docking-link, that for now only struts but doesn\u0027t want do undock or decouple. So what would be the part number that I could use on both sides to be \u0022attN = top\u0022 and to transform that link into a \u0022state = PreAttached\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
