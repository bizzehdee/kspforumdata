Recently I discovered ksp.olex.biz, it says that you have to set a maneuver node to the target planet when the phase angle is x and your angle to prograde must be Y, question: Is there any way to get exactly X and Y in ksp vanilla?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T20:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recommend you using \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ealexmoon\u0027s calculator\u003C/a\u003E, it will tell you which day you need to start your transfer. Eyeballing the extraction angle is not that much of a problem. When setting up a maneuver, it is good to set up normal part of the vector first, then add the prograde part to the full maneuver dv. And then perform some adjustments to get the intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
