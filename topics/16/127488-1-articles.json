I can get a transfer but I run out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can get to Minmus, you can get to Duna.\u00A0 It\u0027s only about 100m/s more dV to get there.\u00A0 Coming back is a bit more tricky but there are a number of options there which I\u0027ll try to note briefly and leave the details for you to sleuth out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only difference between going to Mun and going to any other planet outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI is that you can\u0027t leave any day you want but need to wait for Kerbin and the target planet to align.\u00A0 You can, of course, go at other times but that can cost you insane amounts of dV so it\u0027s customary to wait for the transfer window, which is when the dV cost of the trip is lowest.\u00A0 To know when transfer windows happen, you need some tool that will tell you.\u00A0 These can be both in-game (mods like MJ and several others) and external (various web sites).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnowing when to go is just 1/2 the problem, however.\u00A0 You also need to know where to place the maneuver node for the transer burn in relation to Kerbin.\u00A0 If you look down on Kerbin from above in the map view, call 12 o\u0027clock the direction Kerbin is moving around the sun.\u00A0 Normally, if going to a planet further from the sun than Kerbin, your node needs to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 4-5 o\u0027clock.\u00A0 If you\u0027re going inwards from Kerbin, the node will usually be about 10-11 o\u0027clock.\u00A0 The same tools that tell you when transfer windows occur will also tell you where to put the node (or you can have MJ create the node for you).\u00A0 This is analogous to putting your node for the transfer burn to Mun at Munrise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut anyway, the node is set at the proper position on the proper day, and then you just burn it and you\u0027re on your way.\u00A0 You\u0027ll probably have to make a minor tweak somewhere en route once in solar orbit to fine-tune your approach to the target planet but otherwise it\u0027s no different than going to Mun.\u00A0 The burn will just take more dV than going to Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s getting there.\u00A0 Coming back is pretty much the same because that also needs a transfer window based on the relative positions of Kerbin and whichever planet you went to.\u00A0 This is a different positoin than was needed to get to the other planet and also requires the transfer burn node to be in a specific place relative to the planet you\u0027re now at.\u00A0 So again, you need the transfer window tools.\u00A0 The upshot of this is that normally you can\u0027t just go to another planet, do a fly-by, and comes straight home, but instead have to capture into orbit at the other planet and wait there for months until Kerbin\u0027s in the right place to transfer back to, even though you might have finished your mission within hours after arriving at the new planet.\u00A0 This means your ship needs enough fuel to 1) get to the other planet, 2) capture there, and 3) leave there and then do whatever maneuvers are necessary to set up for a safe landing at Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can probably do this with about 2000m/s in the tank before you leave Kerbin, but\u00A0until you\u00A0get the hang of this you might want to take 2500-3000.\u00A0 A lot depends on how much you need to burn to\u00A0capture back at Kerbin, which depends on how aggressively you can aerobrake in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and/or use Mun to gravity-brake you.\u00A0 Coming home from Duna means you\u0027ll hit Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere\u00A0somewhat faster than coming home from Minmus so the heat will be that much worse.\u00A0 It\u0027s quite possible that aerocapturing without a retro burn is impossible---if you go low enough in Kerbin\u0027s air to capture, you\u0027ll burn up, but if you\u0027re high enough to survive the aerobraking, you won\u0027t capture so will have to burn at least some.\u00A0 And it\u0027s also quite likely that gravity-braking off Mun won\u0027t capture you either.\u00A0 So it\u0027s a good idea to have enough fuel to capture with thrust alone, without aerobraking or gravity-braking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou CAN, however, do a Duna fly-by for less fuel than the above.\u00A0 But as always in KSP, less fuel equals more time.\u00A0 What you do is, when you get to Duna, pass on the left side of it instead of the right, which will gravity-brake you back down to Kerbin.\u00A0 The problem here is that this might require your Duna Pe to be too high to get the \u0022low orbit\u0022 biome.\u00A0 But the real thing is the time.\u00A0 Because you\u0027ll be leaving Duna outside a transfer window back to Kerbin, Kerbin won\u0027t be there when your ship crosses Kerbin\u0027s orbit.\u00A0 This means you\u0027ll have to make 1 or more solar orbits before you meet up with Kerbin, which means much more elapsed gametime to get the ship home than if you\u0027d captured at Duna and then waited for a transfer window.\u00A0 And you\u0027ll likely\u00A0also have to burn some to actually get an encounter with Kerbin at some point.\u00A0 Still, your ship won\u0027t need as much fuel because you don\u0027t need to capture or burn at Duna, and you won\u0027t hit Kerbin as fast as if you\u0027d left from Duna orbit after a wait, so you can save a bit more on capturing at Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T06:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy favorite orbital planner is http://ksp.olex.biz.
