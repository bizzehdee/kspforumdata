There are a couple ways to do this- one is simply by waiting until the two ships are at the right places\u00A0in their respective orbits. \u00A0For example, suppose you\u0027re in an orbit further from Kerbin and looking to rendezvous with a ship closer in. \u00A0The further-out ship takes longer to make one orbit. \u00A0So if the two ships are on opposite sides of the planet, just wait a few orbits and the closer-in, master-moving ship will \u0022catch up.\u0022 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne the ships are in approximately the right place, it\u0027s just a matter of fine-tuning - both by changing the maneuver itself, and moving the time you start it (i.e., dragging the node back and forth). \u00A0If you keep iterating, you should get to a point where the orbits are pretty close. \u00A0You can see the minimum distance between two ships by holding your mouse over the little \u00A0\u0022closest approach\u0022 arrows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, if your orbits are inclined, you can either (1) match planes beforehand by burning normal or antinormal at an ascending / descending node, or (2) put a normal/antinormal component into your rendezvous burn so that the ascending / descending note is right at your rendezvous point. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you get the basics down, the next challenge is to rendezvous so that the relative velocity between the two ships is as low as possible at the rendezvous point (meaning you\u0027ll use less delta-v matching speed). \u00A0This is generally accomplished by making sure the two orbits are tangent, rather than having one cross another. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne side-effect of all this stuff is that it\u0027s easiest to rendezvous\u00A0from two concentric, circular, plane-matched orbits. \u00A0It\u0027s easy to get a good tangent intercept by moving the manuever node back and forth to hit the right spot in time. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove all, though, it just takes a lot of practice, but will soon become second nature. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-02T17:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222658527\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022142980\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221467479912\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166055\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DaElite101\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n43 minutes ago, DaElite101 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, can you explain this in a simpler way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExplained in a simple way: imagine you\u0027re going to the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main difference is that if you\u0027re going to the Mun, you are starting in a very tight, fast origin orbit, and you are going to a very wide, slow destination orbit. Meanwhile, in a typical orbital rendezvous, your origin orbit and your destination orbit are going to be of similar speed and size. But in terms of what you must do, the two exercises are identical: first, make a burn so that you get an encounter (signifying that both you and your target are in the same location in space at the time of crossing orbits). Then, make a second burn at your encounter to \u0022capture\u0022. In a rendezvous, the \u0022capture\u0022 is actually the act of matching velocity with the target. It\u0027s still just one burn though, just like the capture burn at the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, when you go to the Mun, you are doing so at a specific \u0022alignment\u0022 - when the Mun is a certain angle ahead of you in its orbit. In a rendezvous too, you need to be in the right \u0022alignment\u0022, or you can burn however you want, you are not going to get an encounter/close approach. This is, oddly enough, where many newcomers fail. They think that the timing of a rendezvous burn is some sort of arcane magic, that they must learn something completely new, when nothing could be further from the truth. But fear not, there is a simply method to pull it off, and all you need is a single maneuver node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to make your job as easy as possible, make your rendezvous as similar to a flight to the Mun as possible. This means: make sure that your orbits aren\u0027t already crossing. Make sure that your own orbit is fully inside that of your target\u0027s - that your apoapsis is lower than your target\u0027s periapsis. Then, make sure that your inclination matches.

Since you\u0027re inside your target\u0027s orbit, it must be ahead of you, just like the Mun. But because your orbits are similar in size, it must be only a small distance ahead of you, \u003Cem\u003Eunlike\u003C/em\u003E the Mun. If the target is not a small distance ahead of you, just timewarping for a while will fix that, because you are in a tighter orbit and thus move faster.

Now, click and drag that maneuver node around in front of your craft. Are you getting close approach markers anywhere? If no, maybe your target isn\u0027t close enough yet. Timewarp for one extra loop around the planet and try again. Repeat until you get close encounter markers - or until you pass your target. In which case you know that you were already too close by the time you made your first try. You\u0027ll have to timewarp until you are once more approaching your target from behind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you get close approach markers - great! Keep dragging that node until you get the closest encounter that you can, and if necessary, add or remove some prograde \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Mousing over the close encounter marker will show you just how close you are when it becomes visually difficult to discern the marker\u0027s behavior. Note that if you cross the target orbit twice as opposed of just touching it in one spot, you can get close encounters on \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E the first crossing and on the second crossing. Pick one of the two. Both are equally valid, but don\u0027t try to line up both at the same time. It is both impossible and redundant. As a rule of the thumb, any close approach of 2 kilometers or less is good enough, though of course the closer you get, the better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExecute your node. Verify that you are still going to have a close approach of 2 kilometers or less - if not, make a new node and correct. If everything is in order, switch your navball into \u0022target\u0022 mode, and warp forward to you close encounter. When you reach the minimum separation distance, find the retrograde marker on your navball (which, again, should be in \u0022target\u0022 mode) and burn towards it until your velocity shows 0 m/s (or as close to it as you can go). Congratulations, you have just matched orbits with your target, and your rendezvous is complete. Simple as that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you still want to go closer - just point your nose at the target and thrust forward. As long as you are closer than 2 kilometers, this will work without much in the way of error. You can always become stationary next to your target again by burning retrograde in target mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-02T18:02:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2016 06:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-02T19:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orange and magenta intercept markers are supposed to be your biggest tools when creating a close approach.

If you have two ships in orbit, then the ship in the lower orbit will move ahead of the ship that\u0027s in a higher orbit. This is the main fact that you take advantage of to create a close approach. If the target ship is behind you, then you want to be in a higher orbit.\u00A0If your target ship is ahead of you, then you want to be in a lower orbit than it is -- if possible.
