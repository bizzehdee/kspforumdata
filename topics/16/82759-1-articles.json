Thing is, ordinary docking ports are wobbly. Stick three vessels plus an interplanetary stage together as you intend to in order to make a little train heading for Duna, your combined craft will behave very much like a slinky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, using KAS you can apply liberal amounts of Space-Tape (aka struts) after assembling the thing in orbit. But I\u0027ve had only varied success with that approach.

One such tank is plenty - a bit overkill actually, but if not too used to docking better bring a bit more than needed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Speaking of RCS - I see your lander only got one set of RCS thrusters. Each module you intend to manuever using RCS need two sets of RCS thrusters. One above Center of Mass, and one below CoM. Preferably equally spaced so that CoM also becomes Center of Rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour lander should be much lighter. And be powered by more than one little LV909. Two will do, three is better, four is overkill. You should have a Duna TWR of 1.5 to 2.5 ideally. Below that and you\u0027ll burn a lot of fuel going not very far, above that and you got dead weight in engines. With a light enough design, some 400 units of LFO (equal to the smallest Rockomax tank \u002B a little bit more) should give you between 1700 and 1800 dV. You\u0027ll need roughly 150dV to deorbit and 1500dV to get back to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe interplanetary stage will need roughly 3500dV for the round-trip when all hooked up to your other modules. Doing it with chemical rockets (like say the Poodle), you\u0027ll need to use drop-tanks most likely. To loose some mass during the trip so as to get the most out of the fuel. With nuclear rockets, it is easy enough as you get over twice the bang for the buck, uhm, fuel. With nuclear propulsion two Jumbos should be plenty. With chemical rockets you might need as many as four - certainly three.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last - try for a puller interplanetary stage rather than a pusher. With a puller (locomotive) you put stretching tension on the rest of the train, any sideways stress will equalize itself under the tension when you are burning. the construction still need be stiff though, as turning will become nigh-on impossible if not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you put contracting tension on the other modules by going for a pusher interplanetary stage, your design need to be *VERY* stiff. If not, it\u0027ll just start wavering to one side or another, and as you do your burns that sideways motion will get reinforced, eventually breaking up the entire thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alias72","CreatedById":111778,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T21:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood news everybody!

Made a little error in my previous answer. you\u0027ll actually need about 800 units of LFO/2100dV to get down to and up to orbit again from Duna. Been a while since last I visited that place *cough*. And whilst you won\u0027t burn through more than 100-150dV to deorbit, you will burn through 3-400dV more to get the speed down to a reasonable 300m/s before you fully deploy parachutes. The (stock) atmosphere of Duna do not have the required density to slow down your lander enough before popping the chutes. Meaning if they fully deploy whilst you are still screaming down at 1km/s, the braking force of the chutes will rip your lander to pieces. Once speed is down a bit, the atmosphere is just dense enough at lower altitudes that once the chutes are fully deployed, provided you got enough of them you won\u0027t go too fast when getting close to the ground.
