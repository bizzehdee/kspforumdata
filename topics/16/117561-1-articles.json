The latter may know a few more tricks, but the basic interface is pretty similar -- if you\u0027re unhappy with one, I don\u0027t think the other will suit you.\n\nI have to say that I\u0027m not sure if I understand your problem. If you want to plan a maneuver while being focused on a destination, without always misclicking and selecting other stuff, either of the two should do the job nicely. I use MJ\u0027s node editor all the time."},{"CreatedByName":"Tynrael","CreatedById":144990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T22:04:13Z","Content":"You can click on the PE/AP tag in the map view to have it keep displaying the distance and then use the above mentioned Precise Node to dial it in where you need. Of course, clicking on the target pe/ap tag instead of the current can be painful, and when you go too far and lose the ap/pe you will have to re-select it again."},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T22:28:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there any mods, that helps to adjust manuevr node slowly and visible?

I can hardly play without it.\n\nA bit of warning tho, When KSP 1.0.4 loads on my system, it claims that the latest PreciseNode isn\u0027t compatible -- but the mod loads and runs just fine. So just ignore the warning."}]}
