A fast responsiveness will adapt quicker but may overreact to something loud and short like an explosion, whereas if it is slow it will be steadier (and more accurate) over time, but may take some time to converge to that state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Threshold\u0027 is more mysterious to me, but I would guess it is some regularization that keeps the louds slightly louder than the quiets (and vice-versa) so that the AGC does not wash out all of the dynamic range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese values are unitless because audio is generally dealt with in unitless quantities (since you have a speaker amplifying everything, adding any units would be a waste anyway).
