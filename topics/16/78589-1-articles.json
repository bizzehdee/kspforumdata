Today after I reinstalled the new version I set up the controls as I used to have them in .20 or .21 my jet pack rockets would fire for me to pitch, yaw and roll but the kerbal would just sit there. All other controls work normally, but to change my facing I have to resort to using the mouse and space bar which can be done but is no where near a smooth as the control I used to have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sure there is an easy fix, but I have been messing with it for 3 hours now, so any help would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
