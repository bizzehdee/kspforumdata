For example if you have a plane or sci-fi ship you want to look sleek and store the lander in a cargo bay, you can make a really small lander with O-10s or mod engines such as RLA stockalike. It also makes a good emergency system if you used it for docking and you can take the pod off your ship and fly it home using its RCS.
