This will create a higher angle of reentry, and a higher speed at periapsis. What kind of periapsis are you using for reentry? You may want to go for 30-40 km. Also, be sure to try and hold a fairly decent angle of attack with your space plane. This will create more drag early on, bleeding more speed before you get into the deeper, thick parts of the atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T05:56:21Z","Content":"As he said, lower apoapsis or higher periapsis.

If you have a high AOA like the real space shuttle, you are braking much more than you would if you fly perfectly prograde (streamlined) through the atmosphere.\n\nThe missing tilt (AOA) might as well be the problem with your reentry, because your craft won\u0027t brake enough in the upper atmosphere and will roar down into the lower, burning up. Try to pull the nose up (with reaction wheels and/or RCS and SAS) to use as much aerobrake in the upper atmopsphere as you can.\n\nIf you want to see how the real thing flies, take a look at the \u0022Orbiter\u0022 space sim by Martin Schweiger.

It does not have to be very deep, just lower your periapsis into the upper atmosphere, and go a few orbits like that to bring your overall speed down. Once you are low enough, you should have shed enough speed that your \u0022full\u0022 reentry will not be going to fast as to encounter terminal levels of atmospheric friction. \n\nAlso, airbrakes are your new best friend, whether on spaceplane or rocket.

Aim for 50-55 km Pe so that the first pass has you pass through the atmo on an even slower reentry.\n\nIt totally depends on the type of craft you fly. With a real Spaceplane, you might get better results coasting in the upper parts of the atmosphere. With a Spaceshuttle type of craft this isn\u0027t possible because it is designed to perform a controlled \u0022stall\u0022 at high AOA through these layers and only transition to a real glide when all the braking and heating has subsided. If your craft can\u0027t hold this high AOA to brake in a way like this, you must of course follow a much shallower flight path because you are actually gliding it down all the way. However, you\u0027ll encounter much more heating this way, because you spend much more time in the heating airstream, because you don\u0027t brake enough.\n\nRemember: \n\nA) Gliding in the upper parts of the atmosphere = longer braking phase, less heating, but a longer duration of the heating phase.\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Stalling into \u0022lower\u0022 parts of the upper atmosphere (~25-30km) = shorter braking phase with higher intensity of heat but a shorter heating phase.\n\nYou have to find the equilibrium between those two solutions according to the design of your craft.\n\nHowever, i prefer the low periapsis reentries for precision purposes. I can almost always nail a landing at KSC with my Spaceplanes, and the capsules come down just west of the coast of it. If you have a longer aerobraking phase, it\u0027s very difficult to predict the landing site."},{"CreatedByName":"Juicy","CreatedById":142505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T12:02:17Z","Content":"With a non-SSTO, I try to get in a circular orbit at around 100km. Next, when as my apoapsis, I lower my periapsis far enough, that I\u0027d go under ~40 km altitude a bit before I pass my planned landingsite. It gives a pretty shallow re-entry, and with some practice, allows me to land not-too-far from where I want to land (like, less than 25km, which is close enough for me to grab a rover and pick up the data from a probe)"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T18:30:24Z","Content":"If you\u0027re in a fairly high orbit (like 400x400), and you want to go home with minimal dV requirements and minimal \u0022barbecue factor\u0022, the most efficient and safe thing to do is this:\n\n1. Do a single retrograde burn (i.e. directly opposite the direction of your orbit, like you\u0027re doing already), to lower your periapsis into atmosphere.\n\n2. However, don\u0027t lower it very *far* into the atmosphere. That\u0027s your problem, 25 km is too low.\n\nAs for \u0022what altitude is best\u0022: You have a couple of choices, multi-pass or aerobrake-to-land.\n\nThe multi-pass (a.k.a. \u0022super cautious\u0022) approach is to keep it really really high, like in the 45-50 km range. That won\u0027t take you to the ground, it\u0027ll just lower your apoapsis a bit. You can then do multiple aerobraking passes until you\u0027re down around a low, nearly-circular orbit. In practice, I find that I never need to do this, Kerbin reentry is fairly gentle.\n\nThe brake-to-land approach is to just hit atmosphere and go all the way down. Really, you should be fine with this, just don\u0027t aim too low. A periapsis of around 35 km should do it. As you enter atmosphere, make sure you point retrograde during reentry (i.e. with your engines pointing forward), since those have a lot of heat tolerance and are the least likely to blow up (and, if they *do*, they\u0027re the most expendable)."},{"CreatedByName":"Bosun","CreatedById":146083,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T19:09:17Z","Content":"My first Space Plane design in Mk 2 parts just burned the whole way to the ground.
