I would like to try designing and building my own space stations. Can anyone recommend Mods, both parts and others, that would be a great help in producing them?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nIf I come up with anything I like maybe I\u0027ll share them! \n\nThank you ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nKeith\n\nOttawa, Canada"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T17:32:24Z","Content":"Yep, i like stations, too.\n\nIf you don\u0027t know already, here are my favourites, you\u0027ll easily find them in the addons forums: \n\n- Stockalike Station Parts\n\n- Near Future Solar and Near Future Construction\n\n- Karbonite (the collectors for low orbit stations)\n\n- Low Profile Hubs\n\n- Universal Docking Ports (?)\n\n- KAS\n\nShow your processor it\u0027s limits !\n\n:-)\n\nk"},{"CreatedByName":"AcidSludge","CreatedById":95709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T17:34:20Z","Content":"Depends on what\u0027s on your mind how your Space Station should look like. A Death Star, an ISS lookalike?\n\nI never had the urge to mod my game for a space station, I\u0027m quite happy with the stock parts (plus ScanSat), but I\u0027m alway interested in new ideas. So far, all my Space Stations looked more or less like this:\n\n![w7NF11K.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/w7NF11K.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T17:37:28Z","Content":"Ok, well first let me get the obligatory \u0022This forum is for gameplay questions, mods have their own forum\u0022 statement out of the way.\n\nAs for mods to consider [MKS/OKS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588-1-0-2-USI-Kolonization-Systems-%28MKS-OKS%29-%280-30-1%29-2015-05-02) is beautiful. I\u0027ve never used it (because it is big and I am not a Karbonite fan) but I\u0027ve seen it used and there is no denying the models are gorgeous.

Lets say you have a 1000 part lag monster of a station. This mod can bring that part count down to 50 by welding them together.
