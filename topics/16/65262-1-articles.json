Far is supposed to limit turbojets to 1800 m/s, but a config bug allows them to run at max thrust as long as it has air. Higher velocity means you can gobble up more air, which allows you to reach even higher velocity.

Thus, IntakeAir and engine thrust decrease together and both go to zero simultaneously at flameout. This happens internally without moving the displayed position of the throttle slider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the automation is better at managing the throttle to the available IntakeAir than even the most skillful old-school SSTO pilot, and because engines now also run IntakeAir right down to zero instead of dying with some amount still left, the ceilings of jet engines has increased for a given number of intakes. Airhogging really isn\u0027t that necessary anymore; 2 ram intakes per engine is usually enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sundancer","CreatedById":83716,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T21:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems as though both of these things have been at work causing my confusion.
