I just repurposed one of my \u0027space-only\u0027 (well...until final landing back at Kerbin) motherships as an Asteroid-go-getter by fitting an Advanced Grabbing Device to it\u0027s lower docking clamp. All works fine, got to the asteroid, latched on, now ready to bring it back to Kerbin. It\u0027s a Class A, so not very big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow...the ship...it\u0027s mainly powered by 2 LV-N engines, so a thrust total of about 120kn. When I throttle them up....nothing happens...at all. My speed doesn\u0027t even budge. I realize it\u0027s probably due to low thrust, but the asteroid is only the smallest type and 120kn thrust isn\u0027t THAT low...hell, I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ve towed larger-total-mass things with that ship design than this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I don\u0027t even have the LV-Ns throttled up, by some magic I don\u0027t understand, the RCS thrusters WILL change my speed quite readily...(there are 14 of them, so theoretically 14kn of thrust, 1kn each)....you mean to tell me those 14 RCS thrusters\u0027 total output of 14kn somehow moves the ship AND asteroid while my 120kn total thrust LV-Ns can\u0027t...? Is this a huge bug?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought even a miniscule amount of thrust would move something big in space, it would just take a really long time....? (I know there\u0027s a point at which too small a thrust wouldn\u0027t move something, but I\u0027m pretty sure I have more than enough thrust with my engines) The whole ship is currently 21 tonnes as it sits and the LV-Ns move it fine, WITH the asteroid, it\u0027s still only 28 tonnes...why can\u0027t I move them? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anybody explain to me what\u0027s up? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-08T13:24:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2014 01:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by darkstrike\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T12:31:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you trying to push or pull the asteroid with the nukes?
