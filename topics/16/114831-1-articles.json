I\u0027ve never really had any issues with docking. I built this great tanker/science base that floats around Kerbin, and I\u0027ve docked a few things with it. Then I built a couple of ships that also docked with it. However, this is totally bugging me out.\n\n~\u003Ciframe src=\u0022https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=CD76E5B606E9BFBE\u0026resid=CD76E5B606E9BFBE%21490106\u0026authkey=AJmWoy2pTNjBvsc\u0022 width=\u0022320\u0022 height=\u0022180\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nI have checked the persistence file, and there was one set to the wrong thing, so I set it to Active, then backed away and tried again. I also have docked this ship with another ship that has a Docking Port on it, with great success, so I\u0027m thinking that the thingie is pointed the right way. Even the magnets get all excited when trying to pull each other together, and it seems like they\u0027re going to make it, but alas, they never actually snap.\n\nAny ideas? Took me two nights to get this load of data back for this science lab.\n\nCheers!\n\n-Nate"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T03:28:37Z","Content":"Your screenshot appears to be broken.\n\nCould you upload it to an alternative image host like Imgur, and repost it here?"},{"CreatedByName":"nordicpc","CreatedById":147320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T03:37:20Z","Content":"well, I feel like an idiot. I eventually looked at it and realized the ports on my base were backwards. I edited my persistence file and got them turned the other way and got it docked. I don\u0027t know why, but it seemed like there should be a female and male joining, not male to male. I guess that\u0027s where I went wrong.\n\nThanks for the quick reply, but this turned out to be a PBCAK."}]}
