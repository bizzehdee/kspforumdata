I get most of how the mission works but I am still unsure of some parts. I have a very basic understanding of orbital mechanics and how ion engine based ships differ from traditional rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is unclear to me if, when and how you can leave or get into an orbit accurately with a lage ion engine based ship with the thrust being so low. For example, to leave earth\u0027s orbit and to get into a solar orbit do you first have to make your orbit really really large? Once near Mars how do get into a proper orbit there with so little thrust?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I missing here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso how would you operate a craft like this in KSP?

It boils down to exceeding escape velocity and what distance you are away from the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy understanding is that the Hermes is basically a big ship for traditional transfers.

The book implies roughly a month to decelerate. My limited knowledge of trajectories in space from playing KSP has taught me that you can\u0027t just speed up or slow down in space and hope to keep the same trajectory. The simple act of firing your engines in any direction will always alter your path, this would be true even with very low thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP terms would they be starting a long slow burn from outside the SOI of Mars? What would their trajectory look like before starting that burn, in other words, what kind of periapsis would they aim for? I\u0027m guessing that they have to start with an insanely high altitude periapsis and hope that it gets closer as a result of the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hard for me to picture a 1 month burn in the context of planet where the final orbit would likely have a period of 1.5 hours give or take.

One burn to just get a capture, followed by multiple burns over multiple orbits to shrink it down to a low enough Mars orbit to do the mission there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that digging deep into NASA\u0027s Dawn mission would reveal a better explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T02:08:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah.
