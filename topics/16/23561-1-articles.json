I start and tilt up and from there go up into orbit but if I want it ti behave like a normal plane it fails miserably.... it wont turn, when i try to roll and pull back to turn it just won\u0027t budge from it\u0027s current heading, it just flip flops and then its back to it\u0027s original heading. what am I missing here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T20:02:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like your Center of Lift is too far back. You want the CoL to be a little behind the Center of Mass for positive stability, but it it\u0027s too far back then the craft becomes so stable that you can\u0027t turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, however, that you can\u0027t simply yank a plane around into any arbitrarily sharp turn... there are aerodynamic limits on your rate of turn. If you try to exceed them, the craft will \u0022weathervane\u0022 back into the limits. If this is your problem, you can try using the Avionics Package. With SAS mode on, it limits your attempted attitude changes to stay within the limits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-22T20:05:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2013 08:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T20:44:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe your plane is working just fine. Consider how fast your vessel is moving. If you pull back on the stick and get four Gs, that\u0027s just fine. It might take a while to actually see the effect, but that\u0027s just because of the huge amounts of kinetic energy involved. If it took five minutes to get moving that fast, why shouldn\u0027t it take a while to reverse it? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise... what kind of control systems are you using?

Rocket-style ASAS will try to maintain the heading when it was activated, while avionics pack attempts to keep reasonably close to the direction of travel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
