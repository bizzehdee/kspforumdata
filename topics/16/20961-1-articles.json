There is still a bit of atmosphere when you hit that stage, and with the length of the rocket, may make the top end drop. Also, I see that you are using struts, but I have no idea where they are. I would personally strut some of the upper and lower stages together as I imagine they are buckling a little.

That is the 6 large srbs. That only firing plus limited gymbal control means once you hit atmo, it is entirely up to any SAS/thrust to keep it stable. Any wobble will offset the COG and spin out of control it will.
