I have experimented with a few different mining ship but i am struggling with the balance between ore storage, power and dV enough to get down and up again. My crafts are bringing back less ore than they use on the trip.\n\nAnyone here who can give a little advice? I am not looking for ready made .craft just some advice on some simple stuff like how much ore you are bringing back for each drill run to make it profit"},{"CreatedByName":"Shawn28","CreatedById":143994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T15:14:54Z","Content":"It\u0027s kind of hard to say because i don\u0027t know how your lander looks like, so if you send a few screenshots that would be useful...\n\nanyway, what i think so far (without screenshots) is that your lander probably doesn\u0027t have enough DeltaV because if you want to mine ore on the surface and deliver it to the refinery in orbit you need to be able to land with empty ore tanks and get to orbit with full ore tanks... anyway, it\u0027s not simple, but good luck ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nscreenshots would still be useful ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n-Shawn.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nP.S. what i would do is probably make a Minmus(or any other low gravity moon) mining operation instead on the Mun because it takes a lot less DeltaV to get to orbit. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kebra","CreatedById":115002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T15:31:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s kind of hard to say because i don\u0027t know how your lander looks like, so if you send a few screenshots that would be useful...\n\u003E anyway, what i think so far (without screenshots) is that your lander probably doesn\u0027t have enough DeltaV because if you want to mine ore on the surface and deliver it to the refinery in orbit you need to be able to land with empty ore tanks and get to orbit with full ore tanks... anyway, it\u0027s not simple, but good luck ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E screenshots would still be useful ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E -Shawn.\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E P.S. what i would do is probably make a Minmus(or any other low gravity moon) mining operation instead on the Mun because it takes a lot less DeltaV to get to orbit. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nMinmus might be a better idea.\n\nlanding and taking off from Mun is easily atleast ~1000dv\n\nWith a 300 ore tank and , 400 units of fuel LF\u002BO and a LV909 i get about 2000 dV out of it.\n\nSo with two very economical runs i can create 600 fuel, i spent 400 and net about 200 into storage.\n\n[http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34119782387171411/14C9AD40EE6B3BDC539B18899E255D24A54CD8DB/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34119782387171411/14C9AD40EE6B3BDC539B18899E255D24A54CD8DB/)\n\nIn reality i doubt i can do it with 1000dv pr trip.

The reason being that if you don\u0027t have a fuel supply on the ground then your lander needs to land with all the fuel for the return trip on board. The landing phase is the least efficient part of the trip, you\u0027re going slow and burning straight down, so the heavier the ship is on landing the more fuel you\u0027re going to waste on the round-trip even if on paper the delta-v is the same. That is the only difference, but it is a big one in terms of return per trip."},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T17:40:43Z","Content":"The mover between the surface and orbit wants the absolute minimum equipment on board since every gram hurts the bottom line. No refineries, no drills, no ore containers, just fuel, engines, and landing legs. Assuming you have KAS or some other way to transfer resources on the ground it\u0027s much better to leave the refining equipment stationary. The trip down to join the drill for example should contain enough fuel for the trip down but not back up. Refuel on the ground and bring it to the orbital depot. Offload all fuel except enough to go down again. This way you don\u0027t need ore storage and fuel storage on the mover (heavy), just fuel.\n\nThe argument against this is if you need something other than fuel bi propellant, say liquid fuel only for a nuclear engine. Then your mover might need LF/OX while your cargo is just LF or something else as ore eventually might serve a different purpose. You might want LF/OX making capability on the ground still (carrying round trip fuel is expensive) but perhaps you need a separate cargo and mover fuel container.\n\nThe shallowest gravity well is best for both the mover\u0027s consideration and the benefit of refueling craft headed for points beyond which is why Minmus is much more appealing than Mun."}]}
