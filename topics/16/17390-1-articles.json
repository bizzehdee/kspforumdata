But is this a viable approach or will current mechanics always result in this being substantially less efficient than vertical flight?

Wings do provide lift (although they also can deflect airstreams). Without pictures i can only assume that you\u0027re using rocket engines on your craft. Rocket engines consume fuel at a much higher rate than jet engines. Using them for horizontal flight therefor is very inefficient. At the beginning of a horizontal flight a rocket engine provides power to achieve a certain speed by which the craft can climb (due to the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E generated lift). When that speed is reached, drag forces has increased so much that all of the power of the rocket engines is used to just maintaining the speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA vertical flight has the advantage that the air density decreases with the achieved altitude. Drag therefor deminishes with the altitude (given the same speed), so part of the power/force is used for increasing speed by which you reach a higher altitude with less drag which again etc.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the designs in the real world you\u0027ll see that they are based on a vertical start as a rocket and landing as a \u0022plane\u0022. (Space shuttle, Dynasoar etc.). The wings and controlsurfaces of the \u0022plane\u0022 not only give some manoeuvrability to the craft but also allow for a much higher landingweight (because of the lift they provide. Could you imagine what would be necessary to land a 747 with parachutes instead of wings?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhiteowl (a KSP player) has made several YouTube movies where he uses planes to get a craft into orbit.
