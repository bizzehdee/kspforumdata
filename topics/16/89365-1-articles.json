Mun will always complete a full sidereal orbit faster than Minmus, for example. Putting a satellite between Kerbin and Mun, therefore, will mean that the satellite will always become misaligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life it\u0027s possible to do as you describe, however, because of N-body physics. That is, the Moon\u0027s gravity counteracts Earth\u0027s, allowing a satellite to experience less spacetime curvature and orbit in synch with the Moon at a lower Earth orbit. This is called a Lagrangian Point, and in your case, specifically the L1 point.
