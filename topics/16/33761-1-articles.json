I\u0027d think that by adding extra speed facing to the right of my screen at the moment, it\u0027d take longer for the planetary body to reverse that velocity, hence the part of my orbit to the right, by the red arrow, would grow. Why does the green arrow part grow instead?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T09:17:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe answer is probably more mathematical than necessary so I\u0027ll try to provide a qualitative explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe planet\u0027s gravity is pulling you forever toward it, but when you increase your speed you do indeed travel farther.

It will go up for a while, until its speed is overcome by gravity\u0027s acceleration and it falls back to earth. In orbit, you are doing the same thing, except that you are moving so quickly over the surface of the earth, that the ground is falling away from you faster than you can reach it (\u0022aiming for the ground and missing\u0022) Michael from Vsauce does a better explanation \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/jTL_sJycQAA?t=1m41s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E of what orbiting actually is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason you speeding up one side of your orbit raises the other is also due to the fact that you are constantly falling. If you speed at the lowest point of your orbit, you essentially add more speed to your \u0027fall\u0027 around the planetary body. Halfway between the lowest point (where you sped up) and the highest point (180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 out of phase from the lowest point), your \u0027fall\u0027 becomes more like a \u0027throw\u0027 out to the other side of your orbit. At this point, your ship flies higher until gravity stops its vertical speed and begins bringing it back down to earth (incidentally speeding it up again too, so your speed is the same when you reach your lowest point again).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helped!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
