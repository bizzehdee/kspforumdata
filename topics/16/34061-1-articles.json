But I\u0027m not sure what I do now. How do I return them to KSC, remove them from the playing field as it were? I don\u0027t want to have capsule markers sitting around everywhere and although I\u0027m pretty sure Kerbals aren\u0027t naturally social creatures, especially the single pilots in the MK1 capsules could use a touch of civilization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-21T02:39:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2013 02:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SuperWeegee4000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnswered nao.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T02:29:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t return them yet.
