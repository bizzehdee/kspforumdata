You won\u0027t be able to select prograde until you hit space. So hit space, immediately click prograde (have your mouse hovering over it), and then start tapping D to turn east. As soon as it gets\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ejust a little\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0off vertical, stop tapping D and just let the rocket go up.
