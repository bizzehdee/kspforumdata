Hypersonic, yes but it\u0027s harder.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSupersonic is relatively easy, depending on the total mass of the craft, a few Panthers should provide enough thrust to break the sound barrier. I have a small Mk3 transport that weighs 60 tons, can carry\u00A068 kerbals, powered by two Goliaths that tops out around 550 m/s (Mach 1.65 at sea level). If supersonic is your goal, the Panther is probably the best engine; avoid the Goliath and Wheesley as\u00A0they\u0027re up the the task, but tend to overheat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHypersonic is usually defined as mach number in excess of 5, and for that you definitely need to use the RAPIER. The Whiplash thrust curve peaks around Mach 4, but falls off quickly to\u00A00 at M=5.5. The RAPIER fares better, with peak thrust around M=3.5, but with a gentle taper to 0 at M=6. So yes, the engines support hypersonic travel and it can be done. I have a small spaceplane that weighs 77 tons, crew capacity of 20 and a moderately-sized cargo bay, and is powered by 4 RAPIER in the tail\u00A0and 2 Whiplash in outboard nacelles. It can reach a maximum Mach 5.5 at 15 km. I\u0027m sure that you could do better by removing much of the rocket fuel and reducing the size of the crew compartment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr, supersonic is easy, hypersonic needs RAPIERs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-08T22:46:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223799535\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194569\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591651921\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175796\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mabdi36\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, mabdi36 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes but with lots of rapiers or whiplashes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d argue a Mammoth works too but I guess that is not what the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
