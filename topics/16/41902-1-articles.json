I started a new profile in Kerbal Space Program and I wanted to get a satellite into Orbit around Kerbal. I used the default Z-MAP satellite except i put on better solar arrays, science equipment and an sas. I get it into orbit but after that everything stops. I can control the satellite, i cant even turn on and off the SAS or the RCS, i cant extend the solararrays or activate any science equipment. Whats the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dave4002000","CreatedById":41394,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T14:30:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you put a least one battery on there. I don\u0027t think it has any by default. You might be running out of electricity by the time you get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T15:06:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing first check your power levels. As dave said you may be out of juice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly I have had this issue before where for whatever reason the ship just quit responding to commands. Exit to tracking station and go back to your ship see if that fixes it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mmollle","CreatedById":78401,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T15:17:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, i solved it by putting battieries on the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
