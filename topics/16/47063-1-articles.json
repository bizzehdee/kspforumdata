It consists of a large radius central section with four normal radius tank/engine/leg combos on the four sides. It flies and lands well. I sling rovers below, and ascent stages above, the central section. Very similar in style to this (but with four rather than six radial tanks):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xS7uCsZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xS7uCsZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(credit: Roboray)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I want to make it land me heavier, larger payloads (base sections, large ascent modules etc) that would constitute the whole of the central section. This actually works as well; I have radial decouplers that can detach the four side engine assemblies from the central section that is then free to do what it wants. When I do so, all four side modules break off and fall to the ground; the struts between them disappearing (presumably because there are no \u0022real\u0022 parts between them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat they fall to the side into a pile of rubble isn\u0027t a problem most of the time. But now I want those four side engines to stay together even when the central section is detached and removed. With the ring of four engines, I can fly away, leaving the payload where it landed. Or the lander can remain as an operational base once the crew has left. Presumably, to do this, I need to have \u0022real\u0022 parts running between the four radial tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the question is: how do you attach off-axis things together in the KAB? If I use a truss or girder, I can attached it to one side; but it\u0027s never the right length to intersect the neighbouring tanks.. Even if it was, how would I make sure that both sides of the girder are attached (as opposed to the one side I positioned with)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that makes sense; a little hard to explain!!

I think I also get your idea of the docking port - basically, build two technically different, half-ring spacecraft, and have them immediately mate. Intriguing. However, I suspect a full circular logical ring isn\u0027t needed - if I can make a branch that wraps around the central section (joining the four pods with three links), I can get all four pods to be attached to the tree without linking branches. The structural stability I can achieve by putting struts between the first and last pods in the tree\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the tree would look like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                                   Nosecone\u003Cbr\u003E                                       |\u003Cbr\u003E                        Pod 4          |          Pod 1\u003Cbr\u003E                         ||            |       /   ||\u003Cbr\u003E                         ||     Central Section    ||\u003Cbr\u003E                         ||            |           ||\u003Cbr\u003E                        Pod 3  ========|========  Pod 2\u003Cbr\u003E                                       |\u003Cbr\u003E                                 Launcher stages\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(In this, a single line represents a decoupler, a double line a fixed link like a girder or truss).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen landed, Pod 1 decouples from the central section, releasing it from the entire ring of pods, which remain still attached. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifficulties from this approach are it\u0027s messy: unbalanced and requiring some delicate placement of pods around the centre (rather than symmetry-attaching them).

Due to the tree structure, 4 decouplers form their own separate trees, with no way for them to connect to parts on another tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest (symmetrical) way is to make a skycrane (incorporate a stack decoupler on top, with some common stack piece that all the 4 pieces attach to).
