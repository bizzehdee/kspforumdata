It gave me a very stable, very rotation free and quite manageable rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut the decouplers as low on the SBRs as you can. The reason is quite simple: The closer the decouplers are to the engine nozzle, the lower the lever on the decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConnect the lowermost points on your SBRs with the SBRs next to it, so the 6 (or however many you use) SBRs are linked to each other with struts. This reduces the lever even more and equalizes the forces executed inwards between the SBRs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConnect the top of the SBRs to the rocket inside with another set of struts. This is basically mostly for balancing and to lower the shear force on the couplers from the SBR trying to push \u0027up\u0027, less tear on the couplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat results usually in VERY solid booster behaviour.
