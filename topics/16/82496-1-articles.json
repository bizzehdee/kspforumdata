The premise is that I would like to launch a \u0027mothership\u0027 as it were from which to launch individual probes. So I fly by a moon or planet, park the ship in orbit, launch a probe which lands on the body by its own and then the sip moves on to the next body. I have a main ship with 4 probes attaches with radial decouplers. Problem is if I decouple, there appears to be no way to control the probe. It simply drifts away uncontrollably. The individual probes are outfitted with OCTO command modules, engines and parachutes. Even if I switch to \u0027control from here\u0027 and then decouple, it doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I just that stupid?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance dor any help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T18:31:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse the [ and ] keys to select different ships within 2.5km, or go to map view and click on the vessel you wish to control, and select switch to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T18:52:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso make sure your probes are fitted with batteries and a means to keep the batteries charged.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T18:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022iSjaak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022iSjaak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...I have a main ship with 4 probes attaches with radial \u003Cstrong\u003Edecouplers\u003C/strong\u003E.....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming the advice above solves your problem, you might want to consider attaching the probes with either docking ports or stack separators (EDIT the blue things that come loose on both sides).
