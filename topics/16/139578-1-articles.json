For some reason my rover wheels and their steering is totally borked right now. My wheels only ever point inwards or outwards now when they were working perfectly fine before. If I invert the steering on the front axle, It just swaps the direction the wheels point on both sides. They used to both point the same direction prior to one of the updates.\u00A0In both of these screenshots below,\u00A0I\u0027m trying to steer to the right hand side of the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for them being super wide, I play on a 21:9 monitor \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInward:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160511210507_1_zpsp6cmru82.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022421\u0022 src=\u0022http://i191.photobucket.com/albums/z162/bneale_album/KSP/20160511210507_1_zpsp6cmru82.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutward:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160511210036_1_zpsqomdgqcd.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022421\u0022 src=\u0022http://i191.photobucket.com/albums/z162/bneale_album/KSP/20160511210036_1_zpsqomdgqcd.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m only holding right but the wheels point in opposite directions when they used to point the same before.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there anything I can do to salvage this rover?

It has long been surmised that (since there were so many changes to wheels) the upgrade from 1.0 to 1.1 would \u0022break\u0022 the rover wheels. And it did. The rover that I created in 1.0.5 has exactly the same issue as yours. The \u0022driving around the landscape\u0022 function of my rover happens to not be its primary function (it\u0027s an ISRU) -- so I can make do with the broken one\u00A0if I just push it from here to there\u00A0with another rover. If I hit S or W, it kinda sorta turns. Otherwise, it goes straight, and I can push it sideways with the other rover to make it turn in a predictable direction. There may be something that you can do about editing the craft file and the savegame to make the wheels steer properly, but I don\u0027t know it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh -- one other thing: my broken rover had those balloon wheels, the same as yours. The motors on those wheels used to be decent enough to move a rover the size of yours and mine.\u00A0It turns out the balloon wheel motors are \u003Cem\u003Epathetic\u003C/em\u003E now. So even if you can get the steering fixed, I hope you don\u0027t have to drive that thing up any slopes -- even on Minmus, I think it would be a challenge with those wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-12T06:05:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2016 06:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T07:19:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is almost certainly because the \u0022control from\u0022 part (which looks to be the docking port, here) is rotated 90\u00B0 to the horizontal.
