Take your first stage (the stage that, when you drop it, your ship starts flipping out) off the ship, and turn on the COM marker. Then find ways to make that marker as high as possible. Also, small fins on this stage can help get you that extra bit of stability, but may harm stability of the prior stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne obvious way to shift mass forward is to have another stage.
