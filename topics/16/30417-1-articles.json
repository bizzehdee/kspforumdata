It\u0027s not as simple as just moving the files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnswered my own question. Well if you go to the ship\u0027s save file, you\u0027ll find three lines...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eship = Name of the ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eversion = version of KSP it was built in\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etype = VAB or SPH\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwitch the type from VAB to SPH or vise-versa.

Struts can disappear, parts can get stuck to the mouse pointer so that you can\u0027t put them down, symmetry in the VAB sometimes attempts to default to 3x and can\u0027t be changed, and after ending any flight that started construction in the SPH you can\u0027t select return to VAB from the escape menu and vice-versa. That 3x symmetry glitch is especially noxious because what it does is place your original part, place a mirror of it on the other side, and the it places a mirror of the mirror superimposed upon the first part so precisely that you can\u0027t tell it\u0027s there. Then you can drive yourself crazy trying to figure out why one side of your rocket is twice as heavy as the other. Honestly, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth the trouble, and I\u0027ve gone back to building my rovers in the VAB. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T08:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you use Subassembly loader, you can build something in theSPH, save it as a subassembly, go to the VAB and open it there.
