Especially when it comes to the wings of your spaceplane. Because the kind of KSP wanting you to put it on your plane is the only direction in witch they will effectively produce lift, otherwise (attaching it in reverse e.g.) you have more weight and drag but not an increased lift (look at your CoL when attaching airfoils)!
