This is my first post so forgive me if I\u0027m uploading wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just recently got the game and am doing great figuring everything out, except for what the title states. I am on a laptop so I cannot activate the mousewheel the way the manual suggests, and I can\u0027t find any recent discussions, guides, or key bindings that help- I\u0027m on v1.12.5.3190(OSX). It\u0027s been fine for a while but I\u0027m building a satellite for Mun and it\u0027s impossible to perfect the small details as well as getting a cohesive view of the vessel without being able to adjust my camera zoom.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease let me know up-to-date control schemes for this or possible solutions. I\u0027ll try to answer any questions needed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Also is there an all-encompassing document of helpful equations, rates, constants, etc?
