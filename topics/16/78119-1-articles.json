I\u0027m getting them for free every time I research a node. Is that intended? I feel that because the icon next to the entry cost changed to the \u0022funds\u0022 icon, there seems to be intent for entry purchases to be charged to your balance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T05:34:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeya Origim,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is already a thread started on this topic, so I\u0027ll point you that way.
