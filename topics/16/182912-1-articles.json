This platform can reach Kerbin just fine, however the rover (which has two Communotron 16-S antenna) can\u0027t make contact to Kerbin through this platform after I decoupled it from the platform. Is this intended behavior, or do I have a more serious problem on my hands? Here\u0027s a screenshot to show the proximity.
