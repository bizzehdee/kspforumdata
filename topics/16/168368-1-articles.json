For Moho to Duna, that means it has to be the RA-15. For Dres to Eeloo, the RA-100. And you need the level 3 Deep Space Network at home, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, the issue arises as to how to control subsequent craft during the transfer. And how to control craft if you lose the connection temporarily. Or in other words, how to optimise resources and ensure you have at least approximate control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy simple solution: put a pair of DTS-M1 antennae on any craft that is going to go anywhere interplanetary on its own, and make sure the probe core can at least do all of the cardinal direction holds and ideally also hold the burn node direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe dual DTS-M1s allow you get a reasonable distance from Kerbin (from Moho to Duna as long as they are on the same side of the sun) and still have direct control. And if you plot your manouvre nodes and reduce your engine max throttle before getting too far from Kerbin,\u00A0 they can do course correction burns using the minimal control you still have (turn to X direction, max throttle, zero throttle).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with that as a minimum, you can get to your destination, capture, get back, even land probably. But you still need that relay at your destination if you want to do anything. Without the relay, you just have to wait half a year or more until planetary conjunctions bring you close enough (and again, only for Moho through to Duna).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-10T00:46:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2017 12:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-10T14:46:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been using a \u0022Comm buoy seeder-system\u0022 where I send a large relay sat holding 3 smaller relay buoy\u0027s.
