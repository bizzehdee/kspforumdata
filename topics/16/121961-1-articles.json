I intend to use the mk4 cockpit and cargo bay to transport a fairly large rover to various places, but I cant get the damn thing to gattach to the cargo bay. It either mounts to a place between the cargo bay and the cockpit (so that half of it is sticking out in the cargo bay, the other is hidden in the wall to the cockpit), or it mounts to the outside of the fuselage of the cargo bay. I\u0027ve tried using a decoupler aswell, but that changed nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something I\u0027ve missed, some button i\u0027m not pressing?

I did not know about the ALT \u0022trick\u0022, that will save me alot of frustration in the future. But the problem is still occuring. I have the rover as part of a sub-assembly and as a individual save in the SPH. When i load the rover from sub-assembly (it has a rover core and is essentialy a probe with fuel tanks and wheels), that makes the rover \u0022red\u0022 insted of \u0022green\u0022, and it wont attach to anything. It has no attachment nodes. However, if I load the rover from the SPH and try to select the mk4 cockpit, it is the cockpit that\u0027s red. It will attach to the decoupler/docking port on the rover, but not to the cargo bay, since that is also red. Is there anyway to \u0022merge\u0022 the to without any part becoming \u0022red\u0022 and unattachable? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*edit: When I say red, I mean the light red shading that occurs when you bring the mouse over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*edit: It finally worked. Loading the rover form SPH, attached it with two docikng ports facing each other and attached the cockpit in the other end of the docking port. Attached the cargo bay furthermost from the cockpit first and then added smaller cargo bays closer to the cockpit to fill the gap. Kind of had to wrap the rover. It was hangig in the air, attached to the docking port. Then wraped it with cargo bays, starting from the rear. This in case anyone struggles with the same. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Last edit: turns out it didn\u0027t work like I thought. The parts were overlapping in the cargo bay, which is the reason they suddenly attached. What did work was to change the root part of the sub-assembly rover from the rover body to the docking port on the rover. That created attachment nodes on the docking port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your help! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-29T19:58:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2015 07:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sebbemann\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T19:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll right.
