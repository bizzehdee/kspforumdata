I\u0027m running the most recent version of KSP in Career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve carefully setup to pairs of boosters around a large central core ( core is the huge four engine cluster with two large ranks above. Each booster is one if those twin engines with orange large tank an cone. \u00A0 I\u0027m\u00A0\u00A0using a single large hydraulic decoupler roughly at the mass center of the boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI set up the asparagus staging using those yellow ducts to plumb from Paul 1 to pair 2 then into the core tanks. \u00A0 And setup the decoupler staging to shed the booster pairs in the same order.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut test flights so far gave been less than successful. The problems I get are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) not getting sequential high burn rate on outer tanks first.
