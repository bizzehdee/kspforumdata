You see for a rocket to be aerodynamically stable it must have more drag on its rear than at the front. That\u0027s why rockets have nose cones at the front and fins at the back. It\u0027s also the same reason why arrows have feathers (called \u0022fletchings\u0022) at the back. When the arrow flies through the air if there\u0027s any deviation between the direction it\u0027s flying in vs the direction the arrow head is pointed at the fletchings will exert a force to pull the arrow back into alignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow in KSP most parts have a default drag value of 0.2, the actual drag they case on the rocket in flight is then their mass times 0.2. However when you look at aerospike engines you\u0027ll notice that they have a drag of 0.1. By putting lots of aerospike on the tail end of your rocket you create a vehicle that\u0027s more aerodynamic on it\u0027s rear end than at the front. So when this rocket is launched it\u0027s as if you\u0027re trying to throw an arrow with the fletching end first towards something. This configuration is known as \u0022dynamically unstable\u0022 because once you have any angle of attack where the rocket is not exactly pointed at the direction it\u0027s going (say, when you start gravity turn) the aerodynamic forces actually force the rocket to go further off course rather than try to put it back to its heading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is another engineering challenge for Eve return vehicle since you have to use some aerospike engines due to their great Isp in the atmosphere and thus you get dynamically unstable rockets. To correct this I recommend a lot of aerodynamic control surfaces so that the greater altitude control overcomes the instability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re in the upper atmosphere where there\u0027s less air aerospike will cease to be a problem since the destabilising force becomes negligible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tokay Gris","CreatedById":58301,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T23:20:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Temstar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Temstar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI can see you have a lot of aerspike engines, these are the culprits.
