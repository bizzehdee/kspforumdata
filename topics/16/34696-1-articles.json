Though I don\u0027t think I can do that with one ship sadly, due to part count limits, I\u0027m still in the process of sending unmanned probes to scout for landing sites, setup kethane miners etc. so the infrastructure is ready and waiting for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I did wonder if anyone knew of a limit for putting 100 kerbals, either in ships/habitats or on the surface, in a small area - will the game freak out or be rendered unplayable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I know most people are probably ahead of me in terms of achievements, I don\u0027t have a huge amount of time to spend playing and still get a buzz from \u0022the small stuff\u0022 and telling a story so I\u0027m hoping to post an account of my progress here sometime soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaedinator","CreatedById":27680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T12:17:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E100 Kerbals mean 25 Hab Modules. You could build 5 Towers with 5 Hab modules either stacked or sidely attached, whatever you like more, then only solarpanels a probe core, landing legs and parachutes (you should mount them detachable on your towers with radial decouplers and trusses, so you can destroy them after you landed). If you keep your designs low on parts your colony could be between 100-300 parts which is definetly playable. Tip: If you want to save some time waiting for transfer windows to duna, dock all towers together in kerbin orbit, like a train. Attach a big interplanetary tug on the end and send them all at once to duna. Once on Orbit, send and land one module at a time every orbit, just begin your deorbit burn(this stage can be designed to be detachable too) at the same position everytime so you hit your colony location.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
