The upper stage immediately swings upside down and just sort of swings back and forth like a pendulum on a grandfather clock. The upper stage consist (from bottom up) of an LV-909, an FL-200 tank, the storage bay with a couple goo canisters inside, a small reaction wheel, and then the sputnik ball unmanned control pod. Something like this would fly correctly in previous versions of the game. I guess maybe it\u0027s balancing issues, and I understand there are new aerodynamics to take into account \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC but it just doesn\u0027t look right at all the way it behaves in mid-flight. Is this the way the mechanics are supposed to work now? It seems to me, in reality, if something like that was going in a certain direction - even if it\u0027s heavier at the top, the momentum is going to keep it going that way. There is nothing changing much aerodynamically when the first stage separates. It doesn\u0027t matter if I fire the 909 or just leave it off - as soon as I separate, the rocket immediately starts swinging upside down like a pendulum. It really takes me out of the game. I don\u0027t understand why they seemed to have the physics right on that before, and now it just seems silly.\n\nIs this just me?"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T15:19:08Z","Content":"Judging from your description of what is happening, I would wager that the ass-end of your rocket is heavier than the top. You can stick some fins near the rear end to try and counter this, but if the center of mass is too far behind the center of drag, it will continue to flip. \n\nI don\u0027t know the actual weights off-hand, but I\u0027m fairly confident the fuel tank \u002B 909 is heavier than the service bay and sputnik."},{"CreatedByName":"chrisb2e9","CreatedById":87224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T15:34:57Z","Content":"Pictures would really help here. But i\u0027m guessing that you have a lot of drag inducing objects near the top. Once you stage the rocket, the drag at the top overcomes the rocket\u0027s ability to counter it with thrust.\n\nIf you have farings, use them. Otherwise use control surfaces on the bottom of that second stage to give you the ability to counter act the drag."},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T15:51:21Z","Content":"You can also move the fuel tank above the storage bay to move that mass higher\n\nIf you add fins to the bottom of your second stage, you\u0027ll need to add more to the bottom of your first stage as well, so that you don\u0027t flip over during first-stage flight\n\nAnother idea is to cram the probe core into the storage bay so that you can put an aerodynamic nosecone at the top to reduce drag there"}]}
