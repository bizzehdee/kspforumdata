Extra tanks attached via decouplers with crossfeed enabled or fuel ducts to feed into the main tanks are a good way of doing it, sometimes with extra engines on those tanks to compensate for the really low TWRs you get with those kinds of big, heavy, slow ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other option is c) cheat with mods.

You can use gravity assists to get a solar periapsis touching moho and a solar apoapsis touching eve, but you can\u0027t do any better than that, and you still have to pay a fairly high price in intercept speed. that cannot be avoided. you can save a lot over more conservative approaches anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe general rule is that the more your orbit is different from the orbit of your target planet, the higher the intercept speed will be. This is why if you go to eeloo from kerbin you end up with 1300 m/s of intercept speed, while if you start from jool you get almost nothing. with moho, your main issue is minimizing intercept deltaV, and you use gravity assists from eve to make your orbit as similar as possible to that of moho. Now, as I discuss in the first mission report, ideally you would want to meet moho at its solar periapsis, but there is also the issue of orbital inclination; it\u0027s probably a bit more efficient to use eve to equalize orbital inclination, even if that results in meeting moho far from periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trick to multiple gravity assist, again as explained in the first mission report linked, is to enter a resonant orbit. Eve makes an orbit in 261.95 days, so you want to take a gravity assist that will result in a trajectory with an orbital time that will generate a resonance; for example an orbit lasting 175.7 days, so that 3 of your orbits will equal 2 orbits of Eve, and you\u0027ll get to eve again for another gravity assist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224149949\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208774\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221656531115\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the neat part.

Of course, your eve periapsis must be angled just right for this manuever to work: that\u0027s the purpose of the correction burn (here yellow) and also of the original burn.

It must also be close to your solar periapsis, and as close as possible to moho solar periapsis. notice how none of those conditions is respected perfectly, but all are \u0022good enough\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022WopSg3m.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WopSg3m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, when passing at solar periapsis, make a small manuever to change the time of your orbit so you can syncronize it to meet moho at a later orbit. In this case, by setting up a manuever forward and clicking repeatedy \u0022next orbit\u0022, I was able to discover that in 1 year 120 days I\u0027d be passing very close to moho. at this point, a small 2.5 m/s burn was enough to get an intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe violet manuever is the one I used for this, and I\u0027m also using it to refine the encounter, setting a properly low moho periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, having followed all those steps to ensure my orbit would be as similar as possible to moho\u0027s orbit, I get an intercept deltaV of 1750 m/s - including the cost for circularization.
