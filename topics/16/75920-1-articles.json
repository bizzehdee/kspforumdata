Why?","CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T14:35:33Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T14:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a probe that I had sent to Mercury (using RSS) for a flyby. I\u0027ve just finished the pass and collected all of my science, so this isn\u0027t as big of a problem as it could have been, but on loading the game the next time, said probe is no longer on its original orbit which would have had it swing out past the orbit of Earth again. Instead, it\u0027s now got an orbital speed of 62646.8m/s and is on an arcing escape trajectory about 70 million Km above the orbital plane of the planets. What are the possible causes of this and what can I do to fix it / prevent it from happening again in the future. Again, I\u0027m essentially done with this probe, though it might have lucked out with another encounter at some point in the future, but I want to make sure this doesn\u0027t happen to something that took a lot more effort to build and launch like a Mars colonization mission or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-25T23:56:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2014 11:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oafman","CreatedById":110386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T15:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you time warp through an SoI change?
