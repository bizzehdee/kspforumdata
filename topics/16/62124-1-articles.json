I\u0027ve figured out how to get two craft next to each other; I even have two where their docking adapters touch. But the adapters just bounce pointlessly off each other. The magnets don\u0027t seem to engage. (Actually, they seemed to engage the first time, but the next time I loaded, the craft were no longer docked. Since then, I\u0027ve been unable to get them to dock.) Things I\u0027ve tried: Making sure the docking shroud is open (it is); turning off ASAS in both craft; trying docking mode instead of staging mode; making sure the right craft and object is targeted. Regardless of what I do, the craft won\u0027t dock.

SAS tries to keep you pointing in one direction come hell or high water, MJ stabilizes your vehicle so it doesn\u0027t go out of control, but it doesn\u0027t fight you when you\u0027re trying to input commands. Frankly, the stock SAS is bollocks compared to it. I don\u0027t think docking would be possible for me without MJ\u0027s KILL ROT function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo actually do the dock, you need to touch the parts together slowly. They have a lot of docking part magnitism compared to real-life docking clamps, I understand, but even then it\u0027s very, very small compared to actually doing it. Expect to get it wrong and wind up nudging your docking partner where you weren\u0027t expecting, first time or two. Does this remind you of anything?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with that something I won\u0027t mention by name, the trick is to take it slow and easy. Line up the docking ports, get them drifting together from as near as head-on as you can, and if it\u0027s slow enough and close enough, let the magnitism take care of the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, technically, only the lighter participant in the docking actually needs RCS thrusters. The heavier one you\u0027re probably not going to want to be maneuvering around the lighter one, so just use its reaction wheels to get it pointing the way you want it to go. My first thought was to point it above the plane of the solar system and point the other one down, but that proved much less practical than pointing it prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jiawen","CreatedById":44554,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T03:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taki117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taki117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eok, this sounds like the docking bug, I say this because you are using the shielded docking ports and it is nigh impossible to screw placement of those up.
