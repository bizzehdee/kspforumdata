I also run FAR\u002BDRE amoungst other mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is you will need struts or run Kerbal Joint Reinforcement by Ferram4, same guy who does FAR. But it is still recommended you strut things that do not have a solid contact point or are load bearing objects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can avoid the heat by flying higher, around 20-25km you will avoid most of the thick atmosphere with the stock Kerbin scales. My maching bird challenge craft I build sometime ago flew around 22km and did 2201m/s or Mach 6\u002B without air hogging and burning up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other option is to edit your parts cfg files and increase their heat resistance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-27T14:51:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2014 02:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
