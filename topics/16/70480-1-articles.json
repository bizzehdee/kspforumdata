When Jool is in a planetary alignment with Kerbin (at a minimum distance from Kerbin), a JIC aimed at \u0022Kerbin\u0022 will have too narrow of an angle-of-coverage, and won\u0027t pick up the KIC\u0027s. You\u0027ll experience gaps in coverage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, I keep them \u003Cstrong\u003Einside\u003C/strong\u003E the Mun\u0027s orbit, but highly polar, so that no matter where the Mun is, at least one of them can see \u0022over\u0022 or \u0022under\u0022 it, even if the others are occluded (behind Kerbin, blocked by the Mun, etc). That way, my interplanetary sats can aim at the parent body (Kerbin) instead of at individual satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy KLC \u0022repeaters\u0022, then, (Kerbin Local Comsats) are the ones which are responsible for making sure that that signal can reach any point on the planet\u0027s surface, and I have the classic geostationary satellite network. Signal tends to bounce from KSC to KLC-1 (overhead), to one of the KIC\u0027s, and then outbound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are other configurations, of course -- in one of my saves, I opted for three main comstations, outside of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, but in a coplanar orbit. Rather than trying to make direct connections from Kerbin to anywhere, Kerbin broadcast to those, and they sent the signal further. That covered me for when my target was on the wrong side of the sun, and provided a shorter signal delay in most cases, but made for more manual targeting as I\u0027d have to set up the communication path by targeting the comstation\u0027s satellite at Jool, and targeting Jool at the appropriate comstation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo your question, let\u0027s start with, what are you trying to gain by the highly elliptical orbits? I\u0027m intrigued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were going to try this, I\u0027d start out by setting up two Kerbal Alarm Clock time markers exactly six hours apart. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the first KAC alarm, I\u0027d launch polar (e.g., make your gravity turn a little bit to the left of \u0022North\u0022), settling into about an 85-degree North north-west inclination. I\u0027d track that inclination with KER during my launch (don\u0027t worry if its way wrong while under 40km, its only once you\u0027re a long way into the burn that it starts converging on the true inclination). Burn to a fairly circular orbit at your intended periapsis, leave that craft in a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the second one to the launch pad. Set it up with \u0022target\u0022 equal to the first craft. Fast-forward to the second KAC alarm. Follow the same launch profile as above. Once you\u0027re up \u0026amp; circular, you should be very close to co-planar. I\u0027d adjust one of the two to the other\u0027s plane at the Ascending Node or Descending Node, as though you\u0027re making a rendezvous, but without actually docking or worrying about your closest approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen plot your burns to create the elliptical orbits, one as it cross the North Pole, one as it crosses the South Pole. As before, match the SMA\u0027s. I\u0027m not sure what kind of resonance you\u0027ll want (both close at the same time, or opposite each other) so you\u0027ll have to pick your own timing for those burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sense?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
