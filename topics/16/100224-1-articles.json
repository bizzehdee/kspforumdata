I\u0027ve been playing for a decent amount of time (about 500 hours) and I\u0027ve made SSTO spaceplanes before, also SR71-type jets that skim the upper atmosphere, but for some reason I can\u0027t figure this out. \n\nI feel that i WAS pretty familiar with high-altitude flight but it seems that since the .90 update my stock turbojet engines have a crazy power loss at 1000m/s, which doesn\u0027t make sense. According to the .cfg file\u0027s velocityCurve data the engine should be pushing full power output at 1000m/s, trailing off to 50% at 2000m/s, but that\u0027s not appearing to be the case here. Once the jet hits 1000m/s the engine loses so much power that the jet just sits at 1060m/s and will not go any faster, regardless if I\u0027m at 18km altitude or 25km. It\u0027s happened on every craft so far. No mods installed, except kerbal engineer redux for more vessel info. I\u0027ve does various tests to try to narrow down what\u0027s causing it. TWR ranging from .9 all the way to 2.5, as well as making sure there\u0027s plenty of intake air to be used (never a flameout). I\u0027ve even tried modifying the velocityCurve to improve performance (100% at 2000m/s) and still no dice. The ONLY time the planes will go over 1100m/s at ANY altitude is if i set \u0022useVelocityCurve = false\u0022, and when it\u0027s set to false, I have no problem getting to orbit with the exact same jets.\n\nHere\u0027s the default velocityCurve data for the Turbojet Engine:\n\n    velocityCurve    {        key = 0 0.5 0 0        key = 1000 1 0 0        key = 2000 0.5 0 0        key = 2400 0 0 0    }\n\nAnd here\u0027s how i\u0027ve tried modifying it with zero success:\n\n    velocityCurve    {        key = 0 0.5 0 0        key = 1000 1 0 0        key = 2000 1 0 0        key = 2400 0 0 0    }\n\nFrom googling it I\u0027ve pretty much gathered that in the key, the first number is your speed in m/s, the second number is a percentage of max thrust (0.5 being 50%). SO, since it\u0027s a FloatCurve, there SHOULD be an engine power loss for the default engine after 1000m/s, but it should start small and scale down to 50% at 2000, but it doesn\u0027t, it\u0027s cutting to less than 50% immediately (feels exactly like a governor in a vehicle). Especially the case with the modified version, there should be NO power loss. I\u0027m scratching my head with this and it\u0027s becoming an obsession to figure this out. Hopefully someone smarter than me will have an answer for this and hopefully a fix...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-20T18:27:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2015 06:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by brothertim**\n  \nAnswered"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T17:20:20Z","Content":"Do you use FAR? I have no trouble with stock souposphere and highaltitude 2000m/s speed on stock turbojets. As far as I know, FAR modifies the jet engines, might be it. You wouldn\u0027t see the changes on the stock part config files because its done via modulemanager.

No, turbojets don\u0027t ever go to Mach 7. No, you can\u0027t call it a ram jet, they don\u0027t go that fast either (and don\u0027t go that slow either). No, you can\u0027t call it a Scimitar precooled engine, even that futuristic concept never gets above mach 5.5. Stock jet stats are completely insane, remove challenge from spaceplane design and kill any reason to use realistically balanced engines added by B9. New configs solve that while still leaving them perfectly viable for your spaceplanes, - just on equal rights with any other engine in this mod.\n\nSo I guess B9 requires FAR as well as new spaceplane designs for hypersonic speeds. Oh well, back to the drawing board.
