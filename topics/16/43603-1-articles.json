Now I docked a new module. It\u0027s an empty Mark 1-2 capsule. I cleared it off Kerbals before liftoff and controlled the Vessel remotely. I want to use this thing as a return system. I can transfer Kerbals to this Capsule via EVA now. Whenever I undock, the Kerbal disappears, though. As soon as I undock, he is gone and not part of the new vessel. As long as the Mark1-2 is part of the station I can choose my Kerbal and get him out without a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecu\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeter\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-25T09:12:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2013 09:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by groom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spyritdragon","CreatedById":70515,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T13:42:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you\u0027re saying that you connect the Mk1-2 to the station, EVA a kerbal to it, then undock from the station, and he no longer shows up in the Mk1-2?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry right-clicking the exit door and see if he\u0027s there.
