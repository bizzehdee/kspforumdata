The other can be set at rover build time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy reason for asking is that my current understanding is that lift is defined for a part such that it lifts the craft up, and that merely flipping the part over will not change the direction of the lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I wrong?

I am the survivor/victim of countless incidents and over time I have become very good at regaining control in different types of rovers without damage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoss of control is often caused by one or both of two things - terrain and aggressive course correction. Not much you can do about the terrain except anticipate the effect it will have on the rover and/or change the angle/speed at which you meet a feature. There are also bugs in the terrain. I have seen rips in the space-time continuum on Minmus and Ike, driven into bulldust on Gilly and on Eve I keep encountering invisible patches of quicksand which slow and slew the rover. This last one makes me wonder how many times I\u0027ve encountered it before in other places without knowing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easiest way for me to cause loss of control is by changing course. Do it too fast and I\u0027m going sideways. If a wheel catches I\u0027m rolling one foot off the deck into the bargain. It is the roll which most often causes the destruction of the rover. The easiest way I\u0027ve found to prevent the initial loss of control is to reduce friction progressively from the back to the front of the rover (my most used rover has 16 wheels - upgraded to 20 for Eve). This also helps to keep the rover pointed straight during aggressive braking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA simple test I use at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to help determine the worthiness of a rover is to take it to top or near top speed then hold down the left or right control key. If it rolls, I don\u0027t want it. But it can be interesting to see how much I have to change the friction settings to prevent the roll. In the following screenshots the rover is taken to 20.0m/s before holding down the left key (numpad 4). In the first the friction is left at the default 1.0/1.0 and a roll ensues. In the second the friction has been changed to 0.4/1.1 and no roll. I wouldn\u0027t advocate such drastic change for Kerbin but it does illustrate how the friction setting can influence loss of control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 16 wheeler does about 75m/s at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E with both Verniers burning. It doesn\u0027t even look like it is remotely close to rolling when I apply full lock but every now and then I get to see it suddenly flip upside down on some planet or moon so no matter the design or the setup, bad things will still happen.

If you watch racecars, they either have oversteer or understeer. Oversteer means they spin out. Understeer means that you try to turn and not much\u00A0happens. There is a balance point between those two extremes that all racecars try to find. To balance them, the racecars tweak the downforce on the front and back to increase or decrease friction at those points. There is no magic number, but the safest answer is to always be on the understeer side. That makes it harder to go around corners, but at least the car is driveable. A car that spins out regularly from oversteer is not driveable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-28T23:14:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223441180\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177856\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221535443746\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022176515\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Apaseall\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Apaseall said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy rover is extreme in size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait, time out yet again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich wheels are you using?\u00A0 The really big ones?\u00A0 Those steer like a tank does, not like wheels do.\u00A0\u00A0 So when you turn right with those wheels, all the wheels on the left go forward, and the wheels on the right either stop or go backward (I don\u0027t know which in this case).\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 So when you are at speed, and you try to turn, you\u0027re going to spin out, regardless of how much downforce, or any other force you have.\u00A0\u00A0 One set of wheels will not be turning in the same direction that they are traveling!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pic of your rover, as requested many posts ago, would probably clear up a lot of confusion.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apaseall","CreatedById":176515,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-29T07:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223441533\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177856\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221535498080\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait, time out yet again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich wheels are you using?\u00A0 The really big ones?\u00A0 Those steer like a tank does, not like wheels do.\u00A0\u00A0 So when you turn right with those wheels, all the wheels on the left go forward, and the wheels on the right either stop or go backward (I don\u0027t know which in this case).\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 So when you are at speed, and you try to turn, you\u0027re going to spin out, regardless of how much downforce, or any other force you have.\u00A0\u00A0 One set of wheels will not be turning in the same direction that they are traveling!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pic of your rover, as requested many posts ago, would probably clear up a lot of confusion.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not had any luck with trying to post images here in the past. Also I do keep working on this rover, both in terms of what is inside it and yesterday I removed whole body chunks including a pair of wheels. I believe the wheels are from Kerbal Foundries. I have got into the region of 70\u002Bm/s turning now which is a vast improvement. In fact now the issue is not turning at all lol closely followed by over heating which blows the rubber off! That is a bit tricky since this craft is currently not piloted by a kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-26T13:49:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223441403\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177856\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221535482993\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/28/2018 at 4:03 PM, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI disagree with Lisias myself. If you watch racecars, they either have oversteer or understeer. Oversteer means they spin out. Understeer means that you try to turn and not much\u00A0happens. There is a balance point between those two extremes that all racecars try to find. To balance them, the racecars tweak the downforce on the front and back to increase or decrease friction at those points. There is no magic number, but the safest answer is to always be on the understeer side. That makes it harder to go around corners, but at least the car is driveable. A car that spins out regularly from oversteer is not driveable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand what you mean, but I think you are misguided on your conclusions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRaceCars spins out not by \u0022oversteering\u0022, but by losing friction from the back wheels - the centrifugal force is bigger than the friction the wheels can provide. You are misunderstanding cause and effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy making the back wheels \u0022heavier\u0022 (the most effective way to add friction to the wheels), you need to add \u0022weight\u0022 into the front wheels as well, or you loose authority from them on the turns - there\u0027s no point on allowing the back wheels to be more \u0022resilient\u0022 to turns that your front wheels can\u0027t sustain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn RaceCars, the canonical way of adding \u0022weight\u0022 on the wheels is by \u0022inverted\u0022\u00A0lifting surfaces and ground effect. Way better than make the car heavier by adding mass (for obvious reasons). However, such lifting surfaces add a lot of drag in exchange for the lifting, so you must compromise between your ability to survive turns and your ability to go really fast on the straights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind that the \u0022oversteer\u0022 and \u0022understeer\u0022 is highly related to the car\u0027s current kinetic energy, i.e., varies as you go faster or slower. So you can\u0027t define a \u0022oversteer\u0022 cutoff as the car must be steerable on\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eall\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0speeds it will handle on the race track - including slow speeds while dodging debris from accidents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
