Nosecones are there to push the air out of the way around the sides of the fuselage. Pushing air anywhere is basically drag, even if you\u0027re super-streamlined and hardly push it at all. Meanwhile, intakes are there to suck air into the fuselage, and not push it around at all. To put this in terms of pressure, a cone increases the air pressure in front, whereas an intake, due to airflow through the engine, creases low air pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP these effects are divided between the supersonic thrust increase seen in jet engines (IRL caused by slipstreaming airflow through the engine turbines) and the very low drag profiles of the intakes, but really the thrust increase should be directly tied to the intake and not the engine, and the low drag of the intakes should only apply if they\u0027re attached to the front of an engine nacelle, i.e. a hollow tube through which air will flow. The drag profile of a closed intake should be at least as high as that of a low-drag nosecone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T07:35:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIts been empircally tested that shock cones make the nest nose cones.\u003Cp\u003EIts also been empirically tested that for some reason... all nose cones and such perform better if rotated 180 degrees.... although not be that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I can confirm it - I\u0027ve used his craft and it\u0027s definitely capable of orbit.
