The rocket is orbiting Vall currently, and it needed more fuel to land on it so I sent another ship to dock with it and refuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce docked the problem of having to fuel each tank equally popped up. There seems to be nothing that helps with that. All I could do was refuel some tanks, but the other tanks won\u2019t have the same amount of fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich I also think is the reason that causes me to spin uncontrollably whenever I throttle all the way up because of some tanks being heavier than the others thanks to them having more fuel!\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow am I supposed to do this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-24T07:36:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo transfer fuel, you select two tanks, right? One source, one destination? Well, the trick here is that you don\u0027t need to stop at two tanks. You can select as many as you want, and then do 1-\u0026gt;N or N-\u0026gt;1 type transfers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your case, you would select your six large fuel tanks, and then one of the tanks of the refuelling vessel. Then you order that one tank to empty itself. Its contents will be equally distributed to the six other tanks. Afterwards, if the refuelling vessel has other tanks too, you deselect the empty one and select a new one, while still keeping the six destination tanks selected. And then you just repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case you ever encounter a situation where one of your ships has tanks in hard to reach places, or just a really large number, you can also use the resource overview window in the toolbar to select a resource, which will select all tanks that contain this particular resource.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-24T14:14:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf youre open to mods, theres a couple that make this easy, and have a lot more flexibility/functionality.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTAC Fuel Balancer, for one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2395825191\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/186526-112x-tac-fuel-balancer/\u0026amp;ct=1635084929\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:218px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-24T14:56:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002298962\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Streetwind\u003C/a\u003E has it right for what you \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E have done.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EBut now that you already transferred fuel unevenly, the only thing you can do is manually transfer fuel between tanks to try and equalize the weight distribution (\u003Cem\u003Eyou do know you can stop a fuel transfer before a tank is full/empty, right?\u003C/em\u003E). \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003EAnd learn to transfer fuel symmetrically for the next time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, this is the reason whenever I have a tanker ship (i.e. pretty often in my missions), I make sure to give it plenty of reaction wheels, so that it won\u0027t spin out of control even if the thrust is a bit off-center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TIMEFORSPACEPEOPLE","CreatedById":212789,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-24T21:52:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Problem solved everyone, thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
