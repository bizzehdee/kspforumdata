In the first picture, I suppose the tank is upright when picked up, but not hovering over the vehicle. Move your mouse so that its connection ball is where the vehicle\u0027s connection ball is. It should snap right into place just below the upper tank. To make it more clear: Don\u0027t move your mouse pointer to where the vehicle\u0027s connection ball is. Instead, move your mouse so that the part\u0027s connection ball touches the vehicle\u0027s connection ball.
