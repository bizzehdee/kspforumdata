When it comes to making these, it it better to set out design constraints/targets to aim for. Do you want an long-range air superiority fighter? You\u0027ll probably want to design it to be able to carry many fuel tanks but be able to drop them for improved maneuverability when dogfighting. Want an interceptor?
