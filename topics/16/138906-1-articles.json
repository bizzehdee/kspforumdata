However torque wheels are not very effective on anything but the lightest of ships, the main engines have to be running to have any effect, and fins are useless in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRCS is more powerful, and has the added advantage of allowing movement in all directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo use it, you need Monopropellant - basically a propellant that contains both fuel and oxidiser together which burn when passed over a catalyst. It\u0027s slightly less powerful than LF-O per unit of mass, but more convenient in the small quantities required for RCS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for very small probes (and Kerbals on EVA), it can replace engines entirely, especially if you dont have any tiny rocket engines available and don\u0027t want to go too far (because again, it is always somewhat inefficient, and monoprop is heavy).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, RCS also requires little plumbing, so can be attached anywhere on a ship and will use whatever monopropellant you have on board.
