In either case the correction is going to be minimal. If an encounter is absolutely unavoidable you would need to adjust your orbit when inside the Mun\u0027s SoI so that when you exit your correction burn is minimized (Since the dV requirement for a correction inside the Mun\u0027s SoI is going to be cheaper than outside it. Launching from a Munar orbit is going to be infinitely more trouble than just dealing with the gravity assist.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T19:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never thought to adjust inside Munar SOI. I\u0027ll attempt this (hopefully tomorrow).
