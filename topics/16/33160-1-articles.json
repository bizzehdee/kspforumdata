I put a large ship into orbit with 10 docking ports(5 either side) and am in the process of putting together a fuel/rcs rig for the side of it. My question is if there is any way to line up docking ports on the rig to the exact location(X,Y,Z) of the ones on the main ship. I have dug through the quicksave file and have found the lines (dockingport2) with the location but am not 100% sure how the format works. If anyone has any ideas on how this could be done i\u0027d appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AncientAstronaut","CreatedById":36093,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T23:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot exactly sure what you\u0027re asking, but if you\u0027re just trying to dock, all you have to do is set the docking port target as \u0022target\u0022 and either manually line up the two ports or hit (PAR -) on MechJeb\u0027s \u0022Smart ASS\u0022.
