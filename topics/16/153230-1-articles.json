clarification, I\u0027m using an unmodded 64 bit KSP 1.2.1 running on Windows 7 professional 64 bit OS with 16 GB of memory.\u00A0 On an unrelated topic, one that deserves its own thread or a comment on an existing thread, I have been able to almost completely eliminate the garbage heap collection (Unity memory housekeeping) stutter on my system, though I still have to restart the game if I\u0027ve been playing it for several hours straight and the stutter/jitter comes back.\u00A0 First of all, I don\u0027t have any non-hardware related services or startup items enabled on Windows, at all, and have disabled all non-Microsoft scheduled tasks and anything else that could be using memory for no reason.\u00A0 Then, I use two free utilities to free up even more memory by stopping services that aren\u0027t needed for gaming.\u00A0 Third, and most important, run KSP in a frameless window (fake full screen) instead of full screen.\u00A0 Not only does this greatly improve the lag time from Unity\u0027s garbage collection, it completely solves the GPU overheat problem when KSP is running in the background.\u00A0 I\u0027m even able to stream Netflix in HD and have browsers with several tabs open and be playing KSP with almost no jitter from Unity\u0027s garbage collection.\u00A0 I hope this helps someone and I\u0027ll look for a more appropriate thread to post it

it took me six hours, but I built a flying snow plow truck, and shoveled/shoved the part up the Mk. 3 Cargo Ramp.\u00A0 The Rovemax Model XL3 clips through the middle, horribly, making it hard to get into the bay, which it barely fits in.\u00A0 I called the recovery ship \u0022the whale\u0022 because it would open its maw and chomp down on the rover wheel.\u00A0 I could not use any time warping except physics warping up to 4X, or the part would slide through the bay.\u00A0 It would have taken almost 3 days of real time to get it back from Minumus at that rate, so several times I went back to the Tracking Station and used Time Warp there, until I saw the icons for the part and the ship drift apart, then I would have to go back to The Whale and swallow the part again.\u00A0 After 6 hours building, flying, and returning the craft, the mission was complete.\u00A0 You didn\u0027t think I\u0027d abandon a mission just because it\u0027s impossible due to a bug, did you?\u00A0 Here are some
