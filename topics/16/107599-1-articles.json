So far the only steerable nose gear is that Cessna-like toy-gear. Am I missing something or how can you steer a bigger aicraft on the ground?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T10:30:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 10:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bogeyman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten 2X4B 523P","CreatedById":134404,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T07:52:37Z","Content":"I havent opened up the later ones yet (career player), but if theyre anything like the small landing gear, right click on it and select \u0022unlock steering\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Merandix","CreatedById":135352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T09:17:09Z","Content":"Correct, medium and heavy landing gears don\u0027t have steering. Heavy can be excused for being a bogie, and those generally don\u0027t steer. But Medium absolutely NEEDS to have the option since it\u0027s the wheel to go to to use as a nose-wheel when using heavies for main gear.\n\nFor now, you just have to force your nose about on the ground, or use a hardpoint to mount your small nosegear on (though it looks silly). I suspect the landing gear aren\u0027t fully done yet."},{"CreatedByName":"Bogeyman","CreatedById":136919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T10:07:12Z","Content":"Is there like a \u0022wishlist\u0022 in this forum where you could post things like that to make the developers aware of such things? don\u0027t get me wrong, this program is A-W-E-S-O-M-E, but this should be changed."},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T10:11:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there like a \u0022wishlist\u0022 in this forum where you could post things like that to make the developers aware of such things? don\u0027t get me wrong, this program is A-W-E-S-O-M-E, but this should be changed.\n\nYou mean like the [Suggestions and Development Discussion](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/59-Suggestions-and-Development-Discussion) forum?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bogeyman","CreatedById":136919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T10:30:38Z","Content":"Ah, did not see this (newbie ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:43:23Z","Content":"Well if you still want something to complain to SQUAD about, the wheels don\u0027t rotate either.
