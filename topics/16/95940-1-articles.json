But you have to first assign your old station as \u0027ship\u0027 or \u0027probe\u0027, and your new module as \u0027station\u0027. When they docked together, the \u0027ship or \u0027probe\u0027 will be a part of your new \u0027station\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whoozy","CreatedById":76484,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T18:17:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, I\u0027ll try that next.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr-Drunk","CreatedById":132802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T18:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo it\u0027s not possible. For you to complete a contract the station or base has to be completely new.

I don\u0027t think the station contracts have specific orbit requirements (at least the FinePrint mod didn\u0027t).
