A rocket carrying a behemoth to and from eves surface that has the ability to glide once it reenters the atmosphere for a precision landing, shed it\u0027s wings and fairings and lands because i wan\u0027t to navigate to eves 7500m peak. It does this, I tested it, and I\u0027m very happy with it. The craft is pure stock.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PvDxZLQ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022569\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PvDxZLQ.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has 3 inflatable heatshields. The craft cannot turn once it has reentered the atmosphere to shed the inflatable heatshields, because it will get out of control when I do. It has to maintain it\u0027s nose in the direction of the prograde marker during descend, and recovering in flight will take to much time and cause me to lose altitude and I\u0027ll not be able to glide far enough. So the heatshield must be jetissoned and safely removed while facing prograde.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is a problem, but not impossible to solve. All 3 heatshields have engines attached to them. Although you can only see the skipper engines on the 2 outer shields. The central has one to underneath.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure if they produce enough power to actually shed, but if not I\u0027ll upgrade to mainsails or even vectors if that proves necessary. Each engine is attached to a small fuel tank.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the picture I have already staged the outer shields, they\u0027re floating now. Stage \u002214\u0022 is the center heatshield decoupler and the engine attached to it, also having a engine with a fuel duct ensuring it get\u0027s it\u0027s requirements met. When I stage that one it will float away, just like the other 2 outer heatshields. The engines do not ignite.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs you can see my throttle is put at full power.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCan anybody tell me why the engines do not light?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs this a bug?
