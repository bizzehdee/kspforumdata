To stop the dreaded rocket wobble, I partly secure these loads with struts. Initially I used quite a few (remembering various Bridge Building games I\u0027ve played) but, as time goes by, I\u0027m finding I can get the job done with less and less. Is there a limit to the load a strut can take before breaking? Whenever something does break up in flight it always seems to be another part that fails first.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-04T17:06:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2015 05:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Clipperride\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattssheep4","CreatedById":146984,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T16:33:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never had a problem with struts failing, and often 3 or 4 is plenty for whatever task I put them to, but idk if there is a limit of not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T16:50:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStruts are quite strong, but so are most connections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to think of connections as something tied down with a piece of string. That connection may be rather strong in the sense that you can dangle a lot of weight from it before it finally gives way, but it\u0027s not exactly rigid: no matter how hard you try to tie a tight knot, it will always have a little leeway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main benefit of struts is that they give you a second (third, whatever) attachment point. If you chose the attachment points right, you can make do with very few of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest you look at truss bridges for inspiration.

They are overpowered by necessity. You are using less and less because you are learning to recognize key places where struts are important. The whole \u0022Moar Struts\u0022 thing is funny, but realistically, spamming struts in current game versions is unnecessary if you know how to strategically place them (that wasn\u0027t always the case, there were versions where strut spamming was the only option)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T17:04:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the answers.
