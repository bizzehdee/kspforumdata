But the issue is this gives the plane some momentum to the left or right. I stop this before launch, but by the the plane is pointing a degree or so off center, and when I try to take off it just veers to the side and crashes!

If your main wheels are in the correct places, this means weight is being lifted off the main wheels but not the nose wheel. So now we have more drag up front than in back, causing a sudden change of stability. Pushing the tail down and the nose up transfers drag from the nos wheel back to the main wheels, stabilizing everything until getting airborne.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T15:07:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have experienced this problem as well.
