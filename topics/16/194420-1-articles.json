I have spent hours on it and I cannot get it to complete, as far as I am aware all conditions have been satisfied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe contract is in the \u0022Explore the Mum\u0022 contract chain. It says you have to 1. rondezvous 2 space crafts around orbit of the mun. 2. Dock two separate vessels on or around Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have launched the same vessel twice so there has been 2 separate launches. The rondezvous was initially completed when I did a rescue mission with the first ship. I sent the second one up to satisfy the docking part of the contract and docked with the first ship that undertook the rescue successfully using the clamp-o-tron jr but it has not completed the 2nd contract criteria.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anybody see what has gone wrong here or know what I can do to fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"overkill13","CreatedById":173506,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-04T01:25:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny chance you docked with an older space station before heading to the Mun?\u00A0 That might not even be a potential issue, as I don\u0027t think these contracts ask for new vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-04T01:26:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2020 01:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by overkill13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Parkiboy","CreatedById":205098,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-04T07:16:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope both vessels went straight to Mun!
