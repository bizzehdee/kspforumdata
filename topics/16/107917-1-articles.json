But a heatshield and recovery near the center should cancel that out.\n\nIs it feasable as a replacement?"},{"CreatedByName":"falloutaddict","CreatedById":140606,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:01:25Z","Content":"Why don\u0027t you strap it to a rocket and find out for us? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kebra","CreatedById":115002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:08:38Z","Content":"30T full tank: [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34119152245942968/30694957F68D8A74D9E21C531EACBC7609C90D96/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34119152245942968/30694957F68D8A74D9E21C531EACBC7609C90D96/)\n\n15t quater tank: [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34119152245953175/D37253C5D04985A704CE5ADDED9B64E456784CBB/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34119152245953175/D37253C5D04985A704CE5ADDED9B64E456784CBB/)\n\nDocking port, 2 drogues, 2 chutes, fuel, shield and a puddle.\n\nLow TWR\n\nTotal weight 30t\n\nIf i lower the fuel in the tank to about 900m/s dV it has 1,73 TWR and 15t, not that bad.\n\nI took it to about 1000km and straight down through the atmosphere without any problems.\n\nSeems to work.
