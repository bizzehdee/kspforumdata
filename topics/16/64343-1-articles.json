But I am just clueless. I made for about 40 types of my \u0022Orbital Watcher\u0022 ships (get it? It\u0027s a joke!) and I am just not able to left them to fly around my planet. Here is what\u0027s happening most of the time: I am creating ship for over 40 minutes, then correcting issues I made for over 20 minutes and if it doesn\u0027t explode on the lauching pad it will (probably) fly. So I decid to hit the spacebar and it\u0027s flying. In the worse scenarios my ship\u0027s too heavy for the rockets to lift it off, or I am not able to control the whole thing and it\u0027ll fall and explode. However if I make it over 10 kilometers I start to think. By this time I am used to have one more stage ready and the second one is still in action. I tried to do gravity turn at 10 kilometers, 11 (I saw it today) or even at 20. It ends either me flying out of the the Solar system or me crushing to the planet below. If I want to perfrom a maneuver I usually don\u0027t have enough fuel to do so.

I tried all my \u0022lucky trinkets\u0022 I own and I decided to fly only with Jeb (he is funny and also, one of my lucky trinkets - even if we fly towards certain death he\u0027s laughing, lunetic. One does not simply stop loving him).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone help me? I understand this is very simply, but I am quite new to this game.

Once your apoapsis (Ap) hits whatever you want it to hit (I usually shoot for at least 75km to give me a margin of error), turn off your engines and coast until you get close to your Ap. Once you get close, point your nose directly at the horizon and turn your engines on full until your periapsis (Pe) is outside the atmosphere. Congratulations!

Follow the nav ball once it comes around and watch your time to Apoapsis (for which you go flying in map mode). You want your time to Apoapsis to be between 35-55 seconds during the bulk of the ascent (i.e. before your speed gets much above 2000 m/s). If it goes under 35 seconds, return to 45 degrees elevation. If it goes over 55 seconds, burn along the horizon (zero elevation). Watch your gee meter (on the right hand side of the nav ball) as you ascend; you want it right at the top of the green zone - throttle back if you need to. Kill the burn when the Apoapsis is where you want it (or go a little higher if your altitude is still relatively low, \u0026lt;~50,000 m).
