Hit the transmit button will try to find available antennas then try to find a idle one if possible. Right click on antenna to transmit will queue ALL data on this antenna and you can\u0027t cancel it (if you stop transmit, data will still be transmit the next time you activate it). So if you have many data, right click on antenna is not recommended (at current version, I think it will be improved, someday).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
