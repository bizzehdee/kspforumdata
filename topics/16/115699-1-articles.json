Mine has 826 m/s right now, should be enough for my rendezvous. Also, when do you launch on Minmus for a rendezvous? Same as Kerbin?"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T06:24:57Z","Content":"Not quite. This is a really varying question. You can do sub-orbits to allow the target time to catch up, you can wait until it\u0027s overhead and go full speed, or fly up and go in circles for a while.\n\nReally you can judge it good yourself by eyeballing it.

Depending on your TWR, you could either get to your target orbit well before your target is close enough, or you\u0027ll take so long your target will have made another orbit by the time you\u0027ve established yours (Though I think only Ion-engine level landers would be that slow)\n\nHowever, Minmus is fairly easy to get around, so I\u0027d say raise your targets orbit a bit (provided its a return ship and not a station) so you\u0027ll have a bit more wiggle room. IN general, rendezvous in very, very low orbits are going to be very tough as you\u0027ll likely have to go suborbital in order to do it."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T10:08:30Z","Content":"10km isn\u0027t too low for Minmus. My station is at that altitude as well. Always make your orbit bigger than your target, that\u0027s how to do low orbit rendezvous. Using this approach I can do Kerbin 70~75km orbit rendezvous easily w/o ever touching atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T10:55:44Z","Content":"Eh, on Minmus all things are easier. Rendezvous too.\n\nFirst, with all speeds lower all your maneuvers are like - 10m/s, 30m/s, 5m/s...\n\nThen, with the moon being so much smaller, you set up your rendez-vous as on Kerbin, sure there\u0027s like 15km separation as the markers don\u0027t align perfectly - and its 300 meters.\n\nTake it easy. The most likely thing to kill you there is yourself, as you get too twitchy bringing your Kerbin or Mun habits and, say, performing a full-thrust burn and smashing into a mountain instead of gently climbing it.\n\nIn my Science sandbox I got this weird impression... Kerbin is where you launch the ships. Minmus is Home."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T11:03:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Eh, on Minmus all things are easier.\n\nUmm rovers..."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T11:34:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Umm rovers...\n\nFlying!\n\nThe tiny reaction wheels are enough to assure they will stay level.\n\nJust yesterday I got two contracts for seismic scans, Mun and Minmus. Used the same rovers. Mun was tricky, broke off at least three parts after some jumps, including the (vital) seismic scanner (luckily I was bringing them in pairs, so I had a backup.)\n\nOn Mimus, sure I had to use the rocket engine a lot, but the rover would safely land after 300m jumps, and when I once launched off a steep incline flying down good 200m to a frozen lake below, all I had to do was turn it around and burn to a safe landing. Didn\u0027t break a thing either.\n\nOf course if you depend on wheels alone, you\u0027re asking for trouble."}]}
