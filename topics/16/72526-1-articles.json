Having 35 deg AoA can be caused by several things. It\u0027s really the fact that you have to have such a high AoA that\u0027s contributing to the \u0022if I let my nose down for a moment, then drag will straighten my ship.\u0022 It may also be a Center of Mass (CoM)/Center of Lift (CoL) relationship problem.

You can adjust each one to get the look and performance you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) 1 TurboJet per 12 tons of craft. Up to a maximum of 15 tons. There\u0027s not really a minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) ~3 ram intakes per TurboJet. Minimum recommended is 1 per TurboJet. Maximum is as many as you want, but once you go past 3, you have to double the number of intakes to see much effect. (so 6, then 12, then 20\u002B)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) ~150ish units of liquid fuel per TurboJet. Minimum of 100 units (as you get more experience). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) 0.5 to 1.0 lift rating per ton. I usually aim for around 0.75 per ton to start off. You can use a variety of wing parts to get there. Minimum is 0.5 units/ton. Recommended Max is 1.0 units/ton because after that you don\u0027t gain much benefit and suffer from drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way these work is that if you lower the numbers in one rule, you should raise the numbers in another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for example, a 12t craft would be: 1 TurboJet, 3 Intakes, 150 fuel, 9 units of lift. You could also increase the number of intakes and reduce the lift and get 1 TurboJet, 6 Intakes, 150 fuel, 6 units of lift. Or if you wanted it to fly a bit further: 1 TurboJet, 3 Intakes, 200 fuel, 12 units of lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese rules of thumb don\u0027t have an exact exchange rate.
