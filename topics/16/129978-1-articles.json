Now I\u0027m building a space plane that is gonna bring 10 kerbonauts from the surface of Laythe to low orbit. After much testing I finally got a design that is capable of reaching orbit around Kerbin, which is my testing ground. Out of the 5-6 different crafts I made this week, this one has a weird problem, both during ascent and during re-entry. The standard MK2 cockpit that is the most front part of my craft keeps overheating so easily. It spikes up to over 2000 kelvin quickly, and it is the ONLY part of my vessel that shows any sign of overheating. From the orbit I\u0027m de-orbiting from, 35 000m altitude is not something excessive, and all of my crafts ever has had no problems with this altitude. However this crafts cockpit explodes from overheating at any altitude, even when I\u00A0tried 42 000 in an attempt to glide across the whole planet, but even this just keeps pushing my temperature slowly upwards to breaking point. I tried experimenting with some radiator panels attached to it, but it has no effect.\u00A0Does anyone have any ideas what might be causing this crazy overheating at this particular craft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshots\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=601049979\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=601049979\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=601050027\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=601050027\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Melfice","CreatedById":3143,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T20:39:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery odd.\u003Cbr\u003E\nObviously it\u0027s always going to be dipping in nose first, but maybe if you raise the nose up to... maybe 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon?
