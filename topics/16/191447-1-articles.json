Just put the decoupler that ditches the experiment storage unit and the parachute on the unit into the same stage on the staging setup, and then the parachute will be activated when you decouple the lot. But I can see two potential problems: one is that I\u0027m not sure if a single experiment storage unit will survive reentry - even if you add a small heat-shield. The other is that if the unit leaves physics range while in the atmosphere, then it runs a risk of being deleted by the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally: why don\u0027t you just add an experiment storage unit (ESU) to the top of your Onion capsule like you would do it with the Mk1 command pod? A simple stack of Onion, ESU, and Mk16 parachute will orient itself in the atmosphere with the bottom of the Onion first and safely reenter even from high Kerbin orbit (from further away than Minmus).
