The dang thing rotates a bit and I can not line up to dock fast enough to catch one of the ports. I even tried Mechjeb but after 2 hours and almost 2000 monop, it was also unsuccessful. I changed to station control and from there it does not seem to be rotating. Anyone have any advice? I would hate to have to make a giant spear in space as my next station but that\u0027s my only other option if I cant figure out this rotating issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrKicker","CreatedById":77424,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T01:35:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esometimes large craft like to rotate for no reason whatsoever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, timewarp cancels all rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripzter","CreatedById":75335,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T02:18:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed click time warp from time to time to get the uncontrolled station to stop turning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T03:10:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tripzter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tripzter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIndeed click time warp from time to time to get the uncontrolled station to stop turning.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because going into timewarp puts all ships in the active scene \u0027on rails\u0027, which halts all movement. Just blip it up to 5x for a second, it\u0027ll stop rotating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of what\u0027s going on is that the SAS has a tendency to overcorrect, especially the Old SAS, which by default Mechjeb\u0027s autosteering is pretty similar to. So what happens is, you get it stable, but really it\u0027s wobbling back and forth slightly. When you switch craft, it stops being controlled, and whatever the last overcorrection was, that\u0027s how it moves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might try using the default SAS to stop it instead of Mechjeb as well, as it\u0027s a lot less overcorrect-y, even if it does have some issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bayboy","CreatedById":78601,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T04:59:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are probably trying to dock with the docking axis along the prograde/retrograde vector, or the radial vector. As the two vessels orbit, their relative position to each other changes. E.g. if one is \u0022on top\u0022 of the other, after 90 degrees of orbital rotation, they will be \u0022side by side\u0022, when viewed from above. But if you align them \u0022north-south\u0022 before docking, they stay in that position throughout orbit.
