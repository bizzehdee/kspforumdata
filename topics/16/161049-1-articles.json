They can be pretty helpful grabbing all those contracts in the vicinity (kind of) of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I read all the tutorials here and been working on this one plane over the course of a couple days.

Let\u0027s see if we can figure this out then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere a a couple of things I notice right away about your plane. The engines are sitting much higher than the center of mass of the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you click on the Center of Mass Overlay button on the bottom left side of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E interface (it looks like a weight icon) you\u0027ll see a yellow round marker show up in front of your plane. This shows you where the average center of mass is for the plane in its current configuration. If you drain the tanks you\u0027ll see it move around a bit as the weight of the tanks get lighter. Now there\u0027s another button that looks like a rocket engine right next to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E button. It shows you a purple ball that indicates where your direction of thrust lines up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee how your direction of thrust is so much higher up than your center of mass? This means your engines will push on the top part of your plane more than the bottom part and cause it to pivot forward around its middle like a pinwheel firework. This is also forcing your nose down into the runway when you are trying to take off, making it difficult to pitch upwards. You want your engines to be in line with your center of mass as close as possible from the top to the bottom. Moving them down where your horizontal tail fins are would be a better place for them, and you can just stick your elevator fins on the outside of the MK0 fuel tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour steering problems can be fixed pretty well by adjusting the height of your landing gear. You want the front wheel to lift the nose up a little bit taller than the back, so raise the back pair of gear a tiny bit higher on the fuselage. Not too far or you\u0027ll drag the rear end when taking off. Also, the small front LY-05 wheel at the nose is still not quite straight up and down. If you chose the rotate gizmo and click on the wheel it brings up that multcolored set of interlocking circles. Press \u0022F\u0022 on the keyboard and it switches from \u0022absolute\u0022 to \u0022local\u0022 rotation. You\u0027ll find that in the local rotation, which shows you how the part is rotated relative to itself rather than the plane\u0027s grid, the gear is still rotated a little too far clockwise. This is because the underside of the cockpit is sloped. Give it a couple clicks of rotation in the counterclockwise direction. Hold shift down for more precision if you have angle snap turned on, or turn the angle snap off if you have to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that your plane will still bounce a little at first, partly due to the weight of all that fuel being a little more than those wheels were intended for. Turning up the damping strength and spring strength on those back wheels should calm them down for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou probably DO want yaw turned on for the vertical stabilizer fin on the back. You can safely turn the authority limiter down on that tail fin to about 25 percent or so and still get plenty of yaw control. Roll control works best for control surfaces on the outer ends of the wings, so you don\u0027t need those control surfaces close in to the body of the plane. Pitch control surfaces work best near the far back (and sometimes rarely on the front) of the plane. Putting pitch elevators on wings near the center of mass won\u0027t really give you any extra control. It\u0027s best to keep pitch controls on the rear horizontal elevator like the one you have on the tail of your plane already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more tip about the wheels. Right click the back wheels in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and turn the brake level up and then click \u0022Friction Control\u0022. A new slider will appear at the top of the menu (this might need Advanced Tweakables enabled in the main settings menu, I can\u0027t remember.) Set this friction control slider to be about twice what the front wheel is set at. I usually leave the front wheel at 1 and the back wheels at about 2.5. This makes your back wheels more \u0022sticky\u0022 than the front wheels and tends to keep you straighter when rolling along the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this helps and isn\u0027t too wordy. Planes are harder to build and fly than rockets, but they\u0027re so much fun to fly when you get the hang of it. Don\u0027t be afraid to ask if there\u0027s anything I didn\u0027t make clear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-26T00:08:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2017 12:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daawgees","CreatedById":98221,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-26T00:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you, I appreciate the time you took in writing that explanation.

I\u0027ve not done enough testing to see how efficient that technique is for small planes like this though.
