I know the aerodynamics of the game are very primitive and glitchy, but the rudder/yaw-control seems to be a special lousy case for every design I make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypical scenario: I go down the runway and take off and start ascending. On the way up the nose will drift slightly left or right somewhere along the way. I instinctively nudge the rudder a bit the other way to compensate, but yawing does not seem to turn the craft. It turns the nose while I\u0027m pushing the control, but the plane will continue on the same vector. On top there seems to be an excessive rebound effect when letting it go, often slinging the nose back even past the point where I started to turn... (so yawing left may will end up with the nose further right than it was to begin with).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027ve flown RC airplanes for quite some time, and have a fairly strong \u0022insticnt\u0022 of what the flight controls should do on a mid-winged craft, and what my KSP inventions are doing, is sort within reason for roll and elevation, but I have yet to create any resemblance of yaw control... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is frustrating me, I think mostly because I have specific expectation of what a yaw control is, but every time I touch it, something else seems to come out of it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I doing wrong here? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any mid-winged plane design that can steer using yaw control? I know it sort of works if I dial in a significant dihedral or move the CoL way above the rudder CoM, but then it\u0027s just the roll-effect doing the steering, and the yaw is stil rebounding and bouncing all over when letting go...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T08:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think some pictures would help a lot.

Once your plane gets moving in certain direction, that little of control surface may be able to turn the nose of the plane but has not enough lift to change your movement direction. And since that surface is usually behind CoM, once you release the control, the airflow rebounds it to the other side and it oscillates a little before it returns to stable position along the airflow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of turning your plane using yaw, roll the plane a little in desired direction and pitch up to use lift of main wings to change the movement direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: notice that model planes often have both great amount of power in their propulsion (able to hang in air by it with no lift from wings) and a lot more vertical lift-generating area, often whole body of the plane is used as lifting surface, allowing the plane to fly when rolled by 90 degrees just fine. Such planes behave very differently than KSP planes as in KSP, lift is only generated by dedicated wing parts and normal parts do not generate any lift (unless you\u0027re using FAR).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-15T09:45:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2014 09:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T13:06:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs has been said, there are several reasons this could be happening. Pictures of your craft really do help us give specific advice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, most stock airplanes benefit a lot from turning on the SAS (if you haven\u0027t). It will generally get rid of that unwanted yaw, but it will make the roll/pitch a little more \u0022snappy.\u0022 Some people don\u0027t like that, but the plane flies better overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when I see people building larger flat aircraft or aircraft with a lot of wingspan, they generally under estimate the amount of tail required. This will often cause a lot of yaw and springy behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, a lot of real airplanes react similarly to rudder input.
