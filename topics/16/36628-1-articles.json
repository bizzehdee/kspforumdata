I have rockets in asparagus staging, and I set the sepratrons to the default position (black thruster down) the things seems to work, but almost every time the debris collide with the other rockets, so I figured that the thruster should be pointing down, no? That way the debris is pulled down and the rocket keeps going up without problems, right? Wrong! That makes everything worse. The debris goes UP even faster than the rocket. Finally, I figured that it should be pointing out! That was the worst idea ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... what is the correct configuration?

For that reason, placing them this way offers a simple solution to both of these problems. By pointing them upwards, instead of fighting the momentum, which can be a bit disastrous, you play on changing the direction of the booster and pushing it out of the way while still keeping it going forward as he was. I never had a problem with this configuration, excepted with really really light boosters, then you have to put them slightly lower else this pushes the booster away too fast and instead causes it to spin on itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"austin4050","CreatedById":66368,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T23:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBest thing to do is use the auto-snapper that places parts in increment (have no clue what it is called) and 1 (more if needed) at the top AND bottom, you must make sure that they are on complete opposite sides of the part, or it will just spin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T23:54:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xeldrak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xeldrak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehm, I never realized, that the Shuttle SRB still burn during seperation....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I concider way more interesting is that while seperated, the SRBs and the shuttle keep going at the same speed.
