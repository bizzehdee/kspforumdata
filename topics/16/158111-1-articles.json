And yes, you can dock with them this way as Hotaru said. I do it all the time, in fact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the same restriction applies to this kind of docking as to all klaw dockings. The klaw needs to be perpendicular to the surface that it touches, in order to successfully latch on. Speed doesn\u0027t matter, but you must be very careful about touching just right so that it is perpendicular.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
