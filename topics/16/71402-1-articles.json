I just downloaded the latest version of KSP. I haven\u0027t really played a whole lot since .21 or so, but I got the itch and fired it up, downloaded all the updates, and went to go make a rocket... only to find that the little text bar at the top of the VAB where I used to be able to name my ships is gone. I poked around a little to no avail. How do I assign a name to my ships now?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the dumb question, and thanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResolved: After cycling some graphical settings, everything is back, happy, and where I remember it.
