I have trouble getting it centered completely and the mk1 lander kinda sticks out from behind the heat shield. C\u0027mon atmosphere, how the hell do you expect me to get to a 2.5m cockpit if you keep blowing up my science?

What you\u0027re describing doesn\u0027t sound like it\u0027s past the capabilities of the heat shield, and others have said that pretty much the same thing you\u0027re doing works for them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that leaves two possibilities, either you\u0027re being more aggressive with reentry than we think, or your 1.1.2 game is bugged.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the first issue, a couple of screenshots will help loads. If you could post one in map view that shows your orbit right when you start reentry, with the AP and PE markers showing the numbers. And one showing the part of your craft that is reentering, maybe one in the VAB and one during reentry, right before everything goes kablooie.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the other possible problem, when you started playing with 1.1, did you update an existing copy of the game, or did you download a fresh install? If you updated (especially with the patcher) it\u0027s possible that something went wrong and messed up your install of 1.1. I would suggest first trying to delete your physics.cfg from the main KSP folder. This will force the game to make a new one with the default values when you restart the game. If that doesn\u0027t work you can try downloading a fresh copy. If you\u0027re using Steam try verifying the integrity of the game cache.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firemetal","CreatedById":164725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T18:19:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will do that a little later thanks. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T22:09:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Firemetal,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, some specifics:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf your craft is lightweight (only a ton or two), and\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nyour craft design has its CoM close to the heatshield (i.e. the craft doesn\u0027t want to flip), and\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nyou have a reasonable Pe on Kerbin approach (e.g. 30 km works well), and\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nyou\u0027re not going too fast (e.g. not a whole lot faster than 3000 m/s when you hit atmosphere)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n...then it should enter really trivially easily with no problem, unless something weird is going on.\u00A0 Even with a lander can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you\u0027re having problems, it seems likely that you may be having an issue that we aren\u0027t spotting because we don\u0027t have the information.\u00A0 So, there are a few things you can do to help us help you.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nGive us a screenshot of your reentering vehicle, and let us know what its mass is.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlso include your velocity when you hit atmosphere, and your Pe.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKeep it simple, don\u0027t need to hear about 1.0.2 or whatever, just tell us what you\u0027re trying in 1.1.2 that\u0027s not working.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI use the heat shield on lander-can reentry vehicles coming back from the Mun or Minmus all the time, and it works just fine.\u00A0 However, it is important to keep pointed well retrograde so that the can isn\u0027t peeking out from the heat shield more than it has to.\u00A0 That\u0027s easiest to do if you have at least level-1 SAS aboard (i.e. a level-1-or-better pilot, or a HECS-or-better probe core), so you can just click the \u0022hold retrograde\u0022 button and be done with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E have that available yet, and are having trouble holding close to perfectly retrograde, then you may want to try using a Mk1 command pod instead of the lander can.\u00A0 Yes, it\u0027s a couple of hundred kilograms heavier... but on the other hand, its conical shape makes it much easier to hide behind the heat shield, and it\u0027s tougher in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you mentioned \u0022blowing up science\u0022:\u00A0 Do you mean that you have all your science in the lander can with your kerbonaut, and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethat\u0027s\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E blowing up?\u00A0 Or do you mean that your science is still sitting inside your science instruments, and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethey\u0027re\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E blowing up?\u00A0 If so, there are things you can do to protect the science:\u00A0 e.g. putting the instruments inside a service bay to protect them, or (even better) collect the science out of them \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebefore\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E you hit atmosphere, and stash it in the command pod with your kerbonaut.\u00A0 That way, as long as the command pod survives, it doesn\u0027t matter what happens to the (fragile, easily burnable) science instruments; your science is safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firemetal","CreatedById":164725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T22:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes I have updated the game.
