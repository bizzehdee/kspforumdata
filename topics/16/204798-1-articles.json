The crane had tipped over, with several parts offset (they weren\u0027t built with an offset, but they were now); one of the rover wheels was significantly offset from the hinge it was connected to (I was able to use an engineer to fix it), and one of OUV\u0027s had several parts clipping thru each oth,er.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn one instance\u00A0when I switch to a rover, it was placed 10 or 15 meters above the surface and appeared to just hang there, never returning to the surface.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this just some odd aspect of the game?
