A \u0027Completely revised Input Mapping system\u0027 was implemented as of v1.0.0. I bought the game long prior to that release, and I suspect that my settings.cfg file was not correctly reset by the upgrade. This may also affect other players too...\n\n\\* edit: or rename to something else, for a backup copy of what you had.
