The counter-rotating arms are producing torque on the rest of the station that is misaligned with the center of rotation. Is there any way to eliminate this?\u00A0Could this be caused by slight mass variations between arms?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote this isn\u0027t from uncanceled torque. I have visually verified the arms are rotating WRT the station in opposite directions. Concepts that worked in 1.7.1 without this issue get rotation around 1 RPM. Net torque is not consistent and varies. I would say Kraken like, but the forces are tame and disappear when rotors are stopped. This uncontrolled attitude change\u00A0makes it impractical for a station. Furthermore \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E refuses to correct for it (I have a control point orthogonal to the spin axis I intended to point in the normal heading).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTook a break around 1.7.1 when I got sidetracked and stagnated\u00A0designing BG craft.

So even if your rotational mass balance is identical, my guess is that round-off error might be enough to destabilize things; most folks call this the Kraken because of the way Unity resolves connected, harmonically destabilizing forces: Sudden Unplanned Disassembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the bottom line is you may be able to salvage the situation if you have enough reaction wheel force to overcome the imbalance (whether by mass or round-off error) that is externally referenced to the vessel - otherwise you\u0027ll just give it yet another feed-back mechanism to summon you-know-who...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-03T19:06:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPics of the station in question?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-05T02:12:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223903149\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199279\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221609700771\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/3/2021 at 12:06 PM, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPics of the station in question?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrepped an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/cvIDaAk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ealbum\u003C/a\u003E with the latest contra rotating mechanism concept. Frustratingly, this is the the tamest one so far so it\u0027s less illustrative.
