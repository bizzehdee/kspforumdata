I also want to have multiple installs with different mods, but still can\u0027t figure out how to do this. When i copied the steam folder of KSP to a new folder, it completely moved it out of Steam. Luckily, i moved it back to Steam. While it was in the folder, it still had the orginal mods.

I have a folder on my desktop for games called \u0022games\u0022 (yeah, very creative). So i opened up what it called \u0022file explorer on my laptop, it\u0027s windows. Then i found steam, steamapps, common, and in there was KSP. Is that what i copy to the games folder? I tried, and it started downloading/ transferring, but i cancelled that because i wanted to make sure i was doing it right. If that was correct, from the games folder, can i delete all of the mods and saves without effecting the Steam version? I don\u0027t want to start over, even though i do this every version anyways, i just want to have different installs for different types of mods.
