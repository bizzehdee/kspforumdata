The problem with it is, that once I got it into orbit, I only had enough fuel for a deorbit burn, and it was only capable of carrying one kerbal. I also made a RAPIER SSTO, I got it into a highly decaying 152*29 km orbit before it ran out of fuel, and it had a problem with always yawing to the right once it got up to speed, despite being build with symmetry on the whole time. The yaw stopped the moment that the RAPIERS went to rocket mode. So I have a few questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Since I get flameouts at 23 kilometers, should I put more intakes on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: What\u0027s the recommended ratio between LF and Oxidizer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Why do the RAPIERs yaw to the right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: What other tricks should I know about?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ComradeGoat","CreatedById":59041,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T13:32:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour yaw is happening because, as the engines approach flameout, they reduce power. If you have more than one, they won\u0027t reduce power symmetrically, inducing yaw. You can counter this by having a HUGE RUDDER, and/or by throttling back manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RAPIER is a pretty poor engine, BTW. A turbojet and 2 LV 84-7Ses works much better. The trick is keeping them fed with air until you\u0027re at almost orbital velocity. Climb rapidly to 20,000, then gently, bringing your speed up to about 1,300 m/s before you hit 25,000 metres. Try and level off at 30,000 and fly horizontally until your periapsis appears. Keep flying horizontally, and your apoapsis should start to climb into space. When this happens, pitch up to about 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA and reduce power to avoid flameout. Keep this angle, reducing power to keep the engine burning, until you reach about 40,000m, then go horizontal again and keep reducing power for as long as the jets will run, to keep your apoapsis from falling. Once the jet dies at zero power, turn it off and switch to your LV 48-7Ses. You should only need about 100 m/s or less to circularise at apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA plane with one of the small 360 unit fuel tanks, one turbojet, 2 LV 48-7S engines and 4 radial intakes should be able to reach orbit and have loads of delta V left, as long as you get the ascent profile right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, try to keep your centre of lift just behind your centre of gravity.

You can clip the atomic rocket into a fuel tank so that it doesn\u0027t stick out horribly from the back of your space plane. Also, if you clip the ram air intakes inside the fuel tanks you can airhog like crazy without making your space plane look all whacked out.

The key is NOT to go directly to 20,000 unless you have an insane amount of intakes. Instead, level off a bit before that so that you can start building speed. The faster you go the more the intakes will draw and the easier it will be to break orbit. I would suggest something that goes at least 1800 m/s as a minimum. That isn\u0027t that hard to attain because when you get above 25,000 feet you can throttle down to almost nothing and still gain speed and altitude.
