The latest one has me flying quite far past the south pole. I\u0027m using mechjeb and when I pass the south pole my 180 degree heading in mechjeb needs to change to 360. Other than watch and wait for it, how else is that handled... maybe not flying over the pole?\n\nAlso, in regards to the south pole, I tried landing right on the pole. When I pass the engines cut out temporarily. I was flying at about 40m (land was 30m) and when I hit the pole the jet exploded. I wasn\u0027t flying quickly or anything and if the engines just cut out I should have been able to glide to a landing... Not sure what that\u0027s about."},{"CreatedByName":"Xkay7","CreatedById":129537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T13:52:16Z","Content":"Not sure what you mean exactly, but I\u0027m guessing you ran out of fuel or intake air."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T14:59:50Z","Content":"Can you describe the MechJeb problem in more detail?\n\nAnd, documenting the explosion problem with screenshots (f1), can you replicate this pole-caused engine failure?"},{"CreatedByName":"Pandemic","CreatedById":144101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T16:17:31Z","Content":"Fuel and air was fine, I was essentially trying to land ON the pole. That\u0027s when it outright exploded. \n\nI\u0027ll see if I can get video of it. I\u0027ve never done any video of gaming so it may take some time to figure out. I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027ll happen again. The engine cut out for sure but the explosion may not happen ... we\u0027ll see. \n\nAny recommendations on screen capture video software?\n\nThe mechjeb issue seems straight forward. I travel 180 degrees (south) and once I hit the pole 180 degrees changes to 000 (north). Problem is MechJeb doesn\u0027t realize it changed so it trys turning around to 180. I could see it going in circles until it crashes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T17:02:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 05:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pandemic**"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T21:11:05Z","Content":"The poles have mesh errors so sometimes your craft will glitch when directly on it. That\u0027s probably whats happening as far as the explosions."}]}
