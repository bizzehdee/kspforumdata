I am trying to make splaceplanes using mainly B9 parts and with ground personnel to service them so no returning to the SPH for refitting. Here is where the trouble starts. I can\u0027t find a good design for a loading crane. If I try to winch the cargo using KAS and just drop it in withouth docking a lot of times the cargo disappears as I close the cargo bay doors. If I dock it it hangs on the other end throug the fuselage but if I secure it with KAS struts the whole ship starts to bounce around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what are your solutions for loading spaceplanes? I would like to see your designs.

Now I have a rotating crew cabin with a small crane for a mission impossible Jeb to connect the struts, the docking port goes straight down.
