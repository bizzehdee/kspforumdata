I\u0027m not sure what the drill\u0027s collision mesh looks like but a potential issue I see is the drill tipping you when you deploy it. If the drill is not a solid object this wouldn\u0027t happen, of course."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T14:56:28Z","Content":"Just treat Gilly like a very large asteroid. Don\u0027t orbit it or try to be super efficient on your landing. Once you\u0027re in the SOI just get moving toward it and \u0022dock\u0022 with the surface with your landing gear. You WILL land and you WILL be able to drill.\n\nSource: I did it within the past month."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T15:31:51Z","Content":"OK, I thought there was some problems with getting in contact with the ground. When I landed (not a miner), I wasn\u0027t \u0022landed\u0022 immediately. I though that could be an issue.\n\nCool. My miner could refuel the Eve station from Gilly. My station obits Eve at 2000km in Gilly\u0027s plane. Rendez-vous with Gilly is 500 to 600 m/s, then capture and landing. Should fit under 1100/1200 m/s, leaving 250 m/s for docking.\n\nBest Gilly approach is when rendez-vous is made at periaps ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T15:42:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Best Gilly approach is when rendez-vous is made at periaps ?\n\nYour periapsis won\u0027t matter that much. To spend the least fuel as is (reasonably) possible, you should actually just aim to hit Gilly. Once you\u0027re close, burn to stop, pick a place to land, and fly there. The low gravity and time warp issues (i.e., you can\u0027t when you\u0027re too close) combine to make any normal approach unnecessarily time-wasteful.\n\nLanding will take a bit longer than on normal worlds, as you will bounce if you come down at over a couple m/s and going that speed is tough because touching the engines can make you fly off into space. But with practice, thrust limiting, and a ship designed to land on Gilly (not just land, but land on GILLY) and you\u0027ll be fine.\n\nMy last Gilly ship had 6 engines: 2 poodles to get there, 2 48-7ses to come in for a landing, and 2 Ants facing upward to give a little push on landing. I could have done it all with just the poodles, but figured the extra mass was worth saving the pain in the neck igniting a Poodle would bring. As it was, I had to thrust limit the 48-7ses down because they were too touchy."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T16:53:42Z","Content":"With my general lander, I did it with the RCS and time..."}]}
