If you do get them to dock, they will likely bend if you apply thrust later. (Unless uoy\u0027re just refuelling). Because of their size, you\u0027ll have to be extremely precise with aligning them as you approach. Even Sr ports can have a hard time if you come in at just the wrong angle and a heavy ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will say it\u0027s also possible the docking ports are glitched (it\u0027s known to happen). You can try this checking this thread, which covers docking and undocking bugs. It might help you verify/fix the ports if they are broken.
