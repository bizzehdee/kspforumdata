I have a ship that I leave on mun drilling for ore, go back to space center, build another ship and bring it out to the mun to join the ship that is already there drilling. Once the existing ship is about 2km in distance from new ship, I get a message saying Core Overheating - shutting down; and the entire ship explodes. Or if it doesn\u0027t, the entire thing is red hot and several parts will explode, crippling the ship. I have radiators everywhere, wayyy more than what is needed to cool the drill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAND this even happens if the drill isn\u0027t even running! I can have the drill fully retracted, the ISRU shut off, the whole ship shut down, and it still overheats and explodes every single time...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody else experience this or have any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-04T04:21:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2015 04:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by iyzik\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T04:39:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome aboard, iyzik!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve moved your question over to Gameplay Questions where a bunch of smart, helpful people hang out. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TronX33","CreatedById":109784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T05:20:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you playing stock?

Also every radiator I have is maxed out on temperature and red hot. It\u0027s almost like when the ship loads, every part that can radiate temperature gets set to max temperature which causes the RTG\u0027s and Solar Panels to explode since they can radiate heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody have any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T19:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a thought, what does your buildID.txt say ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iyzik","CreatedById":154448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T20:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222310967\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126981\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449431976\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002216426\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, sal_vager said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a thought, what does your buildID.txt say ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbuild id = 01028\u003Cbr\u003E\n2015.11.11 at 01:03:33 CET\u003Cbr\u003E\nBranch: master\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
