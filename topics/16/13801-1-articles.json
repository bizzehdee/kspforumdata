I tried the opposite: driving to orbit, but it didn\\\u0027t work. Try switching your landing gear to the cart mod. I drove it across the lake surface at up to 430.9m/s under its own up power, and it was still handling pretty well and sticking to the surface. In fact, I couldn\\\u0027t get it to lift off despite clearly exceeding orbital speed. Somebody was telling me that it\\\u0027s got a bit of built-in down force, which defeated me, but might help you stay in contact with the surface while slowing.
