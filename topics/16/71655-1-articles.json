I\u0027ve captured multiple asteroids passing through Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Here\u0027s the trick: track it until it enters Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Once it\u0027s inside the SOI, launch into the plane of the object\u0027s orbit. During your first orbit around Kerbin, fine-tune and correct as necessary at the appropriate node (ascending or descending). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow comes the tricky part (and do NOT trust MechJeb to do it; it just can\u0027t and not sure if Sarbian and the other current MJ developers consider it a priority). Plot a maneuver node manually and just play with it; add or remove prograde velocity, move it around your orbit around Kerbin, etc. It really helps to use a mod with a maneuver node fine-tuning editor where you can tweak by small amounts (down to even a tenth of a meter/sec) and move the planned maneuver node forward or backward in time by one second increments. Small differences in this first maneuver make a huge difference later. It\u0027s probably not possible to get a very close approach with the first burn but don\u0027t worry too much yet. Basically, play around until you get an intercept (marked by the two white markers on your orbit and the target orbit). Then tweak the node in very small amounts to get it as close as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember this is not a one-step process; once you\u0027ve got the maneuver node close, just go ahead and make the burn. Now for step two: while en route, plot a SECOND maneuver to fine-tune the approach. MJ actually works well for this part - tell MJ to fine tune your approach to 100m or so and it should work fine. Then do your approach, rendezvous and docking (\u0022Claw-ing?\u0022) as usual. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, once you\u0027ve done that you\u0027re now effectively on the same hyperbolic trajectory as your target. So either have enough dV in reserve to capture the object into Kerbin orbit or be able to ket go of the asteroid and brake yourself if you intend to return. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-07T13:41:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2014 01:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LameLefty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T13:58:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut your ship on launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelect the asteroid as target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERotate map view until you see the asteroid\u0027s trajectory as a straight line crossing Kerbin.
