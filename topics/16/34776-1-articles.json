I realized I\u0027d have to abort the mission, so I separated the command pod from the fuel tank (bottom) and satellite (top) at 65,000 meters, deploying the two MK2-R radial parachutes immediately afterwards. I oriented myself retrograde on the path through the atmosphere, and the two chutes seemed to be slowing me down nicely...but at 500 meters, the chutes opened fully and the force tore off the chutes and the ASAS module still attached to the pod. With no parachutes, the pod splashed hard on impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight report listed a simultaneous \u0022structural failure\u0022 of the parachutes, ASAS module and docking clamp.

I\u0027ve had feather-soft landings with a single Mk25, but I had to use the radials in this case because of the attached satellite.

Try added more parachutes and struts to keep the ship in one piece. Also, I often have to use an engine to slow the craft down to around 80 m/s right before 500 meters. Finally, one last trick is to use the Drogue chutes along with normal ones. Those ones open at 2500 meters so that the deceleration is not as sudden and violent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T23:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey were attached directly to the sides of the (cone-shaped) command pod.
