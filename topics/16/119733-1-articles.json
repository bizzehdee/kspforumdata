My only issue is to setup the triggers to thrust forwards and backwards. Currently, as I understand, the game asigns a function to an axis, in this case forward/backward on Z axis (for example) but what I\u0027d like is to have forward thrust to the Z axis and backward thrust on the Y axis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis system works great for the thumb sticks but, sadly, it doesn\u0027t seem to work so well on the trigger fingers. Since they are pressure sensitive they work as an axis as well where 0 to 100 is forward and -100 to 0 is backward. But the problem is that since these are triggers they don\u0027t have a -100 to 0 range (only 0 to 100). What I would like to do is have one trigger thrust forward and the other trigger thrust backwards. This for RCS and EVA of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T15:44:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you need to do is set the L2 and R2 triggers to \u0027half axis\u0027 and \u0027inverted half axis\u0027 in the MotioninJoy config page, so that they share one axis but move it in opposite directions.
