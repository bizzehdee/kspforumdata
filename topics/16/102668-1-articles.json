Needless to say it became wobbly fast, so there is no hope of it actually traveling.\n\nI then went all in and did build a huge and heavy base for my future station,\n\n then I launched another one with similar mass, but some things in reverse (Nuke Engines), so I can attach it the only way I managed to dock so far - head first,\n\nbut unlike my previous attempt not to have engines pointing in opposite directions =\u003E dead weight.\n\nSo far so good, but there is (un)expected problem I encountered that I need your help with and there it is :\n\nRed zone is where the 2 parts are attached with Docking Port Sr (Took huge amount of time trying to dock them, but they were bugged, so I used the save file option from this forum, THANK YOU! )\n\nTook 2 dock-undock procedures until I aligned em, but this is as close as it gets.\n\nHere is where the problem lies when I fire the 32 Nuke engines \u002B the 16 infront or if I simply try RCS maneuver, due to the lack of RCS (I forgot) on the first piece (the one with 32 nukes). \n\nIt simply goes apart. Not immediately, but in due time.\n\nGreen Zones Can I sacrifice 2 or even 4 pairs of those in order to link them with some fuel tank or fuselage, so the ship will have some structural integrity or I have to scrap it and think of other design ?\n\nThose ports were planned for something else, but it is necessary to sacrifice them now for the greater good. The yellow ports will have to to for Lab(s) and the other stuff I had planned (Like orange tank size ship to be deattached for some unforseen exploration. After all I plan to stuff it and start my journey around the Kerbol system, hopefully explore it all, or at least only go back to Kerbin to refuel once.\n\nOrange zones are small docking ports for the 8 mini ships that will do various jobs and transfers, so those must not be obstructed by the connecting module of the green ports.\n\nPink ports are designated for the 4 small ships coming (along with the crew) of the 3 part refueling station I mentioned before. It\u0027s parts will dock with the only 4 medium docking ports (not colored), dump their fuel and possibly reconnect to each other and remain as refuel station once I fill them up or simply land/destroy them.\n\nThe big Kerbodyne engines you see infront can and will be deattached before taking off on the journey. They were used to help lift all the weigth, because unlike the back part Nukes were just dead weight, facing backwards.\n\n![image.png](http://s28.postimg.org/ygiia2tqz/image.png)\n\nSo, is it possible to stabilize my core with let\u0027s say combination of 2 fuel tanks or possibly 3 and fuselage parts to match length, that will deattach everything from itself, except the ports it will have and the body.\n\nAnd use this 2 or 4 times.\n\nI will need huge help, designing and docking it. Hopefully I will not encounter the Docking port Sr bug much.\n\n Needless to say I am complete noob in docking, let alone docking with 2 ports simultaneously. I will need help on RCS Placement.\n\nAlso if possible it should include few fuel tanks, because no matter how heavy they are my small vessels run on monopropellant for landings/orbit and xenon for longer space distances. The 2 medium ones with the Klaw you will see on the second picture are liquid fuel powered, so will the 2 large ones that will be attached to yellow port and used for landings and re-orbiting on bodies with atmosphere.\n\nIt will be nice if the \u0022patch\u0022 element could have the 2 large ports, but possibly 1 medium and 1-2 small ones on the outer side, just in case without destabilizing it even more.\n\nI hope you can help me salvage my operation, because otherwise I would have to think smaller, due to lack of Clamp-o-Tron-Huge. Another option is to use cluster of 3 or 4, as I have seen in other builds, but that will mean starting over and leaving this one a drift and one real hell of aligning docking, not to mention fear of the docking bug.\n\n![image.png](http://s1.postimg.org/g9gkglucf/image.png)\n\nMapoko\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T02:46:02Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**\n  \nfixed images"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T12:16:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My new project is to make a huge space station, equipped with enough fuel (and mini vessels) to go around all the planetary bodies and moons around Kerbol with crew of ~20.\n\nUm, if it travels its not a station, if it goes to the planets, its not interstellar. \n\nBuilding a huge \\*interplanetary ship\\* for a \u0022grand tour mission\u0022 is the single biggest challenge of the game.

In a KSP thats free from limitations, runs always in realtime with lots of frames regardless of the partcount and included parts a great multiuse starship would be rather easy to build. But here we are with the KSP of mortals, while the gods are playing their perfect KSP (called \u0022the universe\u0022) ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSo, first things first: keep it simple. Whatever your systemspecs are, a small partcount has its merits. Especially if you are using different mods, where the ideas of different developers about connectivity, torgue and so on may also greatly differ.\n\nIf you need to turn your spaceship with all its complexity it can pay off to resist the urge of using RCS. Relying more on reaction wheels (ureallistic or not) for moving / turning huge conctructs can help a lot. But sure as hell its slow ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) Give the SAS time to balance everything out if youre using the autoalignment tools of experienced pilots (or Smart A.S.S. from mechjeb). Check the little panel on the bottom left to see if there is still manoevering going on (yaw, pitch, etc). Make sure that the center of thrust aligns through the center of mass, or at least that you have enough reactions wheels on board to counter small deviations.\n\nIf youre expecting wobbling, than try to lock gimbal on your engine. Lets the reactionwheels do the compensating, not the engine.\n\nUse Kerbal Joint Reinforcement. Really, just do it.\n\nIf everything is fine then start your thrusts slowly, always checking possible oscillations of your vessel or parts of it. Building a huge and complex ship where you can simply go for full thrust is always better, but the need to assemble such ships in orbit by using (small) dockingports is often costing stability.\n\nYou can try using KAS too, where you are able to place struts in orbit between freely assembled parts.\n\nMy 2cents: if you do it, do it slowly and carefully - just like the hedgehog ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T12:44:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 12:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smart013**\n  \nWording"},{"CreatedByName":"Mapoko","CreatedById":139980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T12:57:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E (also 1 of your 2 pics isn\u0027t showing up)\n\nCan you please say which one?

Also I use no mods, so I guess stuff that I have seen (like cargo bays) will not be accessible for me for now.\n\nIf I fail to stabilize this thing or FPS becomes too low I might have to actually scrap it and salvage what I can and start over. \n\nDue to stubbornness I try to play as realistic as possible, meaning I have some stuff drifting around Kerbol, because I did not pack enough fuel or did my slingshots wrong, but the upside is that I have not lost kerbonaut yet.

They tend to be a bit more stable. For the lower thrust approach, keep in mind that you can do your interplanetary transfer in multiple burns. For example, if a burn is going to take 15 minutes at 50% thrust (or whatever level works so that your craft doesn\u0027t wobble), you can do three five-minute burns, starting each two and a half minutes before the ejection angle point in your orbit. As long as your burns keep you in the sphere of influence of the body you are leaving from, you can do this.

Just to reduce part count.\n\nThe KAS alone opens up a whole new universe of possibilities for me.
