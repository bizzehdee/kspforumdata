Here are my toughts:\n\nScoop Karbonite from Jool\u0027s atmosphere: simpler, as the tanker doesn\u0027t need to land by the refinery, but refueling ships in the system must descend all the way to Jool or the tanker must go to them. My karbonite scooper is still on the way, so I haven\u0027t tested this.\n\nVall: I thought it was the best choice, as the lack of atmosphere should cut delta-v from take off. But it takes over 1 km/s to land there, so tankers landing and going up again would need to keep a lot of fuel for landing. \n\nBop \u0026 Tylo: nothing to say\n\nPol: the light gravity makes it great for landing and taking off, the problem is getting there and back\n\nNow Laythe: I haven\u0027t tried (yet) to get karbonite from the atmosphere, but it may seem a better idea than Jool, as it\u0027s not that down the gravity well and incoming ships to refuel can aerobreak to save fuel.\n\nAnd now that I think about it, a surface refinery could work - but the problem is the limited land on that moon. In theory, it takes more dV to reach orbit from the surface than from Vall. But the tanker could be an MK3 spaceplane, which uses the far more efficient air breathing engines to take off. And it would also need to keep far less fuel to deorbit. Did someone try that?\n\nWhat do you people think?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T02:01:32Z","Content":"The deorbit burn is going to be done with the tanker mostly empty, so delta-v is not such a large issue then (though you\u0027d better know how much you need).

But I personally feel them kind of cheating. It\u0027s sort of free fuel, so for gameplay value I usually try to limit to either surface miners or sending fuel from Kerbin"},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T02:39:03Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t been able to build a viable large Mk 3 spaceplane. My Mk 2\u0027s capacity is too limited and would need to make several trips.\n\nMy personal favorite is Vall, if you are going for bulk surface drilling. Bop would probably be the easier of the two to land and takeoff. That is if you can fine a relatively flat drilling site. Utilizing both moons, ferrying fuel up to orbital fuel stations around each, you have travel to both the inner and outer moons covered.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-24T02:52:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2015 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Landge**"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T03:24:49Z","Content":"I like Vall.

Laythe would be my second choice, but I wouldn\u0027t do atmospheric scoops - I\u0027d use a combination of parachutes, jets, and rockets to minimize the dV requirements, and would probably site things on that great bay that Brotoro first popularized.

Unless you were planning to use jet engines, in which case Laythe is your only choice.\n\nBut, OTOH, you also save a lot of fuel by landing in a body with an atmosphere if your tanker is supposed to be reusable. It takes some 2400 m/s to take off (without jets) from Laythe, but it may take some 100 m/s to land there. Vall, OTOH, takes some 1,000-1,200 m/s to *both* take off and land.\n\nThen again, that\u0027s the theory. Laythe is mostly ocean and the atmosphere makes pinpointing the landing harder. And while using jets is more efficient, getting a heavy MK3 tanker to Laythe seems like challenge on its own. Plus, I don\u0027t think there are a lot of smooth places to make a long landing run, so such a spaceplane should also need retrorockets to brake."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T05:56:07Z","Content":"Retrorockets may not be needed ... so long as there\u0027s an engineer on board, parachutes could be used so long as you have the balance right."},{"CreatedByName":"Maukse","CreatedById":119641,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T17:22:53Z","Content":"For me, Vall of course.\n\n Remember, 1000 m/s dV on an empty lander, it\u0027s not that much fuel !

Laythe should also work however it require an cargo spaceplane who can land on uneven terrain. Anything can land on Bop or Pol.

According to tavert\u0027s charts, we need 1000 m/s to take off, which means 2.39 tonnes of fuel.\n\nIf we add one 48-7S engine per LV-N, TWR goes up to 1.94, while delta-v to orbit goes down to 860 m/s. Fuel usage increases to 2.91 tonnes. If we shut down the 48-7S after 68 seconds and use only the LV-N for the remaining 111 seconds, we get 860 m/s of delta-v for the same 2.39 tonnes of fuel. The actual delta-v requirements are probably a bit higher, if we shut the 48-7S down early, but using it for the first 50 seconds or so will probably save us some fuel.\n\nWith two 48-7S engines, TWR becomes 2.57 and delta-v to orbit 840 m/s. The break-even point for fuel usage is now at 39 seconds, so we will probably save fuel, if we use the 48-7S engines for the first 30 seconds or less.\n\nThe estimates are based on the assumption that we aim for a 0 km equatorial orbit. In practice, we want to gain some altitude as well, so the numbers will be a bit different. Still, I\u0027d guess that having a single 48-7S engine per LV-N and using it to boost the TWR for the first 40-50 seconds of the ascent could save us some fuel (around 0.5% of launch mass).
