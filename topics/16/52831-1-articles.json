A somewhat risky affair to say the least and often ending in his demise / miraculous escape. I note that the game holds the ability to make satellites and unmanned rockets would it not make sense to provide those command modules as a first step?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see the logic if it\u0027s to reiterate the inherent clumsiness in the kerbal psych, something that is illustrated nicely enough with my early attempts of lets get into space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wondered why and also to ensure i am not missing some essential game play in career mode.

Beyond that, KSP exists in a world somewhat like a Heinlein Juvenile novel; the kerbals have powerful rockets, but limited computers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T08:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso add kerbodogs, kerbomonkeys and kerbomouses as unpilotted uncontrollable pod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might make sense as the first man sent probe also was computer controlled.

Feel free to dig through the search function (select thread titles only and input Career, for example), beyond that there\u0027s no real reason to keep this topic open. Also it\u0027s not exactly a gameplay question, you\u0027re either making a suggestion or asking a rhethorical question (general discussions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest reasoning I\u0027ve read is that the game is called Kerbal Space Program, the little green dudes that want to reach space so bad they\u0027re willing to strap themselves to SRBs and just go. It\u0027s not called Probecore Space Program. Not starting with Kerbals would limit the game\u0027s feel significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it IS a computer game, not a realworld simulation, thus it doesn\u0027t have to make sense in the normal regard on every little point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all that said, please use the search function to find more to read about this topic, it really has been talked to death though so locking this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
