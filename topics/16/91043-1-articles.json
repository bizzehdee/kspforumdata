Best way is to take them with you as long as possible, then drop them as you go to circularize. Once the main ship is in a stable orbit switch to the sub-orbital stage and follow it down until it lands. The magic cutoff is around 22 km, above that stages that are on rails won\u0027t get deleted by KSP but below that they will (even if they have crew on them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo working mods that get around this limitation (through very different methods) are StageRecovery (link in my signature) and FMRS (Flight Manager for Reusable Stages). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods aren\u0027t evil or cheating (if you think mods like Real Solar System are cheating then you have a weird definition of cheating), but I can respect wanting to play the vanilla game. Just keep in mind that KSP is still in heavy development and many mods are simply improvements on the base game that the developers haven\u0027t gotten to yet (some of which get pulled into the base game by the developers, like Space Plane Plus and FinePrint). When KMP came out Squad reversed their decision on Multiplayer features. When the 64 bit community hack came out they reversed their decision on releasing a 64 bit Windows client (which was as bad or worse than they warned, so I\u0027m glad they didn\u0027t do it earlier).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ISmokeThis","CreatedById":98831,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T19:35:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t mean to say that if you use mods, you aren\u0027t playing the game properly or something in that context.
