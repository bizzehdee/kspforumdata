It\u0027s designed to take 1000 tons to orbit and hopefully far beyond.(Especially when/if I fit ground and asteroid mining gear in it.) I have it set up as best I can to minimize forward movement of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E at full. I\u0027m have it basically finished and I use a tri wing setup allowing me to easily move the wing tips up or down to make it slightly above or below the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E. It\u0027s normally centered/inline, but will it help to have it higher or lower and not inline? It\u0027s very laggy to test as it is 1k parts atm. So, I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027m trying to achieve earlier runway takeoff(if even possible given the weight to wing surface), and anything that makes the wings fundamentally stronger for rentry and higher speed adjustment of the nose. Do either higher or lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E achieve any of that logically? I\u0027m not sure which is better for empty/near empty landings either. That and my lack of break power are about my only concern at this point. IF I decided to add drones and increase the parts count I will also potentially add a lot more wheels to try to save \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E by adding more litho-breaking headroom via higher speed landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, far high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E seems to help with keeping the plane straight on takeoff at max weight. Or I think it does. I can\u0027t tell if I\u0027m imagining it or not.

If anyone actually flies this. Unless you really want to, don\u0027t fly over like 1900m/s before 19k or you loose rapiers and whiplashes and have to use more expensive engines. Sadly air intakes stop working around there. Unless you can get up to where nukes fly on their own. So, either slower or faster. I\u0027m not sure what altitude nukes can maintain velocity in this newer design. Or I could be wrong and this is optimal to maintain speed into orbit.

It won\u0027t make a difference for how fast you can take off - that\u0027s purely about lift/weight ratio. It won\u0027t affect wing strength either - that will depend on attachment method and (auto)strutting. I can\u0027t figure out what \u0022higher speed adjustment of the nose\u0022 means, so I can\u0027t say if it would make any difference for that either. If you mean a more reactive plane to control inputs - that depends on your control surfaces and how far away from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E they are (your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E are already relatively close, that won\u0027t need much change).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe height of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E relative to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E mostly affects flight stability and behaviour at high angles of attack or when banking. In my own experience, having it slightly above \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, combined with a bit of camber, tends to help with stability during reentry. Theoretically the aero forces would then keep the craft heading belly-first, or trying to get back into that attitude if disturbed. But it\u0027s a delicate combination of factors that can\u0027t really be taken individually only - sometimes it adds more instability instead.

I removed all the engines and added 64 panthers, 8 nukes, 28 rapiers. It\u0027s now 700 parts and 2880 tones with a minimum weight of 580 tons(1580 tons with cargo) instead of 1200(2200 tons with cargo). I\u0027m hoping to slowly get it into orbit and get it to laythe. If not I\u0027ll add mining drones to let it skip to destinations. I was able to fly my 100 rapiers up to 400kn of thrust. I\u0027m hoping to push them to some lower altitude high thrust and get out of orbit. The Jpanthers are to get it off the runway and aimed up in time. I\u0027ll have to see. If it works it will have some very nice high isp cruising engines for laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think afterwords I\u0027ll make a smaller 500 ton cargo version(if I can get this to orbit) that halves everything and reduces the parts count to around 350 so it\u0027s manageable. It will be a nearly identical half stated version with half weight, half engines, etc. Should be easier to fly and probably lack the bad lag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-20T23:01:18Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2018 11:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-21T11:05:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou, sir, are entirely insane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow make it a flatbed or underslung design, so you can loft bigger cargoes than what fit into those Mk3 bays. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-21T13:21:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223490867\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179921\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221542749534\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arugela\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Arugela said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was more confused if there is partial thrust blockage and how to test it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no such thing as partial thrust blockage.
