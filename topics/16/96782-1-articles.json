Has anyone figured out what the game does to place kerbals in certain IVA seats? Here\u0027s my dilemma: I\u0027m using the Mk1-2 pod for 2 crew members and I want them both sitting in the pilot/co-pilot seats up front. But one of them always ends up down in the back seat. So I went into the internal.cfg file for the Mk1-2 pod and found that the backseat module was listed first, and I changed it to be listed last, hoping that would fill the two front seats first. Nope. So then I outright deleted the module for the back seat location. That had no effect whatsoever. So I tried re-ordering the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003Ecrew\u003C/span\u003E name fields in the Mk1-2 \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003EPART{}\u003C/span\u003E of the SFS file for my vessel. No difference. So finally I gave up and edited a third crew member in there, had two climb out and climb back in to swap seats from front to back. Then I went into the SFS file and removed the third crew member. After restarting the game, I loaded up the rocket and found both remaining crew members still sitting in the front seat! Yet when I EVA one and have him climb back in, he\u0027s now in the back seat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea how the game is remembering which seat the kerbal is sitting in, all I see in the SFS file are the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003Ecrew\u003C/span\u003E fields that tells the game who is in the capsule, but not \u003Cem\u003Ewhere\u003C/em\u003E they are in the capsule. And yet the game seems to remember somehow. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E (I looked in the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003EKERBAL{}\u003C/span\u003E node too.
