I decided to just build a probe and send it out into space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fitted an ion engine, had a detachable rocket stage and went to it. The rocket got me in a wide orbit around the solar system. I dropped the rocket and throttled up the Ion engine figuring eventually it will continue to push the orbit out (probably wrong).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I have now is, I can\u0027t do anything else. I can\u0027t warp time with the Ion engine throttled up to see if it works. I also can\u0027t return to the space center with the engine throttled up.

You\u0027ll run out of Xenon before you make a dent in your orbit. Ions are certainly efficient, but the thrust is next to zero. Literally. I really think they\u0027d be more useful if the thrust was maybe 2, or 4, instead of what it is now (0.50?). If it was 4, they\u0027d actually be useful.
