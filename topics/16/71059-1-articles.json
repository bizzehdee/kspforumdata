The answer they got was to split it into 3 smaller burns. This is something I\u0027ve been wondering about for awhile now. I installed a mod with several ion engines and tanks but the TWR is sooo low that it\u0027ll take me an hour or 2 to get to just Duna. Can someone explain to me how to split the burn into smaller parts and still get the timing right? or maybe a better solution to the problem? I\u0027d like to use the ion engines to send small probes to all the planets instead of building big, long probes using standard engines.
