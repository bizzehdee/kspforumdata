The root part\u0027s (partial) config looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EPART\u003Cbr\u003E   {\u003Cbr\u003E      name = dockingPort2\u003Cbr\u003E      uid = 2786357868\u003Cbr\u003E      mid = 1455513462\u003Cbr\u003E      parent = 0\u003Cbr\u003E      position = 0,0,0\u003Cbr\u003E[B]      rotation = 0,0,0,1[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E      mirror = 1,1,1\u003Cbr\u003E*-snip-*\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, the ship itself has\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Erot = 0.4343523,0.723475,-0.536573,0.00338749\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, I don\u0027t know what min/max values should be, or which value to even change.
