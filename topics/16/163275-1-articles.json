Today I just unlocked the big orange tanks, and because I have potato PC I thought great, anything that reduces parts is fantastic. structural stability is great too. Since I had plenty of tourist missions, I decided my first use of the orange tanks would be to give an older tourist shuttle a slight revamp. However, I ran into a slight problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite the orange tanks appearing to be identical to 2x rockomax x200-32, it seems on my game this is not the case. Despite the client displaying them to be identical, and mechjeb showing identical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and delta v, when it comes to actually using them it is a completely different story. The only difference between these two rockets, apart from the tanks, are fuel lines and struts, which are placed in the same manner but will just be in slightly differing positions. The shuttle part of the rockets were not changed at all, in fact I even left the solar panels which clip through some fuel tanks just to remove as many variables as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tested the orange tanks in a handful of ways, (including with the solar panels fixed) and every time they lose out to 2x x200-32. When it is just a probe on top of the tank/s and a mainsail at the bottom, the difference is fairly slight. However, it becomes even more significant if I use the pictured\u00A0vehicle but remove the first stage radial boosters. Mechjeb claims a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.61 for this instance, but as soon as the structural supports are released it will actually fall towards the pad. The x200-32 stack always takes off with decent acceleration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the moment, it isn\u0027t much of a problem. The numbers of parts I could save by using these tanks over other types is minimal. By the time it reached a significant number, the rest of the ship would cripple my cpu. I am very frustrated by it though because of how odd it seems. I haven\u0027t noticed (but haven\u0027t checked either) of similar issues with other synonymous parts. I have already validated client files through steam. I am very happy to upload the craft files, I am just not entirely sure what a good place for them is. Somewhere that doesn\u0027t require sign up would be great. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr: orange tanks appear bugged on my client\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: image link fixed(?) the second ship in gallery I forgot to show the engineer report in bottom right side, but weight is identical, H/L/W etc all identical or near enough. I have ran other tests all measurements identical, the only things that haven\u0027t been tested to be exact are cost and the part count is lower by one or two I think, simply by using the orange tanks instead of the x200-32\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-15T10:43:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2017 10:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Brandenburg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-16T00:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLT is the same for both craft, burn time is the same for both craft, delta-V is the same for both craft.

Every part on your test vehicle that isn\u0027t either the part being tested or strictly necessary for the test to function is a part that can potentially\u00A0screw up your test result. Try building your craft without fuel lines entirely, then try to compare your tanks again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Craft 1 consists of a Mk1-2 capsule, two X200-32 tanks, and a Skipper engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Craft 2 consists of a Mk1-2 capsule, one orange tank, and a Skipper engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotice how the only parts apart from the tanks are the engine (necessary for flight) and the pod (necessary for control). Add a nosecone or parachute to taste, if you like. Using the simplest possible vehicle ensures that no unforeseen interaction will make you come to the wrong conclusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a second step, you can then make the vehicle more complex. For example, try a \u0022Heavy\u0022 configuration with two additional identical cores (minus the pod, plus a nosecone) attached to the center by radial decouplers. No fuel lines yet! After you verify that this vessel behaves properly, you can then add fuel lines in a third step.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-17T19:47:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Gameplay Questions, since this seems to be an issue with playing the game rather than a general discussion about KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-17T20:42:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I need a craft file. craft files are just text files -- so you can upload them to anyplace that accepts text files.
