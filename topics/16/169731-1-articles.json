During entry, even a very slow entry that more than circumnavigates the planet before losing enough velocity to descend in the lower atmosphere, part of my rocket is overheating to the point of exploding, causing the rocket to disintegrate. As you can see in the pictures below, there are four inflatable heat shields in front, nine in back for stability. What you can\u0027t see is that a central cluster of seven Vector engines, each of which has the widest conventional heat shield attached to it. Also the rocket is covered in parachutes and radiators. I\u0027m not sure if radiators actually do anything during atmospheric entry, but they seem to buy me more time before the thing explodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/PlhJ6Ws.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022PlhJ6Ws.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere the rocket is during early insertion.

As you can see in the first picture, there is no way for hot air to get through to that point. I\u0027ll explain more what you see here with the following two pictures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/PYc2F7k.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022PYc2F7k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ejOm7vS.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022ejOm7vS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe airstream shell is there to protect a vector engine, the final stage\u0027s power plant, from hot air that hot be getting through. I honestly don\u0027t now if they do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea where the heat causing that section of my rocket is coming from, or even if it is really heating up or hat matter. The radiators on that section have never read above 15%. All of the radiators on this rocket are attached via radial decouplers, so they can be jettisoned once the parachutes are fully inflated at about 2300 meters. When the explosions start, they seem to start around there. They might also starting n the central Vector engine cluster, but I have no way to really know. In the flight events log, it usually lists structural failures between the adapter fuel tanks above the final Vector Engine, as well as and exploding Vector engine somewhere in the rocket. FYI: I\u0027m using vector engines because they have the highest in atmosphere thrust percentage, and can be easily clustered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if anyone has any ideas what is causing this problem, please say so. And does anyone know if radiators actually do anything during Eve entry? Also, if anyone has a design for a Eve liftoff vehicle that weighs less than 700 tons (my current design is over 1100) and can lift 16 or more kerbals off of Eve in one go, please share it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbalstar","CreatedById":154159,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-18T04:51:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure that a structural failure is having to much weight on the connection.

I don\u0027t really believe any ship is necessarily too big. You can make an Eve lander as large as you want to. And I always manually strut everything; so I don\u0027t see a problem with those either. However, there is definitely such a thing as having so much more than you need that it\u0027s become detrimental. And I\u0027m not speaking theoretically about what\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0work, but from experience about what\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0work. Even the slow descent works just fine for me. The reason these things work is that all the parts of my ship are shielded properly. It usually takes quite a bit of testing to get it right; but it always works. And I have never used a single radiator or thermal control. Those are just completely unnecessary. And not unnecessary like people will say about extra Kerbals. You\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to bring extra Kerbals, and that\u0027s fine. I do it, too. But unless you just\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to bring radiators for some reason, ditch \u0027em. And all those \u0027chutes. I\u0027m not even sure what to say. I\u0027ve told you on another thread that my 500 ton lander uses 15 \u0027chutes. Six drogues and 9 regular. I specifically build each lander with descent engines that first lower my orbit, and then burn again just before touchdown for a smooth landing. I think your design has gotten a bit out of hand. I would recommend you takes step back and look at what you\u0027re doing and ask yourself if you can do better. There\u0027s no shame in failure in this game. It is not the same as defeat. You are not giving up, just changing tactics. Take all that you\u0027ve learned and build your ship again from scratch. That sounds like a huge undertaking, but we all do it all the time.
