They were already on their interplanetary journey so it was just simple achieve orbit maneuvers. Well first probe Gets in Duna\u0027s SOI and I decide I have enough delta V to not even bother with an aerobrake, and have no heat shield with using deadly reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way I have my 3 stock nuclear engines fire up and start the slow down process to achieve orbit. 2 minutes into the burn one of my solar panels explodes. I am at an altitude of at least 500,000 m. I check the log by hitting F3 and it says solar panel destroyed be reentry heat. Ok I use a few mods, maybe just a stupid glitch I can deal with that. I check my other 2 panels and 1 is at around 15 C yet the other is around 500 C. Thinking maybe somehow the exhaust from my engines is affecting them except they are all symmetrical and far away from the engines. I kill the engines and see the temp on the high temp one go up a bit more but then starts to drop (very slowly I must add). I end up having to watch the temperature and do multiple burns to get in orbit. Ok, no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell my Ike probe hits the SOI and I plan for its orbital burn. Set it up and burn and now that I\u0027m aware I start looking at the temp of my solar panels. 2 are fine and one is rising rapidly. I do a quicksave just to test it thinking maybe its something with my design. Well I let the panel overheat and explode. Ok done. Everything else should be fine. I check the other 2 and now another one has a temp rising rapidly again. This time though even when I kill the engines the temp doesn\u0027t drop so I can\u0027t control it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have restarted the game a few times thinking maybe it was a bug, but no luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts as to what\u0027s going on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods used:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadly reentry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKER\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal alarm clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal joint reinforcement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar (I have no waste heat also if that is what you are thinking and have radiators)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Escansat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETac life support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-13T04:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENeed a picture of the ship.

Good call though and thank you for the info. Do you know how exactly the heat works in interstellar? I am clueless. Half the parts Im still trying to firure out how they work and theres no documentation I can find. Either way, technically all 3 panels should heat up and explode at the same time under the scenarios I put them under testing this then. I have also used both mods prior to .24 and they always played nice together.
