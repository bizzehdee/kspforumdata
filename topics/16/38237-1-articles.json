Now I want to use it to get some stuff into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is how do I attach the probe to the ship itself? Whenever I try to build the probe (with the spaceplane already built), I cant attach anything to the bottom of it. On the other hand, I have a probe prebuilt, but I cant find out how to mate it to the rocket/space plane so I can actually get it into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried using Payloaderm, but the command line always crashes on me (I have the correct version of Java installed, and Payloader is in the KSP file archive)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T02:20:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recommend using Subassembly Loader.
