Looking at various deltaV-maps I cannot find the answer myself, so maybe some pro out there can help me:\n\n1. My mothership is currently landed on Minmus surface and has 700m/s deltaV left. I want to launch, get into solar orbit and then get back to Kerbin. Do I have enough deltaV for doing this? If not, how much would I need?\n\n2. I have a small dinghy attached with a separate deltaV of 3500m/s. Once in solar orbit, I want to undock it and go on a quick solar suborbit with it and then re-dock. (Yes, it is one of those tourist contracts). How do I do this most efficiently; do I have to enter solar orbit by burning retrograde (to Kerbin\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s solar orbit) out of Minmus orbit instead of a prograde burn before I undock the dinghy? What about an ejection from polar orbit?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T22:16:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Falkenherz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T15:17:12Z","Content":"Farming for XP I see. \n\nWell, this should be possible with 700m/s. \n\nFrom memory (I can\u0027t check the charts here)\n\n- Minmus off = 200m/s\n\n- Escaping Minmus = 80m/s\n\n- To Solar SOI = 90m/s\n\n- Eliptic orbit with PE around 40km = 200m/s ?\n\nDon\u0027t forget to save before though..."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T15:25:42Z","Content":"700 is pretty low, but I think you can do it. Technically.\n\nI use [http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png](http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png) which is wrong in atmo since 1.0 but the rest is still correct.\n\nYou need about 180\u002B70\u002B90\u002B20 to escape Kerbin SOI from Minmus\u0027 surface, or roughly 360 m/s. To get back to Kerbin SOI you can either do a tiny burn and wait about half a year to get back, or burn up a few hundred m/s to get back quicker. That\u0027s the hardest part of this, from a dV standpoint.\n\nIf you opt to wait half a year and use maneuver nodes (and some patience and trial/error with them) you can from outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI return to Kerbin for a few m/s. Maybe 10. If you opt to do it right away, you\u0027ll use (as I said) a few hundred just to get back to Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\n\nOne trick if you opt for the faster journey: You don\u0027t need to get back to Kerbin. You just need to reach Mun\u0027s SOI. If you angle it correctly, you can come in, swing by Mun, and exit Mun\u0027s SOI backwards which should drop you nicely onto Kerbin.\n\nAnd to answer the unasked question you assumed, the charts really aren\u0027t designed to answer most of this question ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T15:27:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 03:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman**\n  \nDidn\u0027t see you were on the surface."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T15:40:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u003Csnip /\u003EI use [http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png](http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png) which is wrong in atmo since 1.0 but the rest is still correct. \u003Csnip /\u003E\n\nUpdated image for 1.0.x at [http://i.imgur.com/9vVZMxq.png](http://i.imgur.com/9vVZMxq.png), BTW.\n\nYou\u0027d need 360 to launch from Minmus and escape Kerbin, so that part you could do. Whether the 3500 in the dingy could do the trick or not, though, is questionable; the way I\u0027m reading it is a flat out no, but others might have different opinions. Maybe with a bi-elliptic transfer maneuver.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T15:45:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 03:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T18:01:53Z","Content":"Concur with the earlier posters\u0027 response that 700 m/s is easily enough to leave Kerbin SoI from Minmus surface and then return. You don\u0027t have to wait half a year, and you don\u0027t need hundreds of m/s of dV to return. All you need to do is to manage your Minmus ejection so that you\u0027re in an elliptic orbit around Kerbin whose apoapsis just *barely* leaves the SoI. That will take a few weeks of calendar time, but it means you\u0027ll leave Kerbin\u0027s SoI with a very low velocity relative to Kerbin, which means that you can then use a fairly low dV burn to head home again.\n\nAs for your dinghy question:\n\nWhat exactly is the dinghy supposed to do? You didn\u0027t say exactly what your tourist contract is for. If it\u0027s just \u0022orbit the sun\u0022, you don\u0027t need the dinghy at all-- simply peeking outside Kerbin\u0027s SoI is all you need, because you\u0027re orbiting the Sun the moment you do that. You\u0027re already doing that with your main mothership, so no extra dinghy shenanigans required.\n\nOn the other hand, if you\u0027ve got one of those \u0022**suborbital** trajectory on the Sun\u0022 contracts, I\u0027d say that 3500 m/s would be nowhere near enough. Maybe you could finesse it with a bielliptic transfer, if you\u0027re willing for the trip to take many years. Anything that drops your periapsis down to the sun is going to have huge dV requirements, that\u0027s why Moho takes so much dV to visit."},{"CreatedByName":"Falkenherz","CreatedById":141969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T21:30:15Z","Content":"Thanks, guys! This helped me a lot to dare the step out of the Kerbin door!
