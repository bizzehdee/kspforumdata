Cost me a small fortune in career mode. I worked around that by always adding at least one OX-STAT to the craft so it could eventually charge and possibly save my vessel.

Set a maneuver node at the point of impact and drag retrograde until node Ap hits the surface. Start the burn when time to node equals node burn time.\n\nIt\u0027s not perfect (it ignores rising TWR as fuel is burned off), if you want to squeak the last bit of efficiency out of the maneuver you should start a bit later, but this is a simple method that requires no math on the fly and leaves a comfortable safety margin."},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T11:15:03Z","Content":"For the OP: engineers can also open solar panels when power is out - though I don\u0027t have much other reasons to bring one for the Kerbin based missions. As they can repack \u0027chutes too, they mostly spend their time on interplanetary operations.\n\nThe most useful hint I got for 1.0 career mode is to bring an octo-core too for manned science missions. The octo has an inbuilt SAS module, so I can keep stability without having to take a pilot.
