First. I\u0027ll explain what I am trying to do and why.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am using antenna range in lieu of the 1.2 KSP update which is alleged to add something similar. I currently have a probe landed on Minmus that loses connection when it cannot \u0022see\u0027 Kerbin. I wish to place three satellites in an equilateral triangle formation which should be able to provide a constant connection. I have worked out that the minimum altitude required for this is 60km with 120 degrees of separation. I plan to put the satellites into a higher orbit than this to provide additional clearance for the signal from the surface of Minmus, I believe a higher altitude also provides longevity in terms of resonance between the three satellites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe three satellites are currently\u00A0attached to a single vessel which is in an orbit of (or about to be in an orbit of) 60km x 20km. I understand the first satellite can deploy and burn prograde to 60 x 60 at any time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy questions are; What is \u0022resonance\u0022 anyway? How do I work it out/alter resonance characteristics? And how do I work out when to deploy the second and third\u00A0satellites from their given orbit into the desired orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this all makes sense and my objectives are clear. I\u0027m not an uneducated individual, however my maths skills are pretty poor, so terminology may need to be explained - though I did manage to workout the height of the orbit by simply constructing an equilateral triangle within a circle/orbit which is twice the radius of the given body (Minmus R =\u00A060km. 2R = 120km. Altitude = 60km). Though please correct me if I have misunderstood this method.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks everyone!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T16:08:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically the low value integer ratio of the two orbital periods... in musical terms the harmonious chord of the two notes of the orbits. the music of the spheres indeed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin the case of a simple constellation of comm sats like\u00A0you have descibed\u00A0it will be 1:1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may want to up it to 4 or 5.
