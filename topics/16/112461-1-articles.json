The rocked exploded because of the gravity impact and the game was not play able. So I opened with **\u0022alt \u002B F12\u0022** the performance tool. And I had **\u0022fix\u0022 25 fps.** \n\nWhat to I mean with \u0022fix\u0022 25 fps? Well, if you do a normal performance check you will have some up- and down spikes. But this line was laser-light-beam-straight. No \u0022ups\u0022 nor \u0022downs\u0022.\n\n![pq8dd7jr.jpg](http://fs2.directupload.net/images/150609/pq8dd7jr.jpg)\n\n**The first step:** Blame the others! Due to the fact that I was using some part mods I thought that maybe one mod was destroying my gaming performance like China was destroying all hope for Tibet. So I decided to open a big ship with just stock parts. [The mighty \u0022Starhammer\u0022 from ShadoZone](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114779-Need-a-hammer-A-STARHAMMER) (557 parts).\n\n No changes at the launch pad. I still had fixed 25 fps.\n\n**Second step:** Just...just blame still the others\u0022. Because I was also using some graphic mods I decided to installed a clean KSP v1.0.2 with no mods. That version was that fresh like the with snow in the never-ending wildness of Siberia during a long and cold winter.\n\n No changes at the launch pad. I still had fixed 25 fps.\n\n**Third step:** Increase the power...huahuahua! So I downloaded \u0022Nvidia Inspector\u0022 (for sure the actual version 1.9.7.3) to optimize my settings. I played around with the Nvidia-settings like an 14 year old boy do it with boobs during his first .... time. \n\n No changes at the launch pad. I still had fixed 25 fps.\n\n**Forth step:** I got \u0022a little angry\u0022...not so angry like the people during the French Revolution but sill a bit. And so I decided to clean install Windows 8.1...why not. We do all for the game, right? ^^\n\n No changes at the launch pad. I still had fixed 25 fps.\n\n**Fifth step:** The duel - part 1: Maybe the reason was the version of KSP. So installed a also very clean version of KSP v0.9 and loaded the \u0022Starhammer\u0022. \n\n No changes at the launch pad. I still had fixed 25 fps.\n\n**Sixed step:** The duel - part 2: I used the maximal graphic settings in KSP v1.0.2 and recorded the frame rates. Than I used the minimal graphic settings to compare those both. And the result was very interesting:\n\nThe test environment: The Base-Screen. The VAB-Screen. The launch pad-screen:\n\n**Minimal Settings: about 60 fps. about 60 fps. fixed 25 fps.**\n\n**Maximal Setting: about 60 fps. about 46 fps. fixed 25 fps.**\n\n**And my GPU was not even used to 100% from the game. Around 50\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 C.**\n\nI mean, the GPU was that bored he counted to infinity and back because he was bored to tears. Not even the fans were turning on. So maybe there is some space for optimizing the resources.\n\n**And neither was the CPU on his limit. He just \u0022warmed up\u0022. Around 50\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C.**\n\nIf I play \u0022War Thunder\u0022, which is raping my GPU, I have 85\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 C and more (with 70 fps) and the fans are spinning around like some cool rappers in a underground club.\n\nBut still, even with the lowest possible graphic setting: I still had fixed 25 fps.\n\n**Seventh step:** Maybe ask the others^^ So in the forum I learned a lot about KSP. It just use one core and not all of my 16 GB of ram. But....but this all makes still no sense because of the \u0022fixed\u0022 frame rate of 25 fps.\n\n**Imprortant information: If I load the pre-installed aircraft \u0022Stearwing A300\u0022 (105 parts) and launch it at the launch pad I have, with maximal graphic settings, a frame rate of around 60.**\n\n**So my question to the community is:** Do you also have noticed this strange \u0022fixed 25 fps\u0022 when you start an 300\u002B part ship? Maybe some of you will donwnload the [\u0022Starhammer\u0022](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114779-Need-a-hammer-A-STARHAMMER) and tell me your frame rate at the launch pad.\n\n**My Computer:**\n\nGPU: Geforce GTX 880m\n\nCPU: i7-4700HQ, 3,2 GHz\n\n**Or, do you know some work arounds for getting off this \u0022internal fixed frame rate\u0022?**\n\nBest regards\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T15:38:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WolfS**"},{"CreatedByName":"includao","CreatedById":145136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T22:09:59Z","Content":"Any solutions?"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T22:42:53Z","Content":"That frame rate indicator is not accurate at \u003C= 25 fps.

The amount of calculations required is basically proportional to the square of the number of parts so if you double the number of parts then four times the calculations are done."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T03:02:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That frame rate indicator is not accurate at \u003C= 25 fps.

That\u0027s a splendid blunder.\nIt reminds me of something that happened when the Antarctic \u0022ozone hole\u0022 was first being investigated.
