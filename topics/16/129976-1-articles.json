Basically, you start get diminishing returns rather quickly in terms of adding more fuel/thrust. You need a little more dV so you add more fuel only to discover your TWR is too low, so you add more thrust, only to discover you need more fuel, so on and so forth. This is why rockets use stages, and specific to your situation, why the Apollo lander had two stages.
