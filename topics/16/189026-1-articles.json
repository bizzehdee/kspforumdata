The trick is making sure the heat shield actually faces forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy typical reentry vessel of a pod with chutes, the crew cabin, and a heat shield, will not be aerodynamically stable. That is, it will tend to skew off retrograde if you let it. At that point, the oncoming airstream hits the side of the crew cabin and will quickly dismantle it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you have at least a level 1 pilot (effortlessly achieved by doing one oribtal flight around Kerbin and returning), then you can set \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to \u0022hold retrograde\u0022. The Mk1 pod has enough torque to keep the craft straight during reentry, so only the heat shield is facing the airstream. That way, the crew cabin survives just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same likely applies to the Science Jr. materials bay. It weighs much less than the capsule, and therefore, the center of mass is moved away from the heatshield, which causes aerodynamic instability and makes the craft want to skew (or perhaps even flip). Be sure to tell your pilot to always hold retrograde during reentry. If that isn\u0027t enough to keep the craft stable, either rebuild it in a more aerodynamically stable fashion (heavy bits at the front, draggy bits at the back), or just add more reaction wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-18T20:31:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2019 08:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-18T21:51:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that helps to retrieve the materials bay intact is to right-click on it after use and close the door.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-18T22:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry adjusting the angle of how you come in.
