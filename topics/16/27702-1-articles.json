This method is extraordinarily inefficient and wastes fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s generally better to start inclining the ascent once your ship is out of the troposphere, around 10 kilometers up. If you angle to about 45 degrees along heading 090, you pick up an additional boost from the planet\u0027s rotation. This has two main effects. First, thrust won\u0027t need to be used to change the ship\u0027s direction so more of it can be used to accelerate the ship. Secondly (and more importantly) during the initial ascent phase the vehicle can maintain a low or even zero angle of attack; this minimizes transverse aerodynamic stress.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jbaltus123","CreatedById":64954,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T14:55:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edid is an video about gravity turns and I DONT KNOW HOW MANY METER TO START GRAVITY TURN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJ2yqga7IrI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cranium","CreatedById":69153,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T15:34:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027m going to just hijack this thread for my own purposes, hopefully trying to bring it back on topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a problem anytime I am trying to get into orbit.

It takes a BIG dV change to get from the Launchpad to orbit, but once you\u0027re near orbital speed, tiny changes in velocity result in big differences in your apoapsis. Watch on map view as you get close to orbital speed, and notice how rapidly the curve is changing in those final seconds. Shutting down the engine a fraction of a second too late can raise the apoapsis by hundreds of kilometers. But that\u0027s easy enough to avoid. Just throttle back as you get close to making a closed curve out of your projected path, and shut the engine down once it\u0027s a circle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jbaltus123","CreatedById":64954,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T16:19:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis is a video about ORBIT FAILS! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/rOmx-xTxebQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Payload","CreatedById":4540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T17:20:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jbaltus123\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jbaltus123\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou dont need itjust its better\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUhmm well I disagree. If you don\u0027t do a gravity turn all the fuel you just spent going up is wasted. You only want to go up just enough so that you are just exiting the atmosphere when you are nearly orbital. Then you inject to your desired AP and burn to circularize when you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis game is incredibly forgiving when it comes to fuel quantities. IRL, you are never making orbit without a gravity turn. There was only one reported case of it not happening that way. The US government preformed an underground nuclear test called Pascal-B and the capping plate on the main shaft was launched at nearly three times earth escape velocity. The engineers did the math and thought it might be interesting so they setup a camera on the capping plate prior to the test. The capping plate was seen in only one frame of video. I would also like to note that the plate still did not likely achieve orbit. It was probably incinerated by friction heating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Plumbbob\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Plumbbob\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you have posted is exactly how not to do it.
