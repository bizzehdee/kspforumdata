They can also be safer (in case of a mishap) because your periapsis will remain within Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, so you won\u0027t be stranded if something goes wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne caveat: a lot of people, when learning how to do a direct ascent, make the mistake of just going straight up. This is wrong; in order to get the efficiency benefit, you must make a gravity turn. Therefore, you want to launch a little bit \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E KSC reaches the appropriate ejection angle, because you will cover some distance during the ascent, and it\u0027s the top of your gravity turn (not the location of KSC) which must line up with your ejection burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second caveat: if you have the flying skill to put yourself into a 70km by 70km orbit, a direct ascent gains you little, since you will need to be mostly out of the atmosphere before you start your transfer burn even for a direct ascent. The inefficiency of circularizing comes from spending fuel to raise your periapsis, but your periapsis will end up above about 60km no matter how you do it (unless you go straight up, which will cost you more in gravity losses than you save), so there isn\u0027t all that much difference with just circularizing at 70km and making a standard transfer.
