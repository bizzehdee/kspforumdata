I just wanted to practice landing at precise places on planets with an atmosphere, so I launched a very simple MK1 command pod to see if I could land it close to the\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Now that it is in a low Kerbin orbit, I am seeing these green line vectors pointing down to the surface. Are they some kind of communication vectors? They seem random, pointing to spots in the middle of the oceans at time, My ship is about as basic as you can get, it is a MK1 command pod with a heat shield, parachute and enough fuel to de-orbit me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are the green vectors trying to convey\u00A0to me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ForScience6686","CreatedById":144187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-26T19:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes that\u0027s communications. \u00A0 What you are seeing is the connection to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E \u00A0tracking station. \u00A0 it does have the ability to track through a bit of \u00A0kerbin \u00A0which is what I\u0027m guessing you are seeing when it\u0027s in \u00A0the ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ty Tan Tu","CreatedById":167214,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-26T20:25:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\u00A0ForScience6686.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nD\u0027oh!
