Your maneuver node to circularize has to be placed exactly at that apsis. If at apoapsis, you need burn prograde to raise the periapsis; if at periapsis, you need burn retrograde to lower apoapsis, in both cases to change the other apsis altitude. If the maneuver is done exactly at the apsis, that apsis altitude won\u0027t change and neither the apsis position; if done earlier or later, you\u0027ll also have the apsis position rotate and change altitude. With finite time maneuvers (taking some time to execute) you need to start the burn half the burn duration before reaching the apsis, so thrust\u00A0 components before and after the apsis balance out deviations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould you have an orbit that crosses your intended altitude (100 Km) but neither of the apsides are at that altitude, you may burn radial while at that altitude to change altitude and position of both apsides (that\u0027s less efficient however than burning at both apsides to correct the altitude of the opposite one).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-27T14:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides what diomedea said -- the reality is that when you burn prograde, you\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ealways raise both your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.

But your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E will always go up a little.

You set your maneuver node and burn a little before you reach your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E. You control your burn so the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E does not move out very far in front of you. The farther it is in front of you, the faster it will increase as you burn. When your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E gets up to maybe 10km below the final value, you burn just enough to set your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E to the final value. Then you wait until two seconds before\u00A0the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and burn just enough to get your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to the final value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-27T15:09:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to just drop a node and set up a burn, go ahead and drop that node fairly close to AP.\u00A0 Once you have the burn planned more-or-less, zoom in and slide the node so projected AP matches better with current.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
