I\u0027m certain the method involves launching to an equatorial orbit and then burning to the necessary inclination, but how does one figure out just when to burn?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"matt_cain","CreatedById":63941,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T04:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I do is select the mun as a target, which is at 0 degrees inclination. It will show the ascending and descending nodes when you do relative to that 0 point.
