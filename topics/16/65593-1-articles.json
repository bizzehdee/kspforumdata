You can always add more fuel and more engines, so the tricky part is making sure it won\u0027t fall part. As SRV Ron suggested, build in stages. That is, attach the very last stage to the payload first, launch it, and make sure it holds together across through the duration of the stage. Once that\u0027s working, add the second to last stage and make sure that holds together, and so on. Install mechjeb or some equivalent to get info on dV and TWR for each stage, and if you have a general idea of what sort of rocket you want, that info can guide your design. For instance, if you\u0027re doing serial staging and have the same engine type (mainsails, say) for every stage, then the optimal design will divide dV evenly between all stages. If some of your engines are more efficient than others, you\u0027ll probably want to give slightly more dV to those stages. I don\u0027t know off the top of my head what the optimal strategy is for dividing dV in asparagus rockets, but I\u0027ve no doubt the answer is on this forum somewhere. Ideal TWR is apparently around 2 on the launch pad - personally I tend to end up quite a bit lower than that because I\u0027m concerned about part counts, and so would rather use a slightly larger fuel tank than deal with cluster engines, but it\u0027s something else to keep in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd use lots struts, but use them smartly - you don\u0027t want to get your part count too high, and a little bit of flex is going to hold together better than something that\u0027s completely rigid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T01:42:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gravitas Shortfall\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gravitas Shortfall\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I don\u0027t know off the top of my head what the optimal strategy is for dividing dV in asparagus rockets, but I\u0027ve no doubt the answer is on this forum somewhere.
