This means KSP can\u0027t differentiate between them because they use the same axis assignments (for example the 1 axis on the throttle is the same as the 1 axis on the stick and you end up controlling the throttle and pitch at the same time by moving the throttle). This is a Unity limitation I\u0027ve been told by the devs. Hopefully that gets fixed with an update sometime\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gummix","CreatedById":105168,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T00:42:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, ty i will try it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4rt14n","CreatedById":101179,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T01:14:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the x 55 cant u use Joy2key or some other program to cpmbine the axis?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T07:16:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eppjoy.
