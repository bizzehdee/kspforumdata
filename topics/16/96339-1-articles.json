However, if you want to do the shortest time in the pod possible (maybe you have TAC life support installed) then you can do it as a direct injection burn, meaning you arrive at orbital altitude and velocity at the right time to be burning to your target. Ultimately this will result in circularising around Kerbin anyway, as part of the transition to the more elliptical orbit, but means you don\u0027t have to physically loop round Kerbin first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the vertical burn all the way, that\u0027s a discussion comes up quite often; the short version is that it\u0027s easier to orbit first, and doesn\u0027t cost significantly more delta-v, so most people prefer to stabilise LKO first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EOne way to think about it (it\u0027s not the right model, but it fits with common sense)... If you go straight up, the distance is less, but you always have Kerbin underneath you all the way until Mun\u0027s SOI, dragging you straight backwards. That is, you\u0027re fighting 100% of gravity to keep going outwards. If you orbit first, then you go out in an ellipse, the pull of gravity behind you is off-centre and some of it goes into making your ship turn sideways, leaving you only fighting maybe 70% along your retrograde, letting you make the same AP for less delta-v from the same starting altitude.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T10:33:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, then my assumption is right.

Basically, you need to raise your apoapsis to the height of the target orbit, but you need to do it in the right place so that the ship and the target arrive there at the same time in order for the target\u0027s gravity to capture the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Mun, that angle just happens to be roughly what you get when you burn at Munrise.

If you are in a minimum orbit around Kerbin, say about 70-75 km, then Mun will rise when the phase angle is about 114 degrees. This is the angle between Mun and your spacecraft as measured from the center of Kerbin. If you burn at that instant to raise your spacecraft\u0027s apoapsis to the height of Mun\u0027s orbit, it will take about 7.4 hours for the spacecraft to travel halfway around Kerbin from its current periapsis to its apoapsis. The spacecraft will have traveled 180 degrees from its starting point, but since it started 114 degrees behind Mun, it will have traveled 180-114 = 66 degrees relative to Mun\u0027s starting position. In that same 7.4 hours that is takes the spacecraft to reach apoapsis, Mun will have traveled 69 degrees around Kerbin. Therefore the spacecraft and Mun will arrive at approximately the same point in space at the same time. With just a little bit of tweaking you can have a very nice encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
