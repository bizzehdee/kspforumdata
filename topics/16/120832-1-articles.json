I cobbled together all the separate parts on a transfer stage that has six nukes. It\u0027s a huge ship, and its TWR is infinitesimal. The burn time for my Jool transfer ended up being almost 6 hours, and I\u0027m not sure how to approach that!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to break up a burn time like that; is it just a matter of laboriously babysitting 50 or so partial burns? And if not, is this something that can be fixed by slapping on more nukes, or do I really need more powerful engines? Nukes seem to be the most efficient, dv wise, but maybe when a ship gets too big they become unworkable? What is the maximum burn time that I should consider tolerable?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-14T02:35:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2015 02:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cephalo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T21:08:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how big your ship is, but if you\u0027re actually trying to visit every single biome in Jool, you should be using drills to get the fuel you need.

If you can get your burn down to an hour or less, then you can get at least some Oberth advantage by making multiple passes-- i.e. do a burn of a few minutes to raise your apoapsis, then coast around, do another burn to raise it again, possibly a 3rd or 4th time, so that you\u0027re always doing your burns at low periapsis and getting maximum Oberth advantage.
