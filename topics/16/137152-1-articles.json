Sure you can do it but there\u0027s a screwdriver RIGHT THERE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have 2 ships in orbit around Kerbin, control the one you want to rendezvous with the other. Place a maneuver node anywhere on your orbit and draw it up to touch the other ship\u0027s orbit on the other side (that\u0027s actually a Hohmann transfer but we\u0027re not calculating anything here). It should get you some encounter markers. Unless you\u0027re extraordinarily lucky they\u0027ll not match up. Drag the maneuver node around the orbit and see if you can get them to. If so, great. Do that burn and then rendezvous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they\u0027re not (and it\u0027s likely they won\u0027t be) use the \u0022\u002B/-\u0022 buttons on the maneuver node (right click it to toggle between the \u0022normal\u0022 maneuver node and this one) and increase the orbit once or more, until the two markers are close to each other. THEN drag it around (in that same \u002B/- mode. Don\u0027t drag it in the other mode or KSP will \u0022helpfully\u0022 snap it back to the current orbit, not the future orbit) until the two encounter markers match up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo mods that make this MUCH easier are precise node (so you can be 100% sure you\u0027re not going to screw up the future node by dragging it) and Kerbal Alarm Clock (so you can go do something else while waiting multiple orbits before your burn).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI apologize if this fits your definition of \u0022making random nodes.\u0022 It\u0027s really not, though.

Especially for rendezvous, which are more about eyeballing where you are in relation to your target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure what part of rendezvous tutorials \u0022doesn\u0027t work out well\u0022 for you, but it\u0027s not complicated at all. There are just four steps to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) First, you assume an orbit that is similar to that of your target. Either put both periapsis and apoapsis a few kilometers higher, or both a few kilometers lower. Which one you should pick depends on where your target is. If it is in front of you, your AP and PE should be lower; if it is behind you, your AP and PE should be higher. Doing this ensures that the distance between you and your target decreases with every orbit, and you will eventually pass each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bigger the difference in orbit altitude, the faster the distance between you and your target changes. It\u0027s safest to not make the difference too large. Experience will tell you how much is appropriate; until then, start with no more than 10 km difference. Also avoid putting your PE into the atmosphere, for obvious reasons \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Then, you match inclination. If you target your rendezvous partner, the game should display markers called \u0022AN\u0022 and \u0022DN\u0022 to you. Mouse over them to see the difference in inclination. If it\u0027s just something close to 0, you can ignore it, but everything above 0.5\u00B0 you definitely want to adjust. To do this, make a maneuver node on either the AN or DN node, and apply only normal/antinormal dV. You can keep mousing over the AN/DN to see how your inclination difference changes. Try to get it close to 0, and then execute that node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) Finally, with your AP and PE set where you want them to be, and your inclination zeroed out, you timewarp a little bit and watch yourself and the target get closer and closer. You want to wait until you are fairly close to passing by each other, but stop before that actually happens... like, maybe one orbit away from passing. Definitely not less than half an orbit from passing. Now, you make a maneuver node a few minutes in front of your ship. If your orbit is lower, you add prograde dV; if your orbit is higher, you add retrograde dV. You keep doing this until your orbit crosses that of the target. At this point, you see \u0022closest approach\u0022 markers appearing (if they weren\u0027t already there before). Mouse over the markers to see how far apart you are. Then keep adding dV to make that value decrease. Unless adding dV makes it increase, in which case you should remove dV instead. You want a nice close approach, ideally under 0.5 km, but anything under 2 km works, really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that you may get two sets of close approach markers in some situations. In that case, you should check both, but aim to perfect one of them only. Whichever of them is more convenient for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) Execute your maneuver and then timewarp forward until you are at your close approach point. Here, switch your navball to target mode (if it is not already), point at the retrograde marker, and burn until the navball shows 0.0 m/s velocity. You are now stationary relative to your target, which should only be a few hundred meters away. At such a short distance, you can simply point your nose right at it, and give a bit of thrust to approach it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVoila, that\u0027s all you needed to do to rendezvous. You\u0027ll notice that at no point in this process did it ever matter how precisely you set up your Hohmann transfer - which is why asking for calculations here is pretty pointless. As long as you did step 1 and 2 properly, step 3 is 100% guaranteed to work with simply making a node a minute or two ahead of your ship and pulling prograde or retrograde until you magically have a close approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes you can get a better encounter if you drag and drop the node further ahead in the orbit, but since you waited until you were close to passing your target already, only a small dV expenditure a few minutes ahead should get you the encounter you want. You can also try to use the normal/antinormal and radial in/radial out directions to get a closer encounter, but if you did steps 1 and 2 properly it shouldn\u0027t be necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-17T13:03:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2016 01:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T13:26:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222518384\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137152\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460897675\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n29 minutes ago, 5thHorseman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(in that same \u002B/- mode.

So for example Earth\u0027s SMA is 1 AU, and its orbit is 1 year, so the constant is 1 (due to how we chose our units). Mars\u0027 SMA is about 1.5, and its year should therefore be about sqrt(1.5 cubed) and sure enough, it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your ships, then, you have one at say a 100km orbit and one at a 200km orbit (Orbiting at 70km is asking for trouble and I would say any permanent station be at LEAST 80km up and you may as well do it 100 for easier math). Of course, Kerbin\u0027s 600km in radius so your orbits are actually 700km and 800km. Let\u0027s say you\u0027re orbiting 100km and your station is 200km. Let\u0027s also say your 200km station\u0027s orbit is \u00221 time unit\u0022 and its orbit\u0027s radius is \u00221 distance unit\u0022. We can say 1 time unit cubed equals 1 distance unit squared, just like with Earth and years. Further, your lower ship\u0027s orbit is 7/8ths of a distance unit, so its period will be the square root of 7/8 cubed, or about 0.93 of the station\u0027s orbit. Note I\u0027m not using km or seconds or anything, just comparing the two orbits using made up units that are more convenient. This is easier because you can then remove all units and just use ratios.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will eventually be making a burn to turn your 100x100 (Periapsis x Apoapsis, not width x height) orbit into a 100x200 orbit, to go from where you are to where you\u0027re going. Remember that\u0027s actually a 700x800 orbit. The long width of that ellipse is 1500km, so the SMA is 750km. so it\u0027s 750/800ths the space station\u0027s orbit, so sqrt(750/800 cubed) is about 0.968. You\u0027ll eventually be traveling halfway around from your ship to your station, and in that half time you\u0027ll travel 0.484 while it travels 0.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0.5-0.484 is 0.016 orbit units, and an orbit is 360 degrees, so you want to be 360*0.016 = about 5.75 degrees behind the station when you do your burn to Hohmann transfer to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you see why I just make maneuver nodes and drag them around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I hope I didn\u0027t make any mistakes, either in the math or the idea.

We define our units in this way to make the math (which is the hard part) far easier. If you don\u0027t, you deal with the below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour station is in a 675km orbit, and orbits in (I\u0027m guessing here) about 30 minutes. So we know that the square of the period (30 minutes) is the cube of the SMA (675km) with some constant based on our units (Above, I set the units so the constant would be 1 but here, we need to find it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, 30 squared is 900 and 675 cubed is 307546875, so 900*x = 307546875, so our constant here is 341718.75 or let\u0027s say 341000. Or 0.0000029 if you\u0027re going the other way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo your ship orbiting at 100km is actually at 700km from Kerbin\u0027s radius. So we plug that into the square/cubed equation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(SMA cubed = period squared * 341000)\u003Cbr\u003E\n(700\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E = p\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E * 341000)\u003Cbr\u003E\n(343000000 / 341000 = p\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E)\u003Cbr\u003E\n(31.7 minutes = p)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo your station orbits in 30 minutes, your 100km ship orbits in 31.7. To burn it down to the station, your transfer orbit\u0027s SMA will be exactly midway between 75 and 100km so at 87.5km which is 687.5km from Kerbin\u0027s center, so we do the same math:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(SMA cubed = period squared * 341000)\u003Cbr\u003E\n(687.5\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E = p\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E * 341000)\u003Cbr\u003E\n(30.9 minutes = p)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it would take your transferring craft 30.9/2 minutes to get from its 100km orbit down to the 75km orbit of the station (because it\u0027s a half orbit). The station in 15.45 minutes will travel 15.45/30 or 51.5 percent of its orbit, so you\u0027d want to be 1.5 orbit percents ahead of the station when you burn down. 1.5 percent of 360 is 5.4 degrees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I may have said that last part wrong in the original example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote this assumes that a 75km orbit is - indeed - 30 minutes exactly. But if it\u0027s not you can do the math yourself to figure it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote also you can end run around the math by noting, for all 3 orbits (ship, station, and transfer) the time it takes to get from Pe to Ap. Double that is your orbital period in all 3 cases, and for every orbit in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-17T15:36:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2016 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T15:52:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222518384\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137152\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460897675\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, 5thHorseman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(in that same \u002B/- mode.
