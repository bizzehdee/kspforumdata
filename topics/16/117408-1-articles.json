At launch you are incredibly slow. You gain just about nothing. In fact, because you are increasing the distance from the planet faster than when flying a flat trajectory, you are gaining *less* from the Oberth effect when you do finally get around to speeding up to orbital velocity. And speeding up sideways is by far the bigger slice of the cake.\n\nAt the same time, every second that your engines are running in a vertical climb, you are throwing 10 m/s dV out the window. Yes, 10 m/s dV per second, simply lost. That\u0027s the cost of hovering, of maintaining the status quo against the acceleration of gravity. Only the excess you can put out beyond that actually goes into accelerating your rocket. Burn for one minute, and you lost 600 m/s - you\u0027ll have increased the cost of getting into LKO by a whopping 15%. And that\u0027s *before* taking into account the lessened Oberth effect mentioned above.\n\nGravity is the ripped jock at school, and he\u0027s NOT your friend. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Better outrun him fast!\n\nThat said, good gravity turns are hard. Newcomers are always going to start pushing their apoapsis high and coasting, because it\u0027s easier. This is not a bad thing. It means that they have plenty of room to improve, and many new things to discover about the game and about physics.

Using that method, you raise your Pe out of the center of the planet by something just slightly less than 600km (Kerbin\u0027s equatorial radius) while already at 70km. \n\n The Oberth effect says that the closer you are to a gravity well, the more efficient the maneuver will be. So if you raise that Pe BEFORE hitting 70km, it\u0027s still more efficient because you are closer to Kerbin\u0027s center of gravity. In fact the closer you are to the center of the gravity while burning horizontally, the more fuel you save. So you want to turn as soon as possible while allowing that aerodynamics will prevent you from turning right away. On the Mun, on the other hand, there are no aerodynamics, but there is terrain so you want to turn just as soon as you clear the local mountains, don\u0027t wait."},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T19:38:56Z","Content":"I have to admit, I can see his logic in going vertical but a decent g-turn is the best way to go.

Launch your rocket and throttle it to a level that will let you float above the launchpad but not ascend. That\u0027s your wastage.\n\nIf you burn early then switch engines off, rising to the apoapsis - you\u0027ve lost the fuel early on. If you rise to apoapsis and keep the rocket angled not to descend - the vertical component is your wastage. Whatever you do, until you orbit you waste fuel - and in direct relation to two factors:\n\n- time spent until orbit\n\n- differemce between your horizontal and orbital speed (squared, I think).\n\nTherefore in your best interest is to start gaining horizontal speed ASAP - not at apoapsis, not at 10,000m. As soon as that doesn\u0027t mean your rocket flipping over and crashing and burning. Usually that moment is when you\u0027ve gained about 40m/s.\n\nThe earlier you gain orbital speed, the less fuel you have wasted. That\u0027s fuel saved that allows you to lift more, further, in smaller, cheaper rocket.\n\nThe mantra is \u0022Burn early\u0022 - as soon as factors preventing it are gone. The rocket tipping over.
