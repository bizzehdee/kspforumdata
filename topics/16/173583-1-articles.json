Not much of a problem, as usually as plane weighs much less by the time it lands. And some miner slippage also doesn\u0027t make takeoff from the runway impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, in my particular case the plane was expected to take off from Laythe under a full load, and the slippery variant couldn\u0027t go faster than 40-50m/s over even the most gentle fold in the ground.
