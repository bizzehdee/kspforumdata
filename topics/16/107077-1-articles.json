I expect to see some new nuke fuel tanks show up at some point though.\n\nI use the Mk3 tanks myself. 2.5m parts fit them reasonably well. And using the new slanty nose cone for a radial mount works way better, heat-wise, than a box girder or I-beam (as long as KSP continues to ignore the radiant heat from the exhaust flame).\n\n[![16728051564_b3dc48d847_o.jpg](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8799/16728051564_b3dc48d847_o.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/rucCW9)\n\nOf course, to totally solve the silly, unrealistic heat issues with the LV-N, you have to tweak it with a ModuleManager file. Like this:\n\n    // LV-N TWEAKS@PART[nuclearEngine]:FINAL{\t@emissiveConstant = 0.99 // was 0.83, other engines 0.80\t@maxTemp = 4000 // restores old value, up from new stock value of 2500\t@MODULE[ModuleEngines]\t\t@heatProduction = 196 // same as Mainsail, down from stock 432\t}}\n\nAt which point all is well. Both can run their tanks dry without anything going boom (although it\u0027s a near-run thing), and the big one can even do it with 6 engines, not just the 4 shown here. I spent all day working on this stuff ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)."}]}
