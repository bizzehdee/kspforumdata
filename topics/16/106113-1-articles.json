Near as I can tell, the heat generated by the ISRU is burning off your heat shield, which is kinda silly. Apparently heating is getting some tweaks in a coming patch, but until then, don\u0027t put your heat shield right against your ISRU and be sure to add some parts like wings to the parts around it to dissipate heat. Also, an engineer is supposed to reduce overheating, but i\u0027m not sure it would help in this case."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:41:27Z","Content":"Turns out solar panels are pretty weak as heat dissipators, wings work better, but it\u0027s a bit late in this case.\n\nBest to run only one drill or move to a spot with more ore, as extraction will be easier and generate less heat ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:42:20Z","Content":"Both the drills and the converter generate heat, seeing that you have 4 drills and a converter running together at the same time, this generates a LOT of heat.\n\n The ablator is just doing its job: dissipating heat by slowly vanishing to protect your command pod.\n\nThough a shield is quite stupid and does not make the difference between reentry or drilling in terms of heat ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Herr Rictus Bingo","CreatedById":142096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:53:35Z","Content":"Okay !

They insulate the heat, so the rest of the rocket stays cool(er), while the section with the LV-N gets REALLY hot REALLY fast.\n\nTechnically ablation shielding uses evaporation for cooling rather than insulation. That\u0027s why the heat-shields have a resource.\n\nThe shuttle\u0027s reentry tiles were insulation. They took heat in and did not transfer it and were only replaced when damaged or missing at the end of a mission. The Apollo capsule\u0027s heat-shield was ablative and vaporized as it dealt with the heat of reentry. It was only used once and never intended for reuse.\n\nJust sandwhich an ablative shield between an LV-N and it\u0027s fuel source and you can run full-power as long as you have Ablator. I just ran a test and the LV-N will run through ablator at about 0.41 units per second at the launch pad. I wouldn\u0027t recommend it though A) because you have to route a fuel line to the LV-N and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) the heat-shields are heavy and the resource they provide is finite compared to the benefits of using other parts as radiator fins.\n\nI feel like the Devs may want to consider prohibiting the ablator resource from being used when both attach nodes of a heat shield are used. Partially because I don\u0027t think ablator is intended for this use, but also because it could cause people to lose ablator on parts that aren\u0027t necessarily exposed to the air-stream but have the misfortune of being in contact with parts that are getting pretty warm. That feels a bit broken."},{"CreatedByName":"SanderB","CreatedById":83050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:22:25Z","Content":"I don\u0027t thnk its very realistic to make it so ablators dont evaporate on heating up."}]}
