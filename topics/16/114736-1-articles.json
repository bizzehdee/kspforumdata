Has anyone built any seaplanes in the new patch yet, either in Stock or with mods?\n\nFirespitter has seaplane floats what work wonderfully. I used to use them on all my Laythe planes. They float well (if you raise their buoyancy setting), they have rudders that work in the water, and they have retractable, powered wheels so your plane can taxi up onto the beach. Problem is, nowadays they make huge amounts of drag so it\u0027s a pain getting a seaplane SSTO off Kerbin without compromising on its design somehow (like way more power than you\u0027d really like for its size). But OTOH, you can ModuleManager the drag to some extent.\n\nIntakes aren\u0027t as good in 1.x as they were before, either. You need rather more of them than you used to, which gets into ridiculous part counts. And the radial intakes now also have beaucoup drag regardless of which way they\u0027re facing, so that kills you as well. The Firespitter floats are far superior in all respects."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T09:11:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you\u0027re willing to go the mod route check out Better Buoyancy - Makes contact with the water less deadly\n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105094](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105094)\n\nI\u0027ve tried it out and it did work better, but not quite enough.

My only exposure to Firespitter so far has been the USI Exploration ducted fans, so I didn\u0027t realise that they had what I wanted. If the drag\u0027s too bad, I might have a go at having them retract into nacelles and see if that changes anything. Or I might just remake the Jart and make the seaplane a parasite fighter that goes to orbit in a cargo container."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T12:34:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Okay, thanks.

Or I might just remake the Jart and make the seaplane a parasite fighter that goes to orbit in a cargo container.\n\nThe USI stuff only uses the Firespitter.dll AFAIK. To get the actual pontoon parts, you need to get the whole Firespitter mod. This is a big mod and you probably won\u0027t want much in it. I tend to cull parts out of it until it\u0027s just the pontoons, the electric propeller engines, and a few other things.\n\nHere\u0027s how the pontoons look and attach (this is a prototype boat for the Elcano challenge, not a plane, but the pontoons are the same):\n\n[![17802793309_8980e813ca_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8802/17802793309_8980e813ca_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/t8aYde)\n\nThere are 5 types of pontoon parts. Front end, back end (includes rudder), wheel bay, center section, and strut. You start with the strut part, which is a thin slice of pontoon cross-section with a vertical attachment leg. Stick this on the underside of the main vehicle. Then you build the pontoons forwards and backwards from the strut adding whichever of the other parts you need. Then brace the whole thing off with normal struts.\n\nEach pontoon part has a tweakable menu with a slider to adjust buoyancy. The default setting is 50%. Always slide this to 100% for all parts in the pontoon. The wheels can also be tweaked to steer and drive as needed.\n\nSo the parts themselves are pretty much inescapably bulky and not amenable to retracting due to the need for struts (they\u0027re kinda wobbly without struts). HOWEVER, thanks to ModuleManager, there\u0027s a way to work around this by NOT actually using the Firespitter pontoon parts. The pontoon parts get their properties from a module called FSbuoyancy. Using ModuleManager, you can add this module to any other parts you desire, making those parts float just as well as the pontoons. You can also had FSrudder, so you can steer in the water, FSwheel to stock aircraft wheels to give them rover power and steering, etc.\n\nIn fact, you can do this already if you have the Firespitter.dll in your game (this is an extremely useful dll, which is why so many other mods use it). You don\u0027t really need to download the whole mod. But I recommend that you do so you can look at the provided parts and learn how the various modules work."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T13:00:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Problem is, nowadays they make huge amounts of drag so it\u0027s a pain getting a seaplane SSTO off Kerbin without compromising on its design somehow (like way more power than you\u0027d really like for its size).
