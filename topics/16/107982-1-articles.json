(grinding to do a mun landing). I put the rocket out on the pad, enable SAS and go to map view to warp to a better launch plane. Upon returning to the pad, SAS is still on but the space bar won\u0027t work, and I can\u0027t launch the rocket. Is this a bug? Anyone else run into this? What is up?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T00:03:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 12:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Trenchfoot**"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T23:38:11Z","Content":"If you time-warped and you did not have your rocket connected with the red stands than most likely you\u0027ve run out of electricity."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T23:52:43Z","Content":"Are you sure you didn\u0027t simply forgot to stop time-warp ? ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T23:59:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 11:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaarst**"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T23:54:45Z","Content":"Maybe it ist this sticky launchpad bug?
