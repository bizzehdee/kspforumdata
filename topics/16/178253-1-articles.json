Well, im not the BEST ksp player, but i\u0027m not the worst.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy problem is, I ran out of science. So i need to go to duna or eve, preferably duna. So, I\u0027m assembling a ship in space to take me there and back. But, I have ran into two problems.\u003Cbr\u003E\nProblem 1: MY CRAFT WOBBLES LIKE CRAZY. I have heard this can be caused by you pushing weight instead of pulling it (or something like that), but i don\u0027t know of a way I can \u0022pull\u0022 my weight into space.\u003Cbr\u003E\nProblem 2: I can\u0027t actually get the engines for my craft into orbit. I was planning to have multiple stages in the craft, \u0022boosters\u0022 or engines to get me away from kerbin and into orbit of duna, detatch that and have a lander go down to the surface and back, then ditch lander and activate \u0022engines\u0022 which get me back to orbit of kerbin, detatch my two \u0022science\u0022 probes (just probes with 1\u00A0science container each\u00A0to easily get them back to surface), then detatch cockpit and de-orbit that. I can get EVERYTHING into orbit, except the boosters and fuel. I just CAN NOT figure out how to move\u00A0the engines\u00A0(see picture), let alone the boosters\u00A0into orbit. I can get it to space, but at that point I loose enough rocket power to actually get it into orbit, and I can\u0027t go into space at an angle b/c of super crazy jiggling wobbling. Now, i COULD use the engines attatched to help get into orbit. Great! But now how do I re-fuel it, because I can\u0027t launch fuel into orbit. B/c i can\u0027t lift that much weight for some reason. And also super wobbling for any tall craft. the yaw and pitch literally just go up and down non stop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/%5Bimg%5Dhttps://i.imgur.com/AMCY2t3.png%5B/img%5D\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AMCY2t3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AMCY2t3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022P3iII9W.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/P3iII9W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229q9r9Kp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9q9r9Kp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease help.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E, I think your main wobbling problem is resonance coupled with relatively strong and vastly separated control parts. As soon as a wobble starts the engines are constantly aiming to fix the direction the control point is facing and not the direction the rocket is going, which tends to make the wobble worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many ways to fix it but I\u0027d start with lowering the gimbaling of the rockets. You could also experiment placing a probe core down there with them and controlling from that, so the engines are always burning based on their own orientation and not the orientation of the upper stage. Of course, then those powerful reaction wheels could end up causing a similar problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-16T22:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223449761\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178253\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221536725905\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022191777\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Heroshrine\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/11/2018 at 9:18 PM, Heroshrine said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is only a guess, but im guessing its good to keep reaction wheels as even as possible with the central mass.
