One of my mainsails in the stage is chowing through fuel faster than the other. The whole thing is perfectly symmetrical. Also I find when I cut the throttle one of the inner engines keeps burning, sending me into a uncontrolled spin. So... I have no idea whats going on. any help would be wonderful\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-08T21:07:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2013 09:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cmmndrme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T02:04:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck your flight log (F3). What\u0027s probably happening is that part of your rocket is breaking off.

The broken off rockets even continue to provide the vehicle with thrust as they push up on some other part, and it will seem like everything is still OK - for a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in actual fact, Your \u0022not-going-to-space-today-ness\u0022 has already been determined: Since the broken off pieces are no longer connected you can no longer control the throttle of the engine, and there will no longer be any fuel crossfeed from the broken-off piece. This means fuel will be used unevenly, and your rocket will eventually spin out of control due to mass and thrust imbalance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-08T02:07:17Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2013 02:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cmmndrme","CreatedById":82685,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T05:14:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much, now how do change the prefix?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-08T05:21:58Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2013 05:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cmmndrme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T06:54:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think if you edit your orignal post and then switch to the advanced editor you can change the title, but I could be wrong...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
