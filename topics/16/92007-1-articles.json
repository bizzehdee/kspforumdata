Lined one side up with your existing commsat, figured out if the new one was slightly ahead or slightly behind, then lowered (or raised) its orbit every so slightly. A few minutes difference in orbital period is fine. Then I timewarp a bit until it is positioned precisely enough for my tastes. Then adjust orbital period to 06:00:00.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERinse and repeat with the remaining two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResult: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44754370/screenshot39.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewho needs math anyway?\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T17:26:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy low-orbit mesh (@ 700km altitude) plus the two at KEO (around 2869km altitude) ends up looking like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xpfnjSEHOtg/VIM7T51C3yI/AAAAAAAABAE/GyaD0GddYqs/w846-h476-no/KSP%2B2014-12-06%2B11-52-40-60.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%2B2014-12-06%2B11-52-40-60.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KEO sats are just ahead/behind of KSC.
