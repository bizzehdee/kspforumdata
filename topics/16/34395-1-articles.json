I have a rockomax hub linked to a modular girder adapter which is then linked to a TR-2V stack decoupler. That is linked to 55 or so octagonal struts. I\u0027ve tried with and without 8 heavy strut connectors as well as the decoupler and variations thereof. Any help would be appreciated. I can\u0027t seem to get this thing to stop bouncing uncontrollably and self destructing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oaSpEj3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oaSpEj3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GYmSJbU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GYmSJbU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3_bit","CreatedById":52836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T06:53:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust... don\u0027t use all tiny struts.

Use the longer trusses, and brace them with overlapping struts. That helps some, but it still wouldn\u0027t be rigid enough to fly up to orbit. However, it\u0027s possible to make pyramid-shaped towers that are very nice and rigid. The I-beams look good for this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bolide","CreatedById":71993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T07:37:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI intend on mounting the actual rockets around it and using them to help support the torque on the arm.
