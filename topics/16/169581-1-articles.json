And that reason is to provide lift to make you go up. If you crank your nose up to some high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, then you might as well be flying a rocket and not a plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Jet engines burn a heck of a lot of fuel to go fast at low altitudes (compared to other jet engines at other speeds and altitudes -- rockets are another story).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Drag gets nasty once you go over 240 m/s or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, as far as I\u0027m concerned, it\u0027s mostly a question of \u0022how high is good enough for going supersonic in this plane?\u0022 So once I get off the ground, I adjust my throttle for slow acceleration, and my nose for a 10 m/s climb rate. I take the first part of the climb through the thick air slowly. Once I get to about 5km, my\u00A0planes are usually\u00A0getting close to going supersonic -- and it\u0027s best to break through that sonic wall quickly. So I go to full throttle then. By 5km altitude, drag is down by quite a bit, and it drops quickly above that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome planes have a much harder time going supersonic, as said above, and you have to do it low when you have megatons of thrust -- even if it costs a lot of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-15T07:47:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery plane is different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor rocket-powered planes, point it up at 45 degrees as soon as you\u0027re able, then when you hit 500 m/s (should be a bit over 10 km), follow prograde.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor RAPIER-powered ones, it all depends on the aerodynamics, the size, and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know lots of people are recommending an acceleration phase at a shallow climb once over 10k but I have only rarely found that to work well.

This does apply to SSTOs earlier in the career. But later on? Yeah I\u0027ll happily build an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E that can loft 200 tons if my payload weighs in at 130, or use my 70-ton lifter for a 20-ton load.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----\u0026gt; another tangent\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInspired by this thread, I tried again experimenting with launch profiles. Specifically, I attempted a launch with my heavy lifter (design capability over 200 tons, actual payload mass about 150) where I did the shallow acceleration run from 10k up. Guess what? It didn\u0027t work. I did manage to keep my jets burning longer and hit 1500 m/s without any bits falling off, but I was climbing much too slowly. When it was time to switch to closed-cycle, I had to point my craft up and ended up burning more rocket fuel lifting my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E than with my usual launch profile for this craft, which is a constant 17 degrees pitch once it reaches 5k@400 m/s, then prograde from 25k altitude up. That way my jets flamed out at \u0022only\u0022 about 1300 m/s but I had a high-enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E that I had no trouble making orbit and ended up burning a great deal less fuel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOTOH when I tried it with a smaller \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E it did work as described: it was a bit cheaper to climb subsonically to 10k, then level out to 5 degrees to accelerate, then nose up and be on my way. So it really does depend on the specifics of the craft and the launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-17T13:21:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBrikoleur,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0In my experience, 10km is really too high.
