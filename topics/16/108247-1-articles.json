Im curious, shouldn\u0027t it have gone down?? \n\nI just am having trouble understanding how the mechanic works is all.. any help would be appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T18:14:03Z","Content":"In stock 1.0.2, re-entry heat is massively underpowered (see [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118785) for testing), but for future reference (or if you want to use the [reentry heat rebalance](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119308) mod) airbrakes work pretty well for spaceplanes and rockets without heatshields ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). If you want, there\u0027s an option in the debug menu (alt/mod \u002B F12 by default) to add detailed information about the heating (under physics -\u003E thermal). It\u0027s useful for figuring out why things are overheating (or not in this case)."}]}
