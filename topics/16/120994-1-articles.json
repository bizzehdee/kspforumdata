Any time prograde undergoes unexpected changes, such as when you leave the ground however briefly, the rover will of course attempt to follow that prograde change, which can be disastrous when what you really want is to just hold level and land on all wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStability assist gives good results on a lot of rover configurations. It tends to be surprisingly not-terrible at keeping wheels in contact with the ground and doesn\u0027t try to override your inputs. With rover wheels it seems to function almost like an ESC, if you drive along a slope it seems to adjust wheel speeds to \u0022pull\u0022 you into the direction of best contact with the ground (i.e. the direction least likely to make you flip) if you let it; this can easily be overridden if you feel like you\u0027re going too far off course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that if you introduce real thrusters, or control surfaces in an atmosphere, you\u0027ll face input from those too, so rovers built with those systems will need them adjusted properly (note: control surfaces can be excellent for stability in atmospheres!).

When SAS is activated, the qewasd keys (in staging mode) basically have two effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. While you\u0027re pressing them SAS does basically nothing - you\u0027re inputting maximum steering input in at least one direction, and the SAS more or less disables itself so you won\u0027t have to fight it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When you release the key, SAS immediately tries to lock you to that attitude, and correctively steers to return you to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, SAS also self-adjusts to the mode in \u00271\u0027 if it\u0027s taking a beating from external things. I guess this is to avoid create feedback oscillations caused by a little bump making a big counter-steer moment. Hence why, if you\u0027re turning quickly, releasing a key won\u0027t instantly lock you to that fixed direction. (Most noticeably, in flight tapping an input key resets all the current SAS steering to zero, and then the SAS settles on a slightly different attitude once it\u0027s nulled out any natural drift.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I do is set up my rover keys to something else, like a joystick input or the numberpad let\u0027s say. When doing this, if it\u0027s active, the SAS will now try to resist changes to direction or attitude, whether it\u0027s input by you or by the surface topography, because you\u0027re not forcing it into \u0027mode 1\u0027 with your steering input anymore, you\u0027re just turning the wheels (this might not be the case anymore).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mention the above because how you control the rover affects how the SAS will respond. Using qewasd in stage mode will have a very different effect to using the same in docking mode or using a completely separate control input. Not only that, but in the absence of that affect (from those keys in stage mode), SAS will attempt to stay \u003Cem\u003Elocked to a fixed direction and attitude\u003C/em\u003E. In other words, if you have enough torque wheels and enough power, and you drive along a perfect sphere, by the time you get 1/4 of the way around, the SAS will have lifted the front wheels up from the surface to be perpendicular to it - you\u0027ll be standing on the back end of the rover. Imperfections in the surface may cause this to reset, as when pressing a qewasd key (discussed above), which is just as well, but over short, smooth distances, the SAS will continue to attempt to maintain it\u0027s attitude and direction. In other words, yes, it will try to stop the vehicle from returning to level after a hill climb, or it will hold the rover up on two or even one wheel if you drive along a slope and then reach flat ground. The SAS will only reorient it\u0027s \u0027locked\u0027 attitude if:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. you disable and reactivate it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. you press qewasd in staging mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. your rover hits a bump at speed, forcing the SAS to re-evaluate it\u0027s orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that\u0027s clear.
