Once they\u0027re up there, I\u0027d fine-tune their orbits so they\u0027re roughly at the desired positions relative to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most efficient method would probably be a test flight so you know how long it takes for your satellite to reach its orbit. Using this and the period of its orbit, you could find the right time to launch the others. The only problem is that you need almost perfectly identical launches for this to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"olex","CreatedById":32731,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-11T16:54:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would go the blunt way. Use MechJeb to have each launch trajectory and time as similar as possible. Launch the first satellite, note how long exactly the launch takes from takeoff to circularization end. Wait the same time in orbit and measure how far along the orbit the first satellite progresses (or calculate the progression, should be easy knowing the altitude, velocity and time; or just take the degrees from the MechJeb launch autopilot window after an automatic launch). Launch the second satellite when the first one is \u003Cem\u003E72\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u002Bmeasured angle\u003C/em\u003E away from KSC (with KSC being prograde from it), do the same for the rest.
