But I really don\u0027t see an important use in space stations, I mean refueling rockets and space planes are useful but I just think it takes too much fuel to even reach the station. Why not just start your mission instead? Or maybe storing crew.....

One launch of a set of 3-7 orange tanks should be good enough for a whole bunch of interplanetary missions. For this to be fully effective, you can build your interplanetary ships accordingly. For example, build a ship with 6 tanks around it. Attach 3 nuclear engines and 3 more powerful engines on decouplers. Use all that fuel to get into orbit, then ditch the powerful engines and refill all that fuel capacity from your station. Now you have tonnes of fuel to be used by the massively more efficient engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T15:32:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use my space station to construct interplanetary ships from parts delivered separately by an universal lifter. Each space station has a habitat for the future ship crew, it has one orange tank and some RCS tanks as a minimum reserve in case the lifter needs to use some of its cargo fuel, and some free docking ports. Then the engine unit, required number of fuel units, and a lander unit are attached to it, the crew transfers to the lander and off we go to anywhere in the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T15:42:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt takes 4500m/s deltaV to get into orbit around Kerbin.
