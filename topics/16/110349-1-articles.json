Now there is a derelict MPL left in space. I happen to need to launch a MPL, so I am hoping I can salvage this one. Unfortunately, I don\u0027t see any docking ports on it. Not sure how the astronaut even got out of the thing when I rescued here. I had to click on her image and then EVA to get her out. Does the lack of doors (ports) on it mean it is simply floating trash?\n\nOh, and question 2:\n\nI see a contract to put an outpost on the Mun. Is it wise to use a MPL for that? Or do they need to stay in orbit for best efficiency?"},{"CreatedByName":"Acet","CreatedById":123646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T08:54:53Z","Content":"If you grapple it with the Claw it becomes part of your ship - as long as it is in the grasp of the Claw it will get energy from the rest of the ship and you can use the menus on it just like for any other bit of the ship.\n\nIn fact, once you unlock the Claw you start getting missions where you are supposed to recover both the kerbonaut and his/her derelict, and it\u0027s perfectly viable to leave the kerbonaut in the derelict and control from there."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T08:56:55Z","Content":"It\u0027s just junk in the stock game, if it\u0027s just the lab part on its own (which it will be).
