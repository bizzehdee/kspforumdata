I am trying to land, have actually landed 2 times but had crashed trying to stop the thing. But where can I see when im slowed down while decending to where im not orbiting at all. I usually seem to be going a little bit too fast sideways and crash because of it. It also seems like the landing gears do not reach to the bottom below the wheels, which also makes it slightly hard to land it/keep it from moving once landed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8feQjRh.png\u0022 alt=\u00228feQjRh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs seen here, right before my crash \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_sleep.png\u0022 alt=\u0022-_-\u0022\u003E lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cyagrdner","CreatedById":71544,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T00:39:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would try to land a lot slower(less than 1 m/s ideally) and make sure you are pointing at the retro grade marker.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dreadwave21","CreatedById":73680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T00:51:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should slow down A LOT.

Ok so.....apparently this thing is decked out with tools and such. Where do I see the stats for all that? Or is it just for show?
