I\u0027ll be removing the nosecones (until they fix them so they\u0027re anything other than extra weight/drag) but hopefully with a bit of modification I can stick enough power on the top stage to get me to Duna (and if not, I have a refueling station up now anyway)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T08:06:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I know nosecones are useless for now, but they look a lot better and they usually change below 10m/s of delta V and if it\u0027s significant and you really need it, you might want to change your thing because it\u0027s tight on fuel \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for the tipping problem, the best you can do to prevent it is to have a large wheel base and a low CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for the boosters, I rarely ever use SRBs. They\u0027re not often suited for large payloads. They would\u0027ve been useful here if I would\u0027ve needed an extra 200m/s, because other pair of orange tanks with mainsails would be overshooting. And your best bet while designing heavy launchers is to keep it simple and keep what you have above as light as you can. When working with stock parts, double orange tanks with the small 2.5m tank at the bottom to prevent the mainsails from overheating is the way to go. You asparagus stage them up to three pairs. Then if that isn\u0027t enough, you go for smarter designs: you change the mainsails for engine clusters, you add a bit more fuel depending on your TWR, you create a third upper stage for the high atmosphere, etc. If you want to aim for Duna, I recommend changing the tug to make it work on nuclear engines, you\u0027ll get a much greater reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, give me a shout if you need any more help! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripod27","CreatedById":68324,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T19:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENukes on the tug would be good actually, most of the slowing would be done by a few parachutes I\u0027ll probably stick somewhere on the thing anyway\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help, man!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T19:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWatch out though, if you want to land on Duna, parachutes only won\u0027t be enough to slow you down, you\u0027ll have to do a half powered landing because here atmosphere is rarely thick enough to solely use parachutes!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
