As you add more mass to the vehicle, the amount of delta-v available will be lower. Higher thrust engines will give you a better thrust-to-weight ratio (TWR) but will suffer from a lower ISP. So you have to play a balancing act between a useful TWR and the amount of delta-v you need for your mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no doubts that someone who is much more adept with math will come in here and post to relevant equations for you, if you so desire.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T19:36:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore \u0022simply put\u0022 here from me, but I\u0027m a simple guy so that\u0027s what you get \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a huge rocket with a lot of fuel, and a tiny rocket with less fuel, and you start them out floating in space together, burn their engines at full until they run out of fuel, and they are both now going 10,000 m/s, they both have a delta-v of 10,000 m/s. It doesn\u0027t matter what the ship is like, just how fast it can go with all of its fuel. Both of those ships could launch from the pad and orbit Kirbin. Actually I think they could escape it but I don\u0027t pay that much attention to the numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets tricky when you\u0027re fighting gravity (and atmosphere) because those take delta v but you\u0027re not actually gaining velocity. That\u0027s why not every rocket can get into orbit even if they have the same delta-v. If you\u0027re too slow off the launchpad, you\u0027re going to spend more time near the surface which saps delta-v. If you speed up too fast, though, you\u0027ll start to slow down in the thick atmosphere, which saps delta-v. I honestly don\u0027t know the details, just try to design my rockets to hit 10,000m at 200m/s and hope I\u0027m doing it right!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T19:59:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDelta-V is, as Rhomphaia mentioned, change in velocity.

Dv can be seen as the \u0022range\u0022 your rocket has. The more dv you have, the farther you can go. Zero dv means you will not be completing any maneuvers what so ever. Also, take into accout that it is the TOTAL change in velocity. For example, to go from 0m/s to 1000m/s (negleting outside influences such as drag,) you would need 1000 m/s dv. But to go from 0 m/s to 1000 m/s back to 0 m/s, you would need 2000 m/s dv. That is because you need 1000 m/s to accelerate to 1000m/s and another 1000 m/s to decelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T21:32:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDelta V is change in velocity (m/s), just like Delta T is change in time and Delta L is change in length and so on.

Knowing Delta V can help you determine what bodies in the Kerbol system you can reach. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just used the Delta V equation to determine if an engine with less mass and a lower Isp had more Delta V than a motor with more mass and a higher Isp.
