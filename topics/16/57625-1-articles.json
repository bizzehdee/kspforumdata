I take off with 2/3 of the intakes closed, and open them up incrementally as FAR tells me my air usage is about to go under 100%, then as air starts running out, I shut off the outer ring of turbo fans, inner ring, then start throttling back the RAPIERs (maintaining acceleration the whole time), jetison the boosters when the fuel runs dry (happens soon after shutting down the inner turbojets), and when I\u0027m just out of air, toggle to closed cycle, close intakes, go full burn to 100km apoapsis.
