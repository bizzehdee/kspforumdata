I attach one port to the bulkhead, then attempt to attach the other face-to-face with the first. For some reason as I get the 2nd port close to the first, it spins around and tries to attach backwards (and overlaps the first). If I first place it in the air, then manually rotate it 180*, I can get it to go face-to-face with the first port, but it overlaps (just like in the pic above). No matter how hard I try, I cannot get it to back-up and snap into place with the first port. Very frustrating (especially considering that I was all the way into orbit before I realized the port wouldn\u0027t undock).
