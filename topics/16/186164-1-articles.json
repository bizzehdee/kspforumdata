The steps are to, with a single vessel, fly past the Mun, fly past minmus, fly past Eve and lastly land on Duna. I have completed the first three steps but every time I am en route from Eve to Duna at some point Kerbal marks the first three steps as incomplete. Or at least the little green completion ticks disappear from those steps in the contract list. Anyone else noticed something similar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-08T00:01:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you docking to a fuel tanker and refueling?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jnbspace","CreatedById":195299,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-08T08:24:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAppears to be a purely cosmetic thing.
