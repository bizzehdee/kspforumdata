Start thinking about an abort when you get to 90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I know that the smallest tank in the demo is the FL-T400, so I\u0027ll forgo my usual advice of \u0022use four tanks to shorten and widen the stack\u0022, because I know you\u0027re already doing the best you can with what you got. That said, three FL-T400s set radially outboard, with fuel lines going \u003Cstrong\u003Efrom the outboard tanks to the center\u003C/strong\u003E and your lander legs attached to those outboard tanks will improve the lander\u0027s stability.

Use it to gauge the altitude of the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting from a 14k orbit, give yourself a quick puff on the thrusters to bring your periapsis to about 5,000 over your target zone. When you almost get to periapsis, do a hard burn retrograde (make sure your speed gauge is set to \u0022Surface\u0022 first) to bring that retrograde marker to vertically up (i.e. you want to kill your horizontal velocity as much as possible). Then kill your burn and go IVA, and watch the radar altimeter. When it starts to twitch downward and gets to an easy mark (say 2,000 or so), switch back to staging view and compare it to the altimeter; you know the surface is 2,000 meters below (so if the altimeter says 4800 when you switch back, you know the surface is at 2800). The rule for the Phallus 7 is that you don\u0027t want to be going much faster than 1 m/s per 10 m above the surface if you want to avoid lithobraking. Wait until you\u0027re about to that point of no return, then burn; don\u0027t burn the whole time, or you\u0027ll waste fuel. Watch your fuel level as you descend; I\u0027ve already told you what to do if it gets to bingo fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do happen to add those extra tanks like I mentioned, start burning sooner. Your lander should have enough fuel to get you back to Kerbin without problems but your craft will also decelerate slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-12T02:51:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2013 02:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwilhite","CreatedById":90637,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T03:04:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Commissioner Tadpole\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Commissioner Tadpole\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bad news is, I don\u0027t have fuel to go back.
