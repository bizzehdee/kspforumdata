Other than that, nice simple flight profile: turn on SAS on reaching the runway, Caps Lock to activate \u0022fine\u0022 control, throttle to maximum, Space to start rolling. Rotate (pull up) around 90m/s, retract gear, 45-degree climb to about 15 km altitude, level more-or-less out and accelerate. Should hit about 25 km altitude by 1500 m/s speed before it switches to rockets, at which point pull up to 45 degrees and switch to map view to watch your apoapsis. Cut throttle once apoapsis reaches 75 km, then perform a circularization burn; that should leave you (depending on how much of your speed you were able to gain from jet mode versus rocket) with about 5% fuel remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above spaceplane only masses about eight tons on the runway. To be honest, that\u0027s about all one Rapier can be expected to lift. A one-turbojet/two-Rockomax-48-7S combination can probably lift more like ten or twelve tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVeering to either side on the runway probably has to do with your landing gear - make sure it\u0027s precisely vertical; also, use your SAS and let it keep you straight. Spinning out probably has more to do with overcontrolling; Caps Lock for \u0022fine\u0022 control, and don\u0027t try to turn your nose far from your direction of flight. Being able to rotate depends on the plane being able to lift the nose, as opposed to pushing the tail down; building your plane canard-style (tail-first, instead of the conventional tail-rear) does wonders for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-17T08:01:37Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2014 08:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DeMatt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E...got the tonnages way off.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverchain","CreatedById":83000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T09:06:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy heavy (~16-17 tons on the runway) spaceplane/rovers have \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E enough in the tank to get to the Mun\u0027s surface and back with careful fuel management.
