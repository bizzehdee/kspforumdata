The QBE, the OCTO-2, and the circular 1m one. These are light weight, and for their weight offer the most features. QBE has basic SAS (which is more or less essential for most of my SSTOs that dont have on-center thrust), so its a rather neat probe, and happens to be super lightweight. The next one that i find viable is teh OCTO-2, its actually smaller then teh QBE, so if fitting something somewhere is important, it is a better choice. It also has a few more features that may or may not be useful, so if there is a reason for these (prograde, normal, radial), its alot better choice. The final one is the circular 1m probe core. It has full features, so obviously if you have a use for the stuff like aim at a target (epic in combat, even if it feels very cheap), or the aim directly at your maneuver node (useful for newer player, but myself i havent found this to be useful as im plenty experienced with orbital maneuvering). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the sputnik, its more or less a joke at least for me. It has no stability at all, isnt the best shape for building stuff (the other probe cores like the QBE/OCTO are easier to build with in my opinion), and is just kinda pointless as its HEAVIER then two way superior cores in terms of features. Anyways, for career it isnt useless, but its still kinda useless, as by the time you even start to use any satelites, you will already unlock the QBE ect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T05:27:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022worir4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022worir4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAwww.
