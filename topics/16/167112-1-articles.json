A direct dive to the surface (especially from a high altitude), usually means disaster. If you look at the thread a little lower on this page \u0022questions about Eve\u0022, you might find some helpful info. If this is a manned mission, it\u0027s going to take a lot of planning and testing. The inflatable heatshield is great but, if it\u0027s a large ship, you\u0027ll need something up high for drag (to keep you from flipping and burning up). You\u0027ll also need a way to dump the shield (if you have Kerbals; a probe can simply land on it), because they\u0027re tough to get rid of on Eve if you play stock.
