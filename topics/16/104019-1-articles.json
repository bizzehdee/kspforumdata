What would you say would be a typical mass range for each category?\n\nSecond, how would I go about designing the ideal rocket for each class? (TWR\u0027s are around 1.5 to 2.5)\n\nThird, I am also planning to have a family of upper stages for interplanetary use, also corresponding to the mass classification system outlined above. I need help designing this as well. Each upper stage has a delta-V of about 3 km/s and an acceleration of 1.5g.\n\nThanks!

I\u0027d also argue that for upper stages, 1.5 g is nice to have but far from necessary once you\u0027re in orbit.

Heavy is anything above 100 tons.\n\nAs for the OP, as others said, 1.0 should change parts and the way they react to the atmosphere, so it\u0027s likely to change.\n\nMy interplanetary transfer stages are typically an orange jumbo tank with four nuclear engines (or the MRS quad nuke at the bottom) radially mounted using girders. That, coupled with assorted docking ports, and everything needed to the ship to act on its own (probe cores, power, rcs)\n\nAt this point, I usually keep that as a subassembly and I also keep about three lifters as subassemblies. This way, I just design the payload, check it\u0027s weight and decide which is the preset I\u0027ll use to put it wherever I want to.\n\nMy medium to heavy lifters use the 3.5 meters parts, with a KR-L2 or the quad engine at the center (depending on whether the KR-L2 thrust can handle the load) with the double engine which is also a fuel tank around it in an asparagus configuration - the problem with those is placing SRBs below. Typically, that\u0027s a girder holding a structural fuselage and the rockets go below it, but that\u0027s rather wobbly. I could change the outer rockets to Mainsails, so I just place the S1 rockets below."}]}
