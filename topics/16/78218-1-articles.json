Been playing for a few days with the old career mode and now started with the new career with funds in 0.24. I took the contract to rescue the stranded Kerbal in orbit and messed it up badly (didn\u0027t have a clue about orbital rendezvous until I was already up there and realized I don\u0027t actually know how to meet up with the poor Kerbal, haha) Anyway, so I wanted to revert flight and start again, but it\u0027s greyed out. How come? What can cause a flight to become non revertable? I didn\u0027t really do anything different than on my other flights where I can always revert, except that I went back to the space center and opened the tracking window and then took back control of my flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-18T14:39:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2014 02:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by guitarxe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T14:24:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022guitarxe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022guitarxe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...
