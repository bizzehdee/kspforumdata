But KSP is a game which, at present, says to the user: \u0022Here is a heap of rocket bits. There\u0027s the Mun. Have at it.\u0022 It does not say \u0022Here is a heap of rocket bits. Now go away and study orbital calculations, and don\u0027t come back until you can calculate delta-v for a stage with your head in a bowl of soup.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn what I should point out is my very humble opinion, the fun to be had in KSP lies in all those \u0027hours doing everything wrong\u0027 that you mention. Those aren\u0027t wasted hours. That\u0027s experimentation, trial and error, \u0022I wonder if this will work with an SRB attached to-oh. Oh dear.\u0022 It\u0027s hilarious malfunctions and thoroughly deserved fiery deaths. Sure, you could download KSP, install it and then spend a week or two watching tutorials on Hohmann transfers and Munar landing. Then you could load up the game and do everything right first time. But then what? Do it again? The first time I attained a stable orbit I felt a grand sense of achievement (funny how silly little games, the playing of which is pretty much the opposite of achieving anything, can do that). I didn\u0027t feel like that because I had utilized any math - I hadn\u0027t. I had just thrown together a bunch of rocket parts, the design informed only by the failures of those that had gone before it. It took me ages, but by trying something, seeing how it failed, and adjusting the design, it was done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes a knowledge of the proper methods and calculations involved in orbital movement make the game easier? I should imagine so. Do I have a problem with using that sort of knowledge? Heavens, no. I only wish I was smart enough to know all of that stuff. But you don\u0027t need it and you certainly shouldn\u0027t bypass the \u0027let\u0027s see what happens if I...\u0027 stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh - I\u0027m sorry for the rant, and for the lack of adherence to the topic. Just something I felt the need to respond to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarry on!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
