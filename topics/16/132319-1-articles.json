I do use FAR, but I don\u0027t use B9 since I want to get familiar with the stock parts first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a picture of my most successful craft:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Or0SB0w\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/Or0SB0w\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven after hours of watching tutorials, I can\u0027t make it go higher than about 15 km or faster than about 350 m/s. I\u0027d like to get it up to 18 km to collect high altitude science. Speed is secondary, but I\u0027m also confused why it won\u0027t go faster. The thrust starts dropping off the higher I go, which makes sense and all, but I\u0027ve seen plenty of planes go higher and faster on just two engines like these. I thought it might be lack of intake air, but adding air intakes seems to do nothing. I have no stability problems as far as I can tell, and the FAR graph seems to suggest I could go higher, but I think my lack of speed is killing me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way to access the thrust v. altitude data for each engine? Additionally, what suggestions do you have for me? More engines? More wing? More intakes? Different shape? I don\u0027t really know where to go from here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-17T08:36:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2016 08:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Wovejulio\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T11:55:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat engines are you using? The Panther or the Wheesley? It\u0027s not immediately apparent from the screenshot. The Wheesley will not go any faster than you\u0027re getting it, period. For the Panther, you\u0027ll want to switch on the afterburners to get the thrust you need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is apparent however is that you\u0027re using way too many intakes. One engine should rarely need more than one intake, and every one you add increases your plane\u0027s drag for little to no benefit, making it slower. In particular, get rid of the highly draggy, poorly performing structural intakes. Yes, all four of them, and any others that I can\u0027t see as well. In fact, since you have those large ramp intakes available to you, stick with the pair of them you have, and get rid of the mk1 divertless intake pods as well - just add regular fuel tanks in there if you need the fuel. Structural fuselages if you don\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, you\u0027ll want to pay attention to the area ruling. That\u0027s something that FAR models but KSP doesn\u0027t. If your area ruling is bad, you get massive wave drag in the transsonic regime and literally \u0022get stuck in the sound barrier\u0022. Since your top speed is right around mach 1, that is a strong indicator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-17T12:29:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2016 12:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T13:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrag is the number one speed limiting factor here. Get rid of anything that you don\u0027t need. The strucktural intakes are crap, so are the inline ones. One of these ram intakes per engine is fine. Shock cones are even better, because they produce less drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso consider the behaviour of the engines. Jet engines vary their thrust with velocity. That means if you climb to early or too steep, you will never gain enough speed and thus your engines will never reach their optimal\u00A0performance. Each engine has a speed where thrust peaks. I thing you can see that in the part menu when you right click the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, engines lose thrust when you get to certain altitudes. This service ceiling is also engine specific.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck out the FAR user interface. You can turn on some overlays in the SPH. It will show you two lines.

You want this curve to be as smooth as possible.

This is the second derivative of the yellow curve and thus shows the change in slope of that curve. So you want this curve to be as low as possible. That will automatically translate to the yellow curve beeing as smooth as possible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is called area ruling.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I just reinstalled FAR ... and guess what ...
