So far I\u0027ve been able to do it like this with a lot of success and rendezvous are becoming easier and easier with each mission.

If you just try to fly and use speed to catch up, you will extend your orbit altitude an fly past it. Try to slow down and you will come below. My preference for a capture is first off, patience. Second, if you are behind, you actually can catch up by dropping altitude and slowing down slightly your rendevous will start to pass overhead and then give yourself some altitude gain. When you get on the same plane and getting close, then can slow yourself down, or if ahead, speed yourself up to match the orbital velocity and angle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PictoKong","CreatedById":20043,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T02:53:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Managed to rendez-vous after some more tries.
