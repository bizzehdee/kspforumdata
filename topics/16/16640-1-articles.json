This is simply a pictorial walk through of sending a 3 Kerbal pod to the Mun and back while having enough fuel leftover to make small corrections with the final stages and/or possibly make a Minmus trip/return if you\u0027re smart about your fuel (haven\u0027t tested it to Minmus). This thing is a little bit tight on fuel, but it has plenty to land and return. Also, since the new forums have a limit on photo embeds in the post, I\u0027m just going to upload them to imgur as solo photos and embed a few of them. Let\u0027s get started!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure most of you know what KISS means, if not it\u0027s an acronym for Keep It Simple, Stupid. I see a lot of rockets around here and the spacecraft exchange which are massive and contain unnecessary amounts of boosters and liquid fuel tanks. Most of us who aren\u0027t engineers or astrophysicists (or just don\u0027t feel like working out the math) probably started out with these and have learned over time to make our rockets smaller and more simple. Now, I normally use mods but I wanted to do this with stock parts as an example. This ship has flaws and isn\u0027t the most efficient design (I suggest checking Scott Manley/Szyzyg\u0027s youtube for that - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg?feature=watch\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg?feature=watch\u003C/a\u003E), but it will demonstrate a rather simple rocket design that still looks kinda cool (and functional) and how I got it to the Mun and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KxXHg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KxXHg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, here\u0027s the KISS Mk I just after liftoff. There\u0027s nothing spectacular about the design of this rocket - 6 large boosters attached radially, 3 each to stacks of 3 of the large liquid fuel tanks using the 1200 thrust 2m engines to start us off. Note that the interior LFE (liquid fuel engine) and SRBs (solid rocket boosters) are not lit for the first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3pZtq.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/3pZtq.png\u003C/a\u003E - Here we have the boosters running out and detaching - currently at 2700m and going 124 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hNwCx.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/hNwCx.png\u003C/a\u003E - The flaw with the rocket is seen here. Our velocity has dropped to 88 m/s after we dropped the boosters since they provide a massive amount of thrust. I\u0027m sure I could\u0027ve designed the staging differently, but I just kept it as is to show that even inefficient rockets are capable of getting to the Mun/Minmus and back with fuel to spare. Had I ignited the two boosters left during this stage, this lost in velocity wouldn\u0027t exist and the potential dV (delta V - ultimately how far your craft can go/return) is likely compounded by poor staging, but I am not a rocket scientist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CUksQ.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/CUksQ.png\u003C/a\u003E - Igniting the interior LFEs and SRBs after ditching the burnt out ones. Our velocity is back up to 260 m/s here just after ignition. This stage, after dropping the SRBs, is going to get us to about 90% of LKO (Low-Kerbin Orbit). I have began tilting my rocket towards the horizon here to begin my gravity turn approximately 20 degrees off from being straight up. I do this maneuver after 10km because it just seems to have worked out for me. There are likely better methods, but this is when I begin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oms6v.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/oms6v.png\u003C/a\u003E - Here, we\u0027ve ditched the last set of SRBs and are making a bigger dip towards the horizon, we\u0027re going 584 m/s at about 25km.

I am tilted just at/slightly below the horizon because at this point, my AP (apoapsis - furthest point you will be from the body you are orbiting) is at around 90km and I don\u0027t want it going any higher. This, also, is likely causing me some loss in dV, but I won\u0027t be bringing this stage into orbit with me and will be dumping it so it falls to Kerbin as I don\u0027t want to leave any space debris behind. This stage of the rocket will get me to about 95% of an 100km x 80km LKO; I finish off the last 10% with my fuel sipping, low powered LFE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CsT36.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/CsT36.png\u003C/a\u003E - Here\u0027s the ship at the PE (periapsis - closest point to the body you are orbiting), around 83km, and completing the orbit - I\u0027ve barely dipped into the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wfIcw.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/wfIcw.png\u003C/a\u003E - Beginning of TMI (Trans-Munar Injection).

I\u0027ve expended a good deal of the fuel in this tank, but we\u0027ve still got plenty left to do what we have to, even if looks like we\u0027re running out. We don\u0027t need that much fuel once we get out to the Mun as long as we\u0027re smart about what we do. My Munar PE is around 50km, you can adjust this before you even arrive at your encounter by using small thrusts and watching the orbital map. Hover over the PE marker to see the altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/McJxo.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/McJxo.png\u003C/a\u003E - Here we right around our PE after having closed our orbit by again firing retrograde. We\u0027ve used a bit of the fuel we have left, but it\u0027s okay because we still have plenty to make our final few maneuvers. My altitude is at 58k because I began firing before exactly reaching the PE, but decided I\u0027d land near one of my other bases, which is the small pink dot you see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P6bze.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/P6bze.png\u003C/a\u003E - On the opposite side of the Mun here after bringing our PE (situated above our desired LZ [landing zone]) down to about 10km. I bring it down this far because it takes just about the same amount of energy to slow down at 10km as it does at 200km altitude, but being closer to the surface of the Mun when we kill our horizontal velocity means that gravity affects us for a shorter period of time and we don\u0027t need to burn as much fuel to slow us down during descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/74zCE.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/74zCE.png\u003C/a\u003E - Back at our PE on the light side, roughly over our desired LZ after having expended all the fuel we have except for the lander/return vehicle. Note the KM height on the altimeter. Killing horizontal velocity is a key step in saving fuel and a successful landing. You only have to fight gravity on one vector and can concentrate on keeping your ship pointed relatively vertically rather than worrying about any lateral movement you may have as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Irj5m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Irj5m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, we\u0027ve killed just about all of our horizontal velocity and have began descent. We\u0027re still traveling at 27 m/s, but a lot of that is vertical speed. We\u0027ve used a bit of fuel in our lander, but it\u0027s okay since we\u0027re only going to be making two more burns during the descent and we\u0027ll still have plenty of fuel to get home. I\u0027m not as close as I wanted to the other base, but I wasn\u0027t really aiming for a pinpoint landing with this trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ow1EN.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/ow1EN.png\u003C/a\u003E - Our first burn during descent. I started around 3500m altitude and burned at full throttle vertically to slow myself down to about 10 m/s descent. Notice how there\u0027s not a large difference between the above image\u0027s fuel level and this one - it didn\u0027t take much to slow down, as I was only traveling around 100 m/s towards the Mun when I began the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bhnwz.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/bhnwz.png\u003C/a\u003E - Our second burn before slow descent. My velocity climbed to about 40 m/s, and I began this burn around 2200m altitude. Burning at full throttle is (supposed to be if there was no fuel bug) more efficient than a slow burn. It takes practice and experience to know how much a certain engine can slow you down and in what amount of time to maximize this, but it\u0027s how you want to do it. It\u0027s more nerve-racking, but it\u0027s something you should eventually learn so you don\u0027t need tons of extra fuel and massive rockets, which leads to bigger rockets since you need more SAS and more fuel to lift them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s0efK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022s0efK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding! Look at how much fuel we have left. If you compare the fuel levels between this image and the one from just after killing horizontal velocity above, you can see that there is hardly a difference. I hardly used any fuel to land myself because I didn\u0027t have to fight gravity as much as if I was coming in at a steeper angle or from a higher altitude. You can increase this effect by bringing the PE even closer to something like 5km over your target LZ before beginning descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u0027s get these guys home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContinued below\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-11T21:06:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2012 09:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by wildkittyv1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wildkittyv1","CreatedById":30893,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-11T20:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rCxfH.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/rCxfH.png\u003C/a\u003E - Here we are after Munar liftoff and having traveled a bit of distance both equatorially and vertically.

Look at how much fuel is left in the lander compared to the image from where we began our Munar descent. We used maybe half a tank of fuel to land on the Mun safely, liftoff, escape its gravity, and slow us down enough to land on Kerbin.

I was all up in orbit and realized I had messed up and would undershoot my target, so I fired prograde again and it just dawned on me that I could easily control my LZ by how I fired. This lead to killing horiz. velocity and that eventually lead to realizing that if I was closer to the body I wanted to land at, I\u0027d have to fight gravity less; pretty standard progression through logic for someone not entirely oriented with orbital mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, as far as this particular craft is concerned, it was a little janky landing it without any SAS at all. I normally use the tiny ASAS module from Kosmos, but wanted to do this entirely stock for demonstration purposes, and I absolutely hate the way the 1m SAS looks and even the ghetto trick of putting the parachute off-center so you can stack on top of it to hide it looks pretty funky to me. I wasn\u0027t really spinning uncontrollably, but it was a bit of a space rodeo since it would twist twice as far as I intended as I got down below 50m from the surface while chasing the retrograde symbol. I actually wasted a bunch of fuel because the 2m lander engine is a bit too strong for this style of lander and \u0022bounced\u0022 around a bit, which would mean having to aim almost parallel to the Munar surface to kill that velocity, and then try to come down smooth for another landing attempt.

I\u0027ve a feeling ships might end up a little bigger once re-entry heat is simulated as at the moment you save quite a bit of fuel by not having to do any work to keep your entry velocity low. You can have your apoapsis pretty much wherever you want but so long as the periapsis is \u0026lt;30km or so you\u0027ll touchdown safely. Having to shove all the extra fuel onto the final stage increases the lower stages by an annoying amount!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally I find I can\u0027t use ASAS combined with a three man lander either. Just can\u0027t get it to look any good. I can sometimes squeeze it in lower down the stack without looking too bad, but I\u0027m really hoping for increased radius versions in .17.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wildkittyv1","CreatedById":30893,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-14T14:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECaroliano - I could redo it with fuel crossfeeding, but this was really just meant to show the level of fuel consumption after getting into orbit and showing how little you actually need (and my rocket is still oversized - if I had done the fuel crossfeed you could probably get away with not having the interior SRBs and 1/3 of the exterior ones I lit on ignition. I\u0027ve done pure LFE rockets before but it just feels wrong if I don\u0027t have some SRBs on it. I love me some SRBs and am working on a rocket that can land and return from the Mun using nothing but SRBs and timing the burns correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnsinn - That\u0027s fine. I\u0027m not a fan of leaving space debris and I consider landing stages to be that. I have a few designs that leave the landing stages behind but those are purpose built as rescue vehicles and I went with a completely different design philosophy for them. Even if I have leftover fuel in a landing stage I won\u0027t go back and redesign. I\u0027ll decouple the extra fuel tank about 1km before landing so it has a chance to pickup some speed and explode on Munar contact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETigga - for this return I think I slowed down to like 2km/s with the remaining fuel and let the atmosphere take over after that. I\u0027m not sure how reentry is going to work once we have heat shields and the like, but I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not going to be overly complex as it seems pretty clear that Squad plans on keeping the game accessible. We\u0027ll just have to change stuff as we need to. As for the ASAS thing, I hardly ever build stock rockets anymore since I feel the parts are limiting and design capabilities plateaus pretty quickly with them. I normally use the tiny ASAS thing from Kosmos and the parachute from NovaPunch that lets you stack stuff on it. I know they\u0027re not stock parts, but I\u0027m not a purist and stock parts are too limiting in their size and capabilities in my opinion. If I was going to redesign this so I could have ASAS during the landing, I\u0027d have just put it between a set of decouplers from the Munar injection/orbital slowdown stage and the ascent/return stage and dumped it like 50m up from the Munar surface. It would\u0027ve looked even weirder, but it would\u0027ve given me a bit more control on the way down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
