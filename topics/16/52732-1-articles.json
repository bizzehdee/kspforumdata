He only has four nuclear engines on it and their thrust is trash for anything then traveling great distances. Just judging from the design, he would not have enough thrust to lift off using only the nukes as I do not see any additional stages or engines.\u003Cp\u003EThe rough math is that He has a dry mass of at least (Only major parts and tanks) 18.1. while he has a wet mass (with fuel) of 53.1. Four nukes gets a TWR of 1.334 with a single full tank (X200-16) totaling to 18.5 mass with another tank and 9 more mass that TWR drops to 0.89. And that is just two tanks and four engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest looking to make your craft a little lighter, using lighter parts initially to see just how far you can get. Once you have some sense of how far certain things can get you, then you can make a more efficient design. Oh and just so you know, The Rocomax 48-7S can do a very good job. It does not have the ridiculous efficiency of the nukes, but it also does not add 2.25 mass to your ship. Play with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the current craft could be used for a flyby? Sort of like a pre-mission to scout for the main landing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you say, it doesn\u0060t look good for ascent from Duna.

As already discussed, though, for many places you might not survive a landing and you\u0027re most certainly not getting home again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor starters, you should add lightness. Ditch the Cupola, replace it with an adapter (Rockomax Brand Adapter 02, flip it over so the \u0022small\u0022 side is up) and put the materials bay on that, or use nothing at all since it\u0027s not required. Then stick a Mk 1 command pod on top of the materials bay for your Kerbal. That will save you 3.6 tons or so, which isn\u0027t a lot but it\u0027s more than nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should not need that much RCS fuel. Consider some radially mounted cylinders instead. Or, if you got the tech, put in a large SAS module and one ZK-4 battery module in place of the RCS tank and ditch the RCS system all together. Stick some OX-4 series solar panels somewhere, or a pair of RTGs. That\u0027ll save you a couple more tons. Every little bit helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear engines are not really appropriate for landing/ascent engines, except maybe on smaller moons. Certainly not anyplace with an atmosphere! You could probably replace two of them with something else like LV-T30s and use action groups to toggle which pair is active; Use the LV-T30s for liftoff and the nukes for interplanetary. It doesn\u0027t look like you have any other thrust so unless your fuel tanks are nearing empty I would still not expect you\u0027d make it off of some bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor leaving heavier bodies, consider more staging just like taking off from Kerbin. As a general rule, drop dead weight as every opportunity - but especially when trying to get off the ground!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Smidge=\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
