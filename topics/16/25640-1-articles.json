Then shift-click and move your mouse only sideways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine how the navball looks when you launch. There are the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west). The more perfect you can place the camera on one of those 90 degree lines, the better. Angle the view so that the \u0022left/right\u0022 is pointing straight down one of the cardinal directions, and \u0022up/down\u0022 is perfectly level. Don\u0027t angle the camera up or down, it only complicates the movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen move the ship in three movements. One to fix it\u0027s fore/aft, one for left/right, and one for up/down. Be perpendicular for the sideways moves. The up/down can be done from either of the sides. For up/down, you can also shift-click and scroll up/down with the mouse wheel and not cause lateral movement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T21:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf all else fails and you don\u0027t have tons of things attached radially to the root part, just take everything but the root part off, throw out the root part, and grab a new one.

Take everything off one end of the root part and save it as a subassembly, here referred to as Ship Chunk A.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Take the root and the rest of the ship and save it as Ship Chunk B. Now you have an empty VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.5. If you don\u0027t mind the root part getting changed, start a new ship by picking a new part from the menu. If you MUST have the original root part, and can\u0027t re-do all the things attached to it radially, skip to step 3. Otherwise, just put Ship Chunks A and B back on either end, remove any redundant parts as necessary, and resume having fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. So you need your original root? Then it gets a bit hacky now. Exit the editor (but you can still leave KSP running) and go into your file explorer. Find Ship Chunk B in the Subassemblies folder of your save and copy or move it to one of the Ships folders (VAB or SPH, whichever is appropriate). When you go back into the editor it will show up as a normal ship (I think. I\u0027ll be double-checking this part later).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

If you can\u0027t even select it, you might have a problem with recursive symmetry. Happens to me all the time and has the weirdest side effects: parts can\u0027t be selected or selected parts can\u0027t be placed anywhere (not even discarded). Usually, but not always, the game will be laggy when this happens. Often, but by no means always, the ship will violently explode the moment you put it on the launchpad/runway. Not collapse under it\u0027s own weight, but actually go boom, before gravity even had time to act on your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve got any of these symptoms, your vessel is probably a write-off.
