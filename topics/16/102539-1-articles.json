I am more or less able to build a plane that takes off and lands safely (by Kerbal standards).\n\nThe one I have built (unmanned) works just fine until the Toroidal rocket engines kick in. At which point, the heavy fuel burn rate empties some tanks, imbalances my plane and it flips over.\n\nI made a small diagram explaining how physics interact with my SSTO :\n\n(\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00A2\u00C2\u00AF\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00C2\u00A1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00A2\u00C2\u00AF\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00B8\u00C2\u00B5 \u003E==\u003E\n\nI have read on the Internets that it was an issue of fuel imbalance in the craft, and all I had to do was transfer fuel to reestablish balance. Something that I have been able to do, thus stabilizing the craft and thus saving the day. Yet as soon as I start the rocket engines the fuel is used again, all hell breaks loose and I never reach space.\n\nHow can I tackle this issue ? What am I missing here ? \n\nThanks a lot for your help ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T20:34:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 08:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sovnheim**"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T17:50:26Z","Content":"Using a fuel-balancing mod works very well; however, a little design consideration will ensure even fuel consumption also. Just ensure that each engine has its own fuel supply (with the same amount of fuel) and that tanks are placed in symmetry. If you must, you can use decouplers to strictly forbid fuel flow (and many parts allow you to disable crossfeed, which will accomplish the same goal). Fuel lines can help as well (to a point anyway). Uneven thrust limiter settings will cause uneven consumption as well."},{"CreatedByName":"jake9039","CreatedById":122602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T17:51:09Z","Content":"I would recomend pulling the fuel into a different source, than pull it to the front of craft.

It will show you where your plane\u0027s center of mass will be once it\u0027s out of fuel, which is information you can use to ensure that the plane will remain \u0022balanced\u0022 as it flies. From what you\u0027re describing it\u0027s likely that the CoM is shifting aft of the CoL after you\u0027ve made the switch to rockets, which is what\u0027s causing your plane to flip over. I might also recommend switching out that aerospike for something less massive; you fly a plane correctly and you won\u0027t need all that much rocket thrust to make space.\n\nI also generally give the advice [in this link](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100334-SSTO-Why-u-no-fly?p=1546536\u0026viewfull=1#post1546536) to most spaceplane rookies.

I have had this happen when putting the rockets on the wings. The ship is stable at low altitude, but then when it\u0027s high enough that atmospheric control surfaces don\u0027t work anymore it flips. I eventually debugged it by (1) using the tools in the spaceplane hangar, especially the part shifting \u0027gizmos\u0027 with snap ON, and (2) hyperediting to deep space and confirming that the rockets could indeed thrust in a straight line."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T17:34:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...What am I missing here ?\n\nI think you are missing the fact that SSTO means Single Stage To Orbit - start simple, with a rocket.

That allows rockets to drain their boosters first (if they are connected to the core), and generally causes the front fuel in spaceplanes to be drained first - something to consider when fiddling with the CoM in SPH ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAbout the fuel problems, there\u0027s (almost) always room for improvement. Flight profile, choosing the right vac. engines, maximizing turbojet time/performance, allocating correct amounts of fuel for different engines, improving orbital manuevers...
