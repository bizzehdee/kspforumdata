If your nose is pointing far above/below the prograde indicator on your navball at any time, you\u0027re wasting fuel, so try and keep the turn smooth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost rockets should be designed to run at full throttle and have the correct acceleration curve to minimize drag loss. If this isn\u0027t the case, it may be necessary to ease off the throttle a bit at low altitude to keep your speed down, but keep in mind that you lose efficiency whenever your engine is throttled down, too. It can sometimes be bettwe to just power through it and go a little too fast, than to fuss with the throttle and wind up losing speed after staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you notice your speed is low at the end of your gravity turn (a periapsis of -200km or lower, to where it takes more than a couple seconds of burn to circularize) you started your gravity turn too late, or not shallow enough. Work on getting up your orbital velocity more before pushing your apoapsis up, by leading your prograde indicator, or starting your turn earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efinally you can use mechjeb to plan and analyze your ascent for you, if you\u0027re so inclined.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Haemogoblin","CreatedById":57864,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T22:45:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re not alone, I\u0027ve tried a bunch of my old designs and had zero success since the latest update.
