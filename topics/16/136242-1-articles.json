I have unlocked an engine (I think the RD-103) which is the first big engine you get, and I\u0027ve been having a problem with it. The engine is not throttleable, so I have to put a huge fuel tank in front of it to keep the rocket from going too fast in the lower atmosphere. However, eventually the engine fails, and leaves me with 3/4 of my fuel unused. This is getting really annoying. I would like to remove the mod that is causing the failures, but I do not know which one it is. I installed RSS RP-0 and RO via CKAN, and did not include many other mods besides the required ones for those big mods. I would appreciate any help with this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T21:49:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not certain, as I\u0027ve only had time to dabble in RO/RP0 very briefly, but I believe that you\u0027re exceeding the rated burn time for that engine. Every engine has a length of time that it\u0027s rated to burn for, any longer than that and the chances of failure go way up.

However, the first stage rocket will fail before I have used up my first stage fuel. Because of that, I shortened the first stage so I wouldn\u0027t waste fuel. However, that means I have a tremendous TWR, and I can\u0027t throttle down with the engine, and burn up in the atmosphere on ascent due to heating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I read up on how TestFlight works, and if I understand correctly I have to use that engine more for it to gain reliability.
