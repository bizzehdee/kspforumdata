Fire your thrusters retrograde (slow down) so you orbit the moon, then orbit until the periapsis is above a well lit area, and fire retrograde again as you approach/reach your periapsis until you are heading pretty much straight down (ie 0 m/s orbit) This is how I tend to make my Mun landings, and as far as I know from my basic understanding of rocket science, it\u0027s the most fuel efficient way to land as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively you could put lights on the bottom of your lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: fixed some mistakes. firing prograde in mun orbit would take you back to kerbin not help you land.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-23T21:11:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2013 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by internetlad\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T21:08:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the darkness itself is the problem, then I\u0027d recommend putting some downward-facing lights on the lander.
