It rolls constantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t mean \u0022it rolls down the runway,\u0022 I know about that. That\u0027s fine. It\u0027s also not about the landing gear flexing funny as I roll down the runway, it\u0027s pretty controllable on the ground. This is in the air. It constantly rolls to the left. Small roll, but enough that I can\u0027t keep a heading and I can\u0027t seem to trim it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane is otherwise stable, best I can tell. CoM is ahead of the CoL so we\u0027re cool in the longitudinal modes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first (with other planes I was trying to build) I thought I was simply unstable in roll, so I tried adding dihedral to the wings (as you can see). I\u0027m not sure that even works in KSP, but it appears this isn\u0027t the issue. Then I thought maybe the jet engine applies a torque, but it does this no matter the throttle setting. I\u0027ve been watching the control input indicators at the bottom left and this happens while the roll indicator is centered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the standard 3 views with the centers highlighted, but as I said it\u0027s not a stability issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v119/pincushionman/ksp/troubleshooting/condor_zpsc1e692c8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022condor_zpsc1e692c8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the .craft, in case any of you want to try to troubleshoot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/la7yyh9ma7asql8/Condor_LRF.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/la7yyh9ma7asql8/Condor_LRF.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have mods on, but only the following: In-Flight Waypoints, KER, Docking Port Alignment Indicator, ScanSat, StageRecovery, Trajectories, Kerbal Alarm Clock, TweakScale.
