A single FL R1 with 8 0 10\u0027s gives me 3293 Dv.

The price difference is only 6k. The engine mass of the 010 is only .09 so having 8 of them on the FL R1 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estill gives you about the same total vessel mass at that point as the 48-7S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not seeing a downside to this engine, unless the numbers I\u0027m getting from KER and MJ are totally flawed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T10:04:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EO-10\u0027s are PhysicsSignificance=1 and hence massless, that 90kg mass given in the VAB is a lie. Infinite TWR!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s only sensible with the 2.5m monopropellant tank, the other mp tanks have awful mass ratios. Monoprop is also more expensive that LFO, so if you\u0027re playing with a budget that\u0027s a limitation. The poor Isp means there\u0027s only a few specific niches where it\u0027s really useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of those niches is an orbital assembly tug. I\u0027m imagining launching station or ship modules without propulsion or RCS, and have a monoprop-powered tug rendezvous with it to maneuver it into place. The O-10 provides higher Isp propulsion that\u0027s throttleable compared to regular mp thrusters, and the additional cost/complexity of a LFO system can be omitted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T10:06:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe O-10 engine is physicsless, so you can get as high TWR with it as you want without affecting delta-v.

Or perhaps a tunable SRB alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a Kerbin-based SSTO, I expect that 1 FL-R1 tank will get you ~0.3 - 0.33 tonnes into LKO, for a decent but unspectacular payload fraction of 8-9%. Well, decent before the 48-7S was buffed. Let alone the ARM engines, and the re-balancing of 0.24...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor landers, it depends very much on design details.

But for anything bigger, say a 3-man pod and service module mostly made of RCS tanks, it\u0027s just too thirsty to even make a transfer from Kerbin to Mun. This thing just sucks down the mono, especially when used in any quantity to get a decent amount of thrust with a decent payload. The Poodle (especially since it lost some weight) is what you want for that job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main use I can see for the O-10 is on small probes for station-keeping, assuming they already have RCS aboard for fine-tuning. You don\u0027t need it for a Minmus scooter or even return vehicle; regular RCS thrusters are adequate for that. And while it might make a good scooter for going between stations, it can\u0027t carry much more than 1 Kerbal in a lawnchair while doing that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blind Dead McJones","CreatedById":109600,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T02:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t yet thought of anything that I would use the O-10 for that I can\u0027t already do with biprop fuel, though I\u0027m sure someone has, or will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanna get anywhere you will need several of the largest monoprop tanks, which won\u0027t lift off unless you add dozens of engines which will use all of your fuel in seconds.
