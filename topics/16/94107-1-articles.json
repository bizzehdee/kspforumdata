I\u0027m guessing it doesn\u0027t change the maximum science you can get from a bonus, simply that it will take fewer repeats to max out the science?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIe, returning a temperature scan (1 experiment maxes out the return) - it won\u0027t make a difference if there was a scientist or not, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuppose I have a lvl 4 scientist, with a \u002B20% science modifier, and I run a hypothetical experiment that returns 80% of the remaining available science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if the experiment, repeated ad infinitum, would yield 100 science points, and 1 experiment yields 80... will the scientist max out the science after 1 experiment? or is it not 20 percentage points, but the return value *1.2 (capped at 100%, obviously)... so that the 80% science return becomes 96%... sort of the way the mobile lab works, but for physical returns rather than transmissions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext: does a scientist have any effect on transmitted data without the use of the lab? Does the scientist increase the effectiveness of the lab?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lab took a pretty heavy nerf to its transmission efficiency (I\u0027ve argued for a buff), is this to offset the effect of having a high level scientist?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf so, I still think its dumb... the transmission function was already nearly useless... now its even more of simple a 3.5 ton weight to lug around to reset goo and mat bays.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aedile","CreatedById":104353,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T11:51:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf so, I still think its dumb... the transmission function was already nearly useless... now its even more of simple a 3.5 ton weight to lug around to reset goo and mat bays. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually lab is great. Think about landing on each biome of a different planet. The lab is supposed to be left in orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransmission is also useful, you transmit, then bring a sample home. You get all the science this way, so you needn\u0027t revisit said biome. Think about visiting each biome of Jool\u0027s moons... It even helps for the local moons.

In the past (before part, size, and weight limits), I could do a single mission to get mun and minmus biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still have to lug it to orbit, and to the mun, even if I leave it in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut only a 15% bonus to transmission efficiency? I just won\u0027t transmit the non-reusable experiment results. Its easy enough to transmit from the surface, re-run the experiment, load it into the pod, re-run the experiment, and then dock, and do a boosted transmission of one copy, while you store the other for return (and since the repeatable experiments are massless, you can bring 2 of them easily if you want to return more)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I am not going to transmit the data from a mat bay. Going from 20% transmission efficiency to 23% transmission efficiency with the lab is a waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve modded the transmission stats on previous games (25% instead of 20% base efficiency, 50% instead of 30% boosted efficiency), and with the diminishing returns for multiple returns, I\u0027d get almost the same amount of science by doing 1 boosted transmissio, and 1 return vs 2 returns...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this 15% boost... useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe utility of the lab lies in 2 things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1) Resetting experiments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2) Boosting transmission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey made #2 useless now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole thing isn\u0027t useless, I just don\u0027t understand why they did that.

In my experience, I cannot see ANY changes that scientists supposedly help with. I\u0027ve tried many different scenarios to get a change in science (transmitting, recovering, etc.) but I can\u0027t see any indication that scientists help and neither can anyone else as far as I\u0027ve seen. If anyone can get some actual specific data showing changes in their science values through Kerbal scientists it would be much appreciated. Otherwise, I think it is a bug that only works in theory. I hope it is a bug, because in my gameplay scientists have been useless.

A very useful bonus, and an excellent way to practice maneuvres before you send up Kerbals, in the early-mid career game.
