I\u0027ve found a few threads mentioning it, but nothing definitive on exactly what to do (or not to do) to get planetary exploration contracts to trigger correctly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my current career game, after reaching orbit around Kerbin, I got the \u0027explore Mun\u0027 and \u0027explore Minmus\u0027 contracts. After successfully completing them, it triggered the \u0027explore Eve\u0027, \u0027explore Gilly\u0027, \u0027explore Duna\u0027, and \u0027explore Ike\u0027 contracts. I accepted all 4 of them and put together a mission to Duna. I did a manned landing on Duna and Ike, completing those 2 contracts, which triggered \u0027explore Jool\u0027, but nothing for Dres or any of the moons of Jool. I accepted the Jool contract, but decided my next mission should be to Eve. I put together a probe, lander, and transfer stage in orbit around Kerbin with the plan to drop the probe on Eve and do a landing on Gilly to satisfy both of those contracts. Unfortunately, my window to Eve wasn\u0027t very good, but my window to Jool was better so I sent the hardware (and Kerbals) on a voyage to Jool instead. After successful aerobrake and orbit around Jool, I satisfied that contract, but no new exploration contracts for the moons (or anything else) triggered. I then moved to orbit around Laythe, which triggered an \u0027explore Bop\u0027 contract for some reason, but still no contracts for any other Joolian moons. So now I\u0027ve got a crew hanging around Laythe, ready to land, but I\u0027m unwilling to send them down and miss out on the money and prestige of the \u0027explore Laythe\u0027 contract that hasn\u0027t triggered. I suppose I could go to Bop and satisfy that contract, but I don\u0027t want to waste a lot of delta-v bouncing around the various Joolian moons without a plan or contracts for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to figure out where I went wrong and why I\u0027m not getting these contracts. Yes, I\u0027ve tried waiting around and time warping to see if they appear and they have not. The only other thing I can think of is that my tracking station is currently only at level 2. Does that play a role in triggering exploration contracts? Do you need a fully upgraded tracking station to get contracts for the outer planets and bodies? My hope for this thread is for someone to come in with a full explanation of how the exploration contracts are triggered so it can serve as a reference for myself and others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-15T13:02:09Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2015 01:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Johnny Wishbone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpelling errors\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T13:19:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt does seem a little random...
