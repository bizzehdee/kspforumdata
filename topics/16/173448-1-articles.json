This turned out to be a very good suggestion. It was the only problem I could get to work well. It has a high detection rate, but also a good field of view. If you put one in a polar orbit of Mun, for example, turn on Kerbnet, hit timewarp, and keep hitting the \u0022refresh\u0022 button, anomalies will begin popping up all over the surface (there are a good number of them on Mun). Then you just tag them for navigation and land by them one at a time to see what they are. This obviously works anywhere else, as well. It\u0027s kinda fun, cuz you never know what it\u0027s gonna be until you get close enough to actually see it. I think you\u0027ll enjoy finding them.
