Duna\u0027s gravity is much lower than Kerbin, so Oberth savings would be minimal."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T06:36:38Z","Content":"My gut is telling me that Kryxal is correct. However, you can test it yourself in half an Ike month by setting up the maneuver node for one journey, and then setting the maneuver node up for the other journey when Ike\u0027s on the other side. Note the total burn dV of each attempt and bammo, you\u0027ll know the answer.\n\nDuna and Jool\u0027s orbits are circular enough that just getting your resultant Sun apoapsis up to Jool\u0027s orbit is enough. No waiting for transfer windows necessary."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T07:15:28Z","Content":"Depends on how much delta-V you have and how much you need. The Oberth maneuver would probably be \\*somewhat\\* cheaper but at cost of seriously increasing difficulty of the maneuvers. IMHO simply dish out the extra 100 or so m/s and go directly (also, pick the right moment in Ike\u0027s orbit - when Ike is moving prograde relative to the Sun).\n\nedit: forgot an important factor. I\u0027m not sure what is the inclination difference between Duna and Jool, but plane adjustment can be costly when done \u0022out in the open\u0022. By aiming your Duna flyby right you can do it nearly for free."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T07:30:16Z","Content":"I\u0027m not sure whether the optimal transfer involves a direct burn from Ike or an Oberth maneuver at Duna, but it\u0027s definitely based on a Kerbin gravity assist."},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T07:39:26Z","Content":"Yeah I was thinking that the direct burn would be simpler but if I could time the Duna fly-by right I may also be able to come back and slingshot around Ike again to pick up some more delta-V. I\u0027m more of a seat-of-the-pants pilot I was just wondering if there was a general rule or maybe someone has a mod to calculate a Duna manouver.\n\nJR"},{"CreatedByName":"Yasmy","CreatedById":79995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T09:02:19Z","Content":"Roughly: \n\nIke -\u003E Duna -\u003E Jool: 1158 m/s\n\nIke -\u003E Jool: 1266 m/s\n\n[Direct vs slingshot table.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128969-Best-place-for-an-interplanetary-launch-facility?p=2086358\u0026viewfull=1#post2086358)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T09:30:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Roughly: \n\u003E Ike -\u003E Duna -\u003E Jool: 1158 m/s\n\u003E \n\u003E Ike -\u003E Jool: 1266 m/s\n\u003E \n\u003E [Direct vs slingshot table.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128969-Best-place-for-an-interplanetary-launch-facility?p=2086358\u0026viewfull=1#post2086358)\n\nSo it\u0027s Ike -\u003E Kerbin -\u003E Jool: 421 m/s.

Slightly behind Duna? , though unsure about angle) and do a lot of that burn when close to Duna? The trick would probably be getting the angle right so that you don\u0027t need to establish an orbit around Duna.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T09:57:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 09:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rofltehcat**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T09:53:48Z","Content":"[https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalAcademy/comments/1qu5jv/deltav_charts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalAcademy/comments/1qu5jv/deltav_charts/)\n\nThese are the most comprehensive set of delta-V charts I have found, and allow you to answer questions like that, as the Reddit post explains.
