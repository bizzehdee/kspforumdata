What\u0027s the lander look like? A picture, although not exactly required to solve this, would help a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, you want to land at less than 2 m/s straight down, and have a wide stance to your landing gear. A tall, skinny rocket with a narrow footprint is easy to tip over on a hill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, both of these can be eased by using RCS. The RCS can help you remove lateral speed, and can help you right a tipped lander if you\u0027re careful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T08:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to remove lateral speed is to tip the rocket in the direction of the retrograde marker on the navball. When you\u0027ve got a long way to go before you reach the ground, you can turn beyond the retrograde marker and burn to push it toward the top (middle of the blue area). The further past it you turn, the faster it\u0027ll move away from your current vector. If on the other hand you are close to the surface and are coming in gently, then you want to make much smaller turns toward the retrograde vector, and be ready to swiftly turn back to vertical before you knock the rocket in the other direction. Takes a little getting used to but it\u0027s pretty easy once you get the hang of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T16:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this is the case, but landing gear suspension might be giving you too much \u0022spring\u0022.
