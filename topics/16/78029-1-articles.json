Go into Steam/steamapps/common and copy the Kerbal Space Program folder to another location. He says this is all legal to do. Then you always have a pristine, untouched version in the Steam folder... and you run your actual KSP games from the other folder that you copied. Then you can add mods, do whatever you like, without worry. Plus, you don\u0027t even have to load up Steam to run the game.
