I am trying to make it into two sets of two boosters around the core so I can drop two of them separately from the other two. If I remove one of the 4 of course all 4 come off but when I try to reset to a bi symmetry it keeps attaching as a quad symmetry. It is not letting me bi-symmetrical.

This is far easier on PC because you have the keyboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, whenever you set symmetry to be on (anything other than 1, aka no symmetry) and your mouse happens to touch ANYTHING that\u0027s already on symmetry, the game flips your symmetry to that number.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here\u0027s what I\u0027m guessing you do. You mouse down, click the symmetry button until it says 2, then mouse back up to your ship and on the way, your mouse goes over something with 4-symmetry. Bam, you\u0027re now in 4-symmetry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution is to stop clicking with the mouse. Instead, use X to cycle through your symmetry numbers, while your mouse is up where you want the thing to be attached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will NOT allow you to place 2-symmetry parts on 4-symmetry attached decouplers. As others have said, you must place the entire radial assemblage you made, starting at the decouplers or cubic struts or whatever, as one entire piece.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-24T02:07:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2020 02:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Superfluous J\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jbdenney","CreatedById":201835,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-24T02:10:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the mouseing over may have been the issue.
