I just wanted to know is there a limit to how far of the Solar System you can send a ship before the space Kraken hits? I wanted to know because I day ago I checked in on my Voyager-1 probe which was on escape trajectory from the Sun. It had been flying out of the Solar System for around seven years of game time and about two months of real time. It was at around double that of Eeloo\u0027s furthest point from the Sun. I went to check on it and all my intruments when black. The screen was flying all over the place wildly. So I was wondering is there a limit to how far out something can go before it starts to glitch out?
