I presume it\u0027s because the lack of load on the wheels are causing them to lose grip but the simulation is still considers the thing landed and looks too much to the wheels for attitude \u00A0behavior. Pulling back hard on the stick just before you reach takeoff speed usually takes the load off of front gears entirely and puts a bit back on the rear and that helps me out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-27T16:10:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2016 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FyunchClick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
