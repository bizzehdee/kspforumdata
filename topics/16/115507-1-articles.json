It\u0027s just a matter of the delta-v requirements gradually rising as you get further from the optimal time and transit time.

The window ends when the spaceship no longer has the delta-v to make the transition at the current phase angle.\n\nAlso, IRL it is possible to launch from earth, do an orbit around the sun, then use earth again for a gravitational assist. (e.g. the Rosetta mission). If the mission to mars chooses to do that (probably a probe), then calculating the length of the transfer window gets really complex because of the gravity assist.\n\nrosetta mission flight path:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ktrtvCvZb28?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T23:13:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 11:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reddeyfish**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T23:18:50Z","Content":"Yeah. But there\u0027s a kind of big difference between the perfect Hohmann transfer and having to burn straight to Mars in a case of Sun - Earth - Mars alignment. That would probably require to go near light speed if you don\u0027t want to miss it. Meaning an almost 600 000 000 m/s delta-V requirment (including the breaking, not the return).\n\nBTW, for OP\u0027s problem, let\u0027s say that there\u0027s theorically a very precise moment where the transfer is optimal, but burning a few hours before/after will barely change anything to your delta-V cost (1 or 2 m/s probably). So don\u0027t worry that much.\n\nSomething worth considering however is the inclination change. There\u0027s a lot of tutorial saying that for a good Hohmann transfer you need to look at the phase angle between the planets. But you should really consider to wait for a window that will almost cost you nothing in terms of plane change. In the worst case, which is Moho, you can get up to a 2520 m/s burn plane change (according to delta-V map) !"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

Yes you can space your launches as other said. The best approach I think is to have them all in orbit already, so you\u0027ll be doing the burns with 20-30 minutes of difference between them. \n\nBut also, the time of arrival at Duna will NOT be spaced the same way, a little difference in the time and speed you leave Kerbin makes a huge difference down the road, so you might end up with days apart even if you launched the vessels within minutes of one another, so you\u0027ll have plenty of time to manage all SOI changes easily."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T02:16:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d like to launch about 3 missions to Duna/Ike - outpost on Duna, Ike landing and perhaps a rover/other Duna landing. Is it possible (or feasible) to space out the transfer burns a day or so apart, and then manage the SOI changes at the other end?\n\nCertainly this is possible. I do flotillas all the time and it\u0027s no big deal. See the tutorial in my sig (and be sure to read to the end of the thread where things got a LOT easier thanks to a change in MJ).\n\nAnyway, don\u0027t worry about spacing things at all on the departure end. That doesn\u0027t matter. You can put all your ships in orbit at once and burn them consecutively one after the other. Due to slight inaccuracies and differences in your transfer burns, and any mid-course tweaks you make, your ships will arrive spread out over an interval of several weeks by the time they get to Duna. And the further away you send your flotilla, the wider the spacing gets. At Jool, it might be a couple months before everything shows up.\n\nThe only place where you MIGHT run into having to juggle several ships at once is Eve. It\u0027s the shortest trip so usually a flotilla will all arrive within a day or 2 at most, with from 1 to a few hours between ships. But even that isn\u0027t really a problem because even with just 1 hour between ships, they\u0027re still far enough apart to burn one, jump to the next, burn it, etc.\n\nBut anyway, I do find it easier on me if I space my departure burns out by about an hour or 2. This is possible with the MJ \u0022Advanced Transfer to Another Planet\u0022 thingy. Just move your mouse slightly until you see a slightly different departure time than ships youlve already made nodes for.\n\nOf course, Kerbal Alarm Clock is an absolute must for this."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T05:54:51Z","Content":"For that matter, a small burn prograde or retrograde combined with radial in/out will affect your arrival time with minimal effect (if you plan it that way!) on your arrival trajectory ... or you can adjust your arrival while you\u0027re at it (and this is VERY good for avoiding Ike!)"},{"CreatedByName":"OscarJade","CreatedById":130772,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T15:39:04Z","Content":"Thanks all!
