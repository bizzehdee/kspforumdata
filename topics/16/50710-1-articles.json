But I\u0027m either not using it correctly or I\u0027ve found a bug. I\u0027m putting whole rockets into subassemblies. Then I just build the probe/ship I want to throw into space and attach the rocket from the subassemblies. The problem is that subassemblies that have items (rocket firing, stages separating, things doing stuff etc) in stage-1, stage-2.. etc blends in with the stage items from my probe. This then causes all sorts of things to go wrong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like that items that are in a stage from a subassemblies be added as separate stages below any that might be existing in the current project. Currently they are blended together. How can I do this now or how can I put this forward as a bug report / enhancement request?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T22:29:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlways remember to check the staging before you launch\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T22:32:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt supposedly helps if you add sufficient number of empty stages below your probe\u0027s stages before you attach the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T01:44:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of the time, the staging will remain in the proper order.
