It also isn\u0027t if what you are controlling is perfectly stationary on the surface of a planet (easiest to notice if you do it with a parked spaceplane, which will \u0022snap\u0022 to its default \u0022un-physics\u0027d build hangar form\u0022 when you reach a high enough warp). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObjects in orbit while you are not controlling them seem to just be saved as some form of \u0022orbit data.\u0022 I figured that out when I finally got around to seeing what happens if you use the \u0022hack gravity\u0022 debug option to get something out of the atmosphere. If you look at the map while doing this, what you see is basically the orbit data you are in with that weird gravity whatnot being on. Return to space center from such an object without ending flight, then go back to that object, and you end up with a ship that is on that projected orbit with normal unhacked gravity. Put another way, the vessel\u0027s speed is increased to the point where it is now at the proper speed to be in that trajectory relative to the local planet\u0027s gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint is, as long as something is in a safe stable orbit, you don\u0027t need to worry about warping time when its not being controlled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wurmfist","CreatedById":65051,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T01:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eleven\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eleven\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPhysical time warp can rip your ship apart, be careful.
