Either transmitting or recovery. Recovery can be done by delivering the sensor back to Kerbin\u0027s surface, or recovering via EVA (then process or returning to Kerbin). You can process via science lab, but none of that applies to one-way probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience recovered by transmission varies by type. For example, the gravity scan transmits for 40% of the recovery science value. So if a recovered scan is worth 100 points, you will receive 40 points for transmitting the data. You can often transmit a second time for some small value (in the range of 1 science or less), but further transmissions get you none.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your second question, it does not \u0022destroy\u0022 follow on science. So if you go back and scan that 100 point science area, then recover the gravity scanner (back to Kerbin surface or via EVA as described), you get the remaining 60 points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome science (such as the goo canister) are single use, and once you transmit (or recover via EVA) you can\u0027t use that canister again. You can bring more than one canister though. Sci Jr is the same way. Those one-use experiments can be scrubbed and reused in a science lab (again, doesn\u0027t apply for one-way probes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the other sensors can be reused, but you are still limited by the transmission percentage. Also note, if you are recovering the sensor, then it can only store one reading but you get the full science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Yes, this changed in 0.23.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-25T23:54:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2014 11:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T00:34:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso keep in mind that transmitting the data destroys the experiment.
