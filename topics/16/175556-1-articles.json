Admittedly, I can only view the video at poor resolution on my mobile phone screen at the moment, so I\u0027m somewhat guessing at the parts. Either way, I agree that the extra capsules slow down just in time because they have considerably more drag than the prime capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolutions include making the prime capsule more draggy and/or lighter (if you have a heat shield, remove all the ablator... or even the entire part), adding chutes that open earlier (drogues) or pitch over more during ascent so that you have a flatter trajectory. The last one gives you more time to decelerate. I think these have all been mentioned already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would add that this type of craft is inherently risky - if the individual capsules get too far away from each other, those outside the active craft\u0027s physics bubble will be deleted.
