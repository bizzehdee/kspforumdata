I open the goo container when I leave the pad high in the upper atmo. I close it and proceed on to almost orbit... I open the goo again and..I cant use it? or it erases the last data I took I really don\u0027t get how the science is supposed to work I tend to put 30 or so goo containers on my ship and open one at a time as I approach a new area or thing... but then I have to somehow get all that back to the surface because my modual will only hold one or two experiments?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E/sigh back to sandbox\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elove the game.

The materials bay behaves the same way, so if you want to take multiple samples on a single flight, just add more goo canisters. However, the other instruments (thermometer, barometer, seismometer, and gravimeter) can be used multiple times each, but still can only hold one result at a time. Kerbals can collect and store those experiments on EVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso don\u0027t forget crew and EVA reports (both transmit at 100% efficiency).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll agree that the way science is handled in some situations isn\u0027t very intuitive, and that can be discouraging to new career mode players.
