If so that\u0027s dead weight costing you delta-V, so go back to the SPH and remove some oxidizer from the tanks.

The engine layout is one nuke and 1 rapier, and this craft (provided you dont bring 2 tons of weapons with you), can get over 7000 dV in LKO (enough to land on laythe, bop, and pol in one go, and return to kerbin without any refueling).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, for a very basic SSTO (only gets to LKO with ~2 tons of cargo), is a (from front to back):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir intake (shock is best but the other 2 will work technically), mk1 inline cockpit, mk1-mk2 adaptor, the shorter of the 2 mk2 bomb bays, mk2-mk1 adaptor, rapier engine. Then add around 2-3 lift rating total of wings, and all the usual gear your need (wheels, solars/batteries/RTGs, RCS system and docking ports if you actually want to dock this, ect). This is a proven and reliable design, extermely simple, and low on part count/lag. Also, for fuel, drain half the oxy total from both tanks, so you should have 360 total LF, and ~220 OX left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor longer ranges, you will need ALOT more LFO in general, and that means scale up the fuel tanks. For conventional designs, one rapier can lift ~15 tons, and once in space TWR is not that critical, making nukes a very good interplanetary engine that doesnt actually use OX at all allowing some pure jet\u002Bnuke hybrids (ions moreso but im not that patient and they have greater limitations especially when you are trying to burn to outer planets where you are on the dark side of planet making solar panels worthless). Anyways, just check out the forum, there are many great designs for a variety of tasks, and there are even soem thready about specifics in terms of stuiff like best fuel ratios for different payloads, wing area, ect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-05T15:12:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2015 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T12:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is nolonger the case. 1.0 made jet engines eat 10 or so times the fuel, most of the time, you will eat 1/4 or so of the total fuel mass with just jets during ascent. \u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for the correction.
