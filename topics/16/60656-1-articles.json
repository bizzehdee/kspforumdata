Burn retrograde so that end of your trajectory points to your target; when to do it depends on your TWR, the less it is - the sooner you need to start or you may not have enough time to decelerate. Next step - kill horizontal velocity while keeping end of your trajectory at the same point. To do this, point \u0022higher\u0022 than retrograde (between retrograde and directly \u0022up\u0022) and start burning. This way you will lose your horizontal velocity less efficiently than 100% retrograde burn, but you\u0027ll also fall down slower. Idea is to find that sweet spot that will keep vertical velocity close to 0 and reduce horizontal velocity. If end of your trajectory points at the same spot and your horizontal speed is decreasing - you\u0027re doing it right. It\u0027s actually like hovering at same altitude while decreasing horizontal speed. Just don\u0027t get your vertical speed positive unless you need to correct trajectory - it\u0027ll be a waste of delta-v. As you\u0027ll get closer to landing zone, retrograde marker will move up (better to switch to surface mode). I prefer killing horizontal velocity a bit earlier rather than a bit later, this way it\u0027ll be easy to control descent. If you miss even a few hundred meters from your target you can alway make small burn to correct trajectory. To land softly, I usually keep vertical speed below 20 m/s at 200 m radar altitude, then 10 m/s at 100 m and decrease it to 1-3 m/s before touchdown, depending on surface flatness and lander stability (some builds allow rough landings while other may flip over).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T12:58:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mystique\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mystique\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHorizontal landing is efficient and useful but I did not find it very useful for landing at a precise spot.
