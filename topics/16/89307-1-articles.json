The simplest way is to design a combination of TWR and DeltaV. You always need a TWR greater than 1, but how much TWR and dV depends on the aerodynamics and how well you pilot. The SRBs destroying your craft is a bug caused by the ejection creating rotation, sepatrons often make this worse. The best non-mod way of working around it is to cut your engines before staging, wait for the SRB\u0027s to clear, then fire them again. That little bit of no engine activity won\u0027t hurt your ascent and if the SRB\u0027s hit the rocket while traveling at the same relative speed, there shouldn\u0027t be any damage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T18:11:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome general information about your designs would be helpful.

With the throttle set to give me a pad TWR of 2.0 my losses were: drag 1029 m/s, gravity 1048 m/s, and total 2077 m/s.

The current model is to add up all the drag values of all parts on the ship and create an artificial drag value. Of course if the part is behind another part, it\u0027s still counted where in the real world it would be aerodynamically shielded. This is kind of stupid. Lift is also done similarly, so you can stack wings ridiculously and they would count toward lift even if they weren\u0027t in the airflow.
