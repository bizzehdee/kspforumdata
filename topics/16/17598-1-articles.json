Then, turn over slowly so you are at about 45 degrees at 30km, and fully turned over by 50km or so. Once here, check your apoapsis. If you have done it perfectly (unlikely, hard to do), you should be just below apoapsis at this point with it rising with you. If it is far above you as is normal, cut your engine and wait for apoapsis. When you are about 10s below apoapsis as seen on map view, do a horizontal burn as dt described in order to bring your velocity to around 2300-2500m/s, and you are in orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy flying\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: What dt described works fine, it just wastes more fuel then the earlier turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote2: You should turn towards the 90 degree marker, as this is the direction of kerbins rotation and it gives you a couple hundred m/s boost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vespasianus","CreatedById":26881,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T14:56:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E3000-4000 metres?

Head for 90 degrees on the navigation ball for best results. In all honesty, you\u0027ll probably want to do your gravity turn a little earlier - I tend to start mine at 10,000 meters, but of course it depends on the craft. You want to be horizontal by the time you leave the atmosphere (just under 70,000m). Then, as stated - burn in the direction of the yellow circle, which should hopefully be at the horizon on the nav-ball at 90 degrees by this stage. Wait for your Periapsis to appear on the other side of Kerbin, and then watch it rise until it\u0027s out of atmosphere as well. Then, you\u0027ll have a nice, stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit - predictably beaten to it.
