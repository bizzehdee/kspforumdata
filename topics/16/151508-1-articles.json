I\u0027ve watched videos where the user seemed to have higher resolution movements than I have. For example, the rotate tool seems to have 5 degree steps in Fine mode and the move part tool still jumps a fair distance even with Shift depressed. Is there a way to increase that movement resolution or change the step settings so I can make smaller changes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-04T22:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you turn off angle snap you have smooth pixel-by-pixel control over the rotation and offset gizmos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
