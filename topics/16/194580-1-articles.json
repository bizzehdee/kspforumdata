the rocket has burned out and the speed reduced to under 300m/s (the extra drag reduces the max altitude from ~23km to ~21km).\u00A0 I only set the deploy altitude to max as it I wanted it to open and

and its neither the parachute nor when I\u0027m deploying it.\u00A0 Turns out, for such a short jump, I didn\u0027t bother using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, which means after reaching max altitude, it would roll over to flying nose first and produce less drag than coming down engine first.\u00A0 Trying this a few times shows that the speed difference is minimal, but apparently enough, because coming down nose first fails every time, engine first works every time (I did try deploying on the way up and down, max/default chute altitude,etc, and it always worked as long as the engine was at the bottom).\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThanks all for the replies and
