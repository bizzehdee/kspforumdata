In this case, they may not be too helpful, since they also require oxidizer. If this is an aircraft rather than a spacecraft, you probably don\u0027t wanna lug oxidizer around. Most engines have alternators though, and will recharge your batteries for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an aside, fuel cells/arrays can be turned on or off by right-clicking on them and activating/deactivating.
