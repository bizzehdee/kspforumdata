My hypothesis is resting position is saved but not spring compression, loading violently compresses the springs. Increasing spring strength raises the resting state recurring the impulse on load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your craft drops on load, reducing spring strength can help the landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless, be extremely weary of overdamping.

Or MKS Kolonization has a part called the Landing Stabilizer which is a landing leg with a toggle to attach craft to the ground, which more or less turns it into a piece of terrain. There are multiple parts in MKS that do this, but I always try to include a couple landing stabilizer legs so I don\u0027t forget to bring that ability along, and they also make pretty decent, wide landing legs even without that ability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI generally use wings instead of spring-based landing gear, simply because I\u0027ve had more than one craft clip through the ground and explode when I load them, which makes it very hard to do mining bases.
