At 100k, you are way above the atmosphere. All you need is a command module, fuel tank and a terrier at that attitude. Put one craft at the top. Add a decoupler or two clamp-o-trons under it and add you second ship underneath it.It is going to be kind of tall, so you might need some fins to keep it straight, but it should work...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
