So I don\u0027t have a huge amount of materials. But I have the hitchhiker module and the rockomax brand adapter/decoupler. Those are the only things I have that are wide (2.5m?). I also still have a 30 piece limit on my assembly building as I don\u0027t have the funds yet to expand it.\n\nIs it possible to get that safely up into orbit for tourist missions? Would be handy to check off a bunch at once."},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T14:12:37Z","Content":"Check the contracts.

I\u0027m playing on the 550-science tiers, but still use a 1.25m rocket like that if I just need Kerbals in low orbit, or a low-orbit rescue. You can even do Mun and Minmus with only 1.25m parts, though the rockets get pretty silly looking. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSounds like you have the fuel line unlocked, so google \u0022KSP asparagus staging\u0022. Building that way buys you considerable delta-v."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T06:05:28Z","Content":"Here is one that gets to LKO with plenty dV to spare.
