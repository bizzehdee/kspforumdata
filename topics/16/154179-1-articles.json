As you know, it already costs a lot... about 12000 credits for 1 science point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost contacts early in the game\u00A0have rewards less than 50,000, which will result in less than 12,000 getting deducted for the strategy. And since the money deducted from the contract (which is caused by the strategy) is less than 12,000 credits, I get no science points for that specific contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question is this: Does the money accumulate and once it reaches 12,000 it gets converted to 1 science point? Or do I lose the money forever?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DD_bwest","CreatedById":164906,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-29T21:16:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhile i don\u0027t \u00A0know the answer and dont wanna be dictating you how to play, \u00A0you are really better off with the money than the small amount of science itll give you. \u00A0youll need cash to upgrade all your buildings, and find that once your doing trips to the mun or minmus, 1 or 2 science points from your cash is peanuts compared what youll get from actual science data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-29T22:00:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^ ditto.
