How do you aerobrake going to Moho, Dres, and Eeloo?\n\nYOu\u0027re reading them wrong. The arrow above \u0022Moho Tranfer\u0022 does not mean you can aerobrake to Moho coming from Low Sun Orbit. It\u0027s saying that you COULD eliminate all of that fuel need by aerobraking if you were coming back from Low Sun Orbit to KERBIN.\n\nSo if you were in low Sun orbit, it takes 26,820 to raise your apoapsis to Kerbin\u0027s orbit. Then it takes 5150 to raise your periapsis to Moho\u0027s orbit, 670 more to raise it to Eve\u0027s orbit, and 90 more to raise it to Kerbin\u0027s orbit at which point you\u0027d be at the same orbit as Kerbin. However, once you get your apoapsis up to Kerbin\u0027s orbit, a smart and skillful player can actually hit Kerbin and erase that nearly 6,000 dV in a harrowing but completely safe aerobraking trajectory.\n\nPreferably straight down onto the Helipad on top of the VAB ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T16:35:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My main problem in KSP is the fuel, how do you calculate how much DV do you need to go where you want and back?\n\nThe simplest (if somewhat inaccurate, depending on how you fly) method is using one of the [many \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV maps](https://imgur.com/a/J1z0o) out there.

Most engines have different ISP values for these and will result in different amounts of DV depending on where you are.
