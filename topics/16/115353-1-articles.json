It\u0027s approximately circular with roughly the right semimajor axis, and is inclined to Eeloo\u0027s orbit by 0.0 degrees, but when I right-click on the telescope the game informs me that the telescope is misaligned with Eeloo. Is there anything I can do to get more information about how I can line things up more effectively?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you can lend.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T22:23:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 10:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nikolai**"},{"CreatedByName":"MoonMan22","CreatedById":78400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T01:13:39Z","Content":"Hi, I just recently watched\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_g-pyUgOds?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n, I think it will help.

(I was a little disappointed when Scott seemed to be flying to get to Eve\u0027s orbit, and I already have one of those doing its job rather nicely. When he went on to get inside Eve\u0027s orbit to start mapping Eve, I saw the wisdom of your words.) A circular orbit at Jool\u0027s distance from Kerbol is sometimes outside of Eeloo\u0027s orbit. Thankfully, I\u0027ve got a fair amount of fuel and a nuclear engine on the thing, so I\u0027ll try bringing it completely within Eeloo\u0027s orbit and seeing what happens when I have time."},{"CreatedByName":"Nikolai","CreatedById":23085,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T22:17:34Z","Content":"Update: That did the trick! The orbit is entirely within Eeloo\u0027s, and inclined to it at 0.0 degrees.\n\nI brought the periapsis inside Eeloo\u0027s orbit first, which caused the telescope to complain about misalignment with Jool. Then I pushed the apoapsis out even further (but still within Eeloo\u0027s orbit), and it started mapping Eeloo! Asteroids spotted!\n\nThank you so much for your help."},{"CreatedByName":"MoonMan22","CreatedById":78400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T14:37:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thank you so much for your help.\n\nYour Welcome!
