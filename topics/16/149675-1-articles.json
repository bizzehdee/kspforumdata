I use Terriers and Poodles unless there\u0027s a good reason to use something else (e.g. a design that requires radially-mounted engines, or a really small payload -- see below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nuclear engine is fantastic for big payloads and long distances (like sending a fully-stocked space station with lander and crew on an interplanetary mission), but for Mun/Minmus missions they\u0027re usually not worth it due to the mass and cost. Just use a Terrier or Poodle and pack a bit more fuel. (On interplanetary missions the TTW will be low, though, so your acceleration burn can easily last 15-20 minutes or so.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, don\u0027t neglect the small engines: the much lower mass makes up for the somewhat lower efficiency if you\u0027re not going very far. I use Sparks for light local crewed missions and Ants for probes/satellites -- you\u0027d be amazed at how far a minimal probe running on an Oscar and an Ant can go. I once used Sparks to return from Duna (I left my orbiter there and just flew the lander \u002B extra crew module back).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-12T11:20:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Terrier and Poodle are more mass efficient for trips under 2km/sec and a whole lot cheaper as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest,\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Slashy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-12T12:24:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLVN are useful for escape to Dres / Jool / Eeloo or Moho and/or big ships or when you need a lot of deltaV\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-12T14:39:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt depends on if you are going to be reusing the ship.
