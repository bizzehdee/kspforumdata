The insertion resulted in a wildly elliptical orbit, but it only cost me about\u00A0280 m/s. Then I take a look at what I can do out at the new apoapsis, and found that passing in front of Ike again would tighten the resulting orbit a lot, with the new apoapsis matching Ike\u0027s altitude, and only for a cost of 5 to 10 m/s. I imagine I could then tighten the orbit further for only a few m/s more at Duna periapsis, but didn\u0027t get a chance to investigate that yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to understand what I\u0027m seeing. I\u0027ve read about and watched a lot of gravity assist examples on YouTube, but that car jump video had a very clear and beneficial\u00A0example that I was then able to replicate. I remember that the assists are really directional changes at the body you\u0027re doing the assist at, but the new direction would instead\u00A0represent some delta-v difference relevant to the parent body. But I\u0027m wondering if a comparably simple rule would help me, something like, \u0022pass ahead of a moon to slow down, pass behind it to speed up.\u0022 At least in the two dimensions the typical orbital plane is in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-20T02:08:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222857176\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152308\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221479601316\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157121\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gordon Fecyk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Gordon Fecyk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022pass ahead of a moon to slow down, pass behind it to speed up.\u0022 At least in the two dimensions the typical orbital plane is in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup, that\u0027s it in a nutshell. If you come in tangential to the moon, and do a tight curve in front of it, you can lose up to twice that moon\u0027s orbital velocity. Passing behind it perpendicularly and coming out tangential can gain you up to twice the moon\u0027s orbital velocity. (But in reality 2x is an impossible ideal to achieve.)
