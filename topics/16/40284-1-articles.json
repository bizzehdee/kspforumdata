So does this mean that if I accidentally kill Jebediah because of a bad ship build, I can never play as him ever again? Or can I revert back to the launch and he will be back? Also, if I end a flight then are the astronauts lost as well? Or do they just appear in the next flight? I don\u0027t wanna lose my Jeb. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Aidan.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rosenkranz","CreatedById":57152,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T17:53:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell, you can\u0027t just end flight anymore. But if you haven\u0027t done a quick load since launch you should be able to revert back to the launch pad or VAB/SPH and just roleplay it as a premonition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you can\u0027t revert then they are lost.
