You still have to do the work yourself but it does help matters quite a bit.\u003Cp\u003EAnd if that\u0027s not good enough for you, apparently Mechjeb can do the job; I haven\u0027t tried this myself and others have reported it being a wasteful piece of crap when it comes to docking, but it may be worth a shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got bored with doing docking myself quite some time ago (though I don\u0027t have a problem with it, it just is one of the games aspects that I no longer find \u0022fun\u0022). MechJeb has two features I use a lot now for these - Rendevous planner, which will actually go and compute the Hohmann transfer to the target (and execute it, fine tuning the approach to whatever desired distance, although I usually kill the planner and fine tune the approach myself to put myself in correct docking position above/below the target), and the Docking Autopilot which actually docks the two targets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeither is particularly efficient if you just let MechJeb do the whole thing. Both are reasonably efficient if you do some of the set up work for them. For the Rendevous planner, I generally either establish a significantly lower orbit (~1/2 the orbit of the target ) or a significantly higher orbit (2x the orbit) - this keeps MechJeb from doing a burn to get to a higher orbit to change the periodicity of the orbit to get a Hohmann transfer orbit earlier. For the Docking autopilot, if you line up the ships as if you were doing the docking manually (N-S orientation of the desired docking ports), then do a small burn (either with the main engines or using the RCS) to get above/below the desired port), then engage the docking autopilot, I\u0027ve found that MechJeb doesn\u0027t waste much RCS at all (30t heavy landers dock at my space stations using only 20-30 units of RCS fuel, 120t\u002B heavy interplanetary ships dock only using 100-200 units - which for a really heavy and \u0022bendy\u0022 ship is actually probably less than I would use). It\u0027s when you use it without doing any alignment that MechJeb wastes tons of RCS getting into position, and chasing the docking port around the target (which is exactly what would happen if I tried to dock without doing any alignment prep as well).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
