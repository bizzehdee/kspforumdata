The problem I\u0027m having is that even though I click the appropiate kerbal\u0027s pod hatch, select the transfer option and get the option to transfer kerbals by selecting the target available part, the kerbal is not transfered. After trying many combinations of mouse clicks with mod button, alt, etc I had to cancel because it was neither closing nor transfering. I did it the normal way by EVA-ing the kerbal and moving him to the other part. I tried from a lander can MK1 to another one and from the lander cans to a Mobile Processing Lab. Neither worked as I could not select the target pod. So, what is the method to transfer crew?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-22T18:57:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2014 06:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by bakanando\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T03:53:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to transfer the crew the two pods have to be part of the same ship (Either built that way or through docking) This sounds like your problem. Secondly, you have to click the crew hatch, (I believe it is a left click) select transfer and then left click THE POD YOU ARE GOING TO (This sounds like your second problem.) Also, I believe these transfers take some period of time, they are not instantaneous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T06:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I\u0027ll have to try waiting after left click. I thought I had to (left) click on the target hatch/pod, but it didn\u0027t say wether it was a succesful selection or not. It didn\u0027t leave the selection menu so I thought it was not the appropiate mouse button/action. I will try again tomorrow.

I did manage to align all the ships together. Compared to docking, crew transfer is rocket science. Edit: The transfer selection is indeed done with left click. But I found a bug with the Portable Science Lab that doesn\u0027t let you transfer as easily when the lab is empty. When it has at least one crew it will work normally, but selection of the empty lab is random and had to click many times before I succesfully transfered a kerbal to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-22T19:00:41Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2014 07:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by bakanando\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
