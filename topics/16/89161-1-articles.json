Put some horizontal wings at the height you want the elevators, and attach the control surfaces to that. Or hook a pair of horizontal all-moving winglets (AV-R8\u0027s, canards) to the tailfin. Basically, build it as if it were a real plane. Control surfaces go along the trailing edge of wings, not anywhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a poke through the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbodyne \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003Ethread and look at the screenshots.
