I am sure that the docks have been coupling properly and I have repeated the procedure numerous times. If it helps when I right click on the Clamp it say Status: locked, but does not give me the option to decouple. I have been playing for a while but have never undergone a long term docking project so the problem might be something stupidly simple. Anyone know whats up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBaz\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nasakev","CreatedById":72681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T14:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any pictures of the two docking ports?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crater","CreatedById":48907,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T15:06:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStatus: locked means that the animation on the part is not running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any chance that some protruding parts of the two vessels are touching, and preventing the docking from being completed?
