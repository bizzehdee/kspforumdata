To get an equatorial orbit of Kerbin, launch EXACTLY east from the launch pad (doing an otherwise decent gravity turn) and once in orbit, target Mun and see how you didn\u0027t actually launch EXACTLY east because your An and Dn will not be 0. Don\u0027t worry, they never are. Hopefully, however, they are close to 0. Say, less than 2 degrees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make them be 0, burn north at your Dn or South at your An. Do it slowly, and only until they are actually 0. When they flip, they\u0027re probably there. Use maneuver nodes for more precision and less headache.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, when you eject to Mun, do it with ONLY prograde thrust. Depending on how close to 0 your An and Dn actually are, your Mun encounter will be more or less perfectly equatorial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE: This isn\u0027t particularly efficient but it\u0027s not particularly INefficient if you start with a good launch. If your launch is like 10 degrees tilted to Mun or something, though, that burn at An or Dn is going to start getting expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE 2: This only works for Mun. You basically can\u0027t just nail an equatorial encounter with any other body without a ton of math and precision that is - frankly - not worth it unless you want to challenge yourself to do so. See this for a challenge I made with Minmus and some of the difficulties doing something that sounds like it\u0027d be simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1223116237\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173858-the-equatorial-minmus-challenge/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:224px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE 3: It\u0027s almost always easier to just fix your orbit once you\u0027re at the world you\u0027re orbiting, and it\u0027s also almost always easier to just give up the ghost and not worry TOO much how equatorial your orbits are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-10T18:38:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2018 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-10T21:35:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-11T06:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, if you have time, you can always set yourself in very eccentric (or simpler: very high) orbit once you get an encounter, and change inclination to 0 at the highest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-11T06:37:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2018 06:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by The Aziz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-11T18:42:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven differences in inclination\u00A0to most worlds and the accuracy needed over long distances, Mun is the only place where you might be able to do this consistently.
