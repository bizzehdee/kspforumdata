I don\u0027t enjoy heat management, and would rather not deal with it at all. I liked the way it was handled in 0.90, however unrealistic it may have been.\n\nNot looking to discuss *why* I want it this way (it\u0027s a video game: everyone enjoys it differently), but rather for solutions.\n\nAny ideas? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEdit: Changed title to better reflect question\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T18:42:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 06:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam\\_Jones**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T18:33:01Z","Content":"As far as I know engine heating has been in the game for a long time.

I\u0027m not a fan of the almost-invisible bars that appear over the parts, or how they in no way match the heat gauges next to the fuel gauges.\n\nI don\u0027t mind editing cfgs, btw"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
