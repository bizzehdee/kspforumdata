I recently managed to land a refueling craft within 50m of a lander but I had to \u0022Armstrong\u0022 it in. Best way I can describe it is to make a node that would show you impacting on the opposite side of the target, burn, then make a normal decent but focus more on killing your horizontal velocity early so that you come in above the target, then coming down slower than you normally would in order to make corrections. Every body is different so it\u0027ll take practice. Always pack along some extra delta-V if you\u0027re planning for maneuvers like that, and remember that you have quicksave available to practice with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T05:38:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a general rule, I find the steeper your approach (the closer to strait down you come), the easier it is to make adjustments, so I would suggest changing your approach to overshoot your target by a bit, so that you can cancel out most of your lateral velocity while still a few km above the surface. This makes it easier to cancel out your lateral velocity while actually ending up over your target (use the mapview, you should be able to get a feel for it on the way down), and then you have some time to fine tune your final approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T07:25:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease consider carefully where you place new threads, this one was in the wrong subforum. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064-Community-Rules-October-27th-2013\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERule 2.4 is in effect\u003C/a\u003E, repeated offences may lead to infractions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThread moved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T22:47:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPractice._\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T00:44:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet the ship on an orbit going above your target site.
