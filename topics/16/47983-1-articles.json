I\u0027ve searched youtube, google and this forum, everything i\u0027ve found relates to things i haven\u0027t even had the opportunity to try yet. So as i figure it out i will edit this post into a tutorial for posterity-sake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plugged in the controller, installed the driver, and cant figure out what to do from there. trying to map it in ksp but absolutely nothing happens. I understand some people use a 3rd-party program to help with this, but others say it isn\u0027t necessary, that the controller more or less works (with a few bugs) on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is also my first time trying to use the controller for a pc game so it\u0027s likely my problem is with the device and not the game. could anybody be bothered to write a brief walkthrough for how to get the controller up and running?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eupdate: i following these instructions \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003Ca href=\u0022http://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/pc-games/xbox-controller-for-windows-setup#84e73a6c06984936ac9ffba26abd1ff7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/pc-games/xbox-controller-for-windows-setup#84e73a6c06984936ac9ffba26abd1ff7\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edown at step 3 when i run joy.cpl my controller doesn\u0027t show up\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-11T20:50:10Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2013 08:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Zacharee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eupdate\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pebble_garden","CreatedById":30150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T14:21:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI assume you have a wired controller? You mentioned plugging it in. I\u0027ve read people have more trouble getting the wireless controllers to work, because the recharging base it comes with isn\u0027t a wireless receiver, you need another bit of hardware for that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here\u0027s how you get KSP to work with a properly working controller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. From the main menu, go to \u003Cstrong\u003ESettings\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. At the top of the Settings screen, click \u003Cstrong\u003EInput\u003C/strong\u003E. You\u0027ll see a sub-screen called \u003Cstrong\u003ECONTROL MAPPING\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Click on the \u003Cstrong\u003EStaging\u003C/strong\u003E tab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. On the right half of the Staging screen, you\u0027ll see an area called \u003Cstrong\u003EAxis Bindings\u003C/strong\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Click on the button for \u003Cstrong\u003EPitch Axis\u003C/strong\u003E and move the left thumbstick up/down. It should assign that axis to pitch. Not sure if pushing up or down first matters, but there\u0027s an \u003Cstrong\u003EInvert\u003C/strong\u003E button if you want it the other way around after testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.
