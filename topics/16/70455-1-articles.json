The turbojets are much better at high altitude and taking this into account you would normally get much better fuel economy overall per km traveled since you\u0027ll be travelling about 3 or 4 times faster at 25km than you would at 5km so best to use turbojets even for little jaunts around kerbin \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you wanted to be really really economical during in atmosphere flights, have a couple of turbojets and a couple of standard jets running off the same fuel tanks, and run the standards during takeoff and climbing/landing, and then once you hit 12km switch out to the turbos, you might be carrying an extra 2 ton around with you but overall i find it still more efficient and since they\u0027re all breathe the same air you only need the same amount of intakes..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T11:19:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBesides higher thrust and fuel consumption (as noted) they are slighly heavier, which may be a factor for center of mass depending on how small your margin is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are fairly swapable.
