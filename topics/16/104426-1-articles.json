I am losing more than a 30% I think.\n\nWhen you say SSTO do you mean a SSTO rocket, or a spaceplane?\n\nThat is roughly what I\u0027d expect, if you did not account for gravity and especially drag losses. Also, engines have worse ISP the lower you are in the atmoshpere.\n\nJust think about it like this, to get to LKO you need roughly 4500 m/s of dV if I remember correctly (I don\u0027t use stock aero so I\u0027m not sure) however, orbital velocity in LKO is only ~2km/s.\n\n--\u003E ~50% losses\n\nAll of this depends largely on how efficient your staging is, and more importantly your ascent profile. As soon as you exceed terminal velocity your drag losses go through the roof. If your design is suboptimal [to low L/D] and you have to reach very high speeds while still fairly low in the atmosphere you will loose even more due to drag.\n\nIf you can turn off engines and still have enough thrust you have too many engines, they way a lot and if you are not running them at 100% thrust, some fraction (depending on thrust levels) is dead weight which means more drag and more gravity losses.\n\nHope this helps a little, if not it would help us help you if you could give us some more info about your ascent profile."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T19:52:19Z","Content":"@TheXRuler: He\u0027s using Realism Overhaul. Based on the dV numbers he\u0027s quoting, that also includes FAR and Real Solar System. So he needs ~10 km/s dV into low Earth orbit - by kerosene engine numbers - out of which about a quarter will be lost.\n\n@jrodriguez: is that 12.5 km/s dV just vacuum dV, or atmospheric? If you\u0027re running with pure hydrogen engines, you\u0027re going to have high atmospheric losses, because atmospheric performance of hydrogen engines is very bad. They go from 450s Isp down to 350s or something, whereas a kerosene engine would only drop from 330s to 300s or thereabouts.\n\nAs a result, your vacuum dV number with kerosene engines is a close enough approximation that you can handwave the lower atmospheric Isp away and still make it to orbit, but with hydrogen engines the vacuum dV number is in no way, shape or form usable as a number for planning ascents out of an atmosphere.\n\nConsidering how close you are to orbital velocity - you should need about 7500 m/s, and you make 6900 - I wager that a large chunk of your \u0022missing\u0022 dV is simply lost because your engines have so much Isp loss at liftoff. A good indicator for this: most of your dV disappears early on, while late in the flight you pretty much get what you think you should get. By then, the atmosphere is gone and your hydrogen engines run at full efficiency.\n\nThis is, incidentally, why pure hydrogen rockets are very unpopular IRL. In fact, there\u0027s only one single pure hydrogen rocket that\u0027s flying right now: the Delta IV Heavy. And even the launch provider itself calls it overpriced and inefficient and says that they will never repeat that particular experiment. The rocket only still flies today because there\u0027s no alternative to replace it with. All other hydrogen rockets have solid rocket boosters that do the majority of the lifting off the pad (Space Shuttle, Ariane 5, Delta IV medium, H-IIA etc). The famous Saturn V was all hydrogen... except the first stage, which was kerosene in order to give it a kick into the regions were hydrogen was efficient."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T19:55:35Z","Content":"Oh, I wasn\u0027t aware that RO uses RSS.

With that kind of atmospheric dV you should be set, technically.\n\nIf your dV is evaporating at the end of ascent... my first impulse would be to say that one or more of the engines you\u0027re running at that point is occluded by something and is not generating thrust, only consuming fuel. You say that you start with all engines running and then turn them off one by one to maintain acceleration. If you have at least 2 still running by the time you run out of duel, then one of them might not be generating thrust. That would also explain why the effect becomes more pronounced the further you go up, because you keep deactivating working engines yet the occluded one keeps running.\n\nEasily confirmed by hyperediting the craft into orbit and checking each engine individually for correct thrust output.\n\nOf course, if you\u0027re only on one engine at that point then you shouldn\u0027t be accelerating at all anymore, and from your reports you\u0027re still getting some sort of thrust. In that case I got nothin\u0027.
