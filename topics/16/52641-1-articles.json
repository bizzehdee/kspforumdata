However, I can currently only visit one or two biomes without having to orbit and refuel (though I haven\u0027t tried a design with a nuclear engine). For Kerbin, I can usually only do one biome per launch because the atmosphere makes rocket launching so fuel-intensive (I haven\u0027t tried high-altitude trajectories with jet engines yet). For Duna, in getting from the middle of the planet to the poles, I\u0027ve got a ship that does an orbital rendezvous for refuel, but the fuel intensity of polarizing the orbit usually means I can\u0027t launch, de-polarize, then rendezvous again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) (Kerbin only).

For instance, you might point your rover north, accelerate to 15 m/s, then \u0022Hop\u0022 an hour into the future, effectively moving your rover 900m north. It would have to adjust for altitude changes and a confirmation option would be nice (\u0022There\u0027s ocean/a cliff here, are you sure?), but I don\u0027t feel like that would be too \u0022cheaty\u0022 as it just replaces me holding down the \u0022W\u0022 key for an hour.
