It\u0027s a common one, and confuses many people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP calculates the drag of a rocket (in simpler terms) by how much it weighs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, we can conclude the answers to both of your questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1: Putting a rocket inside another rocket does not reduce drag, due to the fact it would weigh the same as a rocket attached to another rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2: Yes, as much sense as this doesn\u0027t make, having a nosecone creates more drag.

All parts contribute to drag no matter the location. As best I\u0027m aware, the force on a given part is .0049 * pressure(in atm) * Cd(as seen in the VAB) * mass(yes, really!) * v^2. The nosecone does add to the overall drag on your rocket, but in a non-obvious way. Most parts have a drag of 0.2, so the nosecone experiences less. This will slightly raise your terminal velocity (not enough to matter usually), and move your center of drag. If the nosecone is ahead of the center of mass, you\u0027ll get a slightly more stable rocket. If it\u0027s behind the CoM (say, on a booster), you\u0027re likely to see slightly reduced stability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T17:26:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly thing to add is that some people use extensive \u0027part clipping\u0027, as putting one object inside another is known, for aesthetics or to make artificially small vehicles.
