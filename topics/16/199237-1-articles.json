I want to say in old versions of the game, if you surface-attached something to the outside of a rocket and then clipped it fully inside, the aerodynamics would still register it as being exposed to the air. But newer versions of the game I believe that is no longer the case (someone please correct me if I am wrong).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
