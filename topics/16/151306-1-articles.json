If you wanted to lets say... re-create Juno where you have the spacecraft go around the Sun and encounter Earth again to boost yourself to Jool, it wouldn\u0027t work. There is not enough gravity to get you that far. Therefore if you want to use Duna which is scaled down massively, you\u0027re going to have to maybe do one or two or just get it right.

What I\u0027m saying is you\u0027re either going to have to timewarp before the mission to align the planets which could take decades or centuries in game or just go around the solar system until you get the encounter OR get a mod that does the calculations for you.
