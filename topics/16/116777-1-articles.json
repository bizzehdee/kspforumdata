Try keeping the rocket\u0027s orientation near the prograde vector in the first 10-20 km of atmosphere. Adding fins to the bottom of the rocket helps too.\n\nAlso, start your gravity turn right after leaving the launchpad so that you don\u0027t have to turn over to the horizon more aggressively later on. Turning over 5 degrees is good enough.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T01:02:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 01:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rthsom**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T01:21:19Z","Content":"Given a launch TWR of 1.4, I usually turn 5 degrees at 50 m/s, then hold that alignment till prograde catches up and turn SAS off ... it usually works fairly well."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T08:54:19Z","Content":"an alternative after the initial tilt is to keep SAS at prograde instead of stability.
