Done several tests following scientific method using controls and varying spring strength and damper strength, but I can only make the bounce take longer to hit or make it a little shallower, but it is always there. Starting to worry that my beauty is never going to see glory. I\u0027ve seen other posts in regards to a more pervasive bounce at standstill and takeoff, but they\u0027re mostly older posts (\u0026gt;6 months). These such instances do not report the same symptoms and thus their solutions have not helped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlane is 2 rear gear (medium retractable) and 1 nose (medium retractable), weight 12 ton, Mk. 2 fuselage with twin panther engines. The\u00A0cockpit is BD Mk22 but I don\u0027t think that should be affecting the landing gear too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: turned the nose gear around 180\u00B0 and it is marginally more stable, also seeing some weird graphical glitches in the runway. I am aware that they updated the mesh for the runway, but the symptoms still show themselves on the grass. Current best results are max spring strength and much reduced dampers, but still requires very long and level approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-18T07:08:23Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2019 07:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by lococarl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMore testing\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-18T07:26:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo possibilities spring to mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) if you touch nose-wheel first, that pitches you up, and then the wings catch more air and bounce you up.\u00A0 Real aircraft do this and it can be very embarrassing.\u00A0 You have to slow down enough that you are pitched up enough that the main wheels touch before the nose wheel, but probably you knew that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) if you touch main-wheels first, and then the airplane pitches down, and then the nose-gear compresses \u003Cu\u003Efully\u003C/u\u003E, there is a bug (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/20682\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E20682\u003C/a\u003E, some workarounds mentioned at the link)\u00A0where the strut kicks back unrealistically hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lococarl","CreatedById":170574,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-18T07:46:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I am aware of number 1 and that was partially the case some times, but I thank you very much for number 2. I guess my plane is a bit heavy for the nose gear I\u0027m using? Maxed out both springs and dampers and fully expected it to handle like it was a solid rod and bounce back even worse but it prevented full compression and no kickback occurred. Problem solved.
