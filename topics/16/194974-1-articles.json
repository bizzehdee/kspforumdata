I\u0027m afraid you are simply coming in with that much of a difference in velocity that you must cancel out. This typically indicates that you have not flown a \u003Cem\u003EHohmann transfer\u003C/em\u003E, but rather something else. Either you launched well out of the transfer window, or you plotted a \u003Cem\u003Ehigh energy transfer\u003C/em\u003E (burning really hard when leaving Kerbin to make the trip as short as possible).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might however be able to at least salvage your mission to the point of being able to insert into orbit and later return to Kerbin. Because luckily, Duna has an atmosphere. That means you can \u003Cem\u003Eaerobrake\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake a maneuver node just a few minutes ahead of where your ship is right now, and play with the radial and normal sliders to try and move your PE closer to Duna. The atmosphere ends at 50km, so you want it to be closer than that. Of course, depending on how sturdy your ship is, and how insanely fast you come screaming past Duna, your ship may be torn apart by shock heating. So, after you have executed your maneuver to push the periapsis into the atmosphere, press F5 to quicksave. Now timewarp to your arrival and observe what happens. If you get torn apart, go a little higher next try. If you feel like you have ample breathing room, try going deeper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should probably align retrograde and fire your engines even while aerobraking. If you have to bleed off two km/s just to capture, a single aerobraking pass without engine support will not do it, especially if your craft is fragile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour goal should be to capture into any form of orbit.

Additional aerobraking passes will let you bring that down without spending any fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that even a slight grazing of the atmosphere at these kinds of speeds is liable to rip off any extended antennas and non-fixed solar panels. If this would result in a loss of mission... well. You\u0027re kinda screwed. Your best bet in that scenario would be to not insert into orbit, but rather to burn at periapsis so that you end up in a solar orbit from which you can later get a Kerbin encounter, so at least you can return home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-23T08:00:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2020 08:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-23T07:51:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223807866\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194974\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221592896313\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205166\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rainshine\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n39 minutes ago, Rainshine said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I missing something, or did I just pick an atrocious angle to enter at; and if so, how should I adjust for my next missions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour orbit around the sun is crossing to Duna\u0027s orbit at quite some angle, instead of just coming up to it. Because of that you enter Duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E at quite some speed that you then need to counteract in order to brake into a Duna orbit. So there is at least a good portion of the latter in there. Another issue might be that your PE around Duna is quite high. I can be that you actually need less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to capture around Duna with a lower PE.
