If i place the decoupler in the bay first, then i couldnt attach my payload., i had to build the payload and decoupler on a separate sacrificial external beam and then transfer the whole assembly into the bay. This seems like a hard work for such a simple task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you guys have any tips for mounting payloads in the Cargo bays of the B9 mod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bacterius","CreatedById":69384,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T12:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can put a docking port inside the cargo bay (top or bottom, but not both afaik) using part clipping.
