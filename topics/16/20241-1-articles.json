I know the most efficient way to do this is as soon as possible. But its hard to tell whether I have over or undershot the planets SOI. I haven\u0027t achieved an encounter before the correction burn previously, I always need to correct. How do I figure out which way to burn without waiting a while to eyeball it, and thus hurting my delta-v budget. Alternatively, is there a formula that can tell me where Duna will be at the end of my transfer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: Is it more efficient to burn towards/away from the sun, or just burn prograde/retrograde to curve my trajectory outward or inward?(during correction burns)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
