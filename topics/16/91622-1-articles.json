Because whenever I tried it, in both Kerbin and Space, it REALLY goes off course without me doing anything.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve even turned off gimballing and strutted the whole ship and experimented without docking ports. But whenever an engine is in front of a module, it swerves after a few seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and I\u0027m curious as to what mod that huge structure in the middle is from? And the huge ASAS discs?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t have any difficulty keeping things on course once I\u0027d turned the gimbals off on all four engines, but I did have to do it individually on each one. \u003Cstrong\u003EHowever\u003C/strong\u003E I did just remember a problem I had when prototyping the vessel, which was accidentally clipping one of the hexagonal fuel tanks (45t when full) entirely inside another one so that the CoM was decidedly out of place. I had been carefully placing things with symmetry so didn\u0027t check the CoM before launching and could only work out what the problem was after I dismantled the ship and found an extra fuel tank somewhere it shouldn\u0027t have been. You\u0027ve been flipping and scaling stuff a fair bit, from the look of things, maybe you\u0027ve got something extra clipped inside part of the craft. Do any parts flicker weirdly when you mouse over them in the VAB?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe framework\u0027s from Freight Transportation Technologies, another of Roverdude\u0027s mods. The ASAS discs are actually 3.75m discs from Modular Rocket Systems which have been tweakscaled to 5m. A bit of a cheat perhaps, but I\u0027d spent a very long time on trying to get the ship working thanks to the above problem and so as soon as it was working OK I said \u0022done!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
