You have a limited amount of time before your plane accumulates more heat than it can hold. During that time, you need to stop being so fast that you generate shock heating.\n\nTherefore, avoid the \u0022Mars Atmosphere Dilemma\u0022 you get when staying high up: too little air to slow down, but still enough air to fry you.\n\nIf you don\u0027t have the magic airbrakes available yet:\n\n- Do a steeper reentry, but be careful... you do eventually need to level off to slow down at some point, before going all the way down, or you will be melted.\n\n- Pancake! Flip your biggest, broadest barn door profile into the airstream as long as you can hold it stable. The Space Shuttle did this for most of its reentry.\n\n- After you can no longer pancake, fly S-turns back and forth. This creates drag and costs a lot of speed.

I employ a combination of the suggested techniques - airbrakes, high AoA and S-turns - on most of my craft during the re-entry process; my Vulture 7 spaceplane usually doesn\u0027t even display heating bars during re-entry as a rule, which the OP should take as a measure of the effectiveness of these techniques."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T18:41:08Z","Content":"Enter with a shallow kobra manuver.\n\nI have yet to pass 60% crtical temperature (on radial batteries in a cargo bay) with reentry on a 100x45 orbit and a 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 over the horizon.

I lowered periapsis to about 10km (which is maybe lower than necessary but I figured I\u0027d try for a steep reentry) then entered the atmosphere belly facing retrograde. Nothing overheated (or showed bars) or took any damage and I braked from about 2500m/s to pretty much whichever speed I felt like gliding at. For this maneuver I kept RCS on, and I had a pair of one-way RCS nozzles on the top and bottom of the nose specifically for forced attitude control in situations like this where I need to defy the atmosphere a bit. Also had 4-way RCS nozzles on the wingtips.\n\nI was able to reignite airbreathing engines by dropping to safe speed then turning towards prograde to get airflow, but only needed this if I wanted precision landing site selection as I did gliding landings, usually touching down at under 40m/s and braking to a full stop well within runway lengths.\n\nDon\u0027t know if that\u0027s the best way, but spaceplane part descriptions are explicit about their use for reentry shielding so that\u0027s exactly how I employed them. Though come to think of it, I had monoprop tanks and fuel lines down under the wings and none of that overheated either. I should also point out that I am an awful pilot but do it all by hand using a keyboard so I don\u0027t think the maneuver can be THAT hard to execute, FWIW."},{"CreatedByName":"DCWarHound","CreatedById":135609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T08:36:26Z","Content":"Thanks for the help everyone.\n\nI tried quite a few times and failed most of them,air-brakes helped lots as well as S turning."},{"CreatedByName":"Thorbard","CreatedById":59754,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T18:19:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 21/07/2015 at 7:41 PM, ajburges said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Enter with a shallow kobra manuver.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have yet to pass 60% crtical temperature (on radial batteries in a cargo bay) with reentry on a 100x45 orbit and a 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 over the horizon.

Whilst I have found I can achieve better transonic drag/easier passing through the sound barrier on a well tuned design, I\u0027ve also had much higher landing speeds with FAR than stock Aero - two or three times higher.   So I am wondering if FAR is reducing the lift you get on re-entry ?\n\nIn the stock game,  I took this mark 1 spaceplane from a 75 km orbit and retro burned to 30km periapse.    The mk1 cockpit has poor heat tolerance and the airliner wings are even worse.  It has also only just completed it\u0027s ascent half an orbit ago so wasn\u0027t fully cooled down.   We came close to parts overheating on re-entry but did not actually blow up.   Also, the minimum altitude reached was about 42 km, despite the 30km periapsis.  After that the lift from the enormous wings started sending us back up again.\n\nTo me it\u0027s all about the lift, and not coming in too aggressively with a low periapse. (on spaceplanes i prefer to aim higher, like 40km )\n\nI am not convinced on S turns.  If you are generating lift, you want all that lift used to keep you UP and out of the thicker atmosphere where the heating gets worse, for as long as possible, giving you more time to slow down.   If you bank into a hard turn most of that lift is being diverted for going sideways, and you drop down earlier, reaching the thicker air while moving at a higher speed.\n\nMax lift is at 30 degrees AoA but given the difficulty holding an exact angle and the way it falls off quicker if you go over 30 than if you undershoot, you\u0027re better off aiming a little below.     If I\u0027m not in immediate danger of blowing up,  I use AoA to try controll my landing point.     If i\u0027m overshooting, i deliberately pitch up as hard as possible to increase drag.       If i think i might be coming up short,  i pitch down to less than degrees above prograde, where lift./drag ratio is better.    You drop initially but then your descent and deleration rate slow down, as you \u0027re at a better \u0022gliding speed\u0022.  Again though , this is all relating to stock aero.\n\n![20160423124153_1_zps8nppanbx.jpg](http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/20160423124153_1_zps8nppanbx.jpg)\n\n[https://kerbalx.com/AeroGav/whippynerv](https://kerbalx.com/AeroGav/whippynerv)"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T00:06:54Z","Content":"You might want to read this thread, on exactly this subject: \n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/136538-spaceplanes-in-11-how-to-re-enter/\u0026do=embed\u0026embedComment=2505067\u0026embedDo=findComment\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
