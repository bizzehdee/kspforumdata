Help to better understand the way to build an efficient, simple rocket. Help learning how to get said rocket into orbit (I can get into orbit... sometimes... very unreliable...), and perhaps even one day learn to get to Mun and beyond.\n\nThis is a video of myself describing my frustration. The video also has footage of a failed launch.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/veHukdI_KQ0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nAny help/criticism/tutelage is greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nSporks"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T15:38:49Z","Content":"Your first mistake is that you are going straight up to get to orbit. Orbit is all about horizontal velocity, not altitude. The only reason you need to go up at the beginning is to get out of the gooey atmosphere that\\\u0027s causing drag. Once you\\\u0027re out of the goo, the horizon is where you want to go.\n\nThe trick is to progressively start tilting eastward somewhere between 10-15000m so that you reach a 45\u00C2\u00B0 angle somewhere around 30000m. By the time you reach 60000m, you should be pretty horizontal and the atmosphere will be pretty much gone. Watch your Apoapsis and stop burning when it reaches your target altitude, regardless of your current altitude. Then, you just coast to your Apoapsis (all engines off), and then as you approach it, do a second burn, aiming towards your prograde marker (the yellow marker on the navball that you call \u0027direction of travel\u0027), to circularize your orbit.\n\nIt also looks like your second stage is slighty underpowered."},{"CreatedByName":"PlasticSporks","CreatedById":26350,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T15:46:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Your first mistake is that you are going straight up to get to orbit.

A bit of an update, about 20 minutes ago I think I did all the tips you said on accident, haha. I now have a craft orbiting Kerbal, preparing to do a munar burn.\n\nThanks for the help!"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T15:47:55Z","Content":"Try to make your rockets wider if you want them bigger.

That\\\u0027d make it easier to handle also, right?"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T15:57:36Z","Content":"Yes to all of that, but remember that if its too wide it may hit the tower.

Now... let\\\u0027s just see if I can land on Mun..."}]}
