I was recently playing a rather nice career mode save(named \u0027Career\u0027 because I lack creativity). In the save, I unlocked 2/3 of the tech tree, had a little over a million funds and about 80 science. Returning to the Space Center after a probe that had an Ike flyby and achieved orbit around Duna, I went into my Level 2 Astronaut Lounge and found out I couldn\u0027t hire anyone. The funds showing how much it would cost to hire someone were at \u00270000000.00\u0027 and nobody showed up in \u0027assigned\u0027 section of the roster, despite there being a space station in orbit with 5 Kerbals. Naturally, I exited the game and came back. It was still like that. So...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first re-booted my laptop, and then ran the save again. Still like that. So I made a copy of the save and I leveled up the Astronaut lounge(even though I only had 10 Kerbals out of my 12 limit). The lounge still would not hire. I deleted the save, re-loaded it(with the copied save). Still like that. Then I created some new saves. Perfectly normal behavior of \u0027Hiring\u0027 even in level 2 lounges. Then I checked the persistent file, but a) could not make sense of it, and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E found no problems. I went into the save and with the alt\u002Bf12 cheat button, brought up the roster log. Although I could see \u0027assigned\u0027 crew members through that, I couldn\u0027t hire anyone else. So I tried time warping a bit(I was trying anything at this point). Then, too change a roster, I deliberately exploded a plane and killed a Kerbal. Nothing I did could change the fact that I couldn\u0027t hire anyone. And then, the lounge stopped working. While I could enter, or update other buildings, I couldn\u0027t interact with the lounge. It was like the clicks weren\u0027t doing anything! And as a desperate measure, I brought up the last quicksave, which was the Duna probe entering Duna\u0027s SOI. However, despite the full battery charge, I could not turn the probe in any way!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah, I should probably mention I\u0027m not playing in Windows 64 bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I\u0027m playing another Career save but it\u0027s not as fun because I have to do everything over again.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is, does anyone know what could trigger this glitch, if it even is one? Is there a way to get out of this?
