Instead, they plunge steeply from the beach to the bottom of the abyssal plain, which averages like -1500m on Kerbin and exceeds -2000m in places on Laythe and Eve. This means that unless the Kethane is so close to shore that it probably comes up on land anyway, KAS-based drilling systems need ridiculously long cables with incredibly long spooling times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only real alternative is making a submarine \u0022lander\u0022 that takes the drills to the bottom. Unfortunately, there ain\u0027t any good choices there. The Hooligan Labs submarine mod was a non-starter because it imposed a -600m crush depth, too shallow for most submerged Kethane. And it hasn\u0027t been updated since 0.21 anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK the only other submarine mod out there, which HAS been updated to 0.23, is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24845-Boat-Parts-SubmarineParts-R4-NEW%21?highlight=boat\u002Bparts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInfiniteDice\u0027s R4 BoatParts\u003C/a\u003E. Its subs can reach the abyssal plain although they complain about it. The problem, however, is that it\u0027s very difficult to mount any parts on the sub parts except other sub parts, and they weren\u0027t ever intended to be taken to other planets anyway so aren\u0027t rocket-friendly. It could maybe be made to work at least on Kerbin but doesn\u0027t seem worth the trouble, and even if that happened, I don\u0027t see getting it to Laythe where the demand for underwater Kethane is the highest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wandering rocker4545","CreatedById":96702,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T01:48:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes and yes I\u0027ve tried a kethane mining sub with the same results hard to mount parts no impossible but tricky . The system I have with a barge type ship that drops the drill head into the water seemed like it would work except for the major bug I\u0027m experiencing . With my crafts spawning below the water when I switch crafts .the winches can be edited to have longer cables that was easy . But I just can\u0027t get past this bug maybe I will take boat parts out to see if it was a problem in mod I also thought it was the kore kraken. Either way I gotta keep trying .....arg.

The boat was a combination of FireSpitter parts and stock parts . And no catastrophic failures ! Got the drill to sink by even with a full ballast of water the drill popped back up to the surface lol .

Using a grapplinghook and a winch on the drill itself I was able to counter the upward buoyancy. Extending the winch on the drill a meters so it can grab the ocean floor as it is lowered to the bottom keeps the drill in place. Mini sub center sections to provide the ballast for sinkage and the delivery of the drill head can vary , I have made several differant boats and blimps to bring the drill to a kethane patch in Kerbins ocean for tests . These would be good interplanetary deployment vehicles as well . Each vehical has the capacity to refine and hold a decent amount of kethane . That in combination with a kethane transport vessel is my system . Now that this is complete I will post pictures to help out others with this challenge . This was all Jeb\u0027s idea by the way .\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
