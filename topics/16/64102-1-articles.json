I refer to it a lot, especially when I\u0027m trying to remember the name of the ship I was building the night before, looking a the part count on the auto-saved ship at the top of the list, and then scrolling down until I see the same part count and,,, yup that was it! Think I\u0027m mainly concerned with the accumulated tonnage as I\u0027m designing. Thanks so much for your quick response. Just one more thing, being kind of basic game player I\u0027m not really into mods that much, (however I am running the Kethane pack), which one of those mods do you think I\u0027d happiest with? I see by your join date that you\u0027re a \u0022veteran\u0022 so I would seriously consider your advice.

Like you HAVE to have a rocket and fuel tank in a stage for it to update the weight.

At least not until you add a fuel tank and a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the TWR numbers add up strangely when you start doing anything less that vanilla staging. Asparagus staging works well enough, but if you are firing say 8 SRB\u0027s along during the same stage as 8 LVT-45\u0027s, then KER can confuse you with the TWR and D/V numbers. I get around this by first separating them with decouplers to get the numbers to make sure it\u0027s what I think I want, then merging them and removing the decouplers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when you are trying to make very fine adjustments to horizontal speed it sometimes gives you really screwy numbers when you reach 0. For instance, if you were moving east at 1 m/s then adjusted to west just enough to give you -1 m/s it might read 645 m/s or something else that\u0027s equally absurd.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T04:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xcorps\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xcorps\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI really like KER, but it can be a bit finicky.
