The first is a landing gear issue; in order to take off, your plane must rotate around the rear landing gear. Think of that gear as a fulcrum, with the weight of your plane on one side and the downforce provided by your control surfaces on the other. If the gear are to close to the control surfaces and too far from the center of mass, you won\u0027t get enough torque to lift your nose off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is an aerodynamic stability issue. Your plane looks negatively stable, which means that once you manage to get your nose in the air, it wants to keep turning (basically, the plane wants to fly backwards). The solution to this is to move your center of lift so that it is behind your center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T17:03:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Center of Lift is to far forward.

Wings in KSP act like flat boards, you have to angle them against the wind to get any lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo deal with stability, you\u0027ll want your center of lift behind your center of mass. Also, try turning on precision control and have SAS on at all times (or almost all times). I can sometimes get away with the center of lift being a little bit ahead of the center of mass when I use precision controls and SAS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo deal with going fast enough to reach orbit, you\u0027ll probably want 8 or more ram air intakes, and not too much heavy rocket fuel (your rocket fuel payload looks excessive). Right now, drag is more or less proportional to mass, so that heavy rocket fuel adds a lot of drag that you don\u0027t need. You\u0027ll only need about 1/2 to 1/4 of that to achieve a stable orbit when you\u0027re going fast enough and high enough on jet engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the approach that I use is to get up to about 32K and build up speed. I carefully maintain my altitude at 32K until my speed is above 1,700 m/s, and preferably 2,200 m/s if I\u0027m still gaining speed at a reasonable pace. When I\u0027m going about as fast as I can go at 32K, I\u0027ll gently increase my altitude and I\u0027ll throttle down the engines when the oxygen reserve is low to avoid a flameout. Gradually, I\u0027ll get to higher altitudes and velocities and I\u0027ll end up on a trajectory that will take me briefly out of the atmosphere. I\u0027ll continue running my engines as long as I can to maintain my speed, and then I\u0027ll close my intakes and coast into orbit. I\u0027ll switch to the rocket engine and gently use it to maintain enough speed to reach an apoapsis of 100K or so. At the apoapsis, I\u0027ll gently burn into a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
