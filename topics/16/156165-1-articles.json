The thing that makes it complicated is that the size of the bubble depends on whether your ship is landed, flying, suborbital, or orbital. I also think it depends on the landed/flying/etc status of your target, but I\u0027m not sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, a physics bubble tends to be about 2km for historical reasons that are no longer really valid. So\u00A0I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s your problem. Your targets are outside your physics bubble, so they are invulnerable. Fortunately, NathanKell\u00A0recently made the size of the physics bubble editable, and it\u0027s very easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your main game directory, if you look at your physics.cfg file, at the very end are a bunch of VesselRange values.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Unload value should be bigger than the load value, which should be bigger than the pack value, which should be bigger than the unpack value. But the pack and unpack values are the important ones. Boost your flying and landed pack/unpack values into the 5 to 6 km range -- and I bet you\u0027ll be able to destroy your targets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFunky","CreatedById":128066,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-09T18:39:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you, you were right, but it turns out it was a combinsation of factors.\u00A0 BD Armory also lets you change physics range from in game, so I set it all the way up to 100km.\u00A0 I was very disappointed when I still couldn\u0027t blow anything up.\u00A0 Then I repositioned the guns so they had a less virtical and more spread out field of fire, and it worked like a charm.\u00A0 I also used \u0022guard moce\u0022 instead of trying to manually aim, and even with the guns range setting all the way up, they didn\u0027t seem to want to engage until I was closer than about 1.5km, but that also might have had to do with the field of fire again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks again for the advice on the physics bubble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-09T19:11:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurious if the rounds shoot are affected by gravity, in this case aiming higher to compensate the effect may be required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
