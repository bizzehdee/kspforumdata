It looks like an almost perfect gravity assist. My approach is almost directly solar-retrograde towards Eve, swings around really close and exits almost directly solar prograde. This is pretty close to the ideal gravity slingshot trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wait! Look at my resulting orbit (the red dashed line). It\u0027s half way to Moho. What\u0027s going on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s going on is a problem with conic draw mode zero. Mode zero lets me focus in on eve and actually see the intercept to fine tune it, which you can\u0027t do with *any* of the other modes. However, it shows the path I will take when Eve circles around to the intercept position! And the intercept position is almost 180 degrees around from where Eve is now (You can see it on the other side of Eve\u0027s orbit in the picture). So you have to flip the encounter trajectory around too, which means this is an almost perfect anti-assist!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a pretty big problem with draw mode zero. But with any other draw mode there\u0027s no way to zoom in on the encounter to see what is actually happening!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... anyone know a solution to this problem? I believe there are 5 draw modes in the game.... but I also believe none of them are actually useful. (Mode 3 is probably fine if you\u0027re just going to the Mun...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be really nice would be a picture-in-picture box that popped up when you had an encounter, and which you could drag around, showing a tight focus around any intercepts that are happening. Or at least, it would be nice if mode 0 showed your trajectory from the SOI of the target (as it does now) but drew the trajectory in the timeframe of the encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bjjxBry.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bjjxBry.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-26T13:06:05Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2013 01:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T13:32:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo solution for me, just some reference for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11322-Different-Conic-drawing-modes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11322-Different-Conic-drawing-modes\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemoricus","CreatedById":4141,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T13:49:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour problem is that it\u0027s patched conic mode 0.

You just must not forget the big picture because of small details. It\u0027s not enough to look at Eve and perfect your slingshot there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy approach is: get the maneuver to a slingshot. Any slingshot. Then click on the periapsis to have it highlighted all the time and zoom out. From now on watch your Eve periapsis to not drop too low, but instead of nudging trajectory around Eve, nudge the resulting trajectory after escaping from Eve. Because that\u0027s what you need to bring you where you want to be. The slingshot gives you unbelievable freedom in setting up that orbit for a price of tenths of m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the maneuver is too sensitive and you have problems doing that with the maneuver node, execute that maneuver and fine tune the real trajectory with RCS. It\u0027s no problem to switch the trajectory to the other side of Eve with just RCS if you\u0027re half an orbit away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and one more small detail: make sure to cross SOIs at lowest possible time warp (x5 is the best, better even than x1). Crossing SOI at high time warp may destroy your carefully prepared maneuver completely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-26T14:19:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2013 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T14:23:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found that by selecting Kerbol (or sometimes Moho) I can get my mode-3 approach on the screen and zoomed in enough to see what\u0027s going on.

That\u0027s what allows you to zoom in on it. That part is good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that the plot of your trajectory through that SOI is not rotated to account for the orbit of the planet around the sun. If the mode 0 patch looks like solar retrogtade, but the planet is currently 180 degrees away from where you will intercept it, the trajectory is actually solar prograde (because the direction of the target will have changed 180 degrees). If it\u0027s showing your trajectory relative to the current position of the target, it should ALSO show it relative to the current DIRECTION of the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit, In case that\u0027s still not clear: In my image, it looks like I will enter the SOI from the inside of the Eve\u0027s orbit (lower solar altitude) and exit on the outside (higher solar orbit).
