I had a contract to put a base on the Mun and another to land 4 tourists on the Mun. I figured I would just kill two birds with one stone and land the tourists with the base. Since the base was meant to be \u0027permanent\u0027 I only sent enough fuel to get it down, planning to just send a regular lander down to collect everyone and take them home. Only problem - tourists can\u0027t EVA. Oops. Now I have to build something that can land next to the base, roll over, dock, and then reorbit.
