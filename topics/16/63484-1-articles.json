However, one issue keeps biting me in the ass. After the outermost fuel tanks have been emptied (including the hidden one in the back), the fuel drainage of the tanks becomes asymmetric, making it quite dangerous for every kerbonaut inside it, since it starts pulling to the right at 25 KM while travelling at 1.7km/s. I have basically tried everything, including taking the entire craft apart looking for errant fuel lines. I hoped someone here may be able to find the fault in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink to craft file: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/zXd2Yn03\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/zXd2Yn03\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-17T15:58:58Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2014 03:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rodyle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T14:08:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay...so from your craft file, it looks like you\u0027ve got an interplanetary spaceplane SSTO design (gotta be specific - you CAN make single-stage rockets, and those ARE SSTOs). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarts pulling to the right at 25,000 meters going 1700 kps....what\u0027s your IntakeAir status at that level?

So yeah, I\u0027m working over the operational limit of the engines. I shut down engines whenever a flame-out is imminent, or at least throttle down until it\u0027s no longer an issue. Sure, I sometimes get some pull to either side because of this, but this is not the issue. The issue is actually what I explained. After the outer tanks are emptied, the engines start to drain the fuel assymetrically, which slightly offsets the centre of mass, which produces as pull to the right which becomes stronger the longer I fly the plane, since the CoM offset becomes more pronounced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Album to show the issue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/O2mrn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

When you have an odd number of engines firing, and the fuel rules, your odd engine is causing your plane to draw fuel from the right inboard and hidden MK1 tanks and leaving your left inboard tank untouched (or less touched as the case may be). You can shut down this center engine or lock out the hidden MK1 tank as a mid-term solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might need to rework your fuel lines a little so they aren\u0027t feeding backward and forward so much.
