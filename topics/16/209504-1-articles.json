In you case, you will probably want to attach something like a cubic octagonal strut on the glider and make it the root part (the re-root tool is near the top left of your screen). Now when you merge the glider to the plane, you can attach one of the free nodes on the cubic octagonal strut to the plane. You\u0027ll probably want to attach the glider to decoupler on the plane so you can separate the two. Once the two crafts are attached, you can then use the offset tool (also on the top left) to move the glider where you want it. Attach a strut between the glider and plane if you want it to look like a tow cable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-26T04:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204997-echo__3/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022204997\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204997-echo__3/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Echo__3\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0said, the root part of the \u0027merged\u0027 craft is the only part which can connect to the other craft. \u00A0So you will need to become familiar with the Re-Root tool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have found that joining two crafts via Radial attachment is more difficult than Axial attachment. \u00A0Unfortunately when trying to merge a plane to another plane, radial attachment is usually the method that you want. \u00A0It\u0027s difficult, but absolutely possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing to consider is that at some point you will (probably) want to separate the two vessels. \u00A0That normally involves using docking ports or decouplers. \u00A0Setting the Root part to be a decoupler or docking port causes additional frustration. \u00A0Again, it is possible!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have additional questions, come back here with them. \u00A0Screenshots showing the particular difficulty you are having will greatly help the community to diagnose the issue and provide assistance. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, if you\u0027re persistent, you can accomplish your goal. \u00A0If I can do it, you can! \u00A0(I\u0027m not that good with computers...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
