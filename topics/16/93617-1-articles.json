I have also had the same issue if i try and have a TRI-1190C MK1 Stack on both ends of a series of fuel tanks. On one side it has all three tanks connected but on the other usually one or (maybe 1/3 of the time) two are connected. I am not sure if i am doing something wrong when building them. With the Not-Rockomax i have tried going in a \u0022circle\u0022 to connect and building the square except on one corner and then tried to put the last piece in. I have a picture below to show an example of what I mean. Any suggestions or ideas would be helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5ggiuHP.png\u0022 alt=\u00225ggiuHP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-19T12:51:30Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2014 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Brookstone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T10:28:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a limitation of the Unity engine that KSP is built upon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft you build are stored in a tree format. That means there is one \u0022root\u0022 part, and all other parts \u0022branch off\u0022 from there. And you can only go further up the tree, along each individual branch. Trying to loop back to an earlier part of the same branch is forbidden, as is trying to connect two unrelated branches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is however a special, custom-coded part that does not use the branch structure and thus can attach itself to any two spots you want it to... you guessed it, it\u0027s the strut. The nice thing is, struts can have a length of zero and they till work. So you can substitute a strut where there is no node conenction (or surface attachment) possible. Just set the parts a little apart from each other, usually done by interposing a temporary part somewhere. Then strut one to the other, remove the temporary spacing part and connect the assembly together as you want it. The strut will hold your I-beam against the hub node even with no actual part connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(This has limits, but when in doubt...
