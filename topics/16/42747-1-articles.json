I\u0027ve never been able to successfully remove landing gear from the default key. It looks like it works when you look at the configuration in the VAB, but then all the legs deploy anyway when I press \u0022G\u0022. It\u0027s not a huge thing, but it means mechjeb-assisted landings with complex payloads will hilariously tear themselves apart when all the neatly packed-away landing gear go off at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also means even if you don\u0027t use mechjeb, and forget to use your custom-key-mapped landing gear and press \u0022G\u0022, the same thing occurs.
