Whatever you may have read, it\u0027s not possible to set the current reference body as target in stock KSP. It\u0027s not even possible to find out what your inclination is, let alone where the AN/DN are. Where there is something orbiting the same body on an equatorial plane already, such as Mun does around Kerbin, using that is simple and gives all the information you need. Since Gilly is on an inclined orbit around Eve it\u0027s not as useful, but still the most useful thing the game itself provides.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flashcactus","CreatedById":103335,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T17:59:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rynak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rynak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks!
