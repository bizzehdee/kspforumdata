I hated the various ideas that involved getting to orbit empty just to send up refuellers and am working something that takes a bit of building in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see below, I\u0027ve managed to get 2 x jumbo tanks with 3 x nuclear engines into a 150K orbit, before jettisoning its launcher. In fact it pulled it off with launcher fuel to spare so I\u0027m comfortable I can add a little bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m about to take this baby for a test drive laythe transfer, and hopefully back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lolware.net/kerbal/2013-10-27_00001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-10-27_00001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next revision should allow docking for a lander, followed by some extra fuel tanks. Which brings me to my design query.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I put two radially mounted docks, and attach a jumbo tank, would that large 90 degree angle be capable of surviving the thrust? In a slightly more ambitious version, can you see a way I could dock an engine with one nuclear tank attached that would actually fire in the correct direction? I considered side mounted docks but docking is hard enough as it is without having to ponder any sort of rotational issue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T08:06:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can hang quite large masses off of the sides, as long as you don\u0027t get crazy with the thrust levels, such as this pair of rover-deployers on their way to Vall: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y6RyfOq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Y6RyfOq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I\u0027m not picturing what you mean about the nuke engine mount, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T08:13:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for that!
