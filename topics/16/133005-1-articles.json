I also plan to store and organize a number of documents pertaining to these challenges here. At first, I will be focus on the workings of the craft that will land unmanned, fill its tanks using fuel made on Mars, and fly back to Earth with a crew. This craft is similar to the MAV as seen in \u0027The Martian\u0027, except it is expected to go all the way from Mars\u0027 surface to Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EA: Mars EDL (Entry, Decent, and Landing):\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nLifting entry body design\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPropulsive final decent\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPossible HAID/Ballute\u00A0usage\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDirect entry\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSite targeting:\u00A0FAR, Mechjeb \u0026amp; Trajactories?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I plan to leaf each of these out at a later time, but for now I will lay out the basics. My craft will be 30-60T when it reaches Mars. Some of that will make up the bus for powering and controlling the craft between the Trans-Mars Injection (TMI) and this point. To save on mass, I intend to enter the atmosphere directly from this trajectory, rather than braking into Mars orbit first. Most of my tests have been performed with a decent from Mars orbit, but I have performed some as well from this trajectory (thanks Hyperedit!) By offsetting the payload mass slightly and leading with a heat shield (not at max ablator capacity) I will be able to generate some lift, allowing the craft to slow down before entering propulsive decent. I have had success in achieving an L/D factor of 0.15 - 0.35 with this method. I expect fitting my final craft into a shape that can fit on this shield will be quite challenging. I predict that targetting will be the greatest challenge. I may need to learn and use kOs in order to accomplish 2 landings within 100m of each other\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have performed some tests using the ballute from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/121162-105-inline-ballutes-ib-v123-9122015/\u0022\u003EInline Ballutes\u003C/a\u003E by riocrokite.

A few of those paths are detailed in this paper by \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pioneerastro.com/Team/RZubrin/Mars_In-Situ_Resource_Utilization_Based_on_the_Reverse_Water_Gas_Shift_Experiments_and_Mission_Applications.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPioneer Astro\u003C/a\u003E.

To produce 1 tonne of methane \u0026amp; liquid oxygen (LO2) fuel per day will require a 375 kW power source. I currently plan to use a RTG to generate this energy, but I have yet to find a source for what such a large RTG would weigh. In this process, liquid hydrogen is brought from Earth to be used as feedstock for methane (LCH4)\u00A0fuel. The hydrogen could potentially be sourced from local martian water, but I don\u0027t plan to add that functionality to RealISRU right now. My understanding is that substantial amounts of water would need to be taken from the ground, which would further require a ground distribution map of this resource on Mars. My intended fuel path could be carried out from any landing site, regardless of the availability of ground resources.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy greatest challenge at the moment is the tanking and cryogenic cooling of fuel produced. Due to liquid hydrogen\u0027s (LH2) low density, it takes a not insubstantial amount of tank volume to bring enough LH2 to Mars The required hydrogen doesn\u0027t have a great deal of mass, but the additional tanks required to bring it might. To combat this, Pioneer Astro suggests that some tanks be used to carry LH2 from Earth, and then later be filled with LO2 or LCH4 as fuel is produced and LH2 is consumed. Currently, RealFuel tanks do not support changing the contents while in flight. Secondly, the stock thermal system \u0026amp; radiators appear unable to chill fuels to their cryogenic point. LO2 boils at 90.2K and LCH4 boils at 111.7K, LH2 at 20.3K. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/115734-heat-pumps-for-real-fuels-v11-oct-31-2015/\u0022\u003EHeatPump\u003C/a\u003E appears capable of providing cooling, but so far I can only get it to chill tanks when the radiators are surface attached.

In case you want to do something similar, by setting this value to 190 or something, I will be disabling LOX boiloff on that specific tank as long as the ambient temperature is below 190K. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/NathanKell/ModularFuelSystem/blob/master/RealFuels/Resources/RealTankTypes.cfg#L17\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EExample\u003C/a\u003E.

I like the idea of ambitious precursor missions that allowing testing/proving of multiple enabling technologies at once. The of the major enabling technologies I see myself being able to prove out at this point at:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Multi-ton lifting body EDL\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Surface ISRU\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Ascent to Mars orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI believe I could design a small craft, not too much larger than the largest craft already placed on the surface of Mars, that is capable of landing the small form ISRU units on the surface and powering them via the sun. Effectly, the same scale as the current RealISRU test craft 10. I don\u0027t want to make the single craft too ambitious, so I would only size it sufficiently to return to Mars orbit, but not to return the sample to Earth. If that mission runs successfully, the surface samples from this craft could be transferred to a second craft that returns them to Earth, or an Ion craft could be sent along with the craft, capable of sending the sample back to Earth.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe second precursor mission would be an unmanned dress rehearsal of the ascent craft used for Mars Direct. It would also include hardware capable of sample return, possibly some small rovers as well. This craft would use RTGs for power and the 100 class ISRU hardware. It would fuel up over roughly a year, sending a man scale heat shielded capsule (with a small solar support bus w/RCS) on an Earth return trajectory for sample return. This might end up being mostly roleplay, since without learning Infernal Robotics (IR) I don\u0027t see an unmanned method to pass surface samples from a rover or science package into the return capsule. I am also notoriously terrible at rover design.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn obvious but exceptionally challenge will be proving that I can land 2 craft within 100 metres of each other. That is something I would like to do before committing humans to a mission, but I can\u0027t think of a way to add more value and science to doing this. Perhaps a twin mission, like the twin Mars Exploration rovers? If just one succeeds, it still demonstrates the ISRU and surface sample return missions. Or, the second vehicle landed could be my prototype second Mars Direct vehicle (the habitat and outbound manned vehicle, currently undesigned). a rover \u0026amp; automation could use that habitat to attempt to remotely farm food or perform surface biology experiments, or even basic secondary ISRU like metallurgy and fabrication? Or, it could just be a straight landing of a Hab, intended for potential use in a future human mission?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee, tons of options.

Often times, temps can be lowered, but then are stuck there and will not raise even when cooling is disengaged. While I can simulate a synchronized state of these variables, it is through cfg editing, and only pertains to one environment and does not scale.

It has enough LqdHydrogen to refuel with ISRU and then can easily attain 200km orbit again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am working with the basic RO RSS install and I only use RO modified stock and procedural parts.

If I were trying to do that (which I might try, as I think targeting the same site with your craft would be easier than with mine) I would fire the engines shortly in orbit to target the landing site, then only trigger a suicide burn near the last second and burn all the way down to the landing area.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have even half seriously considered putting wheels on my first landing craft, so I could bring it closer to the human landing party during the year or so of their surface mission before the ascent to orbit. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-14T05:32:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2016 05:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by stratochief66\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lothaar","CreatedById":159753,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T05:57:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you imagine the added stress of always wondering and hoping your return vehicle will make it to your location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dangit Bob, stop using battery power to link in and check on the DAVs mobile progress; It will get here when it gets here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stratochief66","CreatedById":59541,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T02:51:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFound a fission reactor to research more deeply. 100kW electric, 400kW thermal for 0.5T, what a deal!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_Affordable_Fission_Engine\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_Affordable_Fission_Engine\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lothaar","CreatedById":159753,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T23:20:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo funny, I was looking in to the systems on this chart\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://a.static.trunity.net/images/121224/400x218/scale/\u0026amp;imgrefurl=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/154970/\u0026amp;h=218\u0026amp;w=400\u0026amp;tbnid=tlgqdROn7ipgoM:\u0026amp;docid=A-2d5LnVUyB1_M\u0026amp;ei=z-jpVtbvNMTjmAGC8IzgAw\u0026amp;tbm=isch\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWk7flqsbLAhXEMSYKHQI4AzwQMwggKAMwAw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://a.static.trunity.net/images/121224/400x218/scale/\u0026amp;imgrefurl=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/154970/\u0026amp;h=218\u0026amp;w=400\u0026amp;tbnid=tlgqdROn7ipgoM:\u0026amp;docid=A-2d5LnVUyB1_M\u0026amp;ei=z-jpVtbvNMTjmAGC8IzgAw\u0026amp;tbm=isch\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWk7flqsbLAhXEMSYKHQI4AzwQMwggKAMwAw\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand also the homer15/25\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSAFE seems to be the best in terms of power and weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-16T23:21:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2016 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Lothaar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
