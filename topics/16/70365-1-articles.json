But I\u0027m having big troubles with the steering. More SAS, more RCS, perfectly aligned with the center of mass... nothing. The thing tumbles out of control soooo easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what are you guys using to control them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far what I have tried is the \u0022big ass single ship with tons of RCS and SAS\u0022 approach and the \u0022single big ship and a lot of small probes approach\u0022 and the \u0022single big ass ship with multiple equally big probes\u0022 approach. None of them worked. My maneuver probes swing around when they start to fight the roid and the thing just rolls and rolls from one side to the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it\u0027s in solar orbit, I have all the time in the world to experiment and send 100 ships to rendezvous with it if necessary... I just don\u0027t have engineering know-how apparently. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-25T16:52:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2014 04:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rosco P.

Give it a little nudge, deactivate SAS, nudge a little more, and stop it early. SAS was made to stabilize the middle axis of your vehicle. Since your center of mass is FAR above your RCS thrusters, there is no way to rotate the whole asteroid without shifting the middle axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried it yet, but attaching a second ship just opposite to the first one should dramatically improve your steering capabilities. Luckily, usually you don\u0027t have to move the asteroid very far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

Me problem is keep it straight while burning, I\u0027ll try low thrust and see what it does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, so far I attach the maneuvering probes in whatever place I happen to come from...
