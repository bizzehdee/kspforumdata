I managed to get the first part down ok, then the next bit was the launch the second module and try to get it near the first. I\u0027m actually pretty happy because I got closer than expected, but also a bit sad because it\u0027s 800meters away! Is there a way (using KAS or anything else) to get the two pieces close together as they are already on the surface and I can\u0027t launch them again (no fuel, they\u0027re just habitation modules on legs!)."},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T17:03:12Z","Content":"With really low gravity, comes really low friction. Minmus is made of soap buddy, you might just get away with it.\n\nKAS winches I reckon, shouldnt matter that they dont have wheels, retract the legs, let them float onto the hab bases then slide em over.\n\nIf you cant stretch a winch directly then set up a system of ground pylons between them and mount winches to those to \u0027ratchet\u0027 them along (like warping a barge upstream)\n\nedit: and 800m is pretty good for a spotlanding attempt, i actually find minmus hard because although changing trajectory is cheap you fall so slowly that rotation of the moon becomes an issue so you cant just dead-stop and \u0027bomb\u0027 from orbit.\n\nHow are you delivering these? They are out of fuel or never had any? skycrane? staged off a lander?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T17:07:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 05:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by celem**"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T17:16:20Z","Content":"Get the trajectories mod.

You can do this by attaching the winch near the Center of Mass (Make a guess).\n\nBy the way, the base was my first, and it went well. After 2 years there, the crew went home happily.\n\nThe Automatic habitat fell over when the second crew arrived (I landed too close, the exhaust pushed it off its legs).\n\nI scraped the whole thing.\n\nI think it\u0027s still there, actually, I should check...\n\nGood luck, and hope I helped!\n\n-DMSP"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T18:04:15Z","Content":"What I have actually done (stock no KAS) is use the asteroid claw to attach a skycrane to modules.

You could build and send up a sturdy rover - a mobile platform. Drive the thing underneath the module in question, and then retract the landing legs on it and have it sit down on the rover. Then, drive the rover over to where you want it and then extend the lander legs again.\n\nI\u0027ve been thinking along these lines for my own Mun/Minmus bases construction."},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T21:35:23Z","Content":"Build a crane.
