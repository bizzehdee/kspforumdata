While passing by each planet and getting a new course I would detach the HOME base that I have set up and land it on each of the planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main benefit of this would be to use only one burn, when leaving Kerbins gravitational influence and then just being able to coast to the planets dropping off things when the time comes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone would like to join in on the idea and help me out that would be great, because I feel like this could be a really cool and challenging mission to get perfectly right. Of course, it would need a lot of set up, and a lot of docking while in orbit around kerbin. The difficulty with that is now with all of this added weight it may be a little difficult to pull everything out of Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know your ideas, thoughts and what not.

Keep in mind that every slingshot will have to be done in a precise manner. The slightest misalignment from the orbital plane will radically change your course. The real Voyager probes used several slingshot maneuvers over several years using just thruster fuel to hit solar system escape velocity. That should be your challenge as well for your first attempt. Probably would be better to use Duna and or or Jool for the first slingshot attempts although Mum will work if you can catch it in the right trajectory. You might even want to try using eve, Kerbin, and Jool as the multiple slingshot.
