Same vessel interaction: Between about version 1.2.0\u00A0and version 1.7.0, no two parts belonging to a single craft could collide with each other. If they could move, they would just phase through each other. If they were clipped into each other, they would not collide. As soon as you decouple, however, one craft becomes two craft -- and any parts that clip between the two craft\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0immediately collide, often with explosive consequences. All this was done to allow artistic clipping to make vessels look cute, and to prevent explosions between parts that were a little too close together, even if they visually seemed to be slightly separated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what Breaking Ground (and the current version) do is change that all slightly. Breaking Ground movable joints and robotics allow parts of the ship to bend back and interact with the rest of the craft. So the previous unbreakable rule of \u0022no parts on the same craft are allowed to collide\u0022 has changed. Parts that are on opposite sides of\u00A0a robotics joints can now collide. Just so long as you initially store your robotics parts in a safe way, this new rule about self-collisions should never destroy your craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Sometimes, you want to look at the \u0022hidden\u0022 opposite side of your navball. Now you can, with a click.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. When you build your rocket, you can set the \u0022priority\u0022 of the order that you want your fuel tanks to drain. The system automatically sets pretty good default guesses, that will work in almost all cases. But if you want to do something like an asparagus launcher -- using priorities can make it simpler than adding a dozen fuel ducts. Priorities are numeric, and the tanks with the highest numeric priority drain first, provided there is a path for the fuel to flow between the tank and any operational engine. You have to turn on Advanced Tweakables in the Settings before the fuel priorities can be modified.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kar","CreatedById":122714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-21T00:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you so much for the explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1- Indeed, I remember this was a problem in the earlier versions of KSP.
