First issue is how my parts keep overheating. I tried using a heatshield and even tried covering my ship in small radiators, and even just tried taking all my science to the pod and let all my other experiments get blown off, which actually worked. Then I faced another problem. All the way until i was 500 meters above the ground (i happened to be in a highland so it was hard to tell), it didn\u0027t once say my parachutes were safe to deploy. When i was only 500 meters above the ground, i just deployed anyway since i had no other choice, and sure enough they got destroyed. I don\u0027t even have any idea how do get to the ground safely. I\u0027ve considered keeping my boosters to help me slow down in the atmosphere, although I\u0027m not sure if that would help.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T03:57:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 03:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Clockwork13**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:00:42Z","Content":"Hi Clockwork13, it\u0027s hard to know what\u0027s going on just from that, but you should be able to re-enter without much trouble if you set your periapsis to about 30km.\n\nYou\u0027ll slow down quickly enough to avoid too much atmospheric heating, too high and you\u0027ll be super sonic for too long and risk overheating, too much lower and you can punch through the atmosphere without losing enough speed to safely open the chutes.\n\nThe new default for chutes is to open at 1000m and 0.04 pressure, craft launched before the update may still have the lower values though, so adjust them accordingly.\n\nIf your Physics.cfg is old you may also have incorrect values for heat, so rename it Physics.old so KSP makes a new one."},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:04:05Z","Content":"Ok, I understand it this is basically your first time orbiting? Then you\u0027re probably in an altitude of 70-100 km and at a speed of 2300\u002B m/s. To not burn up you need to lose some speed but not too much speed because that would make you drop into the atmosphere too steep.\n\nI suggest first doing retrograde (backwards) burns near the AP and PE positions of your orbit until the other one is just around 75 km (if you\u0027re lower, like 65 km or so it isn\u0027t a problem in this case either but below 70 km you slow down because of the atmosphere). Then do another short retrograde burn to bring one part of your orbit to around 50 km altitude. Fast-forward until you enter the atmosphere (70 km altitude), then slow down the warp a bit (highest setting may make you explode). You will start losing speed because of the air friction and there will be a lot of heat but you should be fine. If you can, point the engine forward as an additional heat shield.\n\nIf this doesn\u0027t work you\u0027ll probably have to experiment a bit with your reentry angle.\n\nEdit: you can also try the 30 km altitude suggested while I was typing this. You\u0027ll probably just have to try it yourself. If you go too high it might take a long time for you to slow down enough but I find it to be a bit safer.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T19:06:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 07:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rofltehcat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:04:29Z","Content":"A pod can survive a landing at sea level (or near to it), but the deorbit is tricky ... till you get drogue chutes, it\u0027s going to be tough to land stuff."},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork13","CreatedById":100102,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:05:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi Clockwork13, it\u0027s hard to know what\u0027s going on just from that, but you should be able to re-enter without much trouble if you set your periapsis to about 30km.\n\u003E You\u0027ll slow down quickly enough to avoid too much atmospheric heating, too high and you\u0027ll be super sonic for too long and risk overheating, too much lower and you can punch through the atmosphere without losing enough speed to safely open the chutes.\n\u003E \n\u003E The new default for chutes is to open at 1000m and 0.04 pressure, craft launched before the update may still have the lower values though, so adjust them accordingly.\n\u003E \n\u003E If your Physics.cfg is old you may also have incorrect values for heat, so rename it Physics.old so KSP makes a new one.\n\nI\u0027m not orbiting though, i\u0027m just going straight down which might be a problem.\n\nEdit: fixed typo in main post\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T19:09:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 07:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Clockwork13**"},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:09:38Z","Content":"Straight down is your problem.
