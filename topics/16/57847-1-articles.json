I last used 0.19, now using 0.23.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been catching up on the changes. But ran into a problem that somehow I managed to work around before, but have not been able to solve, so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s in preparing to dock, to set the target. As I know from before, I have to visually \u0022see\u0022 the ship and click on its docking port to set it as the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the ship is a few hundred meters away, and I can\u0027t get close enough to be able to click on the docking port. One thing that is contributing to the problem is that the ships have clamp-o-tron JR\u0027s. Previously I used the regular sized (1 meter) docking ports. So with these being half the size, they are twice as hard to try to click on when the intended target ship is visually far off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in map view. I can set the SHIP as a target, which works for the rendezvous. But to dock, I have to manually click on the docking port of the other ship to set it as a target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to recall from months ago there may have been some add-on to help with setting the docking port as the target.
