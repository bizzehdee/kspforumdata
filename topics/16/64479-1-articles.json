When building rockets and I want to change or alter the design how do I select just one piece? Every time I try to click on a piece it selects the entire rocket. The only thing I can single select is the capsule and once i remove that nothing else. No matter where I click the rocket at or on what piece it just selects the whole thing.

From that point on ever part you add must be attached in some way to the root. What it sounds like you\u0027re doing is starting with a fuel tank or an engine or something and building there. Generally what you would want to do is start with capsule and build down. This will allow to select and attach pieces individually how you want. You can also select the whole rocket by moving around the command pod. Also some handy shortcuts - Ctrl-z is undo(a life saver), alt click is duplicate part, and I believe shift-click is select the entire rocket regardless of clicking the root or not(helpful if your commandpod is hidden or something). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoup\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPs, there\u0027s no such thing as a stupid question..especially with ksp.

Once I have saved the ship I can click just the capsule and remove it from the rest of the rocket. From there it does not matter where I click the rocket. Im not just trying one place here. I have tried every single piece engine, tank, decoupler, every time it just highlights and selects the whole rocket. Ill try the shift key thing and mash them both in a couple times and see if that helps.

Keyboard shift keys didnt work. Tried pushing them down and even turning keyboard off. Then all of a sudden for a moment I was able to select a single part and pull it out of the rocket. Then i could single select all the tanks above it to remove the one decoupler I wanted to get rid of put it all back together. and now...lol i cant select single parts again. Only the capsule can i select and pull off.

Once I pull the capsule off it treats the whole rest of the ship as one piece. If I put capsule back on and then come down to a piece i want and click it, it will remove everything below that point as one piece and I can select anything above that point singly. Weird but at least I can work around it now.

If the ship parts you are trying to mess with are gray or red, you won\u0027t be able to select them individually. Also, if you are unable to zoom or rotate the screen around, you\u0027ve deleted the root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe loose pieces will need to be reattached to the root part (as others have said). The root part is the part you first picked when you were making the rocket. If you\u0027ve deleted it, then you\u0027ll need to select a new root part, which will automatically drop itself into the center of the VAB. If your ghost ship is in the way, you might have problems seeing it. If you\u0027re not terribly worried about your current design, it might be less confusing to just start a new rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
