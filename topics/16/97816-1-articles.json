I\u0027m putting my planes through insane rigours. Nothing happens. I practice re-entry. Every thing\u0027s fine. I attempt aerobatics with a space plane... no sweat. I go to the moon and land there, no sweat. I aerobrake from 3.2 km/s to much less... easy peasy. I re-enter the atmosphere, as easy as eating a cookie. I pull a hard g-manoeuvre because I came in slightly off-course? Pffft, you must be joking right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT OH NOES! I fly in a straight line, a few hundred meters to a couple of dozens of meters above the ground, at low speed... and one of my wings (on three different designs thusfar) just... breaks off.... I don\u0027t hit anything, I don\u0027t pull hard G\u0027s... I fly in a strait line, preparing for a gentle touchdown (as I like them)... and variably between 800 meters in altitude and this last case at less than 50 meters above the runway, my wing spontaneously disassembles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this design I even figured I\u0027d bolt my wings down a bit more with struts... nope. It still goes. One moment I\u0027m flying there all nice and serene, preparing for an uneventful landing... and the next I\u0027m down a wing. This is annoying, because, you know... I kind of need those things...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this last one, it happened only meters above the ground, and I had a bit of the wing left, so I managed to put her down safely and on the runway anyway (by compensating like crazy). Well... safely? It looks like I crashed... And the report says I crashed into the launchpad... but it happened when I was at least 30 meters above the runway... This is a real head scratcher... is the Kraken teasing me or something? Below some pictures. Maybe I\u0027m doing something wrong, but putting wings on a plane is not exactly supposed to be hard... XD And it kinda worked before...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone an idea what\u0027s going on here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(playing stock btw)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/CU75X\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
