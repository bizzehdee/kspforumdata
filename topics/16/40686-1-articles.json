Sometimes when I decouple the docking nodes, the control goes to the dropped lander and my skycrane loses control, as it becomes \u0022unmanned\u0022. Is there a way to ensure that when I decouple a node, the focus stays on the ship I\u0027m controlling?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T19:37:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe usual thing with sky cranes is that they fly off and crash after releasing the rover. So, usually the skycrane doesn\u0027t have a probe core, just the rover. You decouple and land the rover, keep it from rolling away, etc., ignoring the sky crane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it sounds like you want a reuseable skycrane. In that case, probably the easiest thing is to make it a lander. Fly it all the way down to a full-stop landing and decouple the rover while nothing is flying or moving. Switch control to the rover, set its parking brake so it will stay put, then switch back to the sky crane and fly it back up to wherever you want it to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hour Hero Yes","CreatedById":76830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T20:45:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve definitely been able to drop the lander and keep the focus on the skycrane, though, which allows me to drop it while still hovering\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dravin","CreatedById":77089,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T20:55:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen decoupling make sure you are controlling from a control module, such as a probe core, on the crane and not on the rover. You can select a control module and tell the the game you want to control from that location.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T21:12:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI set \u0027control from here\u0027 on the skycrane\u0027s probe core, and that works great for keeping focus on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeeping control? Not so much. I was dropping a 6\u002B ton rover/base, so the skycrane just sort of shoots off upwards after the release due to the sudden lack of mass. Bad for control, great for making it GTFO and not land on the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strongest_2hu","CreatedById":67784,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T22:03:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust hit ] as soon as you decouple, the skycrane can\u0027t go far in the time that takes and it even tends to go in a useful direction, up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
