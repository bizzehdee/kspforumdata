I have some concepts for the chunkin challenge and beyond that could use them. I understand that rotating bearings are typically made from aircraft wheels in a ring, but am unsure about things like how far to place them from the shaft, what to use as a thrust bearing, etc. Looking more for design guidelines than finished .craft, but could certainly learn something by taking apart the latter. Thank you!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T11:59:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 11:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T13:30:50Z","Content":"Landing gear are not always needed, having a bearing made from a material wrapped around a shaft is more compact although requires more effort to turn.

What stock materials can you wrap around a shaft?

KSP/Unity don\u0027t respect the colliders well when loading, resulting in an immediate jam.\n\nRule number two: both too wide and too narrow clearance results in power loss. Too narrow means the collider mesh of the shaft pushes the wheels too much up their suspension struts, resulting in power loss. Too wide and the shaft starts too tumble, again pushing the wheels too much up their struts but now with a larger force due to an imbalace.\n\nRule number three: After first attaching and rotating/offset the landing gears to have the proper clearance with the shaft, launch craft, return to editor and adjust the wheels again. Due to a bug, the first time the location is not respected by KSP.\n\nRule number four: Four wheels per bearing is not enough for reliable operation! A shaft of 1.25m requires a minimum of six and a max of 8 wheels.\n\nLook at some of my newest designs, for example the Whistling Gnome, over here: [http://kerbalx.com/users/391/crafts](http://kerbalx.com/users/391/crafts)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T15:12:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Rule number one...\n\nGood stuff, thank you!

Symmetry on symmetry. Azimech put two (symmetrical) gear bays on each of four posts with mirror symmetry, then put the four posts around the shaft with radial symmetry. This way one can adjust clearance by moving the four (or six, or eight) posts, and keep clearance constant all the way around.\n\n2. Gear bays for thrust bearings, too. There are two wheels at each end of the shaft to keep it from moving axially. I might try this with the wheels impinging on a cone rather than the flat end of the shaft.\n\n3. Use a separator to detach the rotor shaft from the rest of the craft. The craft must start out as one piece, then in operation the rotor and stator have to be two separate pieces. I tried using clampos first, but I suspect the magnetics were interfering with rotation.\n\n4. SPH clearances can be (visually) deceiving. When i looked at the shaft in SPH it appeared there was lots of daylight between the gear wheels and the shaft. In operation, every wheel seemed to be in contact with the shaft all the way around. Good thing this design and SPH \u0027gizmos\u0027 make it easy to tweak clearance (see #1)\n\nI\u0027m sure I\u0027ll learn yet more as i try to build my own, scaling up to allow some \u0027flinging\u0027 of parts. I\u0027ll leave this thread \u0027unanswered\u0027 for now because I\u0027m sure there is more than one way to skin this kat. Maybe in the end I\u0027ll have enough techniques to help someone else out someday ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T11:59:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 11:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mister Dilsby**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T12:07:56Z","Content":"I\u0027ve copied your findings into my main topic, hope you don\u0027t mind :-)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T12:34:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve copied your findings into my main topic, hope you don\u0027t mind :-)\n\n Honored!

A rotating drum or a couple of round items like batteries that are supported in a 3D way. The landing gears used are massless so very handy. \n\nThe downside is that the axle/engine is big. You have to cram in all those landing gears and you need a decent distance between sets for stability. I\u0027m really, really hoping the new landing gear in 1.0 will help with this. Or we might get a stock axle - but I\u0027m not holding my breath for that. \n\nI keep trying different ideas though, hoping I\u0027ll find some better parts to make an axle.

Well, my real motivation in this pursuit is to develop an all-electric helicopter that will bring a (comparatively) small rocket stage to high-ish alitute on Eve. Using two large counter-rotating rotors, I might be able to get a thrust of 200kN or so... which means I can lift less than 12t off the ground... which probably means forget it. \n\nUnless I can make a giant reciprocating engine out of docking clamps!
