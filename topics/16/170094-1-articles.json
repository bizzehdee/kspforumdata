Unfortunatelly the node is not available, you placed the probecore there (or placed the node at the probecore, same effect). We need to remove the probecore to use the node. If the porbecore is bellow the docking port in the hierarchy we can just remove it, otherwise we first change the root(the docking port need to be closer \u003Cem\u003Ein the hierarchy\u003C/em\u003E to it than the probecore).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother point is noticing what the next part is.
