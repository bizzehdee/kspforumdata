Still, there are also times when you don\u0027t actually care, and others where you actually want an elliptical orbit; see, for example, the Russian Molniya commsats.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T22:32:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, it is not necessary to circularize. Sometimes it even eats your delta-v unnecessarily. Circularization is good in many cases, though. It gets you to defined state and you can burn any direction with the same effect, which cannot be said about elliptic orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECircularizing is also good idea if you want to leave your main ship in orbit and only send down a lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the body has atmosphere and you don\u0027t care where you land, you can just aerobrake to landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it doesn\u0027t have atmosphere and you want to land, you need to burn retrograde and your orbit will go through circular anyway. So you can stop there and look for suitable place to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re visiting one of upper Jool\u0027s moons, it\u0027s better to not circularize and use that elliptic orbit you get after aerobrake to reach the moon with less delta-v. It may take longer time warp to get an intercept, but rarely it\u0027s more than two orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheReaper","CreatedById":75943,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T23:38:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you need to perform an orbital docking at the target orbital body, it makes things easier, also approaching for landing from an actual orbit than a direct crash trajectory, is more efficent\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T08:26:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt only makes things easier conceptually.
