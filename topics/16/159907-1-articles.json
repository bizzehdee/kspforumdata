I currently have a small mun base near the pole of the Mun. I\u0027m trying to deliver a couple of rovers to the base. I get everything line up for the descent and manuveur until my landing site is really close. However, when I get to ~30,000m in my descent, I suddenly lose all control of the probe. I don\u0027t have RemoteTech installed. The fuel info. show that I\u0027m near full-power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe probe is controlled by a probe core on the lander engines, and there are two rovers mounted radially on either side via docking port. The rovers have solar panels mounted on them as well - I deploy them to provide power for the core during flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s my issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-28T22:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell the stock game has communications now with commnet so my first thought would be that the probe dropped below the communications horizon with Kerbin. With limited probe control all you\u0027ll be able to do is turn the engine on and off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ty Tan Tu","CreatedById":167214,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-29T00:40:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it is a Comm, a quick dirty way to get control of your craft back is to do a alt\u002BF12, click on \u0027Input Locks\u0027 and then \u0027Clear Input Locks\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-29T23:52:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/177264-garrett1415/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022177264\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/177264-garrett1415/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@garrett1415\u003C/a\u003E. The newest version of KSP now has a communications network requirement for unmanned probes. It requires a line-of-sight connection back to Kerbin or a connection to a relay satellite in order for probes to have full control. You can read a little more about this in the KSPedia in the game\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you don\u0027t have an antenna on that probe, or you\u0027d rather play without needing a comm network, you can disable the requirement from the pause menu. Press escape, choose the \u0022Difficulty\u0022 options, and then uncheck the \u0022Enable Comm Network\u0022 button. That might fix your problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CommNet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CommNet\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-29T23:53:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2017 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
