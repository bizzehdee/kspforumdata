something like 600 m/s.\u00A0 It\u0027s actually possible (though only just barely, in ideal conditions) for a Kerbal standing on the surface of the Mun to get into a (very) low Mun orbit.\u00A0 If you\u0027re a relative newbie, I don\u0027t suggest trying to do that.\u00A0 But even if you don\u0027t take them to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eorbit\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, they can actually fly quite a long way on the Mun before running out of propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo as long as you can land your rescue ship within a few dozen kilometers of your kerbals, you\u0027re fine.\u00A0 Just land it as close as you can manage, then switch to the kerbals and fly them to the rescue ship via EVA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option is to land not just a rescue ship, but also a rover.\u00A0 It can drive to the kerbals, pick them up, and then drive to the rescue ship.\u00A0 However, depending on how far you need to go, this could be pretty tedious-- driving any significant long distance on the Mun is quite a chore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T09:55:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRescue missions are a regular part of KSP \u003Cimg
