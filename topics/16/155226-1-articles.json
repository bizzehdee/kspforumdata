But if you can lighten things up, it certainly makes it easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne possibility would be going to a resuable Duna lander - that will save a lot of duplicated weight on those Mk 1-2s. \u00A0It is not too hard to build an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E Duna lander, and since you can use chutes on the way down, it does not need all that much fuel in total. If you do go this route, just make sure you have an engineer to repack your parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0You could also save some mass by using lighter parts - both Mk 1-2s are disproportionately heavy for what they offer. \u00A0A few alternatives are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A Hitchhiker crew cabin with an Mk 1 command pod or landing can. \u00A0This is very light but might be a little light on torque, though.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-An Mk 1-2 landing can and Hitchhiker. \u00A0This would also add an extra Kerbal seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-An Mk1-2 command pod and Mk 1 passenger cabin sticking out the top. \u00A0I like this combo myself, since the Mk 1-2 pod has more than enough torque to go around. \u00A0Also keeps center of mass low for entry stability and landing. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as engines, your best options are probably going to be nukes, Poodles, or Rhinos. \u00A0Since it only costs around 1000-1200\u00A0delta-v to get from Kerbin to Duna, chemical rockets are more practical than they would be for most interplanetary destinations. \u00A0Asparagus staging works well in space, just like on launch. \u00A0For example, with nukes, you can do stacks of a few Mk 1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E containers with a nuke on the bottom. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have never used the Elephant but understand it has stats similar to a Vector or Mammoth. \u00A0If so, it\u0027s not a vacuum optimized engine, and you\u0027d probably do better with a Rhino or a bank of Poodles. Note that even on Duna surface, the atmosphere is thin enough that vacuum engines work better than Kerbin atmo-oriented engines. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on how your ship is designed, you might be able to use your lander engines for the transfer burns as well, to avoid the mass of another set of engines. \u00A0For example, you could have a central column\u00A0with fuel and the other stuff that stays in space, and a small engine for the return burn, and have your landers sitting on the sides, kinda like radial boosters, using their engines for the Kerbin-Duna\u00A0transfer but but drawing from the central fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re not now, you might think about aerobraking to capture into Duna orbit to save a few hundred delta-v. \u00A0\u00A0It\u0027s got quite a forgiving atmosphere. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-19T16:29:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2017 04:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Aegolius13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-19T04:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a gander at the Jool-5 mission in my sig for some design ideas... \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-19T07:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222926769\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155226\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221484792623\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022171175\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StupidAndy\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, StupidAndy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m having trouble with the Delta V issue, currently, I\u0027m having maybe 5 modules of 4 of the biggest Mk1 fuel tanks, so it goes like this Mk2 to Mk1 adapter x4, Longest Mk1 fuel tank, Mk2 to Mk1 upside down, relatively simple, so I don\u0027t know...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe trouble is that the Delta V always goes down when I add fuel, and I can never get above 4000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E, so its hard to get up, and I think its adding the fuel from the landers, so I\u0027m not sure, do I have an asparagus staging like a rocket but with docking ports for the fuel, do I have it with nuclear?

You\u0027re building a fairly complex design, but they way you describe your issues, it sounds like there are a few fundamentals of rocketry that you missed picking up on in your time so far. The problems can probably be narrowed down to three things: one, fuel flow rules. Two, engine choice. Three, you don\u0027t know what mass fractions are. I suspect it\u0027s mainly the third, but it can\u0027t hurt to quickly touch on all of them...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding fuel flow rules: not all fuel you add to a spacecraft actually gets used by your main engines. Decouplers, for example, block fuel crossfeed. Else your first stage would drink the fuel of your second stage during launch, and nobody wants that! There are other parts that do this too. So if you\u0027re adding fuel somewhere and your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E goes down, that (most likely) means that you are adding it in a place that is crossfeed blocked from your main engine. Investigate the parts between where you added fuel and the engine, and check if everything is set up the way you need it to. Remember: you don\u0027t want the transfer stage to consume the fuel of your landers. But you do want the transfer stage to be able to access all of its own tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding engine choice: you didn\u0027t tell us which one you\u0027re currently using, but make sure you have a vacuum rated engine. Ideally a nuclear one, but for Duna that\u0027s almost overkill. A Duna transfer costs like 500 m/s more than a Minmus transfer, and that includes capturing at Duna. It\u0027s the cheapest interplanetary destination of them all. Just... try not to fly around in space with atmosphere rated engines like the Mainsail \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding mass fractions: this may be the most important thing you missed out on learning up until now.
