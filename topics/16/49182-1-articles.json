In previous versions of KSP I flew around every planet, had few orbital stations constructed, including bases on few planets. However, right now, Iam not capable of constructing stable aircraft in career mode. So far, I have unlocked basic rocketry and stability, but after numerous tries, my rocket always starts heading off course, as like it was unbalanced. I included .craft file here, so any of you can take a look and tell me, wth am I doing wrong. I can\u0027t get much more science atm. since i can\u0027t control my rocket to land of different biome then the shore. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.craft file: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://snk.to/f-ctkl6flj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://snk.to/f-ctkl6flj\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T10:51:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you include a screenshot with CoM, CoL and CoT enabled?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"7499275","CreatedById":70640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T10:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am also having trouble building stables rockets when I started career mode.
