Do you mean visual clipping surface? Collision mesh? Or some kind of bounding box (e.g. the smallest cylinder that will contain the object)?\n\nWhat is your goal in finding the highest density part?\n\nDepending on your goal, you might consider the toroidal aerospike engine, which has a mass of 1.5 in what is essentially a small flat disk with a spike poking out of it. With clever packing I would think you could easily get more than four of those in the volume of a Mainsail."},{"CreatedByName":"thediscover22450","CreatedById":195232,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-09T12:45:44Z","Content":"the rapier"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-10T06:57:38Z","Content":"If you\u0027re looking for ballast, full ore containers work well."},{"CreatedByName":"Draalo","CreatedById":158993,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-13T16:40:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2/10/2019 at 7:57 AM, Kryxal said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you\u0027re looking for ballast, full ore containers work well.\n\u003E \n\nOre tanks can also be partially filled, so you can finetune needed ballast.\n\nAlso you can jetison the ore if the ballast isnt needed anymore, no need for decouplers.\n\n(If you are planning a submarine then note that there are parts with different buyoncy. Cargo bays for example, open or close is a difference under water. You may also use additional ore tanks - in an emergency just jettison all ore and turn back to surface)\n\nthis part may be interesting too:\n\n![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377869516505612291/545282978457321503/unknown.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-13T16:41:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2019 04:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Draalo**\n  \ntypo"}]}
