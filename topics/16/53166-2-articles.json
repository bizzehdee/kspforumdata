I have however used docking adapters, senior docking port, probe and standard one, add two batteries as you will move this from a side to forward port if you need to move something heavy with a standard port. This can also be done for normal to junior ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the light on batteries as docking indicator lights.
