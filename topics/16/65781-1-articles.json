Along the way it is set up to gather resources to keep the fuel going. I\u0027m hoping to set up 5 of these in total to swan around the system hoping from each planet to the next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway it needs a lander which can detach from the main vessel drop down to the planet/moon mine resources (I have both Kethane and Water as resources needed to make LiquidFuel and Oxidizer respectively), and to then take these resources to the ship to be converted in to fuel and monoprop etc. The lander needs to hold enough fuel to land on each celestrial body and to lift a decent about of resources to make as least trips as possible needed to refuel the ship ready for its next intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m planing on going to mine Moho, Gilly, Minmus, Ike, Dres, Bop \u0026amp; Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built the ship pretty much the way I wanted with a \u0027cartridge\u0027 system where each resource tank is a cartridge that I can use a rcs tug to move the tanks from the ship to the lander (this way if I find just a water pocket or just a kethane pocket I can load those cartridges in to the lander and not go down and back with empty tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first lander looked like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xtZTBzO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xtZTBzO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 nuclear engines, 4 small drills, 5 ports so I can send 4, 2 or 1 cartridge down and remain symmetrical. I also have a hitch-hiker module to bring down crew and to plant flags if need be - also not in this picture is that it had some KAS containers with pipe equipment just in case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot it in to orbit attached it to my starship and sent it off to the Mun for breaking in - the ship performed pretty perfectly - once in orbit it started scanning for water and kethane and then I loaded the lander up and sent it down. Managed to land - filled all 4 tanks and couldn\u0027t lift up with the remaining fuel. I managed to get another crew down there and refuel her and managed to get her back in to orbit (JUST) and docked. I need a better solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo thinking that nukes don\u0027t give much extra TWR I decided to drop two of the nukes, add more fuel tanks and get rid of two drills and two cartridge bays (more trips but at least I would be able to do them this time). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I ended up with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G6MABWn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022G6MABWn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery top heavy.

For a low-grav world like minmus/gilly/bop/pol you can get away with hauling up resources to a depot and refueling each time in space. As soon as you try and lift a decent amount of these products off a stronger moon or body (mun/moho) you find that the dV required to land and then reorbit with a full load is a lot. A little converter at least lets you top off on the mining patch before filling the tanks and weighs relatively little when we are talking about hauling resources anyway.

The hitch-hiker is also an optional \u0027cartridge\u0027 that you plug in to the bottom so it can land totally autonomous to save weight or can be used to land a crew down to plant a flag and visit any anomalies - also when they visit Ike I should have a fully fledged mining operation there for an earlier flotilla that are on their way there directly (this spaceship will be going to moho and Gilly before going to Ike so they\u0027ll get there by the time its been there awhile - hopefully the colony will still be alive and not eaten by the kraken and theres always the possibility that we need to launch a rescue mission so having a hitch-hiker is imporatant - I haven\u0027t tried landing with it stowed underneath yet but the Mark IV will be lower anyway as you suggested so I\u0027ll have to plug it in to one of the four ports along the top - not sure how that would do weight wise - may have to have two hitch-hikers to balance things out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe removal ability of the tanks are important to the design of the ship because if I add more resources in the future (working on this as a kethane add-on at the moment) then I need to be able to bring some empty tanks to the ship in order to mine the new resources - KSC wanted to keep costs low so wanted to have a versatile lander for this - also I wanted the option to either bring two water tanks and two kethane tanks for the lucky times where I have overlapping resource fields or to bring 4 of one or 4 of the other for when I\u0027m not so lucky! Just had a thought that I could stow a mini-converter underneath that can be plugged in for when I find overlapping resources and then have fuel tanks for the cartridges (thanks for the idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like a cool mod - will need to look into it and if its able to work out the payload with the lifter or if I\u0027ll need to make the payload as a sub-assembly or not (theres a mod to redefine what is the root part anyway so I could install both if I need to!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily it looks like I\u0027m getting a lot of bang for my buck in the conversion rates - I\u0027m getting enough to refuel the lander and about an orange tank I think (I\u0027ll have to keep a closer eye on that) I think it more or less filled up my oxy on the spaceship in two trips so was pretty much the same for the liquid too. I was more concentrating on the lander itself so didn\u0027t really pay much attention to that!

The larger the payload and the more delta-v is needed, the bigger the benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psyper","CreatedById":90641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T16:57:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John Crichton\u0022 data-cite=\u0022John Crichton\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI just built my first Kethane SSTO...and here are a few tips:\u003Cp\u003E1) It\u0027s more efficient to refine on the planet/moon instead of in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Your refinery decides how many miners you need because it\u0027s your bottleneck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Less miners \u002B smaller refinery = lighter craft (at the expense of taking longer to mine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If you refine on the ground, you don\u0027t need large Kethane tanks...2-5 of the smallest ones are perfectly fine, even when using the large refinery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Gigantor solar panels are the devil...way too heavy. Stick with multiple smaller ones or even better, a Kethane electricity generator to make it possible to mine in the dark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my Kethane-Plasma SSTO...not the quickest refueler out there, but it can reach all the destinations you listed without a tugger and also land pretty much everywhere but Jool, Eve and maybe Tylo (haven\u0027t tested Tylo yet). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0LG6lSl.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/0LG6lSl.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoving the SSTO and its colours - I\u0027m guessing the texture replacer there!! I did try to do without the gigantor panels but its finding enough surface area on the lander without either clipping the kethane/water tanks or the solar panels themselves - two gigantor\u0027s are pretty much all I needed plus some mini ones to keep the battery charged while they are stowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryxal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kryxal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you\u0027re going to have a spot underneath for a rescue can, why not set up so you can slot in a converter instead on an as-needed basis?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skorpychan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Skorpychan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd, indeed, why not stick a small converter on there so you can top off your tanks in situ?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a good idea - perhaps the small converter with a sr docking port to stow underneath the lander - it needs to be a sr really because the lander sits between the spaceship and a kethane scanner satellite - I\u0027d probably need a jr docking port and a tug to move it in to place - there is another option to add it to the top of the lander so it could have a probody and rcs so it can move itself on to the lander while in orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway - Lander Mk IV was pretty much a success - it landed filled up 4 water containers so thats 12,800 L of water and managed to take off with ease and docked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little niggle was for some reason when I first thrusted to deorbit the lander it started to spin uncontrolled - I stopped the thrust realigned to the marker and started firing again and had no problems. I checked it to make sure I didn\u0027t have any fuel lines missing or fuel unbalanced and couldn\u0027t find anything out of place. Landed okay and took off without a hitch - even was able to cut out the extra engines after the initial boost and use the nukes for the rest of the way up. When I rendezvoused with the spaceship again I kicked in the thrusters and it started spinning but this time I noticed the tanks were wobbling around so it looks like I need MOOOR STRUTS lol. Easy thing to solve with a bit of tweeking on the design. Also I had to keep an eye on the electricity level a lot so might get rid of the radial batteries and go for the large inline one. But all in all it was an easy ride and should work okay for Moho - the big test!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENEW WATER TANKS (I tried to amend the persist file with my new tanks and they ended up clipping the docking ports (still worked though without taking the rest of the spaceship with it!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dLy4twG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dLy4twG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there not a sight more beautiful than one of your own creations screaming along after having its full of liquid \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JMWh2FX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JMWh2FX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks for everyone for posting tips and hints and screenshots - you\u0027ve all been a great help and I couldn\u0027t have done this without your input.
