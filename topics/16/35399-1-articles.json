It\u0027s not in the tutorial thread because it was just a quick reply type thing to a similar question that you just asked\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2. I just took a closer look at your picture, just make sure you rotate the engines so that all of the fairings will jettison out sideways, not radially inwards and outwards. If they do that the 3 halves that go in will most likely continue to sheer off the engines. The way around this problem is not to actually put decouples under these engines it\u0027s to have the decoupled in between them mounted to the tank above them. This usually means using engine clustering instead of the tri-coupler\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-30T20:23:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2013 08:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by HoY\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
