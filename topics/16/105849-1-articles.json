Heat can be transferred from one part to another, say an enginge to a tank to the pod.\n\nI play with the reentry slider at 120% and the MkI pod can burn up on reentry, sometimes and sometimes not, without a heat shield. With the heat shield I need to pay attention of the pods orientation during reentry. Before 1.0 it was pretty much mission complete during descent in most cases no need to touch the keyboard, just hit the space to activate chutes and let the craft handle itself. Now how the COM is with a pod and heat shield it will come in at an angle allowing the pod to overheat if you are not careful."},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:18:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Seems a little high and slow for that altitude to explode.
