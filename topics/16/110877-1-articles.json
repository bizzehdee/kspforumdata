It worked fine initially - Made it as far as across the water to the... West? of the Space Center.\n\nSpeed forward a few hours - I install Quill18\u0027s list of suggested mods because I\u0027m feeling a bit more adventurous (and most of them are interface mods anyway) and decide to pick up another recon contract. Now all of a sudden my airplane has no display of lift in the hangar (just the ball) and when I take off (if I even manage that) the plane flips out and tries its hardest to crash - completely different aerodynamics compared to earlier.\n\nSo... did I manage to ruin the design somehow without noticing? (I\u0027ve been moving parts around trying to find the issue)\n\nOr... Is it one of Quill\u0027s mods that have changed something that I\u0027m not aware of? ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nPlane design with no lift indicator\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ln37l1nsih4ah3s/KSP_Plane_NoLift.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ln37l1nsih4ah3s/KSP_Plane_NoLift.jpg?dl=0)\n\nList of Quill\u0027s mods that I\u0027ve installed (And made sure are in proper folders)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/DuzoYQg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DuzoYQg.jpg)\n\nOn a sidenote - I\u0027m getting a warning that FlightIntegrator is only supported by 1.0 on startup (By UVA? I think), but I dismissed it thinking it was probably just a minor update to KSP difference.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T08:18:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 08:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mansen**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T10:31:57Z","Content":"I suspect FAR - it\u0027s a completely different aero system."},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T10:34:16Z","Content":"Your plane has lift, it\u0027s just that the vector on the CoL is a stupid addition that is confusing and meaningless and shouldn\u0027t be there.
