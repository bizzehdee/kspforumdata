I tried landing once and realized I had nowhere near enough fuel left to land, nevermind get back. So, I go back to the drawing board, and try and build bigger rockets, so I end up with more fuel while in orbit. I just end up with huge rockets that weigh so much that I still run out of fuel. What am I missing? I have built some very small, efficient rockets that can get me to the moon and back, but no matter how big I go, I seem to end up with barely better results. I don\u0027t want to just go look up a perfect design, but any tips to guide me in the right direction? I\u0027m also shooting in the dark when it comes to figuring out thrust limiters, stages, etc. I kept thinking if I break it into stages, it would help, but the extra motors and coupling seem to negate that with all the extra weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-28T05:20:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2013 05:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by TexRob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyrunner27","CreatedById":64031,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T00:17:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan I see a picture of the crafts you are talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T00:28:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA picture or two would help, definitely.
