Thanks if you can help!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T15:26:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 03:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by legoclone09**"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T20:06:13Z","Content":"Have you checked spacecraft exchange?

Check the action groups, I think that\u0027s an older craft file that doesn\u0027t have all the RAPIERs set to manual mode switching and added to the first action group. Other than that, it should just be a matter of swapping out my test payload for yours and strutting it."},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T20:24:29Z","Content":"Thanks, you\u0027re one of the nicest forum members from what I\u0027ve seen!"}]}
