I had decied to try deadly rentry to give the game a little more realisim. I\u0027m having a hard time figureing out how to safely reenter, and blow up. I did it once but have no clue how I did it. I was looking at the map, being picky about where I landed and forgot I put deadly renetry on. When I closed the map I was through and the chutes were opening. All I can say is I pointed to kerbin and burned what I had left of the fuel. The last time I blew up was a shock I thought I had it perfect, I had the perieapps at 2400M and I still blew up. Anyone have any suggestions. Thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T19:22:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou need to come in shallower. A periapsis of about 20km should do it (2.4km is way too shallow) if you are trying to land at a specific spot you want your periapsis to be at least 1/3rd the circumference of Kerbin ahead of where you want to land (And you may still come up short) Also make sure your pod has a head shield. (The Mk1 pod has one installed, all others need one) And that you deploy your parachutes about 10km up (Or after reentry effects have stopped, whichever is lower)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dudester28","CreatedById":61717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T21:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022superkurbol2014\u0022 data-cite=\u0022superkurbol2014\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI pointed to kerbin and burned what I had left of the fuel\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are pointing straight down to de-orbit, you are both wasting fuel and making re-entry speeds higher.

The faster you hit the atmosphere the more heat due to friction, depending on where your coming from, your velocity will vary. For example on a return form the moon you will be traveling faster when hitting the atmosphere than if you were in Low Kerbin Orbit (75km). If you don\u0027t dip deep enough into the atmosphere you will simply skip back out int space, if you dip too deeply you will decelerate too rapidly and burn up.

The initial one as I approach the periapsis that I burned for, then the capsule climbs back up into the higher atmosphere trying to reach the 80km apoapsis, but it has to travel through so much air resistance that it never gets there, then falls back down for a second heating cycle that brings it safely down to the surface. This method does use a lot of the ablative material, and stacking a second heat shield is a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinding the ideal altitudes for the desired apoapsis is a bit of trial-and-error. I always shoot for a value that is as high as possible that will keep my reentry vehicle in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing that you can look at are the Deadly Reentry settings for the shock wave multiplier and exponent.
