I can imagine that you tried building really big rocket and ended up designing one that barely can lift itself; try to remember that more is not always better, especially when it comes to design of rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need to put something heavy in orbit (space station with ability to refuel ships for example) you will need a LOT of thrust at start. My heavy lift rocket starts with 12 long solid boosters and 6 main sail engines. Get used to burning tons of fuel very fast during lift-off (however be careful - if your rocket will accelerate too fast your ship can end up breaking apart. Also air works much more against you when you try to fly too fast in atmosphere). First stage should burn the most of your rocket fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it is sometimes better to split heavy payload in two or three: building that freaking huge space station is possible if you divide it into few parts and launch each as separate mission (and then dock them of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to test some rockets with some heavy mock-up payload (like sending big fuel tank with OKTO into space). Try adding more and less fuel at different stages, or try adding and removing engines, adding decouplers and making more stages. Try adding detachable solid boosters at first stage. You may notice that adding more fuel is sometimes bad idea (rocket will spend more fuel because of extra weight of that added fuel). Try using LV-N engine for orbiting - it is super effective when it comes to fuel consumption in space, but it has weak thrust and it\u0027s heavy, so use it after gaining orbit. Use struts: those big engines can break stuff like radial decouplers and weight and acceleration can make link made with stack decoupler break too; your rocket should be stiff. If something big wobbles or moves during liftoff it means it needs struts (or better design... well that means more struts too). Extra weight of struts will payback easily - less stable rocket uses more fuel because of extra steering with thrust it requires to fly straight, at least this is my experience (not ending up with huge explosion is also good thing).

Yes, there is a diminishing return on how much you can put into orbit as once; it\u0027s more often than not a limitation of your memory, though. The key is to have plenty of stages, to make sure you follow a fuel-optimal ascent (by keeping your speed close to Kerbin\u0027s terminal velocities), and to make sure your TWR is close to optimal the entire way up (1.2-2.5, I\u0027d say).
