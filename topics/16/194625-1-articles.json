You can observe this in action by strapping a heat shield to the bottom of a materials bay, setting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to retrograde hold\u00A0and dropping that into reentry from an elliptical trajectory: even though the heat shield fully shields the bay from compression heating, the bay will heat up to a dangerous level anyway because it\u0027s touching the yellow-hot heat shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf, however, you put something in the way like a service bay, that\u0027ll soak up the worst of the heat transfer so that the landing can will survive. Not only that, but the landing can\u0027s shape and thus drag means putting the landing can on the top rather than the bottom results in the craft self-stabilizing during reentry, pointing the heat shield prograde without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E having to hold it there.
