A few for instances:\n\nI went to Dres with a probe. Launched it to orbit, and calculated the maneuver. from there it was hundreds of days until it arrived at Dres\u0027 SOI, so I made an KAC alarm for few days before it hit the SOI and went back to the KSC to think of another mission.\n\nKAC tells me when transfer windows will be coming for various planets. Jool\u0027s might be coming up first, but I got Duna on my mind. Make a Duna ship, send it to LKO and go back to KSC and do something else. You can retake command of that ship, when the window for Duna comes up.\n\nLess timewarping gives you oodles of time before having to actually do something, so just get that imagination working and think of other goals.\n\nProper KAC usage is key here, because you\u0027ll have several to-do\u0027s hanging around and you have to make sure not to miss them."},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T17:16:32Z","Content":"So should I basically be sending something out every transfer window, and then doing stuff with the mun and minmus in between?"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T17:19:58Z","Content":"You can skip windows if you have no interest in going there, to be sure; they\u0027ll just take awhile to come around again. You don\u0027t need to wait for the windows either, you just need a much bigger spaceship to get to the destination if you leave outside a window.\n\nThe fun part of this is you\u0027ll get an alarm to do something for XYZ craft headed for ABC and you\u0027ll have forgotten even building it. \n\n\u0022Oh wow, hey, there\u0027s that Eloo probe I forgot about, it almost arrived!\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"ClF3","CreatedById":148396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T17:42:48Z","Content":"Send a Flotilla to Duna! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nhttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70026-Flotillas-A-Primer-in-3-Chapters"},{"CreatedByName":"JetJaguar","CreatedById":146965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T18:13:06Z","Content":"Maybe try the [Construction Time mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92377-1-0-x-Kerbal-Construction-Time-1-1-8-%2806-18-15%29-Unrapid-Planned-Assembly). It makes time a resource that also needs to be managed by making everything take time to complete. Vessels take time to build, building upgrades time to complete, research time to unlock, and so on. It will get you to focus on scheduling and fly concurrent missions because otherwise there will be long periods when nothing is getting done. A life support mod will also force you to focus on mission duration since you will have to think ahead and plan accordingly."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T19:24:40Z","Content":"I find it comes naturally. As segments of multi part missions complete, new contacts become available. I can accept , launch, and complete LKO contracts mid Munar mission and Munar contracts mid Minmus mission.\n\nThat doesn\u0027t include the infrastructure I build for myself.\n\nI set up at least one high accuracy Keosynchronus satilite over KSC for a good ship to timewarp from.\n\nI also set up a ring of small (sub 30 part) fuel depots in a 100 km orbit for LKO fuel logistics. No craft returns with any full tanks.\n\nI utilize station contracts to place labs around bodies. They come with landers to keep the data maxed.\n\nI\u0027m currently getting my tug network to the point where I can keep reentry heads (Claw with parachutes, RCS, and docking port) on station at bodies to cut rescue/recover mission time in half!\n\nI have so much going on, several of my SSTO lifter missions can wait up to an in game day for the 25 min window needed to land.\n\nOnce I launch my Duna exploration, I expect to use time warp for longer periods.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T19:27:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 07:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T19:31:48Z","Content":"I normally like to keep my alarms 30 minutes apart but even in Kerbins SOI it takes 9 days for a ship to get to Minimus.

I am using a single vessel to conplete some Mun/Minmud missions involving tourists, astronauts, and rescues.\n\nLast night I launched a lander can with 8 command seats on it, and enough fuel to get to minmus. It was a two part with a command module of two cans and the lander part with a can and seats. Goal was to complete some contracts but also take a team of astronauts on mun orbit and minmus landing to train them up to level 3.\n\nThe two cans in command module held two tourists that wanted a mun orbit.\n\nI first rescued 3 astronauts. In one case after rescuing one, a minor maneuver gave me a intersect with anothet rewcue orbit. Rather than spend a bunch of fuel matching orbit, I burned retro a bit to halfway match, then switched to the rescue astronaut and used EVA to chase down and board the vessel, since EVA is really efficient. It was a challenge because I wizzed by at 200 m/s but had plenty EVA left to catch up.\n\nI went back to LKO docked with space station to refuel. Now I will be off to Mun for an orbit then to Minmus to land, plant flags for xp, and do a few crew reports.\n\nI have several contracts I will complete in visiting Minmus because I\u0027ve essentially been conpleting others and letting them accumulate.\n\nNot only that but my newly rescued astronauts will get some XP before they get back to Kerbal."}]}
