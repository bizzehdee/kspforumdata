planet get randomized every time you start a new game. \u00A0Thus, it\u0027s never QUITE the same for any 2 players, or even the same player in 2 different games. \u00A0And as \u003Ca

difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, observations from playing (and poking around in the Ore.cfg file) indicate the following general things...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe sun, Jool, and all oceans are hard-coded to have zero ore\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nElsewhere, ore concentrations are based on biomes. \u00A0IOW, Biome A has some average concentration no matter where that biome appears on the planet, while Biome B has a different concentration.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn any given planet, the biomes with the highest ore concentrations tend to be 1) those with the highest terrain elevations (mountains, highlands) 2) the poles,\u00A0and 3) those with the lowest terrain elevations (Minmus flats, lowlands, crater bottoms), in that order. \u00A0Although there are exceptions. \u00A0Biomes with medium terrain elevations (which usually make up the majority of the surface) tend to have negligible ore concentrations.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWithin a given biome, the ore concentration may vary slightly from place to place. \u00A0This usually follows the same elevation trend as the biomes themselves. \u00A0IOW, if the lowlands have a relatively high concentration for the planet, then the lowest places within the lowlands biome will usually have slightly higher concentrations than the rest of the lowlands.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlanets with more dirt/stone/metal in their make-up tend to have higher concentrations in all their biomes than do icy planets. \u00A0IOW, the best concentrations on Dres will be average or poor\u00A0compared to what you usually find on Mun.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe maximum concentration you\u0027ll find in any biome\u00A0without \u0026gt;100% abundance setting is 15%. \u00A0But I\u0027ve never found more than about 11% once in a while. \u00A0Usually, 8-9% is the best you\u0027ll see, and even that is fairly uncommon. \u00A0Mostly, you\u0027ll find 1-3% unless you do a bit of prospecting.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, even with those guidelines, you still have to prospect. \u00A0And don\u0027t expect to exploit the highest concentrations on any given planet because those are usually in very inconvenient, even inaccessible, places (mountains and poles). \u00A0What you usually end up with\u00A0is the highest concentration\u00A0available in a convenient location. \u00A0Convenience means on reasonably flat ground and usually on or near the equator, depending on local gravity and the dV cost of inclination changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 1st thing you need to do is get a biome map of the planet. \u00A0If you don\u0027t have SCANsat, then you have to use the ALT-F12 menu to display biomes in the map view. \u00A0Then you need to determine the ore concentrations in the convenient biomes by prospecting with the Surface Scanner and/or NBS (or use SCANsat with stock resource scanning disabled). \u00A0Then pick the best biomes that are conveniently located and scout them out on the ground for a flat place to build your base on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wrote a tutorial on the whole prospecting process. \u00A0The link is in my
