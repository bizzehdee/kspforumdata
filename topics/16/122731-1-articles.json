It went something like 110m/s for 1000m, 120m/s for 2000m, 160m/s for 5000m, 260m/s for 10000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember testing full burns vs controlled burns, and noticed that it is more efficient to follow this chart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is, I now restarted the game, and am experimenting with the basic solid boosters. I am finding that it is less efficient to lower the thrust limiter on the bacc thumper booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 100% thrust, it gets me a 42 second burn, to an altitude of about 296 000m. If I do a 75% thrust limit burn, I get ~56 second burn, altitude of 267 000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone explain why the 75% doesn\u0027t get me higher? I\u0027m sure it\u0027s something obvious I\u0027m overlooking. The pattern above is also true the more you lower the thrust ( I tried it at 50% thrust as well)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T16:13:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDifferent atmospheric model compared to the souposphere before 1.0.

But then again, this will depend on the design of your rocket: if your first stage is huge, you might end up having a TWR of 10 at 10km, and on the other side, if it\u0027s small compared to the rocket, you might never get over 3 with full throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T16:26:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 04:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaarst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StevenRS11","CreatedById":83261,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T16:54:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGetting a totally optimized ascent profile is very hard, but getting a good one isn\u0027t so bad. You really have two things to balance- air resistance and gravity losses. Obviously, you loose energy to the air whenever you are in it depending on how fast you go. You loose energy to gravity whenever your acceleration vector is not perpendicular to gravity, aka non sideways. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a airless environment, you want to accelerate at the maximum possible rate at the maximum possible horizontal angle that keeps you from impacting terrain. So from say minmus, you pretty much thrust a tiny bit up and then just go sideways. You want to minimize the time in which you accelerating against gravity. If you want, its fun to hyperedit launches from Tylo and practice a bit there. With only a single variable, its really easy to optimize your \u0027gravity turn\u0027. Put a single mainsail under a single orange tank and get the maximum velocity you can before you reach your apoapsis. That\u0027s pretty close to the optimal turn for that TWR ratio on Tylo. It gives you a good intuitive feel for what\u0027s \u0027right\u0027. If you want to be even more precise about it, build a rocket with 3,100 m/s dv and escape tylo. That allows for only ~30 m/s of gravity losses, or just 4 short seconds of thrusting directly against gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccounting for air resistance isn\u0027t that hard if you guess and check. At various heights during your launch, quicksave, throttle all the way down, and look at your accelerometer. Any acceleration you see is caused by air resistance, and if its greater than the fraction of the gravity vector that\u0027s opposing your thrusting vector, its probably much. Atmospheric drag should ideally be 1/5 to 1/10th of the gravity drag, with smaller rockets having more atmospheric drag relative to gravity drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso don\u0027t forget that any signifigant angle of attack drastically increases your atmospheric drag. I generally try to use fixed winglets on my rockets and use very limited thrust vectoring to start my gravity turn. My best launches are when I don\u0027t have to do anything but stage after that. The less steering the better, especially in denser atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T17:34:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 05:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by StevenRS11\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T18:57:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, now we have a realistic atmosphere drag losses aren\u0027t a concern. Ascent speed tends to instead be limited by aerodynamic instability. Many rockets are mildly unstable aerodynamically and if you fly too fast too low you\u0027ll flip out of control, slowing down reduces the aerodynamic forces. Many real rockets including the Space Shuttle throttle down to reduce \u0022Max Q\u0022, as the maximum aerodynamic stress is known. Practical launch TWR is also limited, in real life and KSP alike, because engines are heavy and cost money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA wide range of liftoff TWRs can work. Looking at real rockets the Saturn V had 1.15 TWR on the pad, while the Space Shuttle had rather higher.

That said, I\u0027ll sometimes add a few short burning SRBs for my rockets that have a TWR under 1.25 so they get a bit of aerodynamic stability going sooner. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I usually play with FAR, and lately RSS.
