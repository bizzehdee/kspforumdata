Sometimes I just cannot get it to fit back together after this happens. I have had to scrap 2 rockets today that took me probably half an hour each, and all because I moved half the ship with a stray click and couldn\u0027t piece it back together after. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECtrl \u002B Z is listed as being undo, yet I press it and it does nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weegee","CreatedById":72084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T22:45:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you drop the detached part before trying to undo? Sometimes that is a problem. Also, sometimes it seems to take multiple Ctrl-z\u0027s in a row to undo it.

It happens to me too. Just discard the selected part to the left side and press Ctrl-Z to undo. The animated Kerbals in the background should freeze for a few seconds and you should have your ship back to the state it was in before you grabbed the wrong part. You might have to reapply whatever the last part was like struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T23:36:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBest approach if this happens:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1: press Delete key. The part you\u0027re holding disappears\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2: press Control-Z. It may take a short while, but the part should appear back where it was before\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen picking up struts, you need to point your mouse at the place where the strut starts and you need to achieve the state when only the strut is highlighted, not the part to which it is attached.
