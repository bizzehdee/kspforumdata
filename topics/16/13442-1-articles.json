However, it doesn\\\u0027t work well with struts. Placing the base of the strut is easy because it snaps to angles, but the other end of the strut, as far as I can tell, won\\\u0027t snap to anything so you are forced to to eyeball it. This is rubbish because I\\\u0027m very picky about my rockets being symmetrical, and so is physics.

I have always been frustrated with this, but never questioned the fact you are unable to snap the second end of a strut to an angle. I really hope it is fixed with in an upcoming update, but, as it isn\\\u0027t game breaking in any way, it shall unlikely be classed as a priority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you may have guessed from ^all that^, no- I don\\\u0027t know any way to snap them to angles.
