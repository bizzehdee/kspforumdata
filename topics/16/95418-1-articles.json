The offset\u0027s stored as a vector of three separate floats, each of which has its own floating point errors. The larger the magnitude (\u0022distance\u0022) of that vector, the larger each of the floats is, which means the errors are larger, and so have a larger impact on the physics. Then of course there\u0027s the relative rotations, converting all that back to the world coordinates, etc. It\u0027s obviously a bit more complicated than that, but let\u0027s really not get into the technical issues of floating point numbers.
