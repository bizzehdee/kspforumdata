A rather unique and nice looking one. So I went for like the 6th test and I got some phantom shove off the back of the runway. I went again and took off. 1 minute, 41 seconds in, I am attacked by the kraken, killing Jeb and obliterating the plane. Can anyone tell me what the h3ll just happened?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027m only climbing at about 15-20* and this time it hit me at 30 seconds in. There are some wierd forces acting on this plane. I may have to try it with FAR and see if that helps (If FAR doesn\u0027t destroy it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT II: According to the log, pretty much every joint in the craft instantly breaks at 30 seconds.
