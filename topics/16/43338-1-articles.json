One in the center, and 4 around it. I am using asparagus staging, so this cuts down to 3 engines/fuel tanks, and then ultimately the one left in the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is that when it is time to decouple the first and second group of engines/fuel tanks, one still has some fuel left in it, as I\u0027m watching the fuel gauges at launch, one is burning fuel quicker than the other. This causes 2 problems, one when I decouple as soon as one of these tanks depletes it fuel, they are jettisoned and the one with fuel in shoots of like a bullet and hits another part of my rocket. The other problem, if I wait for the second one to empty then I keel over due to excessive thrust on one side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any reason 2 identical fuel tanks/engines would use fuel at different rates? This also happens for the 2 asparagus decoupling. I\u0027ve tried to modify the build but to no avail, at the moment I\u0027m having to use Seperatrons to push them far enough away from the rocket that it doesn\u0027t damage it, but then the backlash from the engine destroys some other part of my rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an image for clarity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o7JITuV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022o7JITuV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T07:38:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have probably accidentally added fuel lines with the wrong symmetry specified, creating multiple paths for fuel to get from the outer to the inner engines.

That seems weird, but more importantly does not allow for fuel crossfeed. And right now it even seems to me from the picture you actually have a fuel line leading to that decoupler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure all your fuel lines are exactly symmetrical, and try leading them from the pancake tanks to the orange tanks, going from the first asparagus stage pancake tank to the second stage orange tank, then from the second stage pancake tank to the central orange tank. Then allow fuel crossfeed on your central stack decoupler before launch, and you should be fine. The problem is most likely related to fuel flow, so you want to lay the pipes with in mind that fuel always comes from the farthest tank first. You want asparagus-1-orange to be the farthest, then asparagus-1-pancake, then asparagus-2-orange, then asparagus-2-pancake, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively you could assign an action group rather than using the spacebar to stage, with in the action group the decouple command along with the \u0027engine shutdown\u0027 command.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T17:12:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, fuel lines are most likely messed up somewhere.
