This will shift your CoM further back towards your tail making your plane very nose light and unstable. Ideally you want your CoL just behind your CoM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this is a bit further back than I would care for it is about where you would want it for a stable flight profile at subsonic speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jLOGWfl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jLOGWfl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CoL shifts back towards the tail at supersonic speeds so that is something to be aware of when designing a craft, this affect is often called \u0022Mach Tuck\u0022. There is a very simple way of getting around this, design your craft with one half full or empty tank near the rear of your craft, so when you reach supersonic speeds you can shift your fuel load shifting it back to keep it stable at supersonic speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fix your craft would be pretty simple, lose the canards at the nose, they are just shifting your CoL forwards to much. If your CoL is to far to the back of the craft, then move your wings forward a bit, or widen the base of then a bit. You will also want to check your FAR information screen, all of the numbers in the second tab on the top should be in the green at .35 all the way up to mach 2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have something that is just slightly in the red you will be ok, but if something is showing more than \u002B2 then you have an issue and should go back to fine tuning the design. Ultimately for a highly nimble craft you want your numebers pretty close to zero but still in the negatives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT #2- One last thing, I would move the rear landing gear forward towards your CoM. The are the pivot point for when you are rotating your nose up to get off the ground. The further back they are the harder it is to lift the nose, because you will be pushing the gear into the ground. Most aircraft rotate around the CoL so if you place your gear almost directly under that you should be fine. But do it after you move your CoL to be just behind your CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-30T16:17:25Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2014 04:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperTechmarine","CreatedById":130494,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-30T20:27:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill try that tomorrow.
