One option is to do a quicksave and experiment. However, I know there are much more experienced Jebadites out there who already are yelling out the answers to their computer screens. Now is the time for them to speak out and share their knowledge. Otherwise, I am going to subject a poor kerbal to a deja vu nightmare as I experiment with him with repeated fiery deaths until a perfect trajectory is achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dudester28","CreatedById":61717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T22:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you want to land on kerbin or just lower your apoapsis?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to land, there is no deadly re-entry (yet) in vanilla ksp.
