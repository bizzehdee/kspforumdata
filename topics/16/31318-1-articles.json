The main orbit should be a high Mun equatorial orbit, the second should have an Ap equal to the main orbit, but be a quater of the main orbits orbital period. The point is to allow me to deploy a sat, and circulaize at Ap, leaving the deploy vehicle to make 1 orbit and be ready to deploy the next sat at a 90 degree angle to the first. 4 orbits, would mean a 4 sats equally spaced along the main orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is how would I go about figuring out what orbits would work, without using trial and error. I know the orbital period needs to be a 1/4 ratio (deploy orbit / final) but I am lost as to what figures, equations I would need.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Banbite","CreatedById":5170,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T17:31:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a great use for keplers third law: (orbital period)^2 is proportional to (semi major axis)^3, or T^2=k*a^3 where k is an arbitrary constant which is the same for all orbits around a body. I just did something similar but with 3 instead of 4 satellites so I know this works. So math:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing your problem the second orbit should actually have a orbital period that is 3/4 of the equitorial orbit, so T2 = 3/4*T1 where T1 is the orbital period of the equitorial orbit and T2 is the period of the \u0022deploy\u0022 orbit. This will make the satellite end up 90 degrees in front of the other satellite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives that T1^2/a1^3 = T2^2/a2^3 =\u0026gt; (T2/T1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3 which gives: a2=(T2/T1)^(2/3)*a1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives us the ratio between the \u0022final orbit\u0022 and the \u0022deploy orbit\u0022, and if T2/T1=3/4 then a2=(3/4)^(2/3)*a1 = 771/934*a1 = 0.8255*a1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo see what this gives for Pe for the deploy orbit use the following formula: a = (Pe \u002B Ap \u002B 2*R)/2, where R is the radius of the body, for the Mun R = 200km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming the \u0022final orbit\u0022 is circular the Pe of the \u0022deploy orbit\u0022 gets:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea1 = Ap\u002BR; a2 = (Pe \u002B Ap \u002B 2*R)/2; a2=0.8255*a1;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPe = 2*0.8255*(Ap \u002B R) -Ap - 2*R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: If your final orbit has an altitude of 500km then your Pe becomes: Pe = 2*0.8255*(500 \u002B 200) - 500 - 2*200 = 255.7 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust punch in your own Ap to get your value of Pe. When you\u0027re deploying the satellites you can make one orbit with the first, two orbits with the second, and three orbits with the third and you should have everyone in a nice 90 degree separation. Or you can redo the calculations with T2/T1 = 1/2 and 1/4 and do everything in one orbit, but you\u0027re likely to crash on the 1/4 one if you\u0027re Ap is to low.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"duncan1297","CreatedById":57230,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T17:33:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chocki","CreatedById":61241,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T18:03:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022duncan1297\u0022 data-cite=\u0022duncan1297\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI almost feel the same way, but I got formulas, and understood most of it.
