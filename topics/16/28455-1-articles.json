BTW, As far as I know transparent backgrounds do not work. Granted I have my graphic settings low because it gets a bit laggy on my laptop, so maybe transparency would work better with the graphics set higher.. One of these days I\u0027ll build a new desktop, currently its barely ever used, over 7years old and down to one ram stick, plus the version of Linux doesn\u0027t like the video card so its stuck with generic drivers. Haven\u0027t tried KSP on it yet but I digress..... I just copied one of the stock flags to the folder I mentioned (in my case I made it GameData\\Sma\\Flags\\) then opened it in GIMP cleared what was there saved it as both png and xcf (so I could make another at a later time). Then just created the flag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T14:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.wcnews.com/chatzone/attachments/screenshot3-png.6369/\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot3-png.6369\u0022\u003E\n"}]}
