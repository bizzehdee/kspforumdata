A Kerbal on EVA can build struts to connect the parts where the last docking port won\u0027t join.

When you start using multiple Claws, things can still get weird. At least that\u0027s the impression I\u0027ve gotten from building MKS bases using the Claw-like parts in that mod, so instead I use the MKS version of KAS pipes, which seem to be more reliable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, KSP seems to dislike ring-shaped things a lot. Even if you can get them to connect up, there are usually Kraken problems with them. It might be better to have all the radial sections connect directly to the central hub, then go back later and connect the radial parts to each other using KAS struts or pipes, including the MKS version of the pipes which look more appropriate for stations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T22:40:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo days in and still no proper answer... I\u0027ll try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your problem is multi-docking in and of itself: You need to come in with *all* ports lined up very well, to a tolerance of less than one degree. If you can eyeball that, kudos to you. Otherwise, I can only point you to mods that will help: have either Mechjeb\u0027s Smart A.S.S. handle the rotation for you (that\u0027s what I do, works a treat) or at least use some kind of docking port alignment indicator.
