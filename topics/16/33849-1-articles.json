Then, put a radial attachment point or an I-beam right on top of the decoupler and try to align it as close as possible with the center of mass. Then, put a fuel tank above it and then mount some engines radially to that and you have a skycrane! Also, put a remote guidance unit on it so, once the base module is landed and the skycrane is decoupled, you can crash the skycrane into the surface to leave no debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: It should look something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zTpNVdW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zTpNVdW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see that the I-beam is aligned with the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kmRtVRm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kmRtVRm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here is an example \u0022skycrane\u0022 that, once the module is landed, will decouple from the radial decoupler and crash into the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-20T14:19:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2013 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by rryy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"onlinegamesz","CreatedById":70808,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T14:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes it works!
