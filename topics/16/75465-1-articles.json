Though my knowledge is limited, I know the basic principles of building air-or spaceplanes, but one thing I can\u0027t seem to get right is the high altitude stability. Starting at ~12000m, the thing starts stalling very easily when I make even slight movements (and is also unrecoverable once its out of control). I really can\u0027t find an explanation for this, maybe it has something to do with the very large wings who are not suited for supersonic speeds?

I\u0027m pretty sure it was lack of yaw control that was the problem before, the COM is very far back and there was only one control surface trying to keep yawing in check, while it was doing that it induced a roll as it is necessarily above the COM. The same tail fin had also roll activated so it tried to counteract the roll and as a result didn\u0027t do anything as the plane turned into a slip and then bad things happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I did was this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I slightly angled the wings upwards to improve general stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I made the control surfaces on the wing only act on roll input, the aft horizontal stabilizers work only on pitch input. I would suggest never to mix these two things on large aircraft. Same with yaw and roll on one control surface, as described above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. As I believe lack of yaw authority to be the main problem here I doubled the tail fin and also angled the canards 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and doubled them too. Canards now act on pitch and yaw inputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Added flaps to the wing and changed the landing gear so take off is not so dangerous. Also did some beautifying on the wing, couldn\u0027t help it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

Once in the high atmosphere where the control surfaces stop working well the drag from the twin tail fins trys to pitch the craft up which can flip you if you do not counteract it with RCS.

Also craft no longer had fuel to fly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolution: Angle wings in the most extreme fashion so COL comes forward, clip wings like a mad man to hide the ugly seams and \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eclip\u003C/span\u003E embed fuel in the wing-root. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI present, Lifting Cargo in style*:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rkiOMJL.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rkiOMJLl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rkiOMJLl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8Bca2Uu.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8Bca2Uul.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228Bca2Uul.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Mind, I have not jet attempted to lift any cargo at all, I fear with higher take off weight a second SABRE engine will be needed...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-20T01:35:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2014 01:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by the_bT\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"i like turtles","CreatedById":169426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T08:07:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might be easier to add more rockets so your TWR is more than 1\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"i like turtles","CreatedById":169426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T08:21:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow did you get your SABRE engines to work?
