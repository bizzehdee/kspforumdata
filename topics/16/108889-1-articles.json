You need reputation for good contracts, you need good contracts for lots of funds and science rewards, you need funds to go places and you need to go places to do science. Really as long as you don\u0027t have excessive amounts of funds it\u0027s not worth converting them and you always need reputation.\n\nThe best way to get huge amounts of science in my experience is to launch a refuelable lander with ~1200 m/s of dV with full tanks to the mun (or minmus) and then hop from biome to biome. Or, for even more science stick some capsules in orbit, rendezvous, transfer the science to them and send them back to kerbin for 100% return rate.\n\nWith such a lander I maxed out the stock tech tree in about 5 days using only transmissions and a science lab to increase transmission value a little (after I had LV-N\u0027s to get 5600 m/s dV ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T12:15:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 12:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T12:12:22Z","Content":"One quick method in the early game is to put a crewed ship in a somewhat inclined orbit low over the Mun, Minmus or Kerbin. Grab all the experimental science you can, and as you pass over each biome leave the ship and do an EVA report. You can get full science from each one and transmit them home with no losses. This should give you enough to unlock mobile labs, which will generate all the science you need to get through the 300 and into the 550 science level. At that point you will be sending your first crewed missions to Duna or Eve orbit, where EVA reports and mobile labs should be enough to finish the tree."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T12:36:16Z","Content":"In my experience, Reputation is the first currency you fill up on, because it naturally comes with diminishing returns. You get all of the stated reputation payout only at 0 reputation (neutral) and from then on it decreases. You get 50% of the payout at 500 reputation, 25% of the payout at 750 reputation, and so on... Plus, above maybe 500 to 600 points the contracts don\u0027t really get noticably better anymore.\n\nSo I usually grab a reputation converting strategy once I am somewhere above 700 rep, with a committment level chosen so the one-time investment cost doesn\u0027t drop me below 500. I generally convert it to cash because science is so excessively overabundant, and finishing the stock tree without even visiting Minmus (much less another planet) is so effortless, that it just doesn\u0027t make sense to convert anything into science. Funds never become useless, especially not later in the game when even the most basic throwaway cash-generating contracts ask multi-year interplanetary missions of you."},{"CreatedByName":"Pax Kerbana","CreatedById":129558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T12:50:06Z","Content":"Alt\u002BF12\n\nI was hoping the tech tree would be a little better for 1.0.x but it is not... How can you have a capsule without having batteries designed? I\u0027m not a fan of how the have it now. There is little point in dicking around on Kerbin to get enough \u0022science\u0022 to design a battery.\n\nI\u0027m really hopefull that Squad spends time to revamp the career for next release. Yes we would like some other things like parts, etc., but career just isn\u0027t fun anymore. And do I even need to mention the cost for Kerbals?!!

I can provide you a step-by-step guide if you like, I started a new 1.02 save just this past weekend. The only Kerbin biomes I touched are those I launch out of (launchpad, shores) and the ones my rockets randomly happened to come down in (grasslands, water). All other science was pure rocketry based.

Oh believe me there is about 1000science in KSC. Send them into orbit and process. Get atleast 4 scientists and make sure their levels are 2\u002B. Fast forward and enjoy the science. When the data level goes down just add more data from KSC since there will be about 100 science reports on your hand you can\u0027t even use them all the lab just gets filled with 500 data. This way i got about 4000 science from start... I know its cheesy but yeah... Then continiued to mun and minmus moving the science lab to their orbits.

It\u0027s fairly simple to pull a few thousand science points out of a single Mun or Minmus landing. If you\u0027re still stuck on Kerbin...well, get to orbit and start collecting EVA reports.\n\nYou can make orbit with only the first two tech nodes unlocked, without any building upgrades. For example:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Visit each building and do a crew report, an EVA report, science and goo study. Each building should net you around 15-20 science IIRC. You can create a cheap vehicle to do this with at the space-plane hangar with a jet engine and a tiny fuel tank. Just keep the speed low. I recently tapped one of the street lights outside of mission control at around 8 m/s, and to my surprise the entire building exploded - only an unharmed plane and a startled scientist left in the wreckage. Later on you can slap some decent thrust on and do a quick survey of the biomes nearby. Highlands, Grasslands, Oceans, Shores, and Mountains will all yield fresh science. Unlock the thermometer and barometer at the first available opportunity. Also, surface samples yield a ton of data, so upgrading science center should be a priority.\n\nAfterwards, you can build some very cheap probes. All it takes is a cheap auto-pilot with a small fuel tank and efficient engine, attached to a decent sized booster. Slap on a couple solar panels, some batteries, the thermometer and barometer, some goo, a science lab, and a radio. You can do the science lab once per flight - but thermometer and barometer can be done over and over. Probing Duna wasn\u0027t too hard early in the tech tree, and yielded good results. It\u0027s also not difficult to probe both Mun and Minmus on a single flight, and sending it off into solar orbit (which yields good science results).\n\nOtherwise, taking a lander to Minmus can be done fairly early, and provides a ton of research. You can even visit multiple biomes per visit, as gravity is so low. Mun is a bit more difficult, as it takes so much more fuel to land and all that."},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowDragon8685","CreatedById":65374,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:54:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Oh you ... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nIt is kind of oxymoronic to run a space agency where all you do is graze space, but it is a strategy, and it\u0027s been working out surprisingly well for me.\n\nSee, once you get to orbit, the reputation rewards for going on a suborbital trip go down significantly, but if, before you go to orbit, you can send 8 Kerbals up on suborbital hops in one craft (use hitchhiker containers), you can easily clear four suborbital tourism contracts in one launch.\n\nWith 60% commitment to intern usury, and mission reputation rewards which are nominally somewhere north of 20 points, it\u0027s fairly easy for me to bring home ~30-40 science in one suborbital hop that takes relatively little time to complete."}]}
