Kerbals duplicated and bugged out my game!","CreatedByName":"LuckyGentleman","CreatedById":205566,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-19T15:28:11Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"LuckyGentleman","CreatedById":205566,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-19T15:28:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello Guys, I have a Problem and need your advice/ help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI played the Career Mode for the second time and as I knew how to build efficient rockets and how to play the missions fast, I wanted to take as many tourists on the same Mission as possible. So I took off with around 15 Kerbal Tourists (and a pilot) on a relative small spacecraft with external commmdoseats. I took them to Mun, orbited and then went on to Minimus, landed and headed back to Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMeanwhile I started another small mission to rescue a kerbal from low kerbin orbit... but then i realised that the tourists where back in the space center... I could choose them again and take them on other missions!?!\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI didnt think much about it and told myself thats surels just a display bug and continued the mission to take the tourists home.\u003Cbr\u003E\nafter a difficult and slow reentry (I had to refuel the spacecraft tho, otherwise they would have burned in the atmosphere\u00A0:P) I landed safely and ended the mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe normal After-Mission screen appeared with the 3 info tabs (600 Science in a single Mission, I was really proud!) but then the game bugged. I couldnt enter the assembly hall anymore and most other buildings too. I also couldn\u0027t save the game at this point, the screen just froze and I couldn\u0027t even close it other than Alt \u002B F4...\u003Cbr\u003E\nI restarted the game and the autosave took me to the landing on kerbin, so i told myself if I just start another rocket and take all the duplicated kerbals on that rocket there must be space for the originals then... but the same bug came up... Now I have no Idea how to continue and what to do...\u003Cbr\u003E\nI dont want to kill the Kerbals as the mission is worth at least 1.7 mio. and as said, 600 Science Points.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny Idea how to solve that? Did someone had similar issues? Does it have to do with my PC maybe..?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks a lot for any help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T07:26:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/205566-luckygentleman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022205566\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/205566-luckygentleman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@LuckyGentleman\u003C/a\u003E, welcome to the Forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems that your space program was closed down by the Kerbin Space Tourism Agency after complaints that you gave paying tourists that booked a pressurized business class cabin only a lawn chair to hold onto during their trip to the Mun. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nO.K. I think it is essentially a bug that allows you to place tourists in the external command seats during launch. Tourists are not supposed to be able to do EVA and sitting in that seat is technically an EVA. On the other hand, I did try to reproduce that bug and I also got the duplicated tourists (in the chairs and in the astronaut complex) but my game didn\u0027t bug out when I recovered the tourists, but instead completed the contract and removed the duplicates from the astronaut complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you use any mods?
