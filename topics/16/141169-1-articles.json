My transfer ship has a science lab. With the new science lab, if you process an experiment you don\u0027t \u0022get it back\u0022 to be recovered like before. My question is, should I keep this science and recover it or process it in the lab on my way home?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-04T03:30:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2016 03:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by A_name\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T03:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t used the MPL in 1.1.x so can\u0027t judge how the mechanics work these days. \u00A0But I would say that at Duna, processing is probably the better option. \u00A0Processing in the lab always gives you more science than the experiment is worth alone, but it takes a lot of time. \u00A0Therefore, I\u0027ve never found the MPL useful at Mun or Minmus because the time needed to acquire the science is (or at least was) very much less than the time to process it. \u00A0However, at Duna, you have to wait for the transfer window home, then make the long trip, so \u00A0you might have the time needed to do something useful with the MPL. \u00A0And if you\u0027ve dragged it all the way out there, you might as well use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T03:56:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222615664\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141169\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465011870\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269507\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, Geschosskopf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t used the MPL in 1.1.x so can\u0027t judge how the mechanics work these days. \u00A0But I would say that at Duna, processing is probably the better option. \u00A0Processing in the lab always gives you more science than the experiment is worth alone, but it takes a lot of time. \u00A0Therefore, I\u0027ve never found the MPL useful at Mun or Minmus because the time needed to acquire the science is (or at least was) very much less than the time to process it. \u00A0However, at Duna, you have to wait for the transfer window home, then make the long trip, so \u00A0you might have the time needed to do something useful with the MPL. \u00A0And if you\u0027ve dragged it all the way out there, you might as well use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea of taking the lab originally was to get some free science from spent experiments in and around Kerbin and in solar orbit on my way there.
