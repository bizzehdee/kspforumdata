Unfortunately KSP does not differentiate by device for inputs, so pressing button 1 on my joystick will trigger whatever button 1 on my throttle is assigned to. I didn\u0027t have this problem before, as I had a T.Flight Hotas X, which both throttle and joystick are counted as one device, so all inputs are different. Do any of you know a program or way to get around this problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
