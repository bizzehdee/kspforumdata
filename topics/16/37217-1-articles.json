It took me that much just to match inclination ( more I think. Over 1k ) Then the burn to Moho took me several thousand m/s of d-v. THEN the 2200m/s for capture. So that leads me to believe I\u0027m doing it wrong. From 80km LKO I burn prograde just until SoI change to get the most circular Kerbol orbit as I can. Then at Mohos ( or any other planets ) AN/DN I perform the inclination burn. Then at the the right phase angle ( -151 degrees for Moho I believe ) I make the transfer burn. And...it fails everytime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Every ship I construct for a landing and return ends up using every last drop in just getting to the target planets surface.

I use them for my return stages, but the problem I find with nukes is there too large. You try to stack multiple stages with nuke engines and the next thing you know you have yourself a wobbly skyscraper...So besides the hardware issues how exactly is the person who made this chart conducting his burns? Do you burn straight out of LKO to intercept? Because even with the right phase I have too much trouble tweaking my nodes for an intercept.

What you want is an inclination change of less than 7 degrees, which you can accomplish by setting up your transfer ellipse, then burning at the far end from Moho, near Kerbin, when you\u0027re going slowest and you can use the long axis of the orbit ellipse as a lever.
