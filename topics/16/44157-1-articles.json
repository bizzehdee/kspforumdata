It is very tricky in that I need to switch to the first stage before it crashes or disappears altogether and switch to the second stage and make sure it makes it to orbit. Once with Mission Control Mod the first stage of a 1.25 m fell and then a message came up asking if it should be recycled while it was still falling and I was focused on the first stage. \u0022Yes, dear god YES!\u0022 I said and click it, freeing me up to focus on the second stage, this would be great if the first stage only needs some \u0027shutes and is autorecycled, but alas I could not get this to happen again. Anyone have better experience with this, got it working such that it autorecycles the first stage for money consistently?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T12:55:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis should be in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forumdisplay.php/13-Add-on-Requests-and-Support\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAdd-on requests and support\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forumdisplay.php/19-General-Add-on-Affairs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGeneral Add-on affairs\u003C/a\u003E as it\u0027s not a gameplay question for stock or generic knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T12:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t this question be better suited in the mod\u0027s thread?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T17:20:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all i\u0027m using most stock parts, second of all that one innocent was so one of a kind I not sure what did it.
