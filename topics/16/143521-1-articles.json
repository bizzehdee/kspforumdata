I have a science lab connected to a mk1-2 command pod on the top, with a service bay containing all my science, and a heat shield on the bottom. I was dumb and I did not test the re-entry on it before the mission. I quick saved before re-entry, figuring if it blows up I could try it again until I get it right. The big mistake was not putting a reaction wheel or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on it as I was trying to reduce weight, once it gets to around 22-23km it loses control flips around and explodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advice for getting this thing back down safely?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"H3N7Y","CreatedById":166426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T03:03:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello Tylerd,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have had this problem many many times as well! I have a few\u00A0questions,\u00A0You are re-entering Kerbin right? How fast are you going? I would try to rotate as fast as you can to reduce heat. That is usually something that saves it. Do you have any parachutes too? I mean you are in a pickle and I rarely solve this problem myself...

In other words, tell your craft to hold retrograde and, as you approach the critical zone, press Q to roll. And keep it held down. Roll as fast as you can and don\u0027t stop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis approach is risky because you can no longer manually steer. However, if your craft was going to flip soon either way, that\u0027s not much of a loss. Meanwhile, the rapid roll will prevent a flip for a short while, because the craft continually changes orientation and therefore cannot move in the same direction for any length of time. It will cause a lot of wobble (and g-forces), but it should not completely reverse until aerodynamic forces overpower the roll. That can give you another couple kilometers of height loss and safe braking. Ideally you\u0027re slow enough to not burn up when you finally do flip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdrevik","CreatedById":114231,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-15T17:35:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you still have a docking port, I had something I couldn\u0027t bring down, so I got the inflatable ultra-large shield, tied it together with an RCU, a small fuel tank and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters and radial thrusters (and a docking ring). \u00A0 Launched it, matched orbits, docked it to the problem components, used the radial engines to de-orbit, then spun it around and inflated the shield. \u00A0 Having lots of batteries to run the reaction wheels to keep it pointed right is helpful (I think I added an extra reaction wheel, too, just to be sure). \u00A0 If you already have enough chutes on what you\u0027re bringing donw, you can just detach the shield craft when you slow down to 1000 m/s (or pop the chutes, then detach and watch it drop).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
