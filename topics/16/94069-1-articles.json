At around 20 km you want to gain speed flying horizontal anyway and need wings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding is an larger problem. My solution is to fly low and slow, then I activated two rocets at the nose to tip the plane vertical, this will also kill horizontal speed, release parachutes and you float down, use the engines to slow down to an soft landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was done with this x-wing spaceplane on Laythe.

My solution has been a \u0022puller\u0022 configuration. Its a bit ugly with a blunt nose (if only I could attach something to the shielded docking port in the editor), then attach something to the front of the nose and mount two rockets radially to that (with parts to give spacing if needed). I like to do a liquid fuel tank, and then have fuel lines going to radial mounted LFO tank with LF engines underneath. Underneath the LFO stage, I have SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it goes: SRBs fire, decouple, LF engines fire, and should get you to space, where you can decouple the spaceplane (or other big draggy thing that makes a rocket unstable if it is on the front) without causing problems (trying to decouple in the atmosphere can cause a lot of problems, obviously, if the detached part is in front of your, and you still need to thrust more).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I ended up doing that when I tried to launch this thing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-a-vie.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10313612_10102671965296953_5067007542813894530_n.jpg?oh=da626b53866779be25005188d907e080\u0026amp;oe=54FE8231\u0022 alt=\u002210313612_10102671965296953_5067007542813894530_n.jpg?oh=da626b53866779be25005188d907e080\u0026amp;oe=54FE8231\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BattleMetalChris","CreatedById":493,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T10:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I think you\u0027re right, it\u0027s a combination of COT being off-centre, and COT being behind the COL. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might try something like a Star Wars podracer tonight, with the orbiter behind the ascent stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
