That\u0027s because in a gravity field energy is a constant of motion, while the velocity obviously is not conserved. Sorry if this sounds confusing, but I\u0027m trying to make clear that you cannot directly add a velocity change done far away from a planet to a velocity change close to the planet, as between the maneuvers your velocity will have changed due to the movement through the gravity field which requires a certain amount of work (in that case kinetic energy). The total energy - your kinetic plus your potential energy - is conserved though, as gravity is a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Econservative force\u003C/a\u003E, so you can indeed sum up energy changes done at different positions within a gravity field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit 3: If you just want to enter orbit around a planet and stay there forever or leave again towards the same planet you came from, there are optimal altitudes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit 5: I\u0027ve been checking these numbers, and either the formula I derived in Edit 4 below isn\u0027t correct, or those numbers are outdated.

So it has no influence on the question of where to arrive in any given SOI if you are not planning to leave that SOI on a new trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs people have said, above, it depends what you want to do. And as people have said, above, there are optimal altitudes for certain things. And also, as people have said above, there are issues of kinetic vs potential energy to take into account.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, Tylo and Laythe are both massive moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo is bigger, obviously, but its SOI is much, much bigger. Therefore if you enter Tylo\u0027s SOI aiming for a grazing pass, it will have a long, long time to accelerate you as you fall almost vertically towards it. That means that if you want to capture, you\u0027ll benefit from the Oberth effect by aiming for a low-Pe pass but you\u0027ll have a huge amount of energy to shed. If you don\u0027t intend to land, grazing Tylo to capture might not be efficient if you enter the SOI slowly (because Tylo will have time to accelerate you massively). If you are already going fast as you enter Tylo\u0027s SOI, then it won\u0027t have time to accelerate you too much and a grazing pass is undoubtedly the cheapest way to capture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe, on the other hand, has a much smaller SOI. Therefore it makes little difference how fast you\u0027re coming in: it will always be cheap to capture and you should therefore maximise that by entering its SOI on a trajectory that comes as close as possible to its atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother way of looking at this is what soulsource was saying: there are optimal altitudes for things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you had a free choice of orbit around Kerbin, and you were going to Eve or Duna, you\u0027d want to choose something near the Mun\u0027s orbit. This is where the outward burn to Eve or Duna is the cheapest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince transfer orbits are entirely reversible, that means that if you are \u003Cem\u003Ecoming\u003C/em\u003E from Eve or Duna, and just want to get into a circular Kerbin orbit for minimum cost, you want to aim for the Mun and no lower, because a lower (circular) orbit will cost more. A lower pass around Kerbin will certainly be better just to capture into an eccentric orbit, but if you have a low TWR and can\u0027t really use those (extremely) few minutes at Kerbin Pe and want to get into a safe and stable orbit, you\u0027d be better off circularising just inwards of the Mun, it\u0027ll cost less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now I\u0027m wondering: was that the actual question? ; )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxL_1023","CreatedById":152317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T04:32:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn optimal altitude that high does not make much sense - it takes only about 200 m/s more to make a Duna transfer than just the burn to put your AP at the Mun\u0027s Orbit, let alone circularizing there than making the transfer again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T06:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso depends if the planet/moon has an atmosphere.
