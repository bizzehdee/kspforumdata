They will automatically draw heat from across the entire ship from any part that exceeds it\u0027s default threshold, operating on the assumption that the vessel has heat pipes throughout to facilitate the transfer. The static radiators will draw heat only from the part they are attached to (unless I misunderstand), and should be attached as closely to the source of heat as possible (if not directly to it.)\n\nHow many you need really depends on what you need them for. The LV-N\u0027s are currently the only major source of heat in stock, but there are mods out there that have some heavy heat generating parts. Per Roverdude, two of the medium radiator panels were sufficient to keep a Nuclear Lightbulb engine from exploding during a recent stream, which burns about 18 times hotter than an LV-N. You could probably get away with small panels for LV-N\u0027s.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T18:54:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Edax","CreatedById":147162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T21:20:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve been looking through the Wiki and there doesn\u0027t seem to be anything on how or when to use the new radiator parts.

There\u0027s also a smaller difference between core and skin temperature, but in my test case that difference wasn\u0027t very large even for the parent. **In effect, they increase the surface area of the parent**. Compared to fuel tanks of 16t and above, even the large panel doesn\u0027t provide much extra area, though. And anyway, radiation depends very much on temperature: in order to radiate well, a part has to be very hot. Which in this case means that the panel\u0027s parent has to be very hot -- a situation you probably want to avoid from the outset. Still, a panel or two may make the difference between a part going poof, or merely running dangerously hot. But as I said two sentences ago: if a part does not become dangerously hot, the panel will also have little to do.\n\n**\u0022Thermal control systems\u0022** (the extendable swivel type) gather heat from all over the vessel. They can easily be the hottest part on the ship and thus also radiate disproportional amounts of heat. For purposes of heat managment, it does not matter where you place them. However, they will break if they collide with other parts of your vessel, so you better make sure they have enough elbow room.\n\nSo far, it seems as if the fixed radiators were nearly useless. However, when in atmosphere they may also help with shedding heat through convection. Think of a nosecone that gets really hot during reentry and continues to dump heat into a nearby part long after you\u0027ve been through the worst of it. Or running a nuclear engine on a spaceplane, where nearby parts could conceivably become even hotter than the surrounding atmosphere. I did not test this, however.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T15:51:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 03:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"},{"CreatedByName":"marce","CreatedById":110351,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T15:42:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If I may add a question:\n\u003E Are radiators bugged?
