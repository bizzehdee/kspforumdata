It\u0027s either 2 sided or no symmetry, and wings are infuriating for a beginner without those options. Did I do something wrong in the settings? Is there something specific I have to do? Why don\u0027t I have 4-sided symmetry?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-12T02:50:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2014 02:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Zunee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T02:40:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using the Space Plane Hangar (SPH), you only have the \u0022no symmetry\u0022 and \u00222x symmetry\u0022 options. That\u0027s because classic airplane designs are typically symmetric in this manner (along the nose-\u0026gt;tail axis). If you did 4x symmetry, the wings would be coming out of the top and bottom of the airplane also, which doesn\u0027t do much for you in terms of lift going up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you would like to build a craft with 4x symmetry, you can do so in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). It is capable of 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 6x, and 8x symmetry. There are also mods out there that allow even more options if you\u0027re interested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SPH is more for airplane design, whereas the VAB is more for rocket design.
