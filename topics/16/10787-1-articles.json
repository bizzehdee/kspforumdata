For some reason my computer doesn\\\u0027t realy like that plugin. Going to Minmus is pretty easy with the patch-conic system, although I am still learning the timing. I usualy make a quicksave when I\\\u0027m in Kerbin orbit, then when I think I\\\u0027m in a good position I make a transfer orbit till the conic system shows that I\\\u0027m going to reach Minmus\\\u0027s SOI. If it becomes obvious that I made an error about the transfer orbit and I will never reach Minmus\\\u0027s SOI I quickload and correct my error. Currently I made 9 attempts and I managed to get there without an error in 6 times."},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T22:28:32Z","Content":"Wait, does this guy get an achievement for the first person to land on Minmus with MechJeb?\n\nFor anyone worrying about timing of the TMiI (have to distinguish it from TMI), do the injection burn when you see it rise over the horizon.
