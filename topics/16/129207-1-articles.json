KSP wings generate no lift at zero angle of attack. Try either rotating the leading edge of the wing up a bit, or adjusting the landing gear so that the nose sits higher. You will then generate more lift while rolling down the runway, and not have to pitch up so much to get airborne.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T04:55:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou appear to have no wings.\u00A0 I see vertical stabilizers, and I think those are canards, but you need something to actually lift the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou also appear to have no engines.\u00A0 Can we get a birds eye view of this plane?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: OK, I just saw the shadow.\u00A0 The wings are just deceptively hidden in that image.\u00A0 A better screenshot would help.\u00A0 However, I think your center of mass is a bit too far forward.\u00A0 You could move the center of lift forward, but you also need to move the rear wheels up to the center of mass and that is going to make tailstrike worse.\u00A0 I would remove the last fuselage and shorten the plane, see if that puts everything in the right position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally you want the CoL touching the CoM just barely, and you want the rear wheels just barely behind the CoM -OR- as Vanamonde said, angle of incidence on the wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-04T05:04:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2016 05:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bandus","CreatedById":8358,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T07:28:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the rear landing gear are to far forward.
