I still don\u0027t master the skills to align it with the runway, so the landing is just on grasslands, but still... i can\u0027t understand why it\u0027s always blowing to pieces, even at very shallow descent angles and low speed (i tried speeds between 50m/s to 100m/s). It\u0027s not stalling and it\u0027s not going too fast... I must be doing something wrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny \u0022piloting\u0022 advice is more than welcome.
