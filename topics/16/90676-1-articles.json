This could be fixed by adding a bit more wing forward or extending your wing root so it pushes forward a bit more. The reason is as you reach supersonic and hypersonic speeds, your CoL actually pushes back towards the rear of the wing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"endl","CreatedById":119320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T18:31:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit was actually really easy to fly, the plane loses altitude (around 17km) when the run first starts but regains it on its own while never dropping below the horizon marker on the ball. at that point i can just hold S button to space. i added the conards for vtol stability mainly but it did make flying it easier. i do have some wiggle room to move/resize the wings a bit more but im not sure why you think i have to do it. is it because of the wing tip engines? i added those because my TWR fell below 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etake off has to be the most difficult part for me i have to maintain a precise angle or the plane starts to stall before clearing the ground, its not that hard but it isnt as smooth as my lighter craft\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-20T18:36:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2014 06:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by endl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T20:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo that isn\u0027t the reason why I think you need to add a bit more length to your wing root. It is because as I said, the CoL actually shifts towards the rear of the wing at supersonic speeds. So if your CoL is just behind your CoM when in the SPH, it will stay roughly around there till you start going faster than the speed of sound, at Mach 1 it will shift back a small amount, and the closer you come to hyper sonic speeds, in excess of mach 3 your CoL actually can be as far off as a couple of meters, depending on the wing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two ways to counter this affect, you can either extend your wing root so you have your CoL sitting closer to the CoM when in subsonic flight, which will make the craft very twitchy. Or you can shift your fuel load from front to rear as you go faster to counter the shift of the CoL, this is what real supersonic aircraft do. I also do this with my craft, it helps a great deal for a lot of reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
