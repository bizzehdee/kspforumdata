I am going to start trying to design a new RAPIER powered SSTO and have a few question. I have made SSTO\u0027s in the past so I do know the basics. \n\nThe Precooler: Should I use it and if so what do I connect to it (the intakes or the RAPIER engine)?\n\nIntakes: Which one would be best to use: the ram intake or the shock cone intake? Also how many intakes per engine 1,2 or more? \n\nFor my assent profile would I be right in assuming that you should get to 10k s quickly as possible then try and gain speed then pitch up once my speed starts to decrease and go to closed cycle mode?\n\nThanks in advance for the help\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T16:14:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 04:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mrmcp1**\n  \nQuestion was answered"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T15:03:32Z","Content":"Put the preccooler behind your RAM intakes.

They are less dragy. Also put a shock cone behind the rapier engine and clip it inside untill you can\u0027t see the white part of the shock cone. This will give you stability as well as less drag at the tail of plane and a bit more air but don\u0027t expect it to work like the ones that are looking directly front. Using this method i was able to create an ssto that goes 1550m/s at 30k height without loosing altitude. At that speed and height making orbit comes easy and don\u0027t use much fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T15:25:23Z","Content":"\\* For RAPIERs, you want your total takeoff mass to be somewhere between 17-24 tonnes per engine; that\u0027ll give you between 0.55 and 0.75 TWR on the Runway, which is plenty.\n\n\\* One Intake per engine is plenty at this point; I\u0027ve got a couple of designs that made it to orbit with Circular Intakes.\n\n\\* You won\u0027t be making it as high or as fast as you used to be able to do before switch-over in the pre-1.0 days; pack more rocket fuel.

Balancing how much intake drag you can push through the SB against how much weight you have to ship in engines is the key consideration IMO. I\u0027m finding that the sweet spot is around 12.5 tons/engine, with enough intake area to keep them burning up to 25km\u002B. By using a nuke as an afterburner, I\u0027ve been able to get to 28km at almost 1400 m/s, with maybe 150m/s climb at switchover. I\u0027ve gotten to orbit with 23% of my initial takeoff weight on board in fuel that way. Using 4 RAPIERs plus one nuke, I just landed my most recent SSTO on the Mun last night. I\u0027m not yet sure if I can do it with enough fuel to get back, but it\u0027s close. Anyway, I think more power than that is better in the new aero system. You really need those RAPIERs to be working at their peak on air at the high end, or you\u0027ll just have to burn through too much atmosphere on bipropellant at 305 ISP.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I\u0027ve got to be able to squeeze that out somewhere...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T18:42:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 06:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T16:01:20Z","Content":"I fully agree herbal space program on the 12.5-13 tons per Rapier in stock.
