I used a station on Minmus orbit for a while, but I found it too tedious to shoot for ideal ideal transfer angles from that inclination. These days I refine on LKO. Getting the ore there might be a hassle, but I don\u0027t have to do that too often and it\u0027s easy compared to an interplanetary mission. It would be the same if I kept the ISRU on Minmus and I only transfered the fuel.

Transfer burns require essentially the same delta-v from all of these orbits.\n\nHigher orbits are also useful, because they allow higher time warp multipliers (at 120 km, 240 km, 480 km, and 600 km), and rendezvousing with ships at them requires less waiting.

These calculations assume no inclination changes and zero eccentricity orbits, so it can be significantly off. I post it more as a general guideline.\n\nI\u0027m going to agree with others that departing from LKO is easiest. Bringing fuel from Minmus to an LKO depot is a lot more wasteful, but so much easier. Fuel tugs, being almost all tankage, tend to be much easier to fly and dock than interplanetary vessels, and can have fabulous total delta-v. Timing is also trivial from LKO. That said, if your interplanetary vessel is low on total delta-v, topping off at Minmus could enable you to complete a mission which you couldn\u0027t if you departed directly from LKO.\n\nTransfer burn delta-v [m/s].

Given a month long orbital period, chances are you want to play with your ejection angle as well as realize greater Oberth gains.\n\nThe two are not mutually exclusive manuvers (as if they weren\u0027t confusing enough in usage)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T21:37:20Z","Content":"The \u0022dumbed down\u0022 explanation would be that Oberth maneuver is a powered Gravity Assist, and vice versa. \n\nA normal gravity assist requires entry and departure at specific angles relative to the assisting body\u0027s trajectory (in most intuitive way, if \u0022front\u0022 is the direction towards which the body (a moon, a planet) is heading, passing \u0022behind\u0022 speeds you up, passing \u0022in front\u0022 slows you down).\n\nOberth effect only requires you to move fast - the faster you move the more actual speed/trajectory change you can squeeze out of the same delta-V. Both speeding up and slowing down (but not so much sideways). That means you can tweak your entry and exit angles as much as you like, just do it near periapsis to get the most out of your fuel.\n\nOf course one doesn\u0027t exclude the other. You can get much more speed out of combining Oberth maneuver and a gravity assist than from either of them. It\u0027s also pretty hard to perform an Oberth maneuver without performing a gravity assist at the same time - after all you are flying by a body, and it will affect you \\*somehow\\* (possibly thwarting your Oberth maneuver benefits if you entered an assist that acts in the opposite direction than your burn...)\n\nAlso, while gravity assists are always about \u0022smaller scale\u0022 flyby affecting a \u0022larger scale\u0022 speed - a moon flyby affects your orbit around a planet, a planet flyby affects your orbit around the sun - you can\u0027t perform a Kerbin gravity assist to change your Kerbin orbit - Oberth maneuver is independent of these. \n\nSay, you want to get a capture - enter orbit of Eve. If you only skirt its SOI, and start braking, you\u0027ll spend a lot of fuel to get the periapsis near the planet\u0027s atmosphere. But if you enter at such an angle that you\u0027re almost skirting its atmosphere, then burn retrograde at the periapsis, you\u0027ll get a capture (an orbit) in a fraction of the delta-V; as you approached it, its gravity was pulling you in and sped you up considerably, making your burn much more efficient - using Eve gravity for changing your velocity relative to Eve. (If you wanted to try capture using gravity assist, you\u0027d have to use Gilly for braking. But Gilly being so small and light wouldn\u0027t be much of assistance - the heavier the body the stronger the effect, simply because you\u0027re \u0022falling\u0022 faster.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T22:25:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For instance, going directly to Duna or Eve from the Mun is cheaper than dipping down to Kerbin.\n\nMun yes, Minmus no. Mun is close to Kerbin enough that you need quite a bit of delta-V to drop your periapsis to LKO. Note how the farther the orbit the slower the orbital speed and the less you need to brake to get the periapsis all the way down. So, getting from Minmus to LKO periapsis is very cheap. And again, orbital speed of Mun is high enough that Oberth effect for departure is not insignificant."}]}
