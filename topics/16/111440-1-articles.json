What\u0027s your go-to solution for making heat shielding for very large spacecraft? I know that atmospheric heating in 1.02 is pretty lukewarm, but I like to include them anyway. I suspect that when I get around to a return mission from Eve I\u0027ll need to shield a pretty massive lander. I think it would be excellent for Squad to make even larger heat shields to play with, like in the region of 5m and 10m sizes. \n\nSo do you attach round heat shields radially, make huge ones out of structural panels, use huge fairings, or simply not bother? Interested to see what people say, pictures extremely welcome.\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T00:23:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Just wanted to ask a question of you all.

I always come down from orbit though."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T00:26:45Z","Content":"Theres a couple of 5m heatshields in a few mods around.\n\nI find that engines work decently well as a heatshield, as long as your SAS can overpower the aerodynamics and rockets tend to want to dive in nosefirst rather than enginefirst."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T01:22:07Z","Content":"Use engines they work like a charm. Make sure you are bottom heavy tho or aero will force your craft to turn towards the prograde"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T04:55:48Z","Content":"Airbrakes = easy mode. They weigh almost nothing, attach radially so you can slap \u0027em on anywhere, and are astonishingly effective. They slow you down gently as a feather, way up in the upper atmosphere, often without so much as a single visible reentry effect."},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T07:14:01Z","Content":"Procedural Parts has a procedural heatshield.

And on descent when entering the atmosphere I activate them. Of course they dont come out immediately but around 20.000 m and just before my craft heats up too much they unfold and slow me down sufficiently"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T09:20:38Z","Content":"Cluster a lot of the largest heatshields around a common center, like the turtle formation used by Roman legions ages ago ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) it works.

KSP aero was disappointing for not even attempting to simulate airflow so I\u0027m curious how the game will handle the occlusion of that."}]}
