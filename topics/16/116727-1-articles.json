Or by mid-course corrections.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"leocrumb","CreatedById":141389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T14:41:14Z","Content":"I dont think you understood the question.

You really should be able to see your post encounter trajectory.\n\nIf your path is in front on minmus you will be traveling retrograde relative to minmus\u0027 orbit. That\u0027s a free return. If your course is behind it, you will be coming mostly toward minmus\u0027 prograde.

That gravity well is going to influence the shape of your orbit, pulling it in towards the centre.\n\nSo.. assuming that by \u0022prograde\u0022 you\u0027re meaning orbiting towards the east, then it\u0027s just a matter of making sure you enter the SOI in that direction.. IE that you have the body \u0022on your left\u0022. If the center of that gravity well is \u0022on your left\u0022, then your orbit will be deflected in towards it - \u0027to the left\u0027.

Differences of order of 0.01m/s can totally shift the side you\u0027re meeting Minmus. So, from Kerbin just get any half-decent encounter, and then execute a correction maneuver perfecting your trajectory when roughly halfway to Minmus. The closer to Kerbin you do it the less precise it will be but cost less delta-V. The closer to Minmus the more precise you can make it, but the more fuel you\u0027ll spend."}]}
