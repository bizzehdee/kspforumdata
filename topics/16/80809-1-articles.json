Jool\u0027s moons have orbits closer together than would probably be sustainable in a true N-body physics model, so you\u0027re more likely to encounter something like this than would probably happen in the real world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-05T17:58:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2014 05:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NecroBones\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T18:18:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s because 350 m/s is less than escape velocity at the edge of Laythe\u0027s SOI.

I have my own Hohmann calculator that gives out intermediate results for all the steps and it showed the same thing: 350 m/s at Laythe SOI, which meant a 400 m/s slowdown at 3000 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I, however, did garble it a bit up above. The problem is that under certain conditions in the patched conics paradigm, it\u0027s possible to exit the SOI of celestial bodies going less than escape velocity, i.e. with an elliptical rather than hyperbolic orbit. For circular orbits at higher altitudes, this creates a situation where there are SOI-edge-velocities that simply can\u0027t be achieved. For a 3000 km around Laythe, your circular velocity is 749 m/s, and escape velocity is 1059 m/s, but you only have to raise your periapsis velocity at that altitude to 783 m/s to push your apoapsis out past Laythe\u0027s SOI edge. And when you reach the SOI edge, you\u0027ll be going 648 m/s. This lower limit exists for all orbits in every SOI, but in most cases, the SOI is big enough and/or periapsis low enough that the lower limit is negligible compared to any transfer velocities you might need. (Example: lower limit for an escape trajectory from 100 km LKO is about 26 m/s.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Hohmann transfer from Laythe to Vall requires a velocity at Layth\u0027s SOI-edge of about 350 m/s. But you can\u0027t get to that velocity starting at a 3000 km circular orbit. So you either have to do a non-Hohmann transfer using alexmun\u0027s calculator, or start from a lower circular orbit (~100 km or below for Laythe-\u0026gt;Vall.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-05T19:58:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2014 07:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skaterzero807","CreatedById":118085,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T20:18:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, thanks Mr Shifty. I think that explains it pretty well. I guess to do a transfer to Vall would require you to leave the SOI moving at ~648 m/s but in a direction such that when added as a vector to Laythe\u0027s motion would result in an orbit (no longer Hohmann) that brings you to apoapsis at Vall.

The speed leaving the SOI would have to be smaller than physically possible so calculators might show a negative burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the way to get around it is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Solve for the slowest speed you could leave the SOI from your orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If the speed you would need to go is slower than this minimum speed, then solve for the flight-path angle (or zenith angle, whichever you prefer, see \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm\u003C/a\u003E) required so that leaving at the minimum speed and that angle, you will have your desired apoapsis (or periapsis if going toward a target lower). This involves solving a quadratic function for cos(theta) (or sin(theta) using zenith angle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. From the known flight-path angle and speed just before leaving the SOI, you can calculate the speed and flight-path angle after leaving by adding the velocity vectors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Given the altitude, speed and flight-path angle just outside the SOI, you know your new trajectory (blue solid orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The delta-V in this case is simply the delta-V required to lift your apoapsis to the SOI. From there, you are moving at the minimum allowable speed and if the point of exit is correct, you will exit with the right speed and direction to make it to your target at apoapsis (or periapsis if going lower)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t go into the mathy details but this would at least give you an idea of how to do it.
