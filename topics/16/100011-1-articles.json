These were needed for a specific job, and now the job is completed. \n\nMy problem is that without these thrusters, my RCS is balanced and it is fairly easy to maneuver to dock at a station. However, with these enabled, the ship is almost uncontrollable.\n\nIs it possible to setup a hot-key which would disable specific thrusters (and obviously enable them when desired)? The only way that I can see to do this is to go edit the save file, and I\u0027d rather NOT do that.\n\nI know I can right-click and hit the \u0022Disable RCS Port\u0022 button, but it\u0027s a real problem if I\u0027m switching the RCS on and off, since that seems to reset the setting, at leat on the Vernor Engines\n\nCould this be a (gasp) bug?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-19T12:31:59Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2015 12:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by linuxgurugamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T14:13:27Z","Content":"You can key them to action groups when you\u0027re building the ship."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T14:13:49Z","Content":"You could always tie them to an action group, however this must be done prior to launch.

So I designed the ship to have the science lab in front of the pod so I would be able to dock it to the orbiting base and then detach. So I landed, waited the 10 seconds to fulfill the contract, and then did all the science I could. Then I took off and rendezvoused with the base.
