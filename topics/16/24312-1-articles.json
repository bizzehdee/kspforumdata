While you do have a higher kinetic energy in low circular orbits than in high circular orbits, an elliptical orbit with a low Pe is actually better than a circular orbit at the same altitude, because you\u0027re moving relative faster at Pe than you would in a circular orbit. That kinetic energy has to go somewhere when you burn the fuel, so it\u0027s added to your craft\u0027s velocity. It\u0027s pretty much always more efficient to do Pe kicks than one long burn, not only because you\u0027re applying more of your thrust close to the ejection angle but also because your velocity is higher when you\u0027re making the burn near Pe on each successive orbit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edat picture \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I should have phrased it better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethere\u0027s no doubt that periapsis kicks is the best \u0022technique\u0022 here, I was just noticing that for all the burns following the first one, your altitude is going to change quite a bit during the burn itself, compared to the first kick (which you perform starting from a circular orbit.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut then, it\u0027s not really the altitude per se that matters, but rather your velocity, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso during the subsequent burns, coming towards periapsis, you\u0027re gonna be more efficient as you\u0027re travelling faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso yeah, let\u0027s just pretend I didn\u0027t say that to begin with \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat about this, RoboRay: what\u0027s your rule of thumb for PE kicks - how long does each one last, at the most?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T18:39:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeh, yeah, those pictures just seem to pop up all the time here. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, it\u0027s the velocity that matters, not your altitude. The general rule of \u0022burn as low as possible\u0022 is just a side effect of lower orbits having more kinetic energy (higher relative velocities), and most people are referring to the parking orbit from which they are starting the transfer burn. But an elliptical orbit gives you an even higher relative velocity at the same Pe, so each kick actually becomes a little more efficient than the last due to the fuel possessing more kinetic energy on each pass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeparting Kerbin, I try to do my burns for 20 degrees or two-minutes on either side of the angle, depending on if I\u0027m using Protractor or the Maneuver Nodes. Assuming your parking orbit is 100km or less (or, about 30 minutes long), that works out to about the same distance around the planet. Beyond that, you\u0027re expending a lot of thrust off-axis, making it less effective. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s really bad if you don\u0027t do kicks for long burns. Think about it... if your orbital period is 30 minutes and you\u0027re making a 30 minute burn, half of your burn will have part or all of your thrust pushing you away from the direction you\u0027re trying to go. You\u0027re still increasing your Ap (and your Pe, too, which is just wasted fuel) from the planet, but the effect on your transfer-orbit velocity (in respect to the sun) is partially counterproductive. This makes your transfer burn even longer than what you should need, so you must burn even more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-01T18:49:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2013 06:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
