Rockets have a lot of drag at certain angles, and can really cut into the air if you push it too far. Try for a gentler ascent, and see if that helps. Severedsolo worked out a [pretty good ascent profile](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118878-1-0-2-Rocket-ascent-profile-and-orbit-delta-V?p=1902945\u0026viewfull=1#post1902945), which should get you through the first 10/15 kilometers of atmosphere. After that, the ascent\u0027s pretty much the same as .90.\n\nGood luck, dude!"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T04:10:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Been tring to fight rocket-flipping with shifting center of mass with pumping fuel from top to bottom tanks, but it looks like this option is no longer available. Was it turned off or am i missing something?\n\nTwo things: In career mode, fuel transfer isn\u0027t available until you upgrade your R\u0026D building.\n\nSecond, if you want to keep your rocket from flipping, you want to move the fuel up, not down. You want a high center of mass, not a low one. [This post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39812-Landing-and-Takeoff-Delta-V-vs-TWR-and-specific-impulse) does a good job of explaining why."},{"CreatedByName":"Jeez","CreatedById":100372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T12:16:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You want a high center of mass, not a low one.\n\nYeah, I got to this myself too.
