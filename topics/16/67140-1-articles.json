KSP simply removes vessels or debris that are in Kerbins atmosphere under 40 km (Really not sure on that threshold) that are more than 2.5 km from an active ship. 2.5 km is the \u0022physics simulation\u0022 range. ANything outside of that is \u0022on rails\u0022, and anything on-rails too close to a planet or in an atmosphere just gets destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the future, use the same number of parachutes, but keep it all together, don\u0027t decouple the science from the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nadreck","CreatedById":89087,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T17:36:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to make sure your science module lands before you recover the vehicle with a Kerbin or automated control.
