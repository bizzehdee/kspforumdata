I then attach fuel lines from each radial tank to the main central tank as well as from the central tank to each of the radial tanks. Most of the time this works fine with a nicely balanced fuel load throughout the flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I play KSP on a inherited \u0022vintage\u0022 laptop (OK so its not that old, but it\u0027s a little below minimum specs for the game) I\u0027ve had to turn all the graphics down to the minimum settings (but the game is so awesome I\u0027m just happy to be able to play at all). At those settings the game plays rather well, a little lag on liftoff and when docking large craft, but my LKO station now has 500 parts and it\u0027s still possible to dock without the lag becoming much of a pain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne issue I\u0027ve had is landing somewhere new, with no idea of the height of the local terrain. It only becomes obvious you\u0027re near the ground when you are \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E close, which means a conservative, fuel wasting decent or suicide burn with fingers crossed. My \u0022bright idea\u0022 was to loose the central engine on my landers and replace it with a decoupler and a small, light, fuel tank. Once I\u0027ve finished my gravity turn and I\u0027m heading pretty much straight down, I drop the tank and note the distance it travels before becoming one with the body I\u0027m landing on (ie crashes). It gives a reasonable guide to how far I\u0027ve left to travel before touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, this method also seems to mess with the fuel flow. I keep finding myself having to balance out the fuel load or, worse, not noticing and having my ship twist and turn all over the place during burns. Previously sound vechiles, when reloaded and refitted with my \u0022distance to destruction\u0022 dropable parts suddenly become unbalanced in their fuel use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I need to redo the fuel lines on all my vechiles when changing something, or is there something I\u0027m overlooking?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-01T01:12:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2015 01:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Clipperride\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steelsunoa","CreatedById":135938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T22:33:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout seeing the craft, I\u0027d say you have the fuel lines crossed somewhere.
