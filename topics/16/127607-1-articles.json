Issues I\u0027m running into:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanders I use previously were powered by a few small stages of 47-8S\u0027s. These same landers in 1.05 hit a top speed of 200m/s when running out of fuel. Landers used when I wanted to be more interesting placed\u00A0three radial jets along side a small liquid fuel stage. Such jets get the rocket to 15km or so, and then even a terrier sitting under a FLT-400 doesn\u0027t have the delta v to push from there into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you pack more, and realise the atmosphere here is strong enough to cause the tipping problem that\u00A0I had only previously\u00A0really thought about on Kerbin launches, and start playing with fins. Fins just don\u0027t seem effective on rockets this small, and after a few hours of playing, I\u0027ve resorted instead to six SAS modules, which seems a far more effective solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo say I have a solution below is to say I have one that feels like it\u0027s a lot larger than it needs to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wawZ8tA.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wawZ8tA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole thing does of course scream \u0022spaceplane\u0022, but that\u0027s not really a path I want to go down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-12T02:03:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe with the new aerodynamics squat and wide is now out, and tall and thin is in. \u00A0Having said that, I recognise that squat and wide is better for lander stability so I would say:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither adjust your ascent profile to start your gravity turn later, or adjust the design of the lander.

But Laythe means you\u0027ve got to build for landing on water. And if you can be bothered actually planning a proper land based landing (I usually give up after 5-6 tries), anything that long and high has a good chance of tipping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I have no idea why but if you lower those outside tanks (easy with the new offset tool) it will flip over in the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
