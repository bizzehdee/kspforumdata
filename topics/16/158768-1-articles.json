How does heat on the ship during re entry work? In the instance of heat shields or just standard non heat shielded parts, is it the lead point that takes 100% of the heat or is it heating any point at all that is not parallel to entry angle. Basically here is the back story that leads to my question. I am using stage recovery mod because I like the realism of being able to recover stages. Because of this each stage has parachutes and other things designed to slow down my stages. On my main stage (4 nerv\u0027s a orange fuel tank and some struts) I put 1.25s on top of the mark1 liquids and a 2.5 on top of the orange. during aero breaking with my pod attached the 1.25s that are set back a few meters from my pod but open to the elements were taking no heat (no ablator loss) but my lead point on the pod was. Is this how it works? To simplify I have a new stage I\u0027m making (screen shot attached) will the engine take all of the heat and not the shields, or will the shields take the heat since they are also at a perpendicular angle to entry? Thanks in advance.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022m9p0s3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i64.tinypic.com/m9p0s3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-05T20:12:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2017 08:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Nickel AP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-05T22:24:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsidering that you are reentering this suborbital on Kerbin:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you had an incredibly sensitive thermometer you would notice that during reentry, the engine would actually get up to a temperature where it was almost warm to the touch.

I meant it in a more humorous way -- my bad (humor on the internet can easily be misinterpreted, and it is therefore dangerous). My basic point is that it\u0027s way overengineered. Removing all the heatshields will save lots of weight, and will probably make it reenter better, because of the extra drag. It will probably also launch better because of the lower weight. Heat is not going to be an important factor for this part\u0027s reentry. The angle of the bow shock depends on the speed. The faster you are going the narrower the bow shock. Most parts can take quite a lot of heat. Heatshields can take a huge amount of heat, but they have quite low drag and they are fairly massive -- so adding them to a RV can easily kill you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy second point was that the lead part takes a slightly unrealistic amount of the heat, especially if that lead part is off to the side (because of attitude or construction). Beyond that, heat is inevitable -- you can\u0027t hide from it forever. So it\u0027s a useful thing to try your designs without the heatshields and see what happens.
