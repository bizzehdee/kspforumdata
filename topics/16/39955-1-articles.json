I can get it into Kerbal orbit, I can transfer it to Munar orbit, I can land it on the Mun and drill and convert Kethane. But whenever I try to lift off from the Mun, it gets several km up, then one of the engines loses thrust and it goes into an uncontrolled spin. Checking the post-flight log it seems that the tank loses structural connection with the rest of the ship. I\u0027ve tried reinforcing them with quantum struts at four separate points, but it still happens. Anyone have any suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T01:32:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReading your post, it sounds like you believe the failure of the structure is causing the spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you also said that one of the engines loses thrust. Perhaps the engine has simply run out of fuel due to erroneous fuel lines. This then causes the craft to spin so violently that the structure fails. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen watching the events take place, does it look like the engine is losing power before or after the structural failure?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have fuel lines on the craft?
