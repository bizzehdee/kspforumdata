I suppose most would be ecstatic about this - free science, forever! Not so much for me, this is my 3rd career game, and for once I wanted to send some probes to other planets before completing the entire science tree. At this rate, that Minmus station will fill it all by itself before I even get to Eve!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpeedDaemon","CreatedById":38448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T21:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe data is converted bit by bit into science as you research, not when you transmit the science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe conversion is faster the more data is in the lab, so you want to keep it as topped up as possible (IOW, don\u0027t wait till data is empty to add new experiments - put them in as soon as there\u0027s room for them).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-26T21:52:52Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2015 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpeedDaemon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"surge","CreatedById":136150,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T22:20:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting.
