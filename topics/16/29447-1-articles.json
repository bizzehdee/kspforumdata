The method I am using might seem unnecessarily convoluted and complex but I am doing it because I feel more comfortable flying my SSTO spaceplane than I do flying a conventional lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plan is to launch a spaceplane and an \u0022interplanetary drive\u0022(basically a nuclear engine and a big fuel tank with docking ports) up to a station in a 250km orbit of Kerbin. Once at the station the interplanetary drive and the spaceplane will both refuel. Once fueled up the spaceplane and drive will dock together and using the nuclear engine fly to Duna. Once they reach Duna I will use the interplanetary drive to get them both into a 60km orbit. The spaceplane will then reduce its periapsis to around 30km and let air friction take it down to the surface slowly for a landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main concern is whether or not my spaceplane has enough delta V to return to a stable orbit. It can get into a 250km orbit of Kerbin with 2/3 of its fuel remaining;however, it can\u0027t use its jet engines on Duna because of the lack of air. Is 3000m/s Delta V enough to reach a stable orbit of Duna and what trajectory should I take to get to it efficiently?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-30T02:28:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2013 02:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Uberdude9001\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T08:48:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the delta-V is a bit under 1.5 km/s to low Duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you going to land on the landing gear, or a tail landing (with legs)?

The large, dark maria near the equator are huge plains that make good landing strips. They are also at the datum altitude, so you\u0027ll get about as much lift as you can on Duna there. When I land on wheels on Duna I set my periapsis to ~5km so that I wind up coming down very gently. If you set yourself up for a more conventional landing with a carefully chosen site to touchdown upon, you\u0027re probably going to wind up having too much vertical velocity and will lithobrake.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
