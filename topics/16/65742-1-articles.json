Here\u0027s what you do: you want to set out a series of ground beacons, one at the ocean end of the runway, one at the other end (the starting end), then further west from that one you put beacons at 1 km, then 5 km from that one, then moar beacons at 5 km intervals to as far out as you\u0027re comfortable doing. My own ILS goes out to 30 kilometers. The beacons don\u0027t have to be much; a powered probe core will suffice, and rover delivery works well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen when you want to land, you can use the beacons as a guide. First of all, if you set them up with little variation in north/south, you can use them to help guide your runway alignment. Second, the beacons act as a slope indicator - your distance to the beacon plus its distance to the end of the runway will give you the altitude you want to be at - one hundred times that sum. For example, if you\u0027re 20.2 kilometers to the ten kilometer beacon, you want your altimeter to read somewhere around 3,020 meters. (20.2 \u002B 20 = 30.2, 30.2*100 = 3,020). That doesn\u0027t work all the way to the ground since the elevation of the runway is at about seventy meters, but it should give you a good feel for whether you\u0027re high or low at least, and should get close to a reasonable glideslope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for getting to the runway itself, from Kerbin orbit you want to set a maneuver node that will put your periapsis onto the ground over on the next continent (not the dinky little peninsula on the same continent, but on the other continent), roughly seventy degrees downrange of KSC. Eyeball it; you\u0027ll be okay as long as you\u0027ve still got gas in the tank. If you find yourself short, you can still fly to KSC if you\u0027ve got a little gas in the tank (5-10k\u0027s when the jets have that 2000\u002B Isp). If you overshoot, you can double back; your ILS will still be able to help you set up your alignment at least, though you\u0027ll just have the ocean beacon to help you with glide slope.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T12:29:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for getting to the runway itself, from Kerbin orbit you want to set a maneuver node that will put your periapsis onto the ground over on the next continent (not the dinky little peninsula on the same continent, but on the other continent), roughly seventy degrees downrange of KSC.

If you have lots of gas, you can wait until you are over the desert and aim for just below the large island north-east of KSC. Takes ~200 m/s of dV for such a steep reentry, but it\u0027s easier to hit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_jack","CreatedById":94383,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T22:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook at this video:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/MThraJAR6Qk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is really helpful. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"roblamb98","CreatedById":75487,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T17:02:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe flat area all around ksc is a haven for new pilots, just keep your engines below 50% and glide down, land AND THEN turn on brakes, bad things can happen when you land with brakes on. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dentarg","CreatedById":106078,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T20:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBTW what is Jool \u0022lower atmosphere\u0022 border?
