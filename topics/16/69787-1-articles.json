I\u0027ve been to Mun, Minmus and around Kerbol many times, and I can get there pretty easily. I want to go to Duna before I go to Eve because of Eve\u0027s very high gravity, and so I think that Duna will probably be easier. Let me just put my tech tree here so you guys can see what science I have unlocked. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TRNNLCr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TRNNLCr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say I have a decent number of things unlocked, and, from what I\u0027ve seen, should be enough to get me to Duna. Unfortunately, I am not that great of a ship builder (I suck) and cannot get a good design. My lander isn\u0027t bad, but the rest of the ship...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, there are a couple things that I would like to be able to have/do with this ship. This is a list of things I would like from most important to least important:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Must be able to get to Duna and back to Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) If possible, I would like it to be manned with a crew of 1 or 2 kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) While I do have docking ports unlocked, I have not messed around with them yet, so I would probably mess something up if I try and dock two ships together in orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Reasonable room for errors, I\u0027m an okay pilot, but I can\u0027t get to Mun and Minmus with only the Start science node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) As you can see, I don\u0027t have the amazingly efficient nuclear engines, but I can probably unlock them if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Any science tools I can bring along are very welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a ship that meets at least a few of these requirements, I would be delighted to see them, if only to get some ideas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Chronin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brun","CreatedById":68293,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T00:33:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you really try to scrape up every little bit of science on Mun and Minmus, you should be able to unlock most of the tech tree without leaving the Kerbin system - or so I\u0027ve heard.

I usually use something that mimics either Apollo, plans for the manned Mars mission, or something in between. For example, once an Apollo moon landing mission reached orbit, it still had the 3rd stage (S-IVB-500) attached. This third stage was used to boost it into the Trans-Lunar Injection and then it was ditched (usually purposely crashed into the moon or sent to heliocentric orbit.) and the command module docked to the lunar (though you could have them pre-attached). Once they reach the destination, the service/command module would perform a orbital insertion burn. The lunar module would undock, land, do science and then (this part is very important to the story) leave an entire half of the vehicle behind to shed the weight. In your case this would include all science tools you bring along, remove the data from em and put it in the capsule. This ascent module would then redock with the command/service module which would them perform a burn to return to Earth, ditching the ascent half of the lunar module on the way after moving all collected science into the command module. Once it reached the point at which re-entry is certain, it would ditch the service module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, obviously anything built like this for a Duna mission risks being too large to launch with one rocket. However, the main ideas of it remains true, namely that A)when you have fuel left over from your launch stage, you should us it, and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E the only 2 things that truly need to return are the people and the science. The lander, the service module, the injection stage, every single part can be expendable as long as the Kerbals and the science make it back in a capsule. Whenever there is a point at which dead weight can be dropped for a weight savings, drop it. If the lander has an empty 2m tank and a poodle on it after landing, then stick a decoupler and 1m tanks and engines on top of it.

Once you\u0027ve landed on Duna the amount of delta-v you need to get into orbit and return to Kerbin can be fit into a relatively small craft.

Now this isn\u0027t the kind of design you should be aiming for right now - you should be carrying more science stuff (you don\u0027t have the small Double-C or GravMax instruments so you\u0027ll want the Science Jr and Goo containers) and you can definitely carry more fuel to make the trip safer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70423-A-comparison-of-design-then-and-now\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L5NWOfJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022L5NWOfJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/g8vyJ0r.png\u0022 alt=\u0022g8vyJ0r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, that\u0027s probably not the ship you should use. But there is a core concept to take from it which is that the portion that will return you from the surface of Duna back to Kerbin doesn\u0027t need to be big. A lander can, FL-400 tank, Rockomax 48-7S and some support equipment like solar panels and a parachute will do pretty well. You can remove the data from any experiment you run so there is no need to bring them back to Kerbin - just run them on the surface, collect the result and then abandon them when you take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA more realistic but maybe a bit overdone Duna expedition can be seen \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62464-Dave-s-Voyage-%28-23-career-log-PIC-HEAVY-ANI-GIFs%29?p=914127\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post914127\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.

You\u0027ll note that that return craft is very close to what I described and I attached my science and other support equipment to the sides so that it could be ejected when I was done with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Wp08cB1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Wp08cB1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Uh2WQ3O.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Uh2WQ3O.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jEVtkWI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jEVtkWI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chronin","CreatedById":108953,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T20:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help, this really gave me some nice ideas. Had you replied yesterday I wouldn\u0027t have used nukes, but early this morning (in America, at least, I don\u0027t know where you are) I went to Minmus and came back with around 700 science, so I know have nuclear engines and some other new parts (not enough for the GRAVMAX though). Anyway, I really like your ship, I myself can never think small. I know simple is good, I know it\u0027s more efficient, but my brain doesn\u0027t care. Problems with a ship? More Mainsail! Too many Mainsails? More boosters! Etc. etc. I really wish I could think small and simple for once...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
