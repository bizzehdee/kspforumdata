Next planned step is a round trip to Duna, but the next transfer window is 230 Kerbal days from present time. So I decided to try and build some orbital stations in the meantime, to fully explore the two Kerbin moons and maximize midgame science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question is: what is the most efficient way to bring fuel to the orbital stations? I read somewhere that is better to send big empty tanks and make multiple flights with small tanks to fill the big ones. I made some calcuations, though, and noticed that in many cases (i.e. same brand) there is no difference in the full/empty ratio for liquid fuel tanks. So what\u0027s the point of sending many small filled tanks in different flights instead of a minor number of flights with big filled tanks? Consider I can only send FL-T and Rockomax with my present science level...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond question: since I planned to build orbital stations orbiting both moons, either for the fun of it and to help with ground exploration, is it worth to build an additional \u0027starting\u0027 orbital station over Kerbin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scanyland","CreatedById":171764,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-02T15:00:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think there is a best way to do it but what I like to do is load up the largest tank I can and get it to the station, I always find that the worst case scenario is that\u00A0I have to tap into the fuel supply if I don\u0027t have enough to finish the journey.

With all fuel coming from launchpad, it really doesn\u0027t save anything.

To send fuel to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, my preferred way is to drill from Minmus and then send it back via aerobraking.

Your original ambition to go to Duna\u00A0will be more exciting and interesting than doing the same things over and over. And unless you\u0027re prepared to time warp for long periods, you risk never actually getting to Duna (or any other new planet!); you will never find \u003Cstrong\u003E1380 hours\u003C/strong\u003E of real-time stuff to occupy yourself until the window comes around naturally, and the game tends to feel \u0022done\u0022 once you finish the tech tree (which Mun and Minmus can do).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking orbital stations is tremendous fun, so by all means go for that. But once you\u0027ve had your fill, consider time warping to your Duna window. It can feel\u00A0weird to some of us to do \u0022nothing\u0022 for that long. But it\u0027s also weird that Kerbals are able to design, build, and launch huge, complex ships instantaneously and have them work flawlessly on the first try. If you told NASA they only had 230 days to launch a manned Mars mission, they\u0027d panic\u00A0and tell you it\u0027s fifteen years too late to plan anything. So you can role-play that they spend the next 230 days designing the Duna ship and working out all the kinks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my ideal world, the entire humanity should be enslaved for the only purpose of advancement of science, with exploration as the main practical goal. This means that, as of today, at least a billion people would be working 16-18 hours per day with the only final aim of explore, exploit and colonize the Solar System. 230 days to get to Mars would be overwhelmingly enough, also considering that the preservation of human life and health of astronauts would be number 2139485902375 in the list of worries. I would say, given these conditions, that not 230, but \u00A0more than 23 days to prepare and launch a spaceship to Mars would be considered high treason and sentenced with death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to the real word(?), I will take your suggestion, meaning that building 2-3 orbital stations, starting from scratch, and not following any tutorial (I like trial and error) will be quite challenging and time consuming, even in Kerbal time, and possibly\u00A0I will not have either the time and more importantly the will to grind much science on the moons thereafter. Also consider that one of the aims of building those stations was to minimize the repetition of science missions to Mun and Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222908355\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154362\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483393077\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00222645\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Carl\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Carl said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean 120 tons delivered to orbit after lifter burn out.
