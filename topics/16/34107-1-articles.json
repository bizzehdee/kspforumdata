When building larger ships and in particular adding struts, it would be great to be able to lock down a part so it can\u0027t be physically moved anymore.

Last night I was building a 3 tank high 21 mainsail design (2 orange, 1 small silver, mail sail and all required strutting). I built the first 2 rocket addemblies with struts and all. Then I disconnected the 2nd built \u0022child\u0022 rock and put it to the side. Then I hit Ctrl- z and it replaced the original rocket back onto the design but also let the entire faded out one I removed. I then (using symmetry) bolted that onto my rocket.
