Not knowing whats REALLY there...So i\u0027d like to know if there\u0027s a mod to make orbit a little brighter and less nothingness-er If only the outer-kerbol-system-planets we\u0027re closer to kerbin, It\u0027d be less...nothingness-ey Is there a mod for that to? List the brightness one if there isn\u0027t how to turn it up if you can\u0027t then can you make or show me a mod that\u0027ll put all the planets a little closer to kerbin so it\u0027s less nothingness-ey with the skybox i\u0027ve used with universe replacer it dosen\u0027t make it less nothingness-ey, thanks in advance!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T06:11:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you can\u0027t really.

I think you can change the quality of the light renderings in the settings but this will do very little if your ship is in total darkness. One option is to just stick some lights on your ship, I have found this quite therapeutic for my Kerbals. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatKerbal","CreatedById":98809,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T22:48:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh k thanks, Yeah i\u0027m glad noone thought i was scared because ksp is fun.
