For Kerbin, like Elkar said, that\u0027s an orbit with a semi-major axis 2868.75km. You\u0027ll probably want to use a plug-in like Kerbal Engineer, which will show you your orbital period; it\u0027s far easier to get a slightly eccentric orbit that has the right period than a perfectly circular orbit at the right altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that a geo\u003Cem\u003Estationary\u003C/em\u003E orbit, which remains in exactly the same position in the sky, also requires an inclination of zero degrees relative to the equator. If your orbit is inclined a bit, then when viewed from Kerbin your satellite will have an analemma, moving across the sky during its orbit although remaining over roughly the same spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-12T11:50:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2013 11:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kimberly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
