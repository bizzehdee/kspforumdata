It doesn\u0027t need to be an encounter, just a near miss, and the proximity matters less and less the farther into the future it is.

As you\u0027ve already realized, the small change in orbital period is magnified over many orbits, leading to a large change in how close the intercept is. But because of the second maneuver node in the future, KSP actually calculates how exactly that burn will affect the intercept, so it\u0027s pretty easy to get it to hit the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-11T10:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be my technique as well, but just to add: you need to make these nodes in reverse order.
