Been a KSP player for years, like efficiency and since career mode I build for cost, every time, even if I don\u0027t need to with excess funds. I\u0027m not bad, but not perhaps the most discerning of method in my builds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo - using KSP Engineer and looking at how much Delta-V I can get for my buck. On build using a Swivel for a two-stage centre, I put two or four BACC SRBs on, but stage\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eso that I launch off the pad with SRBs only\u003C/em\u003E. Obviously ensuring I have enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for it to be viable. If I have four SRBs and enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E I might light only two SRBs on the pad, drop and light the next two (performing a struggling gravity turn with risk of impact when dropping) before finally lighting my Swivel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously this makes for a slow initial ascent. I understand the thick atmosphere thing at the pad, get going quickly blah blah, but when I compare Delta-V stats with Atmosphere in Engineer, doing what I say above yields more Delta-V than if I light the Swivel on the pad, or light all four SRBs on the pad if using four. Again, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is considered and a slower start seems to be better on final Delta-V against cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not arguing the virtues of using SRBs at all vs liquid side-booster stages, to me that\u0027s a no-brainer on cost (I can end up with 2.5m Skipper build with no Mainsail side boosters, just six Kickback SRBs using the above method, lighting four on the pad and lighting the other two before finally lighting the Skipper, when payload makes it viable).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m wondering is, am I wrong to be purely looking at Delta-V values in Engineer in these builds? What might I not be considering that is possibly making the Delta-V figures either erroneous or a bad idea for another reason I\u0027m not considering?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-30T08:37:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2017 08:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by ondofpond\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-30T09:20:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003EThis seems gameplay related.

You may save on a couple dozen m/s worth of gravity losses by accelerating faster and turning over sooner and harder, but every m/s you invest now costs you 3 or more m/s down the line. So in order for this to work out in your favor, the first stage boosters that you are helping along must save at least twice as much through this trick as the center engine is expending in pulling it off, and even then you\u0027re just breaking even. This also assumes that the center engine is no worse than the first stage engines in atmosphere (in terms of percentage loss of max thrust at sea level), but given how most upper stage engines are statted, this is very rarely the case. So the center stage usually has an even harder time to pull profit out of helping the first stage, and the amount of savings you need to earn with the first stage engines just to break even will be larger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, it is possible that there are rockets which successfully profit from this trick. I can\u0027t confirm or deny either way, I have no math and no examples at hand here (and no KSP to test with either). I just want to point out that I think it\u0027s extremely likely that there will also be plenty of rockets that don\u0027t benefit at all, or in fact lose from it.

On build using a Swivel for a two-stage centre, I put two or four BACC SRBs on, but stage\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eso that I launch off the pad with SRBs only\u003C/em\u003E. Obviously ensuring I have enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for it to be viable. If I have four SRBs and enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E I might light only two SRBs on the pad, drop and light the next two (performing a struggling gravity turn with risk of impact when dropping) before finally lighting my Swivel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously this makes for a slow initial ascent. I understand the thick atmosphere thing at the pad, get going quickly blah blah, but when I compare Delta-V stats with Atmosphere in Engineer, doing what I say above yields more Delta-V than if I light the Swivel on the pad, or light all four SRBs on the pad if using four. Again, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is considered and a slower start seems to be better on final Delta-V against cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not arguing the virtues of using SRBs at all vs liquid side-booster stages, to me that\u0027s a no-brainer on cost (I can end up with 2.5m Skipper build with no Mainsail side boosters, just six Kickback SRBs using the above method, lighting four on the pad and lighting the other two before finally lighting the Skipper, when payload makes it viable).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m wondering is, am I wrong to be purely looking at Delta-V values in Engineer in these builds?
