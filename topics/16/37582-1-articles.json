It has a file named GameData that you can place in the Ksp_osx file named GameData\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. It has multiple files named Parts,Plugins,and Ship, Simply open one file (easier to start with \u0022Parts\u0022) and open the Ksp_osx folder and open the parts file inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Next put all stuff from the mod file and place it in the Parts file (Its the same with all the other files, i think)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psychojason","CreatedById":17242,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T08:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you download it through Steam you can access the KSP files through finder, click go in the toolbar.
