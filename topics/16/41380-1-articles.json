Your ailerons were controlling pitch only, and on a delta configuration, you want both pitch and roll (usually just roll, on conventional craft); also, your rudder was controlling pitch, yaw, and roll, where you want only yaw controlled, as others can cause unwanted rotations when going for other directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue I found is that after I made it into orbit, the craft had become too heavy on the aft end, requiring an emergency fuel transfer to the forward tanks in order to stabilise before crashing. The craft is more than capable of circumnavigation, a 100km orbit, and safely landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI quite enjoyed testing this craft and hope it serves you well!
