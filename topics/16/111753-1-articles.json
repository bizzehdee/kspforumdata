You are stating in LKO (~75-100km)\n2. You want to complete a round trip in a single go\n\nIf you do want to do the whole circuit I\u0027d suggest going to Minmus first, then transferring to the Mun, then back to Kerbin. The reason being that returning from Minmus has the potential to put you in a highly inclined orbit that could take a lot of dV to then match to your station. It is possible to intercept Minmus without changing your plane to match it, with a little bit of fiddling, and once there you can pull off pretty much any maneuver at a significantly reduced dV cost. At any rate, let\u0027s look at an approximate value for this round trip:\n\nKerbin - Minmus: ~920 (~1200 if you match planes first)\n\nMinmus insertion: ~100\n\nRendezvous and docking: ~100-200 (depends on your ability, could be more or less)\n\nTransfer to Mun: ~300\n\nMunar insertion: ~250\n\nRendezvous and docking: ~100-200\n\nEscape Munar SOI: ~250\n\nCircularization in LKO: ~900\n\nRendezvous and docking: ~150-250\n\nOn the low end, that\u0027s a total of: 3070 m/s dV\n\nThat\u0027s just as much as an interplanetary trip. Of course these are estimates. It could be more, or less. Single destination trips would be somewhat cheaper. To the Mun and back would be around 2300 m/s dV with rendezvous (860 intercept\u002B250 insertion\u002B250 escape\u002B860 circularization).\n\nReally it comes down to what you want to take on the ship back and forth. Just crew? You can easily get away with a chemical engine. If you want to lug cargo back and forth I\u0027d definitely shoot for a Nuclear tug, but that\u0027s just me.\n\nNukes aren\u0027t really necessary until the mass of your vessel hits a certain level.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T17:23:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T17:41:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t even use LVN for Duna/ike\n\nThat is so right. Actually you shouldn\u0027t even use them for anything but grand tour.\n\nI used a LV-N craft for duna with a lander that used poodle and it was so overbuilt for the job. Ok heres what happened. Started with 5000dv for the main ship. I reach minmus get into orbit, pick up kerbals and get back up meet with the main ship. 16 kerbals total now. Go for duna aerobreak. After that connect the extra fuel and aerodynamic parachute pack to the lander. Get the main ship into orbit and switch to lander. After takeoff leave the extra fuel and parachute pack at Duna after the fuel gets used at takeoff. Meet with the Main ship and refuel lander. Go for Ike and land, takeoff meet again. Go for Kerbin. Get into high Kerbin orbit and change inclanation. At that point i had 5500dv..... More than i started can you believe that? Just because the lander used the fuel reserved for it.. The thing is i still had alot of fuel left reserved for the lander. Decided to go for minmus again and land all the kerbals for experience since some were never there before. After takeoff i have even more dV than before... Facepalming hard here... Go for Mun as well and land for the kerbals that have never been there... takeoff and meet with main ship. Lander still has %70 fuel left but the reserve atleast got used. The ship now has 5600dv... Ahhh... After that left the main ship at high orbit and landed at kerbin.\n\nSo i learned not to use LV-N for anything but Jool Moons Grand tour since it doesn\u0027t worth the burn times for the efficiency.

For that lander to have expended only 30% of it\u0027s fuel and landed on all those bodies, it would have required a wet/dry mass ratio of over 60 to 1, which while impossible enough on it\u0027s own, would have given a TWR so incredibly low that \u0022landing\u0022 would not be the appropriate word. I\u0027m not even going to bother with the main ship.\n\nThough I get the point you are making, the story you\u0027re using to prove it is sort of backwards. The LV-N is in fact -the- engine for moving redonkulously large vessels. You can easily go to Duna and back on conventional engines, and maybe push it to Eve, but beyond that chemical engines are one-way trips for probes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T18:32:03Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T18:32:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s an interesting story. How big was this lander you brought? How much dV did it have? I find it extraordinarily hard to believe you returned while still carrying the lander, with more dV than you started with. You would have literally had to have dumped half the starting mass of your vessel (more!) without losing any fuel beyond what you were burning to have returned with that amount.\n\nI did dump alot actually since i had fuel tanks that i can dump and the aerodynamic fuel extention with parachutes for the Duna landing and takeoff \u002B all the liquid fuel tanks were mk3 parts. Doing the retrograde burns for getting into orbit while the lander is decaupled might have helped too. I had bad twr as you can imagine since the craft had more than 4 hours of burn time but that made it all the more efficient i guess.\n\nIf i remember it right Lander had 1800dV that is why i used an extra parachute pack with more fuel for Duna landing and takeoff.\n\nOh and using mechjeb for everything must have helped too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T18:43:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 06:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T18:37:34Z","Content":"Reusability changes the equation a bit.

NEVAs take a mass hit, but that crazy ISP allows for a lot of payload flexibility.\n\nI am also designing a planetary transport. Though mine is more multi-mission mother ship. It has generous chemical stores (for landers), crew seating, and docking adaptors. Fully loaded it should gave silly dV and enough juice for a lot of lander outings. Switch fuel payload to nuke fuel and it should be good to visit any interplanetary target. (perfect for a crew ferry)\n\nI charted out the tanks in a Google sheet. The Mk2 long jet segment has the best dry mass ratio for pure liquid fuel of any part. The short one is actually a slightly worse ratio and all Mk3 are less mass efficient than the long Mk2. Only resort to them if you need the greater capacity. The dry mass ratios of tanks are weirdly balanced. The Mk1 fuel fuselage and NCS cones have horrid dry mass ratios. Seriously stay away from them unless you need them for aerodynamic purposes.\n\nA Mk2 nuke design will also want small delta wings for heat radiators and to move the CoL back for aero braking. As long as you use cargo bays, you can descend to 30 km at orbital speeds without worrying about burn up, but aero brakes could still be useful for greater brake control.\n\nCareful using a two nuke design for a Mk2 pure space ship. Making it massive enough for a TWR of .3 full makes for a rather wobbly craft and space sausages don\u0027t naturally have need of structures that would be good strut points.

But the long Mk2 is still the most efficient. The part count savings is worth it for heavy transfer tugs, but for a single planet ferry, Mk3 is a little overkill. Less tends to be more and Mk2 is plenty big for 1-2 nuke craft. I\u0027m a fan of nuclear craft that don\u0027t need struts by design, but the loss of the gimbal makes pullers more attractive and those need struts to make properly ridged arms.\n\nMK3 is also not a lifting body, so you don\u0027t need as much consideration for aerodynamic forces. The radiator effect is more for justifying the wings than real concern.
