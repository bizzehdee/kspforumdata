To that end I\u0027ve got two ships in a 100km parking orbit, one destined for Eve and one for Duna. However, having looked up the optimal phase angles it\u0027s clear that I\u0027m not in luck. Eve is around 30degrees ahead of Kerbin, and Duna is around 100degrees ahead. I think waiting for them to align correctly is my best course of action since there is every chance my ships won\u0027t make it, even in a best case scenario. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC they\u0027ve got around 5/6000dV as they sit now.

Excellent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMrPopcup, your first suggestion is one that strikes a chord with me. I\u0027ve been trying to make my craft smaller and more efficient, but I always seem to run into trouble. My new method is doing \u0022simulated\u0022 (revert to launch/assembly) launches a few times to test new designs. I\u0027d never have tried this if I hadn\u0027t been interrupted mid launch for my Eve craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original launch went horribly. On releasing the first stage the ship lost around 25m/s in vertical velocity, which clearly means the design isn\u0027t utilising the first stage to it\u0027s full advantage since the second stage then has to build that speed back up again (burning more fuel). After I got back to try again, it made orbit flawlessly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s so much to bear in mind whilst playing this game... It\u0027s awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving fun in planes is a favourite of mine already \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E It\u0027s just a shame how the aerodynamics model is compared to FAR. In stock (my career install) I have to be really careful how I fly my aerobatics plane to avoid random flailing and then crashing. Yet with FAR I can consistently push that same design to the very limits of what it can do, and quite often beyond with no real issues. Heck, I can do a pseudo-Mig style maneuver with it and come out fine. But if I install FAR for launching rockets, they invariably end up burning six high powered rocket motors directly towards Kerbin once I begin the grav turn (and I do them smoothly as a matter of course, trying to stay within the pro-grade marker). I\u0027ll stick with my stock install until I can achieve circular orbits and/or Mun and Minmus flights with my eyes closed. Once that\u0027s done then it\u0027s time to ramp up the difficulty and try career again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou make a valid point with the rovers though. I ought to build one so I can start building a lifter around it. The issue I face with this though is the fact that building them in the VAB is a pain. I\u0027ve built multiple in the SPH for messing around on Kerbin, but to attach them to a rocket they need to be in the VAB, which requires raging at the symmetry system for a few hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Although, do the subassemblies carry over from one building to the other?
