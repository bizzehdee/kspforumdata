The idea was to have a two part ship made up of the ship itself (screenshot 1) and a fuel section (screenshot 2) Both were separately launched then docked in orbit. Screenshot 3 is what it looks like when assembled. I wanted to keep the ship light by making the fuel supply as module and disposable as possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen tested on the ground, there was a passive transfer of fuel from the fuel section to the ship (screenshot 4) and everything worked as intended. When it was launched however the passive transfer effect was gone and the only way to move fuel around was by manual transfer. (screenshot 5 - fuel is now draining from the tiny white tank)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to get the passive transfer effect from screenshot 4 when the ship is launched in two parts? Mods even?

You could try the Lazor System v28 by Romfarer. If I remember right in the Engineering subsection where you do the fuel, electricity, etc. transfers there is an option to setup somewhat of a persistent link. So you could add the lazor system part to each section of your craft along with the yellow lazors. The yellow lazors allow you to transfer things between craft. Then setup that link and let it go. That would let you constantly pull fuel from the orange section into the drive section (freaking cool looking by the way!). Not sure what happens if you change control to another craft and come back to this type of setup going. You might have to play with it some.

When you dock them in orbit, the game considers it as a bug. To transfer fuel between two docked ship, you have to do it manually, by alt clicking the two tanks and transfering. But this might get tricky. Instead of using the glitchy Romfarer.ddl, I recommend that you would use the TAC Fuel Balancer. This plugin works extremely well to transfer, balance or edit the amount of ressource in any part of your ship, it\u0027s very useful. Plus, once you set it to do something, it works without your input. This way, you would just have to make the big orange tank \u0022transfer out\u0022 and the fuel would slow out of this tank to every other tank on the ship until it\u0027s depleted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25823-0-19-1-0-20-2-TAC-Fuel-Balancer-Prerelease-of-v2-0-20Jun\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink to the mod\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I don\u0027t know how long you\u0027ve been playing, but very nice ship \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E You have some building skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Ninja\u0027d by MrBond dammit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-18T02:17:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2013 02:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by stupid_chris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"esinohio","CreatedById":57681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T02:39:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer !!!
