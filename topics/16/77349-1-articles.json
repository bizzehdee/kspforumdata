Right now, I have to right click on everything and choose the fire button making things really inefficient. I\u0027m using 0.23.5 on a Mac if that might help you.

Also check out the mod\u0027s release thread to see what options are offered, it is usually mentioned in there somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example in my Vertical Velocity mod, I default the mod control key to Z for enabling the mod and controlling your speed setpoint, but I don\u0027t offer keybindings to change your setpoint step size (how big a step your setpoint changes each press of Z) so there is simply no way to keybind that as I (the mod maker) have not given you the option too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt comes back to what the mod maker offers you in terms of what is assigned to a key and if you can change that key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
