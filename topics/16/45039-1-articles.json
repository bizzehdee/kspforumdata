On LKO (80km) I connected them paralel using docking ports and third T like struts construction, and naively supposed, that now I will have big horse with delta V = 2 times 5000 m/s, but it does not happend. I have still the same delta V. Can any one help me how to connect on LKO N independent tugs to have N times delta V? All suggestions or advice is appreciated. Thanx a lot.

Also, the mass being accelerated will drop as fuel is used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo tugs will go a given distance when they both fire their engines until they run out of fuel. Stage one on top of the other, fire the first stage tug that now pushes the second stage one, dump it when it is out of fuel and fire up the second tug until it runs out of fuel, and you will send that tug a lot further out. The reason that will work is because you have eliminated the mass of the empty tug. IE, a smaller mass will be sent out to a much further distance then a bigger one given a starting mass of fuel and engine efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, two tugs pushing a given mass will send it further then just one tug. But because their mass has to be included in the Delta V, two tugs will not double the distance the payload mass will be sent. That payload will be sent further if you stage the tugs, use one to push the second and the payload, then dump it and its dead weight mass when it runs out of fuel. That could double the distance sent based upon the mass of the two tugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow far it goes is a function of engine efficiency, the amount of fuel used, and the change in mass of the total package from start of the burn until all fuel is used up., and or, empty tanks dropped, engines no longer used jettisoned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of people use clusters of LV-1 not considering that you are pushing a mass of 2.25 tons per engine. Signally, they can push a payload a long distance on a 1000 units of fuel, but a cluster of LV-909s in place of the same cluster of LV-N can easily send the same payload much further on that same amount of fuel. Why, the additional mass is going to cancel out the higher efficiency of the LV-N.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are confused by the math, just experiment and see what works.
