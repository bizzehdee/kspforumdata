I want my kerbals to turn religious during re-entry ;p\n\nIs there a way for me to raise the heat?\n\nAnd is there a way to make more of the atmosphere punishing instead of 25k and down? I would maybe not have to turn Up the heat if I could prolong its existence.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T10:07:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 10:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dedjal**\n  \nAnswered"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T23:00:37Z","Content":"You could thrust towards the planet to increase speed. Even coming in from Minmus you\u0027re only doing about mach 10 and you bleed off some of that in the upper atmosphere. At low Kerbin orbit reentry speeds you don\u0027t even need an ablative heat shield, those speeds can be easily handled by radiative cooling using RCC or hot metal TPS cooling.\n\nAnother way to give more deadly reentry is by using mods that increase the size of the planets."},{"CreatedByName":"K3RBAL KOL4","CreatedById":140935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T23:40:56Z","Content":"Go into your item .cfg files and lower ablator levels of heatshields and lower max-temp of all other items. If you want them to die just send them on a very steep re-entry without parachutes, if they don\u0027t explode the lithobraking will certainly do the job."},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T00:24:07Z","Content":"The previously mentioned solutions will be able to help you. The problem is the size of the planets in KSP just don\u0027t allow for high enough orbital velocities that require long exposure to high temperatures. Beware space planes are vulnerable to re-entry heat for this reason."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T00:42:13Z","Content":"You could try real solar system mod. In that you will need something like 8000m/s\u002B for kerbin(earth) orbit. You will see the heat when you enter with 8000m/s believe me. Coming from other planets would be even faster than that and you can feel the heat for sure."},{"CreatedByName":"Dedjal","CreatedById":57220,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T01:15:35Z","Content":"I do not want to kill the crew, I just want to get my money worth from the heat shields.\n\nDecreasing heat values could be one solution, I guess. But that is a lot of parts I would have to change then.\n\nIs it not possible to take the atmosphere at 25k mark and raise it to 40-50k?"},{"CreatedByName":"Nurph","CreatedById":59509,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T03:08:35Z","Content":"In your persistence file there is a line called ReentryHeatScale under Difficulty.
