I put the big rovemax model XL3 because they were the only things that seem to fit size wise and the only thing with a large tolerance. when I try to take off the wheels simply break one by one and the vehicles blows up down the runway. Usually says structural link fail between it and the body...

Put them on a hardpoint or something to create some distance between the runway and the fuselage (needed for when you rotate). Make sure they are EXACTLY level.

Here\u0027s the procedure:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Find the folder \u0022GameData\\Squad\\Parts\\Wheel\\SmallGearBay\\\u0022 in your KSP directory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Copy \\SmallGearBay\\ and its contents into \u0022GameData\\mycustomparts\\\u0022 or some other directory of your choosing (under Gamedata).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Open \u0022smallGearBay.cfg\u0022 with any text editor (Notepad is fine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Change the line that says \u0022name = SmallGearBay\u0022 to any other name that isn\u0027t used by the game, ie \u0022name = LargeGearBay\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Underneath the line that says \u0022scale = 1\u0022 add a line that says \u0022rescaleFactor = 2.5\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Change the line \u0022title = ...\u0022 to some other name. This is the name that will appear in the VAB, so it is useful to be able to identify your new part (it will have the same icon as the old one). Though this isn\u0027t technically necessary. You may also tweak the \u0022cost = ...\u0022 field, if you care about that. You could change the \u0022mass = ...\u0022 and other parameters too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Save your changes and load up the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done this myself and I can verify that it does work as advertised. Doesn\u0027t require any official \u0022mods\u0022 either. Just remember to unlock the steering and disable the brakes on the nose wheel in the VAB and you\u0027re good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
