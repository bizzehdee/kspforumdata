I was looking at landing gear and saw their m/s values. Then I looked at wheels and they were measured in vastly different units.\n\nHow do I compare impact tolerance of wheels and struts.\n\nI also noticed the girders had VERY high impact resistance, anyone use those for landings?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T13:45:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 01:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tranenturm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T23:11:23Z","Content":"I-beams and girders make good landing gear but have their drawbacks:\n\n1. (new to 1.x) DRAAAAAGGGGG. You can\u0027t retract them, so they\u0027ll be sticking out during launch and fairings wide enough to cover the whole assembly make the launcher fly very poorly.\n\n2. (from before) No traction. If you land on even a moderate slope, your lander will slowly slide down the hill. And as it does so, 1 or more girders will get a good grip momentarily as the rest of the lander keeps moving, so the leg will bend. Then either the girder will lose its grip and the lander will jerk forward, or the girder will break off and the lander will fall over.\n\nBut seriously, Mun has low enough gravity than the normal lander legs will work most of the time."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T23:16:31Z","Content":"There are parts that has like 60m/s crash tolerance but that doesn\u0027t mean rest of your craft has the same values. Even if those girders don\u0027t explode the rest of the craft might just get separated and explode. Besides landing struts give you stability when you land on a slope."},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T13:25:49Z","Content":"In short: do what you would do in the real world and it\u0027ll be the most sensible. Landing gear is perfectly fine for... Landing. Specially the most sturdy model, which I would recommend for a larger vehicle, like that mobile lab. You should never approach ground at a speed that would damage the landing gear, it\u0027s unrealistic, i always make my touch down at speed below 3 m/s, unless something gone terribly wrong, like running out of fuel a few meters above ground, as it happened to me once, on the Mun.\n\nadd a few roboust wheels that will make contact with the ground when you raise the landing gear and you\u0027ve got yourself a very workable rover/lander"},{"CreatedByName":"tranenturm","CreatedById":143304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T13:44:34Z","Content":"I found the m/s values for the rover wheels, which is what I was confused about (it also has impact values).

Don\u0027t be afraid of large wheels or large payloads or fairings.\n\nHere\u0027s my mining rover getting ready for launch:\n\n[![R3vjt73h.png](http://i.imgur.com/R3vjt73h.png)](http://imgur.com/R3vjt73)\n\nThis is what\u0027s inside the fairing:\n\n[![TrSQ9WBh.png](http://i.imgur.com/TrSQ9WBh.png)](http://imgur.com/TrSQ9WB)\n\nGot to orbit no problems. Drag isn\u0027t a huge problem, just keep the speed down for the first 10k ascent and slowly speed up after that. My rover is based on the MK3 parts and holds over 5k LF and O2. It\u0027s now landed on Minmus and drilling for ore. The large wheels are great, they never break and can take a hard landing.\n\nXT"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T16:33:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I found the m/s values for the rover wheels, which is what I was confused about (it also has impact values).

Not for the beginner only, but for all kerbonauts. Backups, always carry backups. Specially in long duration missions.
