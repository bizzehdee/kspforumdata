The largest mechanical forces that a craft is subjected to are during launch (and possible reentry, but you usually only care about a few parts during reentry), so having to deal with wobbly docking port connections is much easier in orbit than during launch.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut if you really want to assemble the craft on the ground, then I see two possibilities: have the engines to move a stage from the launchpad to the assembly place on the stage itself or spawn only the new stage on the launchpad and have a transfer vehicle that can ferry the new stage to the assembly. I would probably prefer the latter.
