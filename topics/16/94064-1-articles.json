And then I smash into the ground going 300\u002B m/s. Only way to deal seems to bring along extra fuel and attempt to do a powered descent.

Put some horizontal velocity on it, and you can abuse a combination of orbital mechanics and a lifting reentry to keep your vertical velocity low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify on the lifting reentry part: if your capsule is pointed above atmospheric retrograde*, FAR will give your capsule a bit of lift. 2-5 degrees usually does a decent job. One way to do it very efficiently is to have an asymmetric capsule. If your center-of-mass is above the midline, atmospheric drag will naturally tend to pull your reentry vehicle to a proper lifting reentry. This is important in the real world, where reaction wheels are very limited, because you can control that with roll, instead of struggling with brute-force pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Ensure your velocity display is set to surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-22T03:28:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2014 03:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"westamastaflash","CreatedById":110546,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T22:44:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify on the lifting reentry part: if your capsule is pointed above atmospheric retrograde*, FAR will give your capsule a bit of lift. 2-5 degrees usually does a decent job.
