I want to escape Kerbin\u0027s gravity and set myself on a course to a lower orbit of the Sun (like Eve and Moho). Technically I\u0027ve already plotted a trip to Eve, but that was using maneuver nodes, I need to do this one with just the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see it I should make my prograde burn when the ship is at A so that it escapes Kerbin\u0027s orbit at C. Not because C is closer to the Sun, but because if I exit at C while going \u0027right\u0027, my orbital velocity around the sun will be \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E then the body I just left (Kerbin). If I escape at A, going \u0027left\u0027, I think I\u0027d be increasing my orbital velocity from that of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, am I correct in the assumption that I should be exiting to the \u0027right\u0027 if I want to reduce my orbital velocity around the Sun?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd should I burn at A to do that, or does the change in angle when I burn hard to break the orbital \u0027circle\u0027 mean that I actually need to burn at B, since after a burn at B the opposite end of the orbit (which is now an escape node) will be pointing straight to the \u0027right\u0027 instead of curving \u0027up\u0027 as it was previously?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T16:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEscape at point D.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley explains why here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/eVPMTQfOvYQ?start=2085\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E (that\u0027s for Minmus, but it works on all orbits I would guess)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vlk","CreatedById":57928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T16:52:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easy answer is that just play around with the nav node, and find the spot where you need the lowest deltav to get to a close sun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut i try to explain the hard one, which is, if im correct, that you have to start the burn around B:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is no Kerbin, you have to burn retrograde, so against your current veloicty around the sun. (Kerbin\u0027s velocity)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want the same while orbiting kerbin, you have to plan an escape route that goes out against kerbin\u0027s velocity. To do that, you have to start burning prograde At around B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere i think you are mistaken: if you burn at A, your velocity at C will be pointing to the right, if you still stay just in orbit, thats okay. But if its a high orbit, it would be a very-very little magnitude vector. But you will not complete the orbit, you will escape. And it is much better if the escape is fast, and if the direction of this escape is a sun-retrograde direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evrion","CreatedById":70825,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T17:36:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, escape at C if you want to go in, A if you want to go out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will have to play with maneuver nodes to get the right place to do the burn so that your exit path matches the desired escape direction.

For going \u003Cstrong\u003Ein\u003C/strong\u003E, you will want to go in the retrograde direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow how to figure out where that is? It\u0027s rather easy. Consider the following picture. This one is actually plotting a course to get from the Mun back to Kerbin, but the same principle applies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L0guOu4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022L0guOu4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice how the tangents of both the projected trajectory and the Mun\u0027s orbit are exactly parallel.

That line must be parallel with the tangent at the body\u0027s orbit \u003Cstrong\u003Eat that point in time\u003C/strong\u003E (ie. when you\u0027re exiting the SoI.)

This is also what you will need to get closer to the Sun. To actually go \u003Cstrong\u003Eprograde\u003C/strong\u003E to go further out, just flip the maneuver 180 degrees around the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T18:12:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to start your burn between points B and C so that you exit perfectly retrograde to Sun somewhere between points C and D.
