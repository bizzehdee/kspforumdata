And now, many months later, it has reached its destination! But...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECircularization is way more expensive than expected! I planned my deltaV budget based on the map here :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q0gC9H7.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/q0gC9H7.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with a first stop around Ike, I calulated (250\u002B2*(30\u002B180)\u002B360) = 1030m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd my ship has 1502m/s in its tank, so I thought it would be easyyy. But, really, it is not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step, achieving extreme elliptical orbit around Duna, is alredy 950 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what went wrong? Are the map values realist? Do I need to have a travel time of a full Duna year for them to be accurate?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-11T00:42:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2015 12:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ikare\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T21:37:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe values indicated in the delta-V maps such as the one you linked are mostly idealised values: you can need exactly the dV indicated, hardly less, or much more depending on your transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that most of the delta-V lost in the process was in the initial insertion burn: when you went from hyperbolic orbit around Duna (escaping trajectory) to stable orbit around Duna. Depending on your ejection burn at Kerbin, this one can greatly vary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow did you plan your transfer to Duna ? Did you use a window planner ? If no, then you probably launched at a bad window and therefore it is normal that you\u0027ve needed much more dV that you first thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if your Duna periapsis for the encounter was higher than indicated (60km on this map) then, you\u0027d need more dV again to circularise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-V could also have been lost while messing around with Ike: again, non-optimal transfer window and high encounter periapsis can greatly increase the dV requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: remember that Duna has an atmosphere that is thin enough to aerobrake safely with most craft designs, and that Ike\u0027s large SOI can provide strong gravity assists. These two can greatly reduce the dV needed for your mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ikare","CreatedById":149933,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T00:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
