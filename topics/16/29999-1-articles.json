For large ships, I recommend using RCS, but with smaller ships or ships you don\u0027t want to have wasting all that RCS, use an SAS module. ASAS doesn\u0027t make it easier to change attitude, it just holds a given attitude the best it can when the SAS light is on. Command pods/probes really don\u0027t help provide much torque, but I still use a probe on almost all my ships so they can function unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Banbite","CreatedById":5170,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T15:03:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime warp to stabilize \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS works to, if you balance it properly\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RobbazIsKing","CreatedById":57761,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T15:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike the previous posts RCS or use the LV Liquid Engine for some torque from the enngine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
