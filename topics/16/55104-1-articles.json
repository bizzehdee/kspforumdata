Luckily, you don\u0027t need to. Sub 1km intercepts are only needed in the relatively small orbit you find around planets, as you get too much error trying to thrust straight while in a curving orbit. If you\u0027re going around the star Kerbol, you\u0027ll be fine with hundreds of km for an intercept, and close in using a rocket engine or RCS (divide distance by 100 to get approximate distance / second you want to close at - so at 200 km away, approach at 2000 m/s). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou won\u0027t be able to do an EVA and capture if you plan to pass by with vastly different shaped orbits with the same apoapsis, as you\u0027re relative velocities will be far too high.

That circular orbit is a reasonable starting point but with target orbit this elliptic I would probably go the other way - rise the apoapsis somewhere near Jool, match the periapses near Sun, then lower the apoapsis to get the encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose \u0022two years to coordinate\u0022 ... if you mean real time then no, rendezvous in solar orbit does not take significantly longer time than rendezvous in Kerbin orbit.

First thing that came to mind was a space cannon that could be used to bounce the free floating kerbal into rescue craft\u0027s orbit.
