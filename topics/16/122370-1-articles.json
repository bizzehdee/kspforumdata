It\u0027s turning out to be a lot harder than I expected. I have a couple different issues, but the biggest one is simply getting enough dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes around 5500 to reach a 70x70 orbit, and I\u0027ve heard you can get between 1200-1500 m/s with airbreathing engines, but that still leaves more than 4300 m/s that has to be done anaerobically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with the Aerospike, I am having a really hard time cramming that much fuel into a rocket body with reasonable dimensions. I can get around 4200 in a decently controllable design, but as soon as I add wings and extra jet fuel (let alone if I\u0027m using seperate air-breathing engines), it drops to under 4000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you guys point me in the direction of some example designs that contain this much dV? Or give me any tips or ideas as to how to go about this? I\u0027m thinking about moving up to RSS, but if I can\u0027t do an SSTO in 3.7x, there\u0027s no way I\u0027ll be able to with a 6.4x scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T13:23:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t think people SSTO\u0027d in RSS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use RSS, you\u0027ll want to use realistic parts too, which have better mass ratios and TWRs, and in some cases, better Isp.... so....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to your question...

In the current aerodynamic model, I can get my craft up to about 1300 m/s at 22k altitude in air breathing mode, which means that not a lot more is required to actually reach orbit on rocket engines. Also, a lot less dV is required to get to orbit in the current aerodynamic model, arounf 3200 m/s and not the 5500 you think you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-reading your post, I am thinking you are not playing KSP on a PC platform, as the version number does not correspond, so what I said above may not hold true on the platform you are playing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain H@dock","CreatedById":139017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T14:03:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERe-reading your post, I am thinking you are not playing KSP on a PC platform, as the version number does not correspond, so what I said above may not hold true on the platform you are playing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fairly sure the 3.7x he\u0027s mentionning is a scale factor, not a version number. kerbol A.Bx refers to the Kerbol System where all distances are multiplied by the A.B decimal number.
