It means, since your orbit is inside kerbin\u0027s, that you are orbiting faster than kerbin. but not a lot faster, becuse your orbit is still fairly similar to that of kerbin. you probably have an orbital time of 300 to 350 days - it would have been nice if you had included that in the picture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhich is a problem if you want to return to kerbin fast, because you are moving faster than kerbin but you are slightly ahead of it. so you\u0027ll basically be chasing kerbin, for a full orbit. you\u0027ll only gain a few weeks every orbit, so it will take a while to catch up. It\u0027s going to be fairly cheap, at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to shorten your return, you can use some of your large fuel allotment to try one of two things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) go slower than kerbin, so that it will be kerbin to catch you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) go a lot faster than kerbin, so that you can reach it faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\noption 1) requires you to raise your orbit - either apoapsis or periapsis, apoapsis is likely more efficient - until you have an orbital time of some 500 days. this way, kerbin should overtake you in one orbit or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\noption 2) requires you to further lower your periapsis - down to an orbital period of 200 days or so - so that you\u0027ll move a lot faster than kerbin, and you will overtake it in two-three orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin both cases, you are likely to not cross kerbin\u0027s orbit in an hohmann-like transfer, so you\u0027ll get a very high intercept deltaV - hence the need for a strong heat shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmore troubling, in both cases, you still have the problem of getting an actual intercept on kerbin. it\u0027s doable with more orbital mastery, but not easy to explain.

I plotted it near apoapsis because I want to still intersect kerbin\u0027s orbit; luckily, the ship is close to apoapsis right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nburning retrograde I moved periapsis down, quite a lot. but crossing the orbit of moho is not a problem, encountering it by accident is extremely unlikely. then, at periapsis, I made a small prograde burn to raise orbit and cross the orbit of kerbin. Do notice that the periapsis maneuver is not in the first periapsis passage, but in the second; that\u0027s because it will take two orbits to overtake kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI planned those maneuvers, and of course I did not got a close encounter. but then, it\u0027s only a matter of increasing or decreasing the initial burn; this changes your orbital time, so that if the simulation shows that you will be passing behind kerbin, you need to get there faster and so you must lower periapsis a bit to reduce orbital time. and if you pass in front of kerbin, you are too fast and you must raise periapsis. be wary that this fiddling will also move your second maneuver, so you have to move it back to periapsis every time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nboth options will leave you with some 1500 m/s, which should be enough for kerbin capture even if your approach is not very favorable. so you can do this even if you don\u0027t have a thermal shield and aerobraking capability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: also, your whole management was quite inefficient.

A planet is moving very fast, and your ship is also moving very fast, so when they meet, they will have great differences in speed. but, just like two cars speeding on a motorway can touch each other lightly with minimal damage because they are moving in the same direction at very close speed - but a lateral of frontal impact would be devastating - you can achieve a low intercept speed relative to a planet if you reach it while going in the same direction. it\u0027s called a hohmann transfer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Calculating a Hohmann Transfer : 15 Steps - Instructables\u0022 data-ratio=\u002293.02\u0022 style=\u0022max-width:946px;width:711px;height:661px;margin:0px;\u0022 width=\u0022946\u0022 src=\u0022https://content.instructables.com/F4Z/WM7Q/IJM04H3Y/F4ZWM7QIJM04H3Y.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;frame=1\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis case shows earth and mars, but the principle is, look at the point where the transfer orbit intersects mars orbit: both mars and the spacecraft are moving in the exact same direction. this results in (relatively) small intercept speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you cross the orbit of your target body, the intercept speed is a lot bigger, because you are moving in different directions. but sometimes, like in your case, you can\u0027t avoid it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na reentry pod with a heat shield can withstand a lot of punishment, hence my prediction that - even though you\u0027d have to cross kerbin\u0027s orbit in your trajectory and therefore would have a high intercept speed - your ship could survive. it appears from the picture that you don\u0027t have a thermal shield but rather a cargo bay; that\u0027s also very good for thermal resistance, unfortunately it creates drag in front. and when a ship has drag in front, it wants to flip. good for you, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was strong enough to prevent that\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
