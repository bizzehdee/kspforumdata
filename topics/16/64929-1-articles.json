This means I can\u0027t drop all six satellites in Jool orbit and have them insert themselves into their orbits alone. It would only count as \u0022one\u0022 satellite being dropped by the SSTO. As for inserting the satellites into their orbits on their own, during an intercept, I don\u0027t think that counts. I messaged the mods and they said they have to be in their \u0022parking orbit\u0022 when dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TalonX273","CreatedById":43698,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T06:07:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 3/6/14:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done some practical testing.

Now, this platform was essentially a poorly built flying orange tank, with 4 Mk1 tanks attached. Not to mention, I botched Cruise and Circularization Phases too. So it might be possible to cram a little more dV out of this. I\u0027m not entirely sure what numbers to use for the Delta-V calculation, hence why I did a practical test. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone please confirm what\u0027s the maximum dV an SSTO can carry into orbit? Or is this test already the best case scenario? Once I have that number, the next step is finding the most Delta-V effecient flight path to execute the mission. If those two numbers don\u0027t match... Well, this mission is impossible then. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Talon\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-07T06:11:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2014 06:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TalonX273\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
