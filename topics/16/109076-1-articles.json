Hopefully my math isn\u0027t off here, if it is, feel free to correct me!\n\n For anyone who doesn\u0027t know what a logarithm is, it calculates out \u0022How many times (x) do we multiply y to get number z\u0022 (log ^ y (z) = x) , for example, 5 \\* 5 \\* 5 = 125, so log^5(125)=3. For the rocket equation, we are looking at a natural logarithm, which uses Euler\u0027s Number (2.71828) as Y. So ln is the same as saying log^2.71828, or log^e.\n\n So lets break down the rocket equation based on the information in the OP\n\n\u003E \n\u003E When its refueeled it has exactly 3000 units of liquid fuel, and it weighs 46.1 tons at that point. Also it is using 2 nuclear rockets with 60kn each and an isp 800\n\n The rocket equation when using Isp is DeltaV=Isp\\*g0\\*ln(M0/M1), where g0 = Gravity (9.81m/s^2), M0 is mass when full of fuel, and M1 is empty weight. So pulling down from above, we have an approximate empty weight of 12.8 (Fuel units weigh about 0.0111 each, so 46.1-(0.0111\\*3000))\n\n DeltaV=800\\*9.81\\*ln(46.1/12.8)\n\n DeltaV=7848\\*ln(3.6015625)\n\n DeltaV=7848\\*1.325\n\n DeltaV=10398.6\n\n So you should have plenty of DeltaV for things, assuming you have a way to get all that into space directly. The harder part of those engines is they are pretty bad in Atmosphere by comparison (Having an Isp of 280 instead of 800 in atmosphere, plugging that into the equation you come out to 3639.51, on those engines alone, you won\u0027t even get into orbit from the surface! \n\n For TWR you are looking at TWR=Thrust/(m0\\*g), so in this case, TWR on Kerbin would be 120/(46.1\\*9.81), or 0.265, whereas in space it would be 2.603 (120/46.1).\n\n As such, I would expect your ship to work quite well in space with those engines, but on Kerbin, It wouldn\u0027t lift off by itself. Taking that ship, strapping it to a rocket and getting it to space first is your best bet. Once in space, the ship should easily be able to make it to the mun and back.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T22:34:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 10:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SoberSquid**"},{"CreatedByName":"iDisOrder","CreatedById":143952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T22:09:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Breaking this down a bit more for any kerbalnauts...\n\nI\u0027m certain that you did a wonderful job simplifying this for most here, \n\nbut for those of us that your response causes migraines, is there a mod that allows you to enter a destination and calculate it for you using the ship you\u0027ve built?\n\n*(yes, I\u0027m a total n00b at this in case your wondering)*"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T23:41:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m certain that you did a wonderful job simplifying this for most here, \n\u003E but for those of us that your response causes migraines, is there a mod that allows you to enter a destination and calculate it for you using the ship you\u0027ve built?\n\u003E \n\u003E *(yes, I\u0027m a total n00b at this in case your wondering)*\n\nConveniently, the delta-V to a destination doesn\u0027t change with ship design, it\u0027s the same for all ships to a given destination.
