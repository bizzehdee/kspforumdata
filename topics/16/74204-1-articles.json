To minimize capture delta-V, therefore, you need to minimize how fast you\u0027re going when you arrive at the target planet. You do this by making your approach orbit as shaped as much as possible like the target\u0027s orbit before you get there, so you\u0027re going not much faster than the target. IOW, instead of going direct from Kerbin to Moho, you 1st put your Pe down near Moho, then pull your Ap down after you to near or inside of Eve. Problem is, this is just moving the delta-V expenditure from the capture burn to the transfer phase so unless you can brake at Eve as suggested above, it probably won\u0027t make the total delta-V much less, it just makes less of it happen at capture which is often useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several ways to lower your Ap. The cheapest is to brake at Eve, which means you\u0027re leaving on an Eve window, not a Moho window. The simplest is to just burn at your Pe down near Moho.
