I stopped playing career mode because I got sick to death of having to fail contracts because they don\u0027t work. You tick all the boxes but they still don\u0027t complete. So I just play science mode now. I hope they fix this on ksp 2, though I\u0027m not confident.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-03T08:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not a bug.
