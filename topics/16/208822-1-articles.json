And so, it is possible to come from an interplanetary trajectory and still hit atmosphere at less than 1800 m/s, which is a safe speed in most cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat is a general rule. the smaller a planet, the better it is for aerobraking - if it has an atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for how fast you can go, it depends on the ship, and whether it has some thermally sensitive components. those have breaking points at 1200 K, and they tend to explode over 1500 m/s unless they are in a shielded position. a normal ship with all components having a thermal breaking point of 2000 K.... you can hit atmosphere between 1900 and 2000 m/s. With a thermal shield? I managed to survive a reentry at 10 km/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour profile also matters. In the high atmosphere you don\u0027t heat much, but you brake even less, so you can take a short passage in the atmosphere if you stay high - useful to circularize, but it won\u0027t help you with an interplanetary capture burn. On kerbin you can enter the atmosphere with a normal ship at 2300 m/s because your trajectory is almost circular, you\u0027re staying up high, and by the time you drop in the denser atmosphere you already lost enough speed to survive. On duna, if you want to get captured, you have to go low on your first pass, and that means hitting dense atmosphere at full speed, so your maximum safe speed is lower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, somebody may claim that it\u0027s better to go deep immediately for convoluted reasons of heat transfer, but it\u0027s a urban legend. it\u0027s potentially true only in rare corner cases. Perhaps it was true in a previous version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
