If you have RCS you can use it for a very fine tuned burn (turn on CAPS LOCK for precision and use translation controls). If you\u0027re as far out from Duna as I think you are, trying to use engines probably will result in an overshoot. When you focus on Duna (use Tab to change focus, backspace to return to your ship) I suspect you\u0027ll find that you couldn\u0027t get any closer because you have an inclination that takes you above or below Duna. Make sure to setup your maneuver to correct inclination first, then tweak it to get within the atmosphere. Combining the maneuvers is more efficient, but we\u0027re talking about very subtle changes so it may not be worth it. Assuming you aren\u0027t in Duna\u0027s SoI yet I would just try to get within the atmosphere and roughly equatorial (if you can get to a roughly 15 km Pe, that is great, but anything within \u002B/- 10 km of that I probably wouldn\u0027t mess with). Fine tune it once you are in Duna\u0027s SoI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also recommend installing \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/238\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETrajectories\u003C/a\u003E. It simulates your aerobraking trajectory and give you a projected orbit or landing site depending on how low your Periapsis goes. It makes aerobraking significantly easier/safer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mabarry3","CreatedById":152371,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T14:19:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing about the SOI changes that I recently read though:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to install a text editor (nothing special) and go into the KSP folder, and go to the settings.cfg file and use the text editor to read it.
