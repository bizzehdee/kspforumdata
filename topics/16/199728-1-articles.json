Is there a way to more finely control the speed? For instance, with engines you can reduce the thrust from 100% to a lower % so that the thrust is more finely controlled for maneuvers.

If you reduce the motor size, or if you add more mass for it to turn, then you\u0027ll start to see it struggle to maintain target RPM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want better numbers control, you may want to delve into the world of KAL-1000 Controllers. You could for example bind the Throttle to\u00A0Play Position on a KAL Controller. Then set the KAL Controller to alter your rotor\u0027s RPM. Maybe set it to just a specific range, like from 200-360. This will give you small increments with Shift/Ctrl, but in a narrower range.\u00A0You can take this a step further by combining multiple KAL Controllers, perhaps creating different gears for the rotor. But it gets complicated fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost likely what you\u0027re trying to do is fly a plane, in which case you should instead consider binding Throttle to the Authority on your blades. Tweaking the blades\u00A0gives you better control than tweaking the rotor, and since the\u00A0best blade angle changes with air pressure and speed, it\u0027s something you\u0027ll want to have direct control over anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-21T05:32:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to GamePlay Questions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vv3k70r","CreatedById":208078,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-21T11:17:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223912223\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199728\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221611174212\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205063\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maddog59\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, maddog59 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t seem to see any difference in behavior when I use the torque limit % field\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour propeller is not draggy enough for motor output.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse bigger proppeler to abuse motor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maddog59","CreatedById":205063,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-21T13:48:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223912356\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199728\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221611195468\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208873\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022InfernoSD\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, InfernoSD said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost likely what you\u0027re trying to do is fly a plane. \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks much for taking the time to provide those suggestions.
