The only reason to put batteries on a comm sat over those required to get it to its destination (usually 0) is if that sat is also fulfilling some contract that requires batteries on the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-30T23:02:55Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2019 11:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorj","CreatedById":201273,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-30T23:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\u00A0 That will sure make deploying a swarm of RA-2s easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
