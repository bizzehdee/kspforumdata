To really eliminate it, the way resources flow would need to be reworked, which I suspect is unlikely to happen. Your best bet is to alternate the placement of intakes/engines. Intake, engine...intake, engine...etc.\n\nAs a side note, asymmetric flameout is a thing on realy high performance airplanes. Some airplanes (like the F-15) have a system that detects when one engine has a problem, and automatically adjusts the other. Also, the book \u0022Skunk Works\u0022 details several asymmetric flameout stories that plagued the SR-71 flight testing.\n\nThat being said, I don\u0027t think asymmetric flameout adds to gameplay, considering that it\u0027s a side effect to the resource flow that is only marginally controllable by the user. I did build a sort of fix for this, but it\u0027s rather complex and can render planes in flight semi-broken if uninstalled. It\u0027s not been updated for 1.0. The intake build aid above is your other add-on option.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T18:04:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 06:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"}]}
