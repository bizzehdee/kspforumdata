I\u0027ve been reading the forums for a long time but this is the first time I\u0027ve actually posted anything. I did a quick search to see if my question had been answered, but there was nothing obvious (as you can imagine, searches for \u0022crew transfer\u0022 come up with a whole big mess of results).\n\nI\u0027ve flown a fuel tanker full of kerbals out to Minmus for the collection of science, and to serve as a fuel depot for missions outside of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. I managed to dock this terrible monstrosity, but now I can\u0027t seem to transfer crew from one section of the station to another without using EVAs. This is a problem, since kerbals leaving the command pod of my fuel tanker can\u0027t seem to do anything other than re board (it looks like their heads spawn inside the RCS wheels!). Without crew transfer I won\u0027t be able to use the lander or the orbital lab until I fly even more crew out here!\n\nSo my question is: Is the crew transfer interface buggy? Am I using it wrong in some way? \n\nHere is what I do:\n\nLeft click the crew hatch, get the crew transfer window. \n\nSelect a kerbal to transfer. Interface changes, full modules appear orange, not full modules appear blue, as expected.\n\nLeft click on a blue module to transfer kerbal to a seat in that module.\n\nNothing happens, whatsoever.\n\nTry right clicking, option clicking, double clicking, etc...\n\nNothing happens.\n\nCry.\n\nIs there a known bug? Is this a side effect of running TAC? Are kerbals not able to transfer through non contiguous crew spaces? WHAT IS HAPPEN? ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\nMany thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"nfpinto","CreatedById":143049,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T17:30:35Z","Content":"you need to use a mod for it. \u0022crew transfer\u0022 or \u0022ship manifest\u0022 do the job"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T17:38:47Z","Content":"Huh, this is strange.

For me, the problem eventually works itself out.\n\nSometimes double-clicking on the destination capsule works.

It definitely seems worse at some times than at others. I\u0027ve played around with it a little bit, and I have a theory of what\u0027s going on:\n\n- I think that when they coded it, they didn\u0027t code the \u0022click\u0022 event very robustly: that the mouse press and mouse release have to happen right on the same spot, i.e. you can\u0027t press down, move the mouse slightly, and then release.\n\n- When the game slows down (e.g. if you have a big craft with high part count, or your video card is having trouble keeping up with a high-def render of planet\u0027s surface), so that the frame rate is lower, it checks for mouse-down and mouse-up more slowly.\n\n- This results in the impression that your clicks aren\u0027t getting anywhere.\n\n- However, you may be able to make it register if you press the mouse down, are *very careful not to move even a millimeter*, wait a moment or two, and then release the button.\n\nYMMV. I haven\u0027t had the patience to try controlled experiments with this, since it\u0027s pretty sporadic and hard to reproduce. I may have even gotten some of the repro steps a bit wrong.\n\nHowever, what I can say is: It\u0027s definitely a thing, has been around since 0.90, and I think it\u0027s possible to work around with careful mouse technique."},{"CreatedByName":"Duke Leto","CreatedById":142852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T05:36:10Z","Content":"This bug is the absolute BANE of large scale Tourist missions.
