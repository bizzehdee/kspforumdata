This is NOT about that. Apparently, I\u0027m the only person who has had no problem with using the Mk1 command pod without a heat shield (it seems to survive just fine for me, and I\u0027ve got all the difficulty settings on max except for being able to revert flights and quicksave/quickload). Which is definitely strange...\n\nANYWAY my real question is this- what can we do to help orient ourselves during re-entry without resorting to ridiculous \u0022cheats\u0027 like deploying parachutes early? For example, last night I had this spacecraft:\n\nParachute-\u003E Mk1 command pod -\u003E Science bay -\u003E Service bay (with four goo modules inside it)\n\nThe service bay has a built-in heat shield apparently and so it does not require a heat shield (I\u0027ve done re-entry from the Mun with it at 3000 m/s.... yea, no heat shield is required at all). \n\nWhat happened was as soon as I got above about 2 gs of deceleration, the craft got almost impossible to orient correctly- it would flip around with the command pod facing INTO the atmosphere and explode in like five seconds. After several tries, I just spammed the staging button in desperation, and to my surprise, the parachute popped out in drogue mode, the craft decelerated at like 20gs, and Jeb\u0027s life was saved. Obviously, this is not realistic, and I hate it (using parachutes like this during re-entry).\n\nObviously, the craft is too draggy on the bottom, and too heavy on the top so an aft-end first approach is highly unstable.\n\nSo my question is this- what can I do to help me orient crafts correctly? In the case of the above vessel, I can think of some simple solutions\n\nParachute -\u003EScience bay -\u003E Service Bay -\u003E Mk1 command pod\n\n^^This would probably move the CoM enough toward the aft end to allow me to keep control of the craft.\n\nBUT that\u0027s beside the point. There will be other craft that are far more complex that I need to keep proper orientation on.\n\nSo can I use fins, or will they burn up? At this point in career mode, I just got access to my first fins. However, such fins may make ascent much more unstable (because they will be on the top). I still have that stupid VAB that limits me to only 30 parts.\n\nWhen I get these airbrake parts, can I use those, or will they burn up?\n\nBasically, is there some kind of draggy part that doesn\u0027t burn up easily that I can use on the top of my craft to help orient it during re-entry, or do I need to fiddle around with the CoM instead?"},{"CreatedByName":"Chiodo","CreatedById":141044,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T14:22:45Z","Content":"Try this:\n\nUse a pilot that can point to Retrograde, or a probe and a good SAS module to point retrograde during the re-entry, if it helps use RCS.\n\nDo NOT perform a vertical re-entry, try to bounce gently on the air drawing a curve in the sky: more heat time but less G"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T14:44:10Z","Content":"Parachutes are remarkably resilient at this time... you could try kicking out a drogue chute from the top end at 30km.

(The communities expectation is a big heavy heat shield should shift the CoM sufficiently to contribute to the stability of the reentering ship...)\n\nIn the mean time, a couple different ways to tackle this:\n\n1. Upgrade the Astronaught Complex to unlock EVAs. Then, you can EVA to recover all experimental data and pack it away in the Command Module. Decouple from the (now empty) experiments, and let them burn. Have the Command Module (with a chute only) and reenter with all your experiments on board - win.\n\n2. A route I want to experiment with is putting separate heat shield and recovery chutes on the experiments. Deorbit the whole thing, and then separate for reentry. Hopefully both halves will be recoverable."},{"CreatedByName":"Bedwyr","CreatedById":104239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:12:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Huh? 22 km physics range?
