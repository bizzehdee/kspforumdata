But I want to set a key for each aileron to roll (E for rolling right and Q for rolling left). I\u0060ve just started doing crafts with robotic parts and this plane is my first craft with them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-27T16:45:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes you can. You\u0027re looking at axis groups. Just assign the actuators to the \u0022roll\u0022 axis (or if you\u0027re using the KAL-1000, assign its animation position to the same axis).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
