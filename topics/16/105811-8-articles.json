Pre-1.0, I believe there was enough science in the Kerbin system to complete the tech tree twice, and since then, they\u0027ve relaxed the requirements for use on several of the science tools (e.g. pre-1.0 you couldn\u0027t take temperature scans in high orbit, now you can).

I didn\u0027t realize the limitation before I recently landed a very nice science bus on the Mun that has two labs. Was that a complete waste? When the first lab is finished with the data, can I then load the same experiments into the second lab? Does the first lab make the second lab totally invisible and thereby useless? Have any of you reading this thread explored this configuration in detail?\n\u003E You shouldn\u0027t let people build craft with two labs if it\u0027s a waste.\n\u003E \n\u003E I like the MPL mechanics, but it needs polish. As someone mentioned, with labs you can complete the tech tree without leaving the Kerbin system. The labs need to be better integrated into the career mode\u0027s pacing. That means you might have to change the whole science gathering system to accommodate them.\n\nIt\u0027s not a total waste, every scientist on board contributes to the daily rate. So, 2 labs with 4 scientists should be double the daily rate of 1 lab with 2 scientists. It\u0027s just the 500 cap and the hidden internal no-repeats log that is per-craft and not per-lab. As for preventing it, it should only be a warning, as some may wish double rate, or have aesthetic reasons for choosing to have multiple labs.\n\nCompleting the tree without leaving Kerbin SoI is nothing new, and that\u0027s something that is actually a good thing. While it\u0027s possible to do interplanetary without completing the tree, plenty of people have absolutely no interest in doing so. I\u0027m not interested in exploring the solar system with one hand tied behind my back. The career game is absolutely not about ongoing unlocking of the tech tree, that would be a terrible game. That has never been what the game is about, and I sincerely hope it never will be. It is about unlocking the tech tree as a start of game activity only, with mid to late and end game being all about exploration and managing funds. I always get the tech tree out of the way as first priority, before any interplanetary missions. The game is an open ended exploration and building sandbox, with the tech tree strictly as an early game \u0022getting started\u0022 activity only. You can choose to venture out of the Kerbin SoI early if you prefer to do that, but you should never be forced into that just to get the full set of parts. The science system absolutely should not be changed in the way you suggest, it is absolutely not broken like that.\n\nYes, the labs need some polish, and a proper UI in particular. No, they do not need \u0022to be better integrated\u0022, they need to continue as a stand alone and optional science source which you can choose to use or ignore. There is nothing wrong with career mode \u0022pacing\u0022, it\u0027s working the way that it\u0027s supposed to work."},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos_F","CreatedById":143276,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T16:51:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I can unlock the entire tech tree without going farther than Kerbin\u0027s moons?!

I mean don\u0027t spoil the entire game for me, but that is disturbing.\n\nYes, money. There\u0027s a science --\u003E funds policy, which allows you to convert 500 science into 50.000 funds. I have two labs on Minmus pumping out 100.000 funds every ~100 days.\n\nAnd to those suggesting the lab needs a nerf because of it easing finishing the tech tree before even leaving Kerbin SOI: that would only make sense if everything stayed the same and the tech tree became **bigger**. Think about it. Are you going to force people to travel beyond kerbin SOI before they unlock tier 3 engines/fuel tanks?? Makes no sense. We went to the moon in the sixties, using computers that were less powerful than the most humble smartphone. And after all these years and advancements, going beyond \u0022Earth\u0027s SOI\u0022 is still an extremely daunting undertaking.\n\nFinished the tech tree? Use labs to generate funds.

It is about unlocking the tech tree as a start of game activity only, with mid to late and end game being all about exploration and managing funds.\n\nSo many different people approach games from so many different perspectives with different priorities. Personally, as a player on my first run-through, I find that science comes a little too easily and the MPL as it currently exists gives too much science when you start time accelerating, even for legitimate reasons. When I can do a mission and unlock 5 techs at once, I get a little overwhelmed with all the new parts. And it makes the success of gaining science and unlocking techs somehow seem a little less rewarding than I\u0027d like it to be. \n\nPerhaps I\u0027ll change my perspective after multiple run-throughs, but even if so, every game should have a really good first run-through. I\u0027d like to see them do away with 2/3 of the KSP biomes for a start. And maybe add some end-game techs that do nothing except let players who want to unlock future techs unlock them. The Squad team is pretty clever at writing stupid stuff that makes you smile, and future techs that do nothing would be an opportunity to expand on that a bit. \n\nI\u0027d also like to see the MPLs chew through data quicker. Not to generate science faster, but to require more attention from the player. Once you get it full of data, you need to wait forever before you plug in the rest of the reports you have waiting to be processed. It leaves me feeling like all those surface samples from Minmus were a waste of time, and thus reduce that satisfaction for having been so incredibly clever as to pull off the amazing feat of getting them in the first place. (Now I know that getting surface samples from Minmus is no big deal, but still, first-time players want to feel like they are incredibly clever for figuring stuff out). \n\nWhatever tweaks come down the line, I hope they keep in mind a large number of play styles.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T17:25:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 05:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity**"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T18:25:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not interested in exploring the solar system with one hand tied behind my back.\n\nCareful there, games in general are all about doing things with one hand tied behind your back.

It makes no sense at all."},{"CreatedByName":"Pappus","CreatedById":100574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T23:31:07Z","Content":"Are you sure that it is processing science on kerbins surface or rather kerbins stuff itself yields little data?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I couldn\u0027t be more against anything which forces you down a particular path in career mode using the tech tree, or that nerfs current science levels. **It would be a huge, game-breaking mistake!**\n\u003E The tech tree is early game only, end of story. That\u0027s how it is, that\u0027s how it has always been, that is how it is designed, and that is how it should be. The game is about exploration, not grinding science reports. Science is still useful once the tech tree is completed. If you are incapable of motivating yourself to explore the solar system, without a stupid grinding mechanic and one hand tied behind your back from having a pitiful selection of parts to use, then you are in the wrong game!\n\u003E \n\u003E Career mode is not about unlocking the tech tree, that\u0027s just one tiny component of it that is intended to be the earliest, finite, and relatively short start to your career. Once it is complete, you are exploring for the satisfaction of exploring, gathering science for the satisfaction of gathering it (and getting paid for it once the tech tree is complete), designing new craft for the satisfaction of designing them (and to help with the other activities), and fulfilling contracts. Right now, everyone has the choice in how they prefer to start the game, either completing the tech tree locally, or reaching further out while completing it. Taking that choice away and replacing it with a horrible slow grind that involves a huge amount of time warp would be a dreadful mistake and go a long way to euthanising KSP long before its time!\n\nWhy don\u0027t you just play sandbox? I don\u0027t get your logic at all. In simpler terms: There is no progression anymore once the science tree is done. You can now design rockets without anything remotely resembling science stuff, because why would you. All missions before always try to pack what they can to get at least some science out of it. The game is more enjoyable as long as there are tradeoffs you need to make. I can design a rocket that lands once on mun, gather science and come back. I cannot design it in a fashion that also allows for 4 tourists to be sight-seeing at the same time. Most beginners will likely be in the same shoes as me and I like the seperation that having the science tree not fully unlocked brings.\n\nI was doing science only mission for a purpose, be it turbojet to start spaceplaning, to go further or simply cheaper. There is no exploring as far as I can see. There is nothing to see on those planets, you mostly need to click on some science stuff to even check if you are actually in another biome. The career mode should be all about being limited, because if I don\u0027t want to play it THAT way I can just press sandbox where it really is about exploration.\n\nCareer mode should be about establishing bases with rudimentary stuff you have."}]}
