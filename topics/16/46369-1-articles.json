The problem is with reentry. It will not burn up (I use DR) but it will begin to roll uncontrollably (I also use FAR,) causing the G-loading to tear it apart (and rip off the VG ejection module.) My profile was to bring its periapsis to 10km and let drag do the rest.I\u0027ll post a screen shot in the morning.

Does it starts to tumble during reentry ? In this case, i think you have too much weight at the rear of your spaceplane and not enough drag at the rear. (Maybe try to add some flaps at the rear configured as aerobrakes - and deploy them during reentry) - basically, you should ensure that your center of drag is behind the center of mass during reentry, else the center of mass will try to get in front of the center of drag, causing the spaceship to tumble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
