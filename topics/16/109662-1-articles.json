Extra tank on top who will be moved to bottom. \n\nSide mounted LV-N using the new nosecones. two probes on the sides.\n\nClose up view of 2.5 m bay.\n\n[![DTAqb71.png](http://i.imgur.com/DTAqb71.png)](http://imgur.com/DTAqb71)\n\n[![AeGOTB2.png](http://i.imgur.com/AeGOTB2.png)](http://imgur.com/AeGOTB2)\n\nTwo KIS containers, a stack of .612 m batteries with an mechjeb module on side, two RTG and two small monoprop tanks. \n\nKAS winch and node, an life support module. It might be an minor clipping on the KIS modules but that is standard on multiple crafts. \n\nOnly unique is the canards used as landing leg extensions. \n\nThought first it was the octo core so I replaced it with the 1.25 core in bottom, it also manage more heat.\n\nSee now that the 2.5 m service bay is dislocated from the rest of the craft. is it the small monoprop tanks? \n\nOnly other unique thing about this ship. and yes by design their connector have to clip. Have used up to 4 of the 150 liter tanks in bays before.\n\nAny tips\n\n[![AqspkxG.png](http://i.imgur.com/AqspkxG.png)](http://imgur.com/AqspkxG)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T15:38:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by magnemoe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:39:08Z","Content":"I believe that part clipping in service bays can lead to this problem.
