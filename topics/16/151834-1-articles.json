So I built the sat and put it into orbit and all mission critical circumstances were fulfilled except the: \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EReach the designated equatorial orbit around the Mun with reasonable deviation.\u003C/span\u003E The Periapsis is supposed to be 241,665m and the sat. is at 241,653m, and the Apoapsis is supposed to be 252,929m and my sats is 252,958. In my book that is a reasonable deviation. Especially since in all the videos I watched on youtube they usualy had far greater deviations. The orbit is pretty much spot on with only a few dozen meters difference, yet it won\u0027t let me accomplish the mission. Is that a bug? or is there something I\u0027m doing wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-10T21:44:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello wardogjohn and welcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn almost every one of these cases, the satellite has been put into orbit moving in exactly the wrong direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you look at the target orbit in map view, you should be able to see an animation within the orbit line moving around to show you which way the satellite must move in the orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the markers which indicate inclination when viewed from the satellite in question should be very near to zero.\u00A0 If they are near to 180 then you are going the wrong way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DD_bwest","CreatedById":164906,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-10T22:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyup starhawk is on the money. its almost always that the satelite is going the wrong way. \u00A0its an easy mistake to make even for the more experienced player. \u00A0ill occasionally not be paying attention and launch the wrong way only to realize once i go to the map to make my circulization burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chiron0224","CreatedById":147812,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-11T01:01:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFreaking this.\u00A0 I love satellite contracts because they are how I print money but if I had some funds for every time I put a satellite in the wrong direction I wouldn\u0027t have to do so many contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wardogjohn","CreatedById":171416,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-11T02:26:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo out of curiosity, Do you flip the orbit by 180 degrees or do you revert?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-11T11:41:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222846443\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151834\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221478831183\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022171416\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wardogjohn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, wardogjohn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo out of curiosity, Do you flip the orbit by 180 degrees or do you revert?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sheer amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E required to flip the orbit (essentially kill all your velocity, stop, and get going just as fast in the opposite direction) is enormous.\u00A0 Usually prohibitive for a small satellite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the answer is flip the orbit if you have enough fuel and don\u0027t mind burning it.\u00A0 Otherwise revert.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-11T19:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222846443\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151834\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221478831183\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022171416\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wardogjohn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, wardogjohn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo out of curiosity, Do you flip the orbit by 180 degrees or do you revert?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA large number of players take the advice that \u0022you did all the work necessary to get the orbit so very close -- you deserve the credit, but don\u0027t do it again.\u0022 And then go into the Debug Menu, under Contracts, and mark that contract \u0022Complete\u0022 via cheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if the orbit is high enough, reversing it doesn\u0027t take all that much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.
