Like I said in the title, I have little skill in the game, especially in comms. I attempted to set up a network for a Duna mission (after realizing that I didn\u0027t have a powerful enough antenna), only for the probes not to connect. The first probe, a fuel depot, has a HG-5, and nothing else (communications wise). After I lost control and realized that this was not enough, I sent a relay satellite. It is orbiting the sun, both is apoapsis and periapsis at about the halfway point between Kerbin and Duna. The relay has an RA-15 antenna. When put in orbit, it didn\u0027t connect with the depot, so I sent another relay. Again, no connection. Did I do something wrong? Do probes just not connect? Any help will be appreciated. Thank you in advance.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Lucida Sans Unicode\u0027, \u0027Lucida Grande\u0027, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003EImages\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/1jyEvry\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis is the fuel depot.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/3T3cqZv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis is the relay.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/glkUjeP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis is the map, showing both relays, the depot, Kerbin and their relative positions.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-19T05:16:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe entire problem is summed up in the antenna range equation, for connecting between two antennas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConnection Range = sqrt ( AntennaRange1 * AntennaRange2)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour HG5 has a range of 5000km.
