I did swap the structural intakes for ram-air intakes right off the bat since as others have pointed out the structural intakes aren\u0027t well suited to spaceplane use. The design isn\u0027t half bad, a few tweaks and I could get it to a roughly circular 75 km orbit. I did swap out the long MK2 liquid fuel fuselage for a short LF and a short LFO MK2 fuselage. My first attempt at an orbit had roughly 490 units of LF without any oxidizer. I would also recommend swapping out the engine nacelles even though I didn\u0027t try this. They are rarely worth the weight compared to what you can use in their place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Using my usual ascent profile I peaked at around 1.2 km/s and maintained over 1 km/s up to about 25 km. The short version of my ascent profile is accelerate to about 270 m/s at a modest pitch, then climb to 10 km with as high a pitch as you can while maintaining about 270 m/s (just don\u0027t pick up too much vertical speed, keep it under 100 m/s). At 10 km start to level out by setting SAS to point prograde and letting it track prograde down to just below 10 degrees pitch and return to stability. Usually I level out at around 15 km. You should already be going about 1 km/s at this point. As you observed you\u0027ll start losing thrust, but you should still have enough to continue accelerating. For TurboJets you\u0027ll probably start losing velocity around the 20 km point, but I usually stay with the jets until they either cut out or I drop too close to 1 km/s. At this point you switch to rockets and you can basically ascend like you normally would at this point if you were using a rocket. I\u0027m changing my ascent profile all the time and there is probably someone out there with a better one, but this is the one I like and it worked for my version of your plane at least once. Jet engines are pretty sensitive to the operating conditions, airspeed, altitude, air intake, and angle of attack all factor in and you need to maximize them all for a good ascent with a spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe margins were pretty thin, though that may be because my piloting skills aren\u0027t tuned for this plane.

This changed drastically with 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENowadays, air-breathing engines have \u003Cem\u003Etwo\u003C/em\u003E velocity curves - one based on velocity and one based on altitude - but no Isp curve. Your Isp stays constant at all times, but if you\u0027re operating outside the engine\u0027s rated optimal altitude, you\u0027re getting less thrust for that constant fuel usage, so that\u0027s basically a \u0022stand-in\u0022 for the old Isp curve. Except that additionally, it affects the way you fly the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the Whiplash and the RAPIER are modeled mainly as ramjet engines, but with turbine assistance at subsonic speed. Ramjets only work properly when flying supersonic; their velocity based thrust curve starts low on the runway and then increases with speed for a while until finally it starts dropping off again with even more speed. As a result, a spaceplane equipped with these engines may have trouble hauling itself off of the runway on turbine thrust alone; and when you\u0027re already struggling to maintain airspeed, climbing is even harder. Which is kind of a catch-22, because if you could only climb a little, you could accelerate better with less drag... But, if you\u0027re investing your thrust in climbing, you\u0027re not accelerating right now, which means your engines don\u0027t spool up to higher thrust levels... And so on and so forth. It can get tricky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you somehow manage to push through the sound barrier and pass 350 m/s, the ramjets finally get going and suddenly the plane starts \u003Cem\u003Epushing\u003C/em\u003E. What now happens to newcomer pilots is that in their elation, they pitch the nose up sharply and try to ride that massive ramjet thrust tsunami up and away towards the edge of the atmosphere. And then the other thrust curve, the altitude-based one, comes into play and the engine thrust evaporates all of a sudden, even if there\u0027s still air in the intakes. This is especially true since the high tech engines are quite optimized for high altitude flight, with their atmosphere curve all but plateauing for a while... and then they suddenly fall off a cliff at the end of that plateau. Since you report that you\u0027re only at mach 2 while going past 15km and losing thrust, I\u0027m fairly sure that this is exactly your issue. You\u0027re going too high too early without accelerating first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this means is that you need to learn in which regimes your engines can be operated in the most favorable manner. Find the \u0022cliff edge\u0022 of the atmospheric thrust curve, right before the engine starts rapidly losing thrust, and level off at that altitude to accelerate as much as you can. At some point, the engines will again begin to rapidly lose thrust, this time due to sheer speed, and that\u0027s the point where you have maxed out their potential. \u003Cem\u003EThen\u003C/em\u003E you pitch up into your actual climb into space. After your pitch maneuver, you switch the airbreathers off and the rocket motors on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJudging from the Whiplash\u0027s config file, you want to stay above an atmospheric density of 0.16 while accelerating before your final climb. I\u0027m not exactly sure what height that translates to, maybe some of the more experienced pilots can weigh in on that. You can probably get to mach 4 before you need to start pitching up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DCWarHound","CreatedById":135609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T08:28:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few things to keep in mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to keep the amount of dead weight you\u0027re carrying to a minimum,things like air brakes,monopropellant and rcs thrusters (if you\u0027re not going to dock),rocket engines,reaction wheels,wings and control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket engines are dead weight in the atmosphere,try and get a combination of \u0022Whiplash\u0022 engines and \u0022Rapier\u0022 engines.The extra thrust from the rapier will allow you to take more weight to orbit.Your airbreathing stage should get you at least up to 40km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirbrakes aren\u0027t really needed,tilting your plane upwards will expose its belly which will create allot of drag and slow you down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re only taking up cargo to space and not docking,the monopropellant in the cockpit and 2x single direction rcs thrusters mounted on the top will be enough to get the cargo out of the bay (switch to docking mode and turn on RCS and hold \u0022S\u0022 or \u0022W\u0022 to fire both rcs thrusters,remember to turn back to staging mode once done)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need more reaction wheels,unless your plane is excessively large,the reaction wheel in the cockpit should be more then enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWings and control surfaces create drag,only use as many control surfaces as you need.To find out if you have enough lift,fly in a straight line and then look at the prograde marker,if the prograde marker is above the direction you\u0027re heading then you have too much lift (aka drag which slows you down),if it is just below the direction you\u0027re heading then you have enough lift and if it is far below the direction you\u0027re heading and you\u0027re losing speed then you don\u0027t have enough lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECalculate how much jet fuel you need by disabling the fuel flow on your fuel\u002BOx tanks and then doing a standard SSTO SP ascent:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly up to 10km at 45 degrees,flatten out to 0 degrees once you reach 10km,once you reach around 800m/s start pulling up to 25-45 degrees (25 makes your rocket stage more efficient but you might burn out)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need about 2500 of Delta/V for your rocket stage to get in orbits between 72km and 200km with enough left to do maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robertlong13","CreatedById":146954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T15:01:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheDarkMechanic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheDarkMechanic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhere/how would one host a craft file?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDropbox is a great free option for file hosting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T15:34:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn old versions of KSP, air-breathing engines had a thrust curve based on velocity and an Isp curve based on altitude.
