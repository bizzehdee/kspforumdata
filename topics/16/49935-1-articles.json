Trying to improve myself as a player and be less dependent on mods...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does the math of vehicles work? Like the mass? What does 0.3 mass equal? I\u0027m assuming once I know the mass of objects I can use an equation based on the Kn of thrust an engine provides to determines if that engine can lift that total mass? Also how to determine the Delta V of a stage and of the entire rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you guys understand what I\u0027m getting it. Its aggervating not knowing the true weight in tonnage and not knowing the lift capabilties of a stage!
