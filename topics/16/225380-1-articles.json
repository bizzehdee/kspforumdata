I had no idea this existed until now, apparently it was added in the final major version (1.12)! Unfortunately, after a little messing around and a quick google, it looks like that\u0027s just how it works, unfortunately. It seems it\u0027s capable of producing\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0transfer to other bodies, but not necessarily a particularly fast one...
