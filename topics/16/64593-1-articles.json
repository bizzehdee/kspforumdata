I am trying to land Kerbals on the other planets, this probably isn\u0027t a good design for it but the trouble I am having is the initial lift off. if I put all the outside tanks feeding straight in I have no problem but when I put it into an asparagus arrangement the first tanks get messed up in flight somehow. one side is emptying faster than the other.

The rocket only climbed up to 2 km and then fall down because of too low TWR. Split it up into several rockets und assemble your interplanetary ship in the orbit. That makes constructing lifters and acending easier. ~500 parts also caused incredible low frame rates - that\u0027s not fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn use less struts! For example the outer aspargus ring should work with only 2-3 struts per tank (2 on each side above the decoupler, one in the center below it or the other way around).
