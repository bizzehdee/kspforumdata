Burning straight up to reach heights of Mun and beyond takes more fuel than establishing an orbit and then raising the apoapsis to the same height.

The fact that gravity will always pull you down even as you are trying to thrust straight up. Once you are in orbit and speeding toward the horizon this pull of gravity just increases your apoapsis on the far side; it doesn\u0027t actually make you lose energy. If you go straight up; it is always slowing you down. This effect is more obvious if you have a low T/W ratio which is actually pretty common given the low thrust hish ISP engines normally used for interplanetary travel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-28T23:48:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2013 11:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Alistone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrazedGunman502","CreatedById":81247,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T23:46:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alistone\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alistone\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGoing straight up:\u003Cp\u003EPros:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t have to worry about gravity turns or steering losses to establish orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity drag constantly reducing rocket efficiency.
