But they should fly with minor tweaks.\n\n- Rocket launches can get tricky at first, until you realize that you just need to limit your angle of attack.\n\n- The lifting body effect can screw you over until you learn to use it to your advantage\n\n- Fairings become a must. I haven\u0027t tried out many mods for this, but [Procedural Fairings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39512-0-90-Procedural-Fairings-3-11-manual-shape-controls-%28December-17%29) works fine for me\n\nOnce you get the hang of it (shouldn\u0027t take that long, really), you can reap these rewards:\n\n- Taking off without having to swim through the soupmosphere\n\n- Lift is generated realistically, meaning that you get more lift. (If memory serves me right, lift should be a square of the speed, while in stock it\u0027s just linear)\n\n- Swept wings work as they should\n\n- Flying is more fun\n\n- In most cases, getting to space requires less Delta V with winged crafts\n\n- It might prepare you for 1.0, depending on how the new aero model works\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T20:37:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 08:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T20:45:42Z","Content":"Jarmund is dead on, on all points. \n\nFAR is the best choice I have ever made in a mod since I started playing oh 2 or 3 years ago."},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T20:54:59Z","Content":"If it were me, I\u0027d wait for 1.0 as the stock aerodynamics is updating."},{"CreatedByName":"Friend Bear","CreatedById":123301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T21:01:26Z","Content":"Or practice with FAR and prep for 1.0. \n\nPlus, the chicks totally dig a player with FAR...\n\n![A-Queer-Chick11111.jpeg](http://thehairpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/A-Queer-Chick11111.jpeg)\n\nIts how I got my wife (see above).\n\nYou can also consider NEAR.

It really just depends on what *you* want to get out of the game. It looks like you\u0027ve been playing the game for a while. Usually people start to settle into what kinds of mods best suit their play style. Physics enhancements, visual enhancements, science reworks, etc... If you find that you tend to play in deep space a lot, something that affects atmospheric behavior may not be all that useful. If you tend to build a lot of airplanes or spaceplanes (or think you\u0027re going to get into them), it can certainly change how the game feels for you.\n\nBear in mind that you can also make a copy of your entire KSP install, and put FAR on that second KSP install. That would allow you to cleanly revert if it turns out you don\u0027t like it. That might make make the prospect of a test drive a little less concerning.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T11:33:50Z","Content":"IMHO if you\u0027re interested in planes and you want them to fly like planes you should get FAR.

If you\u0027re more of a \u0022throw it together and see if it works\u0022 type, or if you prefer supersonic tri-planes, avoid FAR like the plague. Myself, I made the switch because A) I had pretty much nailed down how to fly planes in stock and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) because I knew changes to stock aero were coming and I wanted to get to a state where, to the best of my knowledge, I could design and fly craft that would work in the new state of things. \n\nPecan gave you the link to the thread I started up last month that\u0027s detailing my adventures with FAR. Have I figured everything out yet? No. Obviously. But I am learning, and I haven\u0027t yet resorted to throwing bricks, so there is that. My big annoyance with FAR is that I am very much a figures and guidelines type of builder, and FAR has few solid guidelines. Or at least, it has guidelines that are more ambiguous than stock. For example, in stock, you fly with 1:1 mass to total lift coefficient ratio. In FAR, that much wing will give you too much drag in the critical region between 25-30k. What\u0027s the proper substitution there? Hell if I know...I haven\u0027t found a working solution with stock parts yet, let\u0027s put it that way.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T15:19:38Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 03:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T01:33:36Z","Content":"You\u0027ll find after a while with FAR you\u0027ll just be throwing things together that work.
