Most SSTO use between 2 and 15 intakes per engine and 2 is considered a very small number. Although it might be possible to get into space with only one intake per engine the cargo to thrust ratio may mean you need 2000 parts or more to be able to do it. Two to four intakes per engine are possible without stuffing the intakes inside of each other so I would suggest upping the intakes if you can. If you try making a craft with 15 intakes per engine mashed and clipped into each other then you will see why doing it with one is very hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also worth noting that although rapiers are less efficient than ramjets and rockets their flameout for air intake is also much lower than jets and more evenly distributed so you are less likely to spin out of control at low air pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T21:09:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t have realistic SSTO, there are no SSTOs in reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour insistence on one intake per engine is just personal preference - KSP intakes have set area, real life engines don\u0027t use one of pre-manufactured intake areas, their intake area corresponds to needs of the engine.

Maybe also try to mount a set of wings to help you fly through the atmosphere?

With jets you don\u0027t really want to do that. You have experienceed the fact that your jets will flameout after just a minute or two if you do this, which is wasting the advantage of jets... their high efficiency. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to use the jets to gain speed for as long as possible. In order to do this you\u0027re going to want to add wings and climb like an airplane. Get yourself some turbojets (not basic jet engines, turbojets work at much higher altitude) and climb to as high as you can without risking flameout. If you go with one intake per jet this will turn out to be about... uh... 25km if I recall correctly. Level out at this altitude and gain as much speed as you can. If you can gain enough speed to put your apoapsis outside the atmosphere, you\u0027re done! Coast to apoapsis and finish circularizing with the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I don\u0027t think this is possible at 25,000 meters. The maximum airspeed of turbojets is 2400m/s (surface speed. About 2570 m/s orbital). At this speed their thrust curve goes to zero. And 2400 m/s at 25,000m is not fast enough to get your apoapsis into space. So you\u0027re going to need to climb higher than this, reducing throttle on the jets to avoid flameout. Adding more intakes would definitely help at this point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not willing to add more intakes you\u0027ll need to switch over to the rocket by the time you reach about 30,000m. You probably don\u0027t need a mainsail from here, though. A skipper is likely to be good enough and the weight saving will help you a lot with your initial ascent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, while the quad-couplers are useful, they\u0027re also heavy. You\u0027d be better off without them. Use multiple fuel tanks with a jet and intake on each end instead of a big fuel tank with an adapter and multiple jets/intakes on each end, or use cubic octagonal struts to attach your jets and intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-19T00:41:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2014 12:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T00:36:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo reinforce the good comments above; first change engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasic jets are only useful at low altitudes and speeds.

Otherwise you either end up with an fuel/oxidizer imbalance in your main tank, or you end up carrying too much fuel around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Ditch any oxidizer in your strap on tanks. (Can\u0027t tell from your pic.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) As has been hinted at, fly fairly horizontal at 25-ish km and let the TurboJets build up some speed.

For this family of lifters, I find that I typically need as much rocket fuel on bottom as what I\u0027m carrying on top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, I also wait a bit longer before firing up my main engine. I think my 40t lifter also has a few more TurboJets on it.

That\u0027ll give you a bit more dV for your main engine\u0027s orbital insertion. If you do that, put the engines on a hotkey to shut them down before decoupling...

The album was for a challenge, but shows how much you can lift on just TurboJet engines. 236t at launch, it ended up with all that junk (8x 200-8 fuel tanks) \u002B 3/4 of an orange tank when it reached orbit. I honestly can\u0027t remember the mass on orbit, but maybe around 100-110 tons.
