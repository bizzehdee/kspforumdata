But yet whenever i try to pitch my nose more than 5 degrees or so in either direction it just flips out. Is it part of the new aerodynamics? If so i hate it because i cant even manuver with it like that. Is there a way to fix it? Would Putting the center of lift behind the center of mass fix it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T17:14:10Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!\n\nYes, the general advice is to have the CoL slightly behind the CoM. Right on top of it makes for minimal stability."},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T17:14:18Z","Content":"It would most likely help matters quite a bit if you moved the center of lift a bit behind the center of mass, yes."},{"CreatedByName":"Combatsmithen","CreatedById":146407,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T17:17:54Z","Content":"Im not new to the game lol.
