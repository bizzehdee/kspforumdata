And you won\u0027t have the opprotunity to fine-tune your orbital inclination, so you have to match it as you start the gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T11:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou essentially need to figure out how long it takes to get to your apoapsis after liftoff. Then, lift off at the right time so that your apoapsis coincides with your escape burn point. At apoapsis, you don\u0027t burn to circularize, but burn longer to escape.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T12:00:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022erkha343\u0022 data-cite=\u0022erkha343\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it enough to launch slightly before I reach the escape angle?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally yes but it is not exactly simple as you need to get on the right trajectory.
