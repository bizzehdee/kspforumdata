Does it keep the ship around but remove those parts from that ship? Does it keep the ship and NOT remove the parts, therefore causing a bug where it potentially crashes the program because the vehicle is making a reference to nonexistent data? Does it remove the ship entirely if it references nonexistent parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, what does it do to ship designs you\u0027ve already saved in the VAB using the deleted parts?
