Not a trivial calculation. - As he said, put the Reaction Wheels near to the CoM to help you rotate it. You can put thrusters as the extremities to rotate a ship quickly - but that will possibly screw you up if you ever want to use them for lateral movement instead.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"Nathair","CreatedById":102894,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T13:44:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But if you rebuild the same craft into a smaller and tighter ball like structure with a bit of torque control spread evenly around the centre of mass, then it can be nicely responsive and well controlled.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It is a welded Craft so the source of torque is located at the CoM.\n\nIt does not matter where torque is applied.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T13:47:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 01:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nathair**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T13:56:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It is a welded Craft so the source of torque is located at the CoM.\n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/sVtI5](http://imgur.com/a/sVtI5)\n\nOkay, so this means your ship will have uniform denisty - but it doesn\u0027t say anything about the shape..
