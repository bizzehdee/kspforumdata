For instance if I wanted to change the game time to say year 1 day 233, what value would that equate to in the persistent.sfs on the UT line. (day 233 is just as an example) I\u0027m trying to play around and see what different launch windows look like in sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoToH","CreatedById":68428,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T22:39:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUT is total time from game start (year 1, day 1) in seconds. To change to day 233 you have to add 232 days, 232*6*3600 = 5011200 seconds (assuming time setting is kerbin time with 6 hour days).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jamsham","CreatedById":111568,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T04:01:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I didn\u0027t see that a kerbin day was 6 hours.
