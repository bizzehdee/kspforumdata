However I\u0027m sure I\u0027m doing something wrong with plotting launch trajectories though.\n\nI use olex\u0027s launch window calculator which is fine, however I then have to guess at my launch angles etc as KSP doesn\u0027t show them, so it\u0027s all done by eye. It can take ages to wait for the planet to come into alignment and if you overshoot you have to wait even longer even at full timewarp.\n\nThere has to be a quicker way? I toyed about with kerbal alarm clock but that didnt\u0027 seem to do what I wanted, no zoom to launch window feature.....\n\nPlease someone, fil me in, what do you do to make planetary launches viable? mods? tricks? I think I had a mod a while back that showed teh launch angles etc....engineer I think!? But it\u0027d be extra nice if I could zoom automatically to that point.\n\nThanks, Kev"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T15:25:24Z","Content":"I just launch the ship to LKO, then use a maneuver node.\n\nKAC does have a transfer window calculator that you can use also.\n\nAlso, if you miss the transfer window, you can compensate by using more fuel.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T15:28:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 03:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Merinsan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Volix","CreatedById":144192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T15:27:26Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t used it myself, but [protractor](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83173-23-5-Protractor-Continued-Rendezvous-Plugin-v2-4-7-%28June-14th-2014%29) might be just what you\u0027re looking for.

That one gives a time rather than an angle between Kerbin and the target planet.\n\nNear the time specified in the planner I create a maneuver node about where I think it should be on my orbit.

I slide my maneuver node around on the orbit until the ejection trajectory is exactly parallel with my new orbit which is very important for efficiency. This simple method sets the ejection angle and determines the exact departure time.\n\nAt that point I zoom way out and hopefully see an encounter (if there\u0027s no significant plane change) or at least check to see that my orbit becomes close to tangential to my target orbit.\n\nIf no significant plane change is needed, I then fine tune the maneuver node while focusing the view on the target planet. This allows quite detailed control of your trajectory within the target\u0027s SOI.\n\nIf a significant plane change is needed, I wait until after the plane change burn is done and then place another maneuver node and fine tune the encounter.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"TDplay","CreatedById":173761,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-14T12:37:37Z","Content":"I personally first get into circular \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and then go on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E and set a timer for the next transfer, usually with a margin of just over half my orbital period.
