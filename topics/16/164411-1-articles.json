I believe this is why all my ships flip out of control after dropping the first stage. I am keeping the Blue lift bubble below the yellow center of weight marker for all stages that will be used in the atmosphere. Does anyone have a tutorial on how to build stable rockets in 1.3? I can make it to orbit in smaller craft but If I try to build one to go to the Mun the craft always flips out of control when I drop the first stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPS: how does a heat shield or capsule produce lift when the surface creating the lift\u00A0it is inside of a staging clamp where air can not get to it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rodhern","CreatedById":144074,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-14T16:25:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are on Steam try revalidating the game files.

Flipping over is an old, annoying friend of mine. Here\u0027s what I do to keep him from showing up at my house.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWatch your wet center-of-mass. As fuel burns, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E moves. If you\u0027re not careful, though, the remaining fuel mass can pose a problem during your gravity turn, inducing a flip. With heavy lifters stacked on multiple tanks, I change the fuel priority so the lower tanks burn first. This shifts the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E towards the nose quicker than if I let all the tanks empty themselves equally (the default).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBe wary of solid rocket boosters, as they have no gimbals. If they are too powerful compared to your liquid-fuel engines, you may lose just enough steering control to flip over. To compensate, I\u0027ve either reduced the flow rate of the SRBs or added some Mk-55 \u0022Thud\u0022 engines to the sides to add more thrust and gimbal.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA little drag may help borderline cases. I\u0027ve solved some flipping problems by ensuring I had adequate tail fins to keep the rear-end planted.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWatch out when using non-cylindrical lifting bodies such as the MK2 for rocket fuselages. At speed, lifting forces will throw your rocket back and could flip it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStaging can suddenly drop a lot of mass, briefly throwing your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E into chaos. If your ship is not quite nose-heavy enough, or unstable structurally, it may not be able to survive this transition.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStrengthen the ship using autostrut or, if geometries are complex, actual struts. Anything that wobbles won\u0027t be fuel-efficient. A wobble that grows into a resonance (especially during Max Q) may flip the rocket if steering overcompensates. I always autostrut each stage\u0027s main engine to the root part, unless I have pods sticking out. For outboard engines I usually try autostrut to grandfather part. If the ship twists itself to bits with this, I\u0027ll throw actual strut parts on there to hold her steady.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHide non-aerodynamic parts inside fairings if you can. You\u0027d be surprised how much a set of exposed landing legs will cost you on ascent.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPay attention to Max Q (MechJeb is good at this) but be careful not to throttle down too much or you may lose control and flip.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-14T18:26:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/120032-enriched-uranium/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022120032\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/120032-enriched-uranium/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Enriched Uranium\u003C/a\u003E, a problem like what you\u0027re experiencing can best be diagnosed with a screenshot.

Dropping your first stage is causing a very rapid change in the aerodynamics of your rocket. Fins or winglets usually solve this problem without a redesign.
