I decided I really enjoyed all the rendezvous and docking I had to do to rescue all of them. Thus, my next project was born, the Kerbal Space Station, KSS for short, in LKO. It would serve as an orbiting gas station and recharging port for spacecraft and cell phones. So I designed and launched a station core with two Gigantor panels, and docking ports on either end. I used the launch vehicle to put that in to orbit. Next I built, launched and attached a station propulsion unit and construction tug, and after some harrowing docking, put it all together:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ztoten3uvd2nvqz/screenshot763.png?dl=1\u0026amp;token_hash=AAHzdwl4O15Y8jfA6SyIbVrC1Vvyn9f1FDqep-A1R_z1JQ\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot763.png?dl=1\u0026amp;token_hash=AAHzdwl4O15Y8jfA6SyIbVrC1Vvyn9f1FDqep-A1R_z1JQ\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks too small, I realize it\u0027s just 3 components, 1 of which is temporary, but after seeing videos and screenshots of other stations I expected the solar panels and everything to be bigger. Are those stations just using different part packs? or is there a bigger solar panel I missed? I realize this is kind of a silly aesthetic thing, but I enjoy building big things! Right now this looks more like a gangly ship than a station. I am planning a few additional modules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECommand Control Module - with a Cupola observation deck and all the ASAS/probe body things (role currently held by the construction tug)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHabitation module - probably made from hitchhiker pods, unless there is something better to use?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFuel tanker modules - large fuel tanks for storing LF/OX for ships to refill from\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMulti-ship docking adapter - for the ships to dock to for refueling/parking\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECrew Escape Vehicle - something that can be loaded with Kerbals and cut loose in the event of an emergency\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I guess I\u0027m looking for general advice to make sure I\u0027m on the right track here, what does everyone think of the initial build, the plan and my not-so-Gigantor panels? Any other key modules a good station should have?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I learned my first lesson the hard way, RCS thrusters are no good without some kind of fuel! My propulsion module (opposite the tug in the above image) was unable to dock because it had no way to translate and make small maneuvers. I ended up getting it close with the main engine on it, swiveling it around to mostly line up, and then docking the station to it! In reverse! Have you ever tried to dock in reverse? It\u0027s kind of thrilling... and terrifying.
