So I started playing around with them and figured out that if you put an avionics unit on the front of them and add some wings they will fly really straight every time... You don\\\u0027t even have to activate the avionics package, just having it will make them fly straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/UCcgr5uItzQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/UCcgr5uItzQ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-06T05:17:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHuh.
