When calculating the DV (removing the oxidiser) for various small and slightly larger craft they never seem to be better than using the LV-909 ... am i missing something???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T09:15:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse fuel tanks that only hold LF. \u00A0When you use an LF\u002BO tank with the O removed, the best wet/dry mass ratio you can get is about 5:1 rather than 9:1 for LF only tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T10:29:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntech level as well. unless you are focusing on getting the lv-n you\u0027ll get the 909 first\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nickrich","CreatedById":159998,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T11:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, it was the LF only tanks that threw me, i\u0027d only looked at the \u0027rocket\u0027 tanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T12:03:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou also might not be packing enough delta-V.
