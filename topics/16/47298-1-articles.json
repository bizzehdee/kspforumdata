However, no matter how many struts I attach or how slow I go they seem to break and fall off at the slightest hint of a bump...how are they so useless? It says their impact tolerance is like 150 or something so what gives? If you\u0027re telling me theyre connected with the same strength as everything else is then that\u0027s equally as retarded...4 of those wheels cant even support a single orange tank\u0027s mass evenly distributed between them...The smaller ones...they can...how? I cant even drive something with these off the lip of the runway without them breaking off at 2m/s... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to build something that can refuel my planes on the runway after a long mission. I would use the next wheels down, but I need the height and constructing something throws off the center of gravity too much for it to be practical. Unless the largest wheels get a realistic performance enhancement I guess I\u0027ll just never be doing that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T18:20:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know what is causing your problem, I can get 4 of them on an orange tank with a cupola and a large diameter battery off the runway just fine at top speed of 13m/s or so.
