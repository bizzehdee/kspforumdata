One preliminary note - due to my ruthless culling of extra jet engines to save weight, this thing can barely get out of its own way in-atmosphere. \u00A0It has to launch half-empty on Kerbin (I refuel in orbit), then has to do a slow climb and then dive at around 7k meters to get velocity into the Rapier sweet spot. \u00A0Laythe performance was a little better, but I still had to turn on my nukes for about 5 seconds on takeoff to make sure I didn\u0027t hit the ground right away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t care much about Kerbin efficiency as long as the darn thing makes it to orbit, since I will be refuling in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E anyway. I do care about saving fuel on Laythe, though.\u00A0But since so much delta-v is going to be expended in space, weight may be more important than atmosphere performance. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, I\u0027ve currently got 2 Ram Air Intakes on each of my Mk 1 nacelles. \u00A0They generated way more than enough intake air throughout the journey, and are fairly light, but I hear their drag is not the best. \u00A0Other options:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The shock cones. \u00A0These seem to be the go-to choice in most planes I see. \u00A0I do not need the extra air at all, but I do hear they have better drag than the Ram intakes. \u00A0I did a test climb with shock cones and could see maybe a minor speed improvement, but it was overshadowed by inaccuracy in my climb profile. \u00A0The extra weight shaved off about 20 of my plane\u0027s 5,800 vacuum delta-v versus the Ram intakes, which does not seem like a big price\u00A0if there is a decent efficiency improvement on Laythe. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The precooler, which also seems pretty popular. \u00A0I like the zero-drag factor, but between the weight of the part itself and the fact I\u0027d have to put something else in front of my nacelles (maybe NCS adapter and tiny-size nosecone), it will likely end up heavier than the shock cones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0It will also add bulk, being the size of a Mk \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E tank but with much less fuel capacity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The radial adjustable ramp intakes. \u00A0\u00A0These are very light, which I like, but they add a new source of drag and, again\u00A0would require me to put a nose cone in front of my nacelles. \u00A0Air supply seemed adequate (maximum draw with 2 of these guys was about 50% according to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E), except for a weird thing where my Rapiers flamed out 1 second after initial engine startup on the runway. \u00A0This was remedied by starting at half throttle for the first few seconds, then maxing out once my plane was moving. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of the other intakes seem like good options. \u00A0The subsonic ones would flame out, and the divertless intakes seem like worse alternatives to the precooler. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am tempted to just go with the shock cones, but was wondering if anyone else has any thoughts on what works best for a Laythe mission. \u00A0At the end of the day I doubt there\u0027s a big difference, but half the fun of KSP is agonizing over the best part choice, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny other thoughts on ways to optimize the plane are welcome as well. \u00A0I am tempted to remove the drone core, clamp-o-tron and/or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, but usually end up regretting those decisions. \u00A0I\u0027m only keeping 15 monopropellant. \u00A0May also reduce the oxidizer capacity as I don\u0027t need it all to escape Kerbin, and didn\u0027t need any on Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinal note - part cost is not an issue. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-04T07:36:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you willing to exploit a bug?
