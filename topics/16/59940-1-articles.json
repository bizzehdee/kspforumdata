I set one of my other Sats target to Kerbin. Then I found that sat and copied the target. Then I pasted it into my save file for the target for my dead probe. That seemed to work. I don\u0027t see this as cheating, since it would have been set up that way before remote tech, just I didn\u0027t have the options to do that. I noticed that I do not have to Physically POINT the antennas at each other. That would be very Tricky. That would make a VERY challangeing update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
