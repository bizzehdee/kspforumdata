Have you tried scrolling out further and rotating the view around? I know it seems obvious, but we have to ask. Solar orbit is a bit place. The orbit could be located beyond Eeloo, and it could be polar. Also, sometimes the game hides orbit lines of orbits that are much larger than the current zoom setting. For example, you never see Kerbin\u0027s own orbit line until you zoom the view way out of its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-24T08:21:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get the map view or Tracking Station to display a satellite orbit, you need the view to be focused on the CB in question.
