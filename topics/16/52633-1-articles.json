I had put together a lifter using orange tanks and mainsails where I could recover them once they parachuted down, but I could only ever save the one I was focused on.

If you add another nuke you get twice the thrust and consume twice as much fuel. The extra thrust doesn\u0027t really buy you anything in space (unless you just can\u0027t stand the long burn times). However, bringing the extra nuke adds a LOT of extra weight to the launch. I would prefer to just have one nuke and be patient. Even if you can\u0027t get up enough velocity to hit Kerbin escape velocity on your first pass around the planet, you can just burn again on your second pass around the planet and still get about the same Oberth effect because you would be burning at the periapsis the second time around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ve never built a craft big enough to require more than one nuke, but maybe there is a good reason to do it for very large crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
