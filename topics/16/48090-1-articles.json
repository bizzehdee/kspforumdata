However, having flown that particular mission myself I can say that the craft works fine, the LV-909 itself couldn\u0027t have been the issue. Off the top of my head it sounds like you either clipped the engine into something, that there was something obscuring the engine or that something was clipped into the engine inside it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for a troubleshooting approach, I\u0027d advice you to redo it and design it from the top down as you normally would, but try it between each stage. Design your payload, test it (even if it won\u0027t get off the ground). Then add the stage before it, and test. The continue so for each stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Luna 9 payload and a FL-T400 tank below it a LV-909 can lift it even on Kerbin, so put that on the pad and test it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould your decoupler have been on the wrong way so it dropped the tank and was still attached to the engine? That\u0027d cause it to not exert any thrust. The arrow needs to point at what you want to detatch (so the engine).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T11:53:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022technion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022technion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey guys,\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fairly new to the game and working through the historic missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent a lot of time struggling with the Luna 9 (first probe to the moon) mission.

Just continue the burn until the counter reached zero or better yet, view the burn in map mode and cut power as soon as the intercept takes place. Be sure to throttle down near the end so you don\u0027t overshot the intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upper stage LV-909 is more then enough. Replacing with the LV-30 upsets the balance due to the heavier weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis two stage example using NovaPunch, the launch engine is the equivalent of one and a half LV-909, the first stage fuel tank similar to the FL-T400 in size, not only made orbit but has more then enough fuel left to orbit Mun or Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TD8RZk9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TD8RZk9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PhrTMMd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PhrTMMd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Person012345","CreatedById":33728,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T12:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never had that problem with the 909.

In that test it did reach orbit but fuel was wasted fighting gravity due to slow acceleration. (The 50 % more powerful NovaPunch engine with a 75 unit thrust is not vectored so the SAS is needed on that stage.)
