The thing is, if I turn off the 2 turbojets I have, it doesn\u0027t flip, forcing me to use my rocket engine earlier and as a result I run out of fuel.

Don\u0027t recognize them) is set higher than the rest of the fuselage. The trust from your jet engines is therefore below the center of mass. The problem becomes apparent at 17k meters because by then you have burnt a bit of fuel, the center fuel tanks therefore weight less in relation to the engines, your center of mass moves upwards, while your trust stays in place, causing your plane to flip nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine pushing against the center of a big box, that causes the box to move straight forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow imagine that you are pushing against the lower edge of the box.

First plane looks aero flight stable, but lack of wing surface means that when it gets high, the off centre of gravity thrust causes a rotation. When you hit 17000, you simply lose the wing surface to counter this rotation also combined with the loss of fuel mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second one could be a result of your center of lift being too forward of your center of gravity? Possibly too much upper drag?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T01:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are several factors that could make the plane flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne is aerospike engine behind center of mass (CoM) which naturally makes the craft more unstable due to drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother is having a control surface at the front. If you go higher than 30deg attitude i would expect the plane to flip (from what i can see on the pictures) just due to center of lift (CoL) moving forward. You can go to SPH and rotate whole craft (with [shift]) with CoL and CoM visible to see how does it change with attitude. If CoL goes too far forward, add more control surfaces to the rear or remove the front ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlacing air intakes in front of CoM have destabilizing effect aswell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there is of course more silly mistake of fuel change moving CoM behind CoL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sephta","CreatedById":66104,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T08:00:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe common reason a plane flips at this altitude is the drag induced from the needed pitch: all parts in the front will push back above the CoL, your engines will push forward below the CoL: there you have a nice torque for lifting your nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can counter this by: adjusting your weight at this point (pump fuel forwards), reducing your need of pitch (pre-pitch the wings instead) , adjust the direction of thurst (you have to judge the way of your CoM moving, as you burn your fuel.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way is to make your plane a bit nose heavy and give it enough lift (and pitch) with the wings alone (give them an angle up or down, depending where they are)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-10T15:13:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2013 03:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sephta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
