However, I\u0027m still stuck on one thing: I like to have my landers equipped with some probes to allow for wider research, and my lander design requires the probes are launched vertically from a docking port (as it also needs to be capable of relanding on the docking port and resupplying). I realise this is not the most efficient method, as launching prior to landing would require less fuel and so on, but it\u0027s more for story usage than anything else (i.e. \u0022An unusual seismic event has occurred at x|y co-ordinates, despatch a probe to investigate!\u0022). Any ideas for how to launch them?\n\nI have already tried simple undocking and then launching, however even clicking on \u0022control from here\u0022 on the probe guidance unit results in staying with the lander when the port is undocked, and when control is switched to the probe it then auto-docks (which in other situations is much appreciated.

It will prevent the probes from falling down when detaching, and it will also help with landing."},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T11:53:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My probe is attached in symmetry, so an action group would likely activate both probes, although I\u0027ll bear that in mind for when I only have one!\n\nHmmmm, you could build all bar the docking ports symmetrically, then manually place ports one by one, then place probe sub-assemblies on top of them one by one. That\u0027d allow them to have different action groups. It would get very complicated, though, especially if you end up with all four spots filled.
