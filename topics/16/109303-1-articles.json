I would like to try my hand in strategy creation, but I don\u0027t know where to start. I have looked at the configuration file for SKB, but that still doesn\u0027t tell me how to use the options given and what options are available that I don\u0027t see used there. Does anyone know the entire set of options available for strategy creation, or at least have a straightforward way of explaining how the basic options work? Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T06:59:22Z","Content":"You might want to try the add-on forums for this question."},{"CreatedByName":"KerbinDriveYards","CreatedById":137802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T03:52:27Z","Content":"Ok, will do that right away.
