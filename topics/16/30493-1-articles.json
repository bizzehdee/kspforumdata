Whenever I turn sas on it automatically starts burning all of my rcs trying to hold it\u0027s vector. I have to turn rcs off in order for this not to happen. I am also running mechjeb 2 and I only use it occasionally when I get frustrated but this problem is even worse with the docking autopilot or the smart a.s.s. Is this a ship balance issue or is there a way to make the use of rcs more efficient that I don\u0027t know about?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PaleoGamer","CreatedById":66992,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T17:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure your ship is balanced properly. Once you have your orbital stage set up in the VAB, turn on the center of gravity marker and put your RCS thrusters equidistant in front of and behind it.
