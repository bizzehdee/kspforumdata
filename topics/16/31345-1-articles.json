Anyway, I just now realized that 2 of the 6 winch systems on the CORE part of the station I have forgot to put connectors on...its the core section and there is no way I can replace it. I tried sending up some connectors and placing them on the winch via EVA but it don\u0027t seem to be possible...anyway I can install new parts on an orbiting ship? Whats this hyperedit I hear about?

Are they there to provide points for craft to dock with, or are they simply there for kerbals to hang on to? If they aren\u0027t needed on the central bit of the station, you can always send up a module that contains more winches (with the connector bits on them), and leave the current ones as non-functional units.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IllicitMedic","CreatedById":66677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T19:31:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes KAS. They are attached to the \u0022parking lot\u0022 of the ship. Once a ship docks to the station they are attached to \u0022secure\u0022 the craft in place in the event of an accidental undocking, etc. They also act as fuel lines so yea they are kind of important.
