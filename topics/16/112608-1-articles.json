I can never find it again, it\u0027s like I ended the flight but I did not. What gives?\n\nAlso I noticed while making some probe controlled fuel tanks for delivery, I can no longer turn with RCS. translate up/down/left/right still works, but I can\u0027t rotate. That also happens with the station I built, but if I turn on SAS and RCs no monopropellant gets used at all and no jets fire."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T22:09:50Z","Content":"Are probes off in the map filters?
