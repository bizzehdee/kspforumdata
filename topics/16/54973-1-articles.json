I then tried slowly rotating my ship...nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I using the wrong ports? Can I not connect a multi-port to another multi-port? Does one need a shielded clamp while another uses a different clamp? I thought maybe it\u0027s a male/female thing, but I don\u0027t see any indicators of such in the parts menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like I can successfully accomplish the hard part (touching the ports together while at 0m/s relative velocity), but the blasted things just don\u0027t want to unite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny information would be much appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh I also wanted to ask...what exactly can pass through what sections? My linear layout was the shielded clamp, then multi-connector, then science lab, then hitchhiker bay, then the capsule (and engines all the way down). Do kerbals travel through the science lab and connector, or do I have to EVA them and move them around outside? Would fuel (liquid or RCS) travel through this type of connection, or does a fuel tank have to touch the connector directly? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UH60guy","CreatedById":77959,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T16:09:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFuel (liquid, RCS, etc) can pass through docking ports. In fact, it can automatically do so on launch if you\u0027re not careful to disable crossfeed if launching a ship with a docked connection along the stack. To transfer fuel, option-right click on a Mac (I think it\u0027s ctrl-right click on a PC) on each tank to select the fuel tanks you want to transfer fuel between. You don\u0027t need to worry about connections as transfers work seemingly magically across any point on the ship. Be extra careful not to shift-right click, as that ignites the main engines again and I\u0027ve destroyed a few space stations accidentally that way... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically two docked ships act as a single ship, and fuel transfers act exactly the same way. Electricity is shared between the systems and ship evenly- I think the batteries charge proportionally off any RTGs or solar panels located anywhere. Just the staging and activated engines can get a little weird when they\u0027re combined, so you\u0027ll need to be careful (I make checklists) before doing any maneuvers to know exactly which end is the explodey side and which end is the front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for crew, if you\u0027re not using any mods, you can only transfer them via going EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll let another expert handle the docking port question- it sounds like you\u0027re doing everything right as the only thing I could think of would be ports installed backwards, which isn\u0027t really possible with the shielded ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-02T16:14:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2013 04:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by UH60guy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T17:12:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOther than ports installed backwards (not possible with shielded) and leaving the shields closed (which you didnt do) the only other things that could happen is you approached too fast and knocked something off (unlikely) or you are misaligned during docking (also unlikely) so its probably a bug. best advice I can give is to back up and try again if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are trying to connect the multi port ensure that there is a docking port on each face (IT DOES NOT COME WITH THEM INSTALLED)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T17:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think a screenshot would do wonders, preferably 2 or 3 of them from different angles in very quick succession.
