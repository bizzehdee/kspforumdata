Rather than have it rotate for breaking maneuvers, I\u0027m going to have breaking engines installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question: As the main engines thrust I assume stress is put on the connections, kind of a push stress from the back to the front. If the breaking thrusters are at the back, it would become a pull stress (sorry, not scientific sounding). Will that make a difference? Is there anything special I need to plan for in that situation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Marked answered.

However, look out for your ship pulling apart if the segments docked together are extremely heavy. This may not, in fact, be a good idea though, because if you add enough reaction wheels, you could ditch the ultra-heavy engines and extra fuel and just use those to turn it round...albeit very carefully.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sauron","CreatedById":69931,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T04:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Lazro said. If your ship is strong enough to survive the braking thrusters it\u0027s probably also strong enough to turn around with a few extra reaction wheels--this will be much more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kethevin","CreatedById":64466,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T04:47:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never used reaction wheels, sounds like a good time to learn about them. :-) Would putting the docking struts (those after launch) on it help at all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your time. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dangerous_Beans","CreatedById":78059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T05:40:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kethevin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kethevin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve never used reaction wheels, sounds like a good time to learn about them. :-) Would putting the docking struts (those after launch) on it help at all?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking struts would help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy current interplanetary ship, which has a few problems, is about 4 jumbo tanks long. it can be flipped over quite easily using the RCS thrusters on each section, though it does take a few minutes. small corrections using SAS modules are possible too, though either approach will make it wobble like mad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe main problem is that if i accelerate at over 4m/s the engine section pops off the fuel section \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso my advice would be to ensure that all modules have balanced RCS placement (probably just using linear ports, you aren\u0027t going to be docking with it so you don\u0027t need forward/back control) so you can flip it end over end, rather than taking even more engines. provided you plan ahead and make sure everything is balanced, you can take a fair bit of time to flip over, and it weighs less than another engine pack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
