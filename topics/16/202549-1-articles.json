So I am getting closer to the end game. Been to and from Eeloo and most Jool moons. Still struggling a bit with Moho return.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI developed a high delta v lander with refueling capabilities. It does have several nuclear engines as much as I dislike them lol. The problem I realize, was the thrust to weight makes it really hard to land on Moho. I could make a lander which rendezvous with the mother ship, of course\u00A0then the mother ship can\u2019t refuel. So I need enough delta v to get to Moho, slow down (the tough part), and return.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am\u00A0trying to nail down the Moho transfer. I know it\u2019s probably the toughest transfer because of the inclination and the fast travel around\u00A0\u00A0the Sun. You can get to Moho straight from Kerbin with one burn, but slowing\u00A0down is tight. I know you can literally spend thousands more delta v doing it this way.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow are other people doing it? I am more wasteful with delta v than I would like. Could somebody explain the most efficient burn to Moho? I know it involves a correction burn but I can\u2019t quite figure that out. \u00A0I think it involves the correction burn at ascending node or descending node?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Rylant\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Echo__3","CreatedById":204997,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-20T21:38:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps this video tutorial will help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/XHYRlssCGTU?list=PLAxKqla-n5X6uzL80P-e4drEw6zAEsGVg\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-21T00:01:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the inclination is a problem, it\u0027s not the biggest problem.

It does have several nuclear engines as much as I dislike them lol. The problem I realize, was the thrust to weight makes it really hard to land on Moho. I could make a lander which rendezvous with the mother ship, of course\u00A0then the mother ship can\u2019t refuel. So I need enough delta v to get to Moho, slow down (the tough part), and return.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou have a few ways around that\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) make a nuclear tug with low thrust to bring you in Moho\u0027s orbit. Once in Moho\u0027s orbit, detach the lander. make sure that the lander has large tanks, so it can go up and down with much spare fuel. refuel the lander, bring it back to the tug, and transfer fuel to the tug. then land the lander again, and dig more fuel. repeat until the tug is refueled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) make a slightly bigger tug. Do not bother with refueling it. in fact, if you drop the mining equipment in favor of fuel, you\u0027re probably good already. reach Moho. drop the lander. recover the lander. Now, going to Moho requires at least 3000 m/s, unless you are willing to spend many decades making slow gravity assists. but going away FROM Moho is much cheaper: with 1000 m/s you can get to Eve, use an Eve gravity assist to go everywhere. You can get an intercept to kerbin, where you\u0027ll aerobrake (you\u0027ll need a heat shield). So, refueling at Moho is not all that necessary, you only need a fraction of what you spent going in\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) instead of going to Moho, go to Gilly. Refuel at Gilly. Now go to Moho from Gilly - falling down on Eve first, to get Oberth effect. It\u0027s much cheaper to go to Moho this way, so you won\u0027t need refueling at Moho. In fact, you can drop your mining equipment at Gilly for reduced weight\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
