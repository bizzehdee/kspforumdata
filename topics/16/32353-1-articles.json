For it to theoretically work, they would both need docking ports and one would need to be carrying a rover with a parachute. If the plane with the rover was flying, then dropped the rover and deployed the parachute, and turned on ASAS, it would keep flying. If you then drove the rover to the other plane and docked it, you be in control of the plane. Then you could fly it up and be flying with the other plane. Anyone know if this would actually work? I haven\u0027t gotten to test it in-game yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T21:28:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowscyther","CreatedById":66257,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T21:32:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DarthVader\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DarthVader\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMechjeb....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI meant stock...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-RanZ-","CreatedById":51892,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T21:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seen a video of someone controlling and docking a couple planes in mid-air... looked challenging.

There is no way to do this with stock parts, as I have done with my shuttle experiments, however I have considered the idea with parts mods only, namely, B9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I achieve my goal of a stock parts shuttle launch, orbit and landing, I\u0027ll finally allow myself to use a mod to build a plane big enough to carry my shuttle designs in the future; and I think it can be done quite simply; well, not simply, but it can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I\u0027ve designed my stock shuttles so far, they\u0027re unpowered gliders that fly like a dream. I\u0027ve made some stunning landing tests with unpowered flight, so I\u0027m pretty sure I can do 2 aircrafts. The plan is to ferry the shuttle up to a decent altitude, let it go, stabilize with ASAS or the nose cone flight computer part in my case, then switch aircrafts, make sure the other craft is on level flight, switch aircrafts again, land the shuttle, and switch again and land the plane that piggy-back the shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I think it can be done is simple. Whenever I try to switch aircraft or space vehicles, I get the standard warning \u0022you can not switch while throttled\u0022 message. Since my shuttle is unpowered, thats not an issue. It\u0027s balanced enough to glide for 10\u0027s of kilometers without any intervention my part. Given enough altitude, future testing needed of course, I Can easily switch crafts for a few minutes and let the shuttle glide in the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thought process is there for me and I would definitely like to try it out one day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strongest_2hu","CreatedById":67784,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T02:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs part of my experiments in aerial refueling with KAS I put two airplanes up at the same time, it was actually really simple and the only stipulation is that they have to stay within the 2.25km of each other (you can of course increase that with mods). Basically you launch one plane, drive/fly it off the side of the runway, then switch back to space center to launch another plane. Now you have two planes sitting near each other. Throttle one up, pitch up and engage ASAS (throttle back if exceeding 2.25 km is a factor), then quickly switch to the other plane with \u0022[\u0022 or \u0022]\u0022. I know it doesn\u0027t make sense, but I\u0027ve never had trouble switching between throttled up planes in the atmosphere. From there you quickly throttle up and race to catch up with the other plane. As long as you\u0027re within 2.25 km you can do whatever you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly my aviation pioneers were unable to refuel one plane from another, as the refueling boom proved unstable and impossible to intercept at speeds slow enough to allow docking and preclude explosions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"koshelenkovv","CreatedById":53764,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T10:32:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022strongest_2hu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022strongest_2hu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E you launch one plane, drive/fly it off the side of the runway, then switch back to space center to launch another plane.
