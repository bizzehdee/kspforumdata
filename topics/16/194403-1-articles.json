More torque = more control, use the biggest wheels you can (surface attach some cubic struts and then add large reaction wheels if you can\u2019t put them in the stack e.g. if you\u2019re using a 3.75m rocket) and put them mostly in the first stage as it sounds like you\u2019re having trouble shortly after leaving the pad and they will be overkill at high altitudes or in orbit. Don\u2019t worry too much about power, unless\u00A0you\u2019re using an obscene number of reaction wheels the engine alternators will be more than enough to power them all.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMOAR FINS! And the bigger, the better. Controllable fins like the AV-R8 winglet will provide additional control when lower in the atmosphere, but are heavier than fixed fins. Any aero surfaces add mass so become a hindrance at higher altitudes which is why you should only put fins on the lowest stages.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMOAR GIMBALS! Use engines with a greater gimbal ability to keep your rocket under control. Add vernier engines like Thuds or Cubs if you have to and consider either adding a mod that gives SRBs some gimbal or using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/Ox boosters on your first stage.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMOAR- er, I mean, LESS DRAG! Try to make your fairing as tight fitting as possible to minimise its\u00A0surface area and try to avoid a blunt tip which adds drag- a slightly heavier but pointier fairing might help you.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMOAR STRUTS! With advanced tweakables\u00A0enabled in the settings you can add auto-struts between different parts; unlike the strut part these autostruts have no drag and can help your rocket stay the right shape. Add some autostruts between the base of your rocket and the payload to keep it rigid and prevent it bending which will quickly cause a tumble; add some more struts between your boosters and core stage, with struts from the booster nose cones to the root part which will suppress their tendency to oscillate which can also cause instability. Use regular struts if necessary to hold your payload still inside the fairing as a payload that flops around inside the fairing can easily become unstable and if the payload includes\u00A0your control point that will make the rocket very hard\u00A0to control.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if none of that works, try launching the payloads in smaller pieces and assembling in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joe Kerbal","CreatedById":204871,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-03T12:39:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThankyou jimmy.
