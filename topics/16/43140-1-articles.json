Target the planet when you are on the launchpad and on the maneuver planner click transfer to planet this will set a node up showing you how long you need to warp till you get an intercept angle, launch just before and your be there or there a bouts, i think there may be a way todo it on the ascent but never bothered to work it out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T19:13:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI Replied to your other thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said there Karmacoma is correct that the Phase angles screen is not in the new mechjeb.
