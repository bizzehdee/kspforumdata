The pull-down menu does not work while flying a ship in the map view (it appears, but clicking the different types of ship does nothing) until you either pause and resume, or bring up the navball. Then it works properly, and you can enable and disable the display of different classes of ship right there in the map view, without having to go back to the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I originally discovered the pause technique by accident and used that for a while, then I saw a Scott Manley video where he accidentally discovered the navball trick. He concluded that the navball had to be open for the pull-down menu to work, but actually once it is working it stays working, even if you put the navball back down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
