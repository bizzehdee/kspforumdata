I honestly did. I think part of the problem is that I am not entirely sure what I\u0027m searching for lol. Perhaps I\u0027m incorrectly applying what is in my mind n-body physics, perhaps I\u0027m just thinking too much, perhaps I\u0027m not thinking enough.\n\nIn a nutshell I would like to know if there is a more or less effective side of the body (say the Mun) to approach from for a capture burn. In terms of \u0022sides\u0022 I mean the prograde or retrograde sides, ending in either a prograde or retrograde orbit.\n\nApproaching from retrograde is how you do a gravity assist (right?) so it would impart greater velocity. But since you\u0027re moving \u0022with\u0022 the target (mun), that velocity is moot (right?).\n\nApproaching from prograde is how you do a gravity... er... deceleration so it would reduce your velocity - on that same token, you\u0027re moving opposite of the target\u0027s path and so that deceleration would also be moot (right?)\n\nMy monitoring of dV usage has not yielded conclusive results, which would suggest that there is no more efficient side to approach from.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T21:23:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 09:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ErikTheAngry**"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T21:16:19Z","Content":"You\u0027re right about gravity assists (both to accelerate, coming from \u0022behind\u0022 the body orbital path, or to decelerate, arriving in front of the body). \n\nBut about \u0022optimal capture\u0022, there is no preference in KSP. Unlike space simulation programs that implement multibody gravitation, KSP uses only a two body gravitation model, so once a vessel enters the SoI of a body, there is no further influence on it from other bodies, therefore no advantage making a capture burn in relation to the position of those other bodies.. \n\nYou\u0027re right instead that, should multibody be used, the side where the gravitation total effect is lower (facing the mainbody that is orbited by the body you plan to make the capture with) makes for lower orbital speed and therefore lower Oberth effect than the opposite side."},{"CreatedByName":"ErikTheAngry","CreatedById":148414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T21:26:36Z","Content":"Thank you Diomedea. Simple is good (single body physics).\n\nI remember thinking it would be nice to have lagrange points, and noticing a mod in development for n-body physics. Then I saw the youtube video of orbits being perturbed by the mun and realized that lagrange points are definitely not worth all the station keeping I\u0027d need for remotetech lol."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T00:15:24Z","Content":"There are more capture scenarios to consider...\n\nWhen you capture from an elliptic orbit, retrograde encounters alow for an abort to free return trajectory. Prograde captures offer cheaper landings.\n\nWhen you capture from a hyperbolic trajectory from the parent (Kerbol orbit -\u003E Laythe) destination position and incoming orbit can create significant dV differences. The optimal approach trends to be to enter the parent in a prograde (matching the target) hyperbolic trajectory and encounter the destination on a tangent trajectory. This subtracts almost all of your target\u0027s orbital velocity from yours on SoI change. For Laythe this can be the difference between a 3 km/s aerobrake and up to a 8 km/s aerobrake (otherwise known as a firework)."}]}
