About your questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No way to switch axis based on mode. KSP has absolutely no knowledge of the different modes on a X-52, so the only way is to associate different actions to them with the Saitek programming software. But even with that, there is no way to switch axis (only the behaviour of each axis and button).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KSP is based on Unity (4.3.3 in its latest 0.23.5 version). Unity only recognizes generic joysticks (see the list of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://docs.unity3d.com/351/Documentation/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUnity keycodes here\u003C/a\u003E) and, even if possibly it could handle up to 5 different sticks, it recognizes only buttons 0 to 19 for each of them. Therefore, KSP can\u0027t recognize (and is impossible to assign) any button beyond 19.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T16:41:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei am currently setting \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etwist = yaw \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex-axis = roll. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand one of the hats as the x/y-axis for RCS translation; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe big dial on the throttle as RCS foreward/backward\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut this setting feels a little bit odd when it\u0027s a rocket, twisting to turn doesnt feel right...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany insight how to set the stick?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T17:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have the main axis set the same as you, just feels better flying a plane that way. As you know, KSP has no different settings for rockets; in case, it would certainly feel more natural to set the yaw with x-axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt helps me that a rocket doesn\u0027t need to be controlled at all times, mostly I do during ascent and landing, and often using keys instead of axis is enough. With the roll set on x-axis, I use mostly roll, then pitch during ascent (instead of a quadratic pitch/yaw control); for landing, I try to find perfect yaw alignment first, so to then need control pitch and throttle (if done right, only small yaw adjustments are needed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor RCS, my preference is to use the slider control for forward/backward (centered), the big rotary on the throttle for left/right and the small rotary for up/down. But I use also keys quite often, and must say your RCS x/y set on a 4-way hat is a very good solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
