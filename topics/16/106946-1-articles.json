But the new mission \u0022Ferry a VIP safely to her destination - Haigy\u0027s Travel Itinerary - Suborbital spacelight on Kerbin\u0022 I have no idea what and how to do it. Googled it but no results.\n\nWould be great if you could give me a guideline or point out to a tutorial. Many Thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:17:55Z","Content":"If there is *no other instruction* about the mission then just make a 2 seated rocket, put any kerbonaut and Haigy inside and launch for a suborbital flight (just get your apoapsis over 70km, no need to circularise)\n\nFor tutorials, Scott Manley has a very good tutorial series on YouTube for beginners in 1.0.\n\nFirst episode here:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/d74m3qThOoU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Crusher48","CreatedById":135642,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:19:30Z","Content":"Step 1: Accept the contract.\n\nStep 2: Build a rocket or spaceplane that can get above the atmosphere (aka get above 70k elevation). Look at other guides for rocket building.\n\nStep 3: Have either 2 crew slots, or 1 crew slot and a probe core. Put the tourist in one of the crew slots, put a pilot in the other if needed.\n\nStep 4: Bring the rocket up to above 70k to count as suborbital flight. Orbiting is not needed.\n\nStep 5: Land safely.\n\nStep 6: Profit!"},{"CreatedByName":"silentnight","CreatedById":141482,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:01:12Z","Content":"Thanks!
