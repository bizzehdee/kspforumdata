Shouldn\u0027t it be more efficient to burn at a farther away periapsis such as when I burn farther away from the planet to adjust my orbit? It seems to me that by making my periapsis closer, the increase of velocity due to gravity would require more retrograde burning to cancel out the velocity. Obviously a close periapsis is good for aerobraking, but what about planets without an atmosphere?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-11T02:35:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2013 02:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by jBar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T01:36:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s something called the Oberth Effect, which states a rocket traveling at a higher velocity has more useful energy than a rocket traveling at a lower velocity. For example, it is easier to raise your apoapsis from the periapsis, where you are traveling faster. In your case, it is easier to change your trajectory farther away from your target. Think of it like this: there are two lines that form an angle, those lines form a 10 degree angle. The further away from the vertex, the further apart the lines get. This is similar in orbital mechanics; if you adjust you inclination by x degrees, the further away you get from that point the further off from the original trajectory you will be. But say you wait until you are about to reach the SOI of a planet, but you want to change your inclination. You will have to put in more energy to achieve a similar result because you have to change drastically and quickly, versus gradually and slowly. If you venture out to planets further from Kerbol that Kerbin, you will not be intercepting the planet at your periapsis, and vice versa for planets lower than kerbin. If you plan to aero brake in Duna, Eve, Laythe, or Jool, it is best to push you orbit very close to the atmosphere or just inside of it. This way you will have to use less energy to change your trajectory while traveling at interplanetary speeds. If you want to get captured in a world without an atmosphere, it would be better to be further away because the planet\u0027s gravity would be accelerating you less.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T01:40:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Oberth effect is derived from the kinetic energy of your fuel.

Escape or capture burns are changing your orbital energy, and it\u0027s best to change your orbital energy when most of that energy is kinetic, not potential, meaning low periapsis. Kinetic energy is a function of speed squared, so the slope of orbital energy versus delta-V is larger for higher speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does however depend what you\u0027re planning on doing once you get there. If you aren\u0027t landing on the planet, just hanging out in orbit and you don\u0027t care what orbit, then you might be able to save some fuel by capturing into a circular orbit just barely inside the SoI. But if you plan on landing, dropping that orbit down to the surface will be expensive (or rather the landing itself will be expensive since you\u0027re falling so far), you\u0027re better off capturing into a very low periapsis. If you have a mothership or fuel tank or something that doesn\u0027t need to land, you can capture into a highly elliptical orbit, with very low periapsis and very high apoapsis (just inside the SoI), leave the mothership / fuel tank there and drop the rest of the way with the lander on its own. Your lander will need more fuel if you do this though, to catch back up the the high mothership orbit if you need to rendezvous after landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-11T01:54:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2013 01:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T02:22:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like to think of Oberth as the efficiency of accelerating while fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf kinetic energy is proportional to v^2 (and it is) then the energy by going from speed v to v\u002B1 depends on the value of v. Going from speed 999 to 1000 gives double the energy as going from speed 499 to 500. Try the math. Compare 2^2 - 1^2 and 3^2 - 2^2 and 4^2 - 3^2 and so on. However both take one deltaV worth of fuel so if you\u0027re going to spend fuel you want to be going fast when you do. The best way to go fast is to jump off a tall building which in orbital terms means to fall as close as possible to a massive body, converting the potential energy of gravity into speed. Being high and slow does you no good since the potential energy of being up high doesn\u0027t affect your fuel efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reverse is true. Scrubbing off kinetic energy is best done fast because every quantity of reduction in speed equates to more kinetic energy lost. It may seem like there\u0027s less speed to lose at a higher orbit but even at 0 m/s you still have all that potential energy which is going to turn into KE if you try to land. If come in with 1000m/s excess orbital energy and you don\u0027t care about landing then a high orbit is fine. You still have to blow off some steam though so it\u0027s better to flyby the target close, burn just so you are captured and then let yourself drift to outer orbit before circularizing. If you can burn while fast it\u0027s always better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bunsen","CreatedById":10598,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T02:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to change the inclination of your orbit, lower velocity is always better.

I think it\u0027s easier to see how it works by focusing on the energy of your rocket, though: Kinetic energy goes as the square of speed, so a small change in speed produces a change in energy that\u0027s proportional to your initial speed.
