I\u0027ve accepted the mission to insert a satellite with certain orbital requirements, and I have a few questions on how to achieve the adjustments.\n\nApoapsis - 373,000 (Achieved)\n\nPeriapsis - 342,000 (Achieved)\n\nInclination - 152 (Need Help On)\n\nLongitude of Ascending Node - 288 (Need Help On)\n\nI know how to adjust my inclination, but I don\u0027t know how to figure out what inclination I\u0027m actually at using the navball. How do I get to a certain inclination without having any target to set to?\n\nAlso, I have no idea what Longitude of Ascending Node means, or how to change it. Help on that, please.\n\nThanks for the help in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:21:49Z","Content":"Hello CaptLobster, and welcome to the forums!\n\nAn inclination of 152 is almost a retrograde orbit. That is to say that the orbit will be in approximately the opposite direction of a standard prograde orbit. In map view, the target orbit is shown with small beads of light moving around. These indicate the correct direction.\n\nYou don\u0027t need to worry about the longitude of the ascending node. If you match Ap, Pe, and inclination, that will complete the contract.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:34:17Z","Content":"Inclination is the angle with Kerbin\u0027s equator. To get it set the Mun as target, as it has 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination, then look at ascending/descending nodes in map view. To modify it simply burn normal or anti-normal (purple triangles on the navball) at these nodes (this get more complicated for high angles), this will modify your inclination but not the position of the nodes.\n\nLongitude of ascending node is the position of the ascending node on the orbit. It is hard to find as stock KSP doesn\u0027t show you your coordinates unless you\u0027re landed; but as Starhawk said if you match all the other requirements, it will be at the right place.\n\nNormally you should see the required orbit in map view which makes it easier to get to the orbit. First get an approximately round orbit, then match the inclination (and longitude of ascending node if you manipulates your inclination at the right place), then match apoapsis and periapsis."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptLobster","CreatedById":144201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T19:17:00Z","Content":"Thanks for the help! Although, I have an issue.\n\nI don\u0027t see the required orbit in map view.
