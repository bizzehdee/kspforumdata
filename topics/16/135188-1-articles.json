for the actual docking once you\u0027re right up next to the target. \u00A0Use the main engine (gently) to close the last few hundred meters from where you matched velocity at the end of the rendezvous. \u00A0What you do is point get into target mode on the HUD and point actual retrograde (not target retrograde) to reduce your velocity relative to the target to 0. \u00A0Then point at the target and burn very gently on the main engines until you\u0027re going about 5m/s (relative to the target). \u00A0Rotate again to true retrograde and be ready to kill your velocity again. \u00A0Watch the range to the target and its position and apparent motion relative to your ship. \u00A0As you get closer, it will start to slide sideways across the screen. \u00A0Kill velocity at that point, then point at and burn towards the target gently again. \u00A0You might have to repeat this process several times but eventually you\u0027ll be within spitting distance of the target. \u00A0At this point, kill your velocity relative to the target one last time and begin the actual docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

rest with torque and RCS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually docking consists of 4\u00A0main phases, doing which requires either torque, RCS, or both, as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nGetting on the Correct Side of the Target: \u00A0The docking port is on a certain side of the target so can only be approached from that direction. \u00A0So if you\u0027re not already on that side of the target, you have to get there, either by flying your ship around the target or switching to the target to rotate its docking port at the approaching ship. \u00A0If the target is reasonably small and robust, rotating it should be no problem but this usually isn\u0027t an option for big, floppy space stations, which means you have to fly around to the correct side. \u00A0This is best done with RCS translation, very similar to flying a Kerbal around on EVA, although using the main engine VERY gently also works.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAligning Your Ship with the Docking Port. \u00A0Now that you\u0027re on the correct side of the target, you need to turn your ship so its docking port is facing the target docking port, and that the line drawn from your port into your ship is parallel with the line drawn from the target\u0027s port into the target. \u00A0All you\u0027re going for here is parallel docking axes. \u00A0Use torque to do this.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGetting Colinear Docking Axes: \u00A0Once your docking axes are parallel, use RCS translation to slide your ship sideways until it\u0027s lined up directly with the target docking port.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFinal Approach: \u00A0Now that you\u0027re all lined up, just ease ahead slowly with RCS translation (or maybe just a tiny blip of main engine) until the ports come into contact and attach. \u00A0Try to make contact doing no more than about 0.1-0.2m/s\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 2 most tricky parts of the above are Steps\u00A0#2 and #3. \u00A0I recommend mods to help with these because the stock game is woefully short of essential instrumentation that you need to perform either step with certainty. \u00A0These mods DO NOT fly the ship for you, they just give you helpful information to let you fly it more effectively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recommend NavyFish\u0027s\u00A0excellent Docking Port Alignment Indicator. \u00A0It makes it MUCH easier to see what you\u0027re doing in both steps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHOWEVER, it won\u0027t help much for Step #3 unless your ship has balanced RCS thrust. \u00A0If it doesn\u0027t, then translating will introduce unwanted rotation, which makes trying to do Step #3 screw up what you\u0027ve already done in Step #2. \u00A0This makes docking very frustrating if not impossible. \u00A0Therefore, success in Step #3 really begins in the VAB by building the ship with balanced RCS thrust. \u00A0To do this, I recommend the wonderful RCS Build Aid mod. \u00A0Using this, you can be sure your ship won\u0027t rotate while translating and docking will be MUCH easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T17:10:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

This tells you how many minutes away you are. When you\u0027re a few minutes away, turn to face the antitarget marker. Make sure the NavBall is in target mode. The target retrograde should be near to the antitarget. Now, point your ship slightly to the \u003Cem\u003Eother side \u003C/em\u003Eof the retrograde marker, and gently fire your engines. This should reduce your speed relative to the target and also move retrograde over the antitarget. If you delete the maneuvre node on your map, you should see that the encounter is now a touch further away (in time) and a touch closer (between the two ships).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrop a node there, guesstimate how much time it\u0027ll take you to reduce velocity to zero (judging by what happened in the paragraph above), and wait until you\u0027re about that far from the node.
