To minimize the size of the capture burn, you want your ship\u0027s path to cross the target planet\u0027s orbit at as small an angle as possible. IOW, your ship and the planet are almost on parallel paths when they meet. The greater the angle between your path and the planet\u0027s orbit, the less of your existing velocity counts toward your desired final orbit, and the more you have to work to bend your vector in the desired direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m not claiming this make the whole flight more efficient.
