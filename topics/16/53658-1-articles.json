As \u0022drag\u0022 is actually a drag coefficiency, draining fuel won\u0027t change your terminal velocity, as terminal velocity varies with average drag coefficient. Thus, the only way to slow down a ship is to make parts with a drag coefficiency of more than 0.2, but a parachute with a drag coeff of 200 that weighs 1 ton will slow your ship down more than one weighing in at 0.2 tons, as it will weigh more in the average drag coeff calculation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T15:10:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDrag (in kN) definitely falls with fuel usage, which is pretty silly. You can test by flying steady at a given altitude with infinite fuel, set throttle so that you\u0027re exactly in a circular orbit (effective gravity is zero, so drag = -thrust), then turn off infinite fuel. As fuel drains, you speed up, but thrust doesn\u0027t change -- this proves that drag is falling. Since you\u0027re at steady altitude, drag is falling because your mass is falling (of course, because you sped up, soon you will be climbing, and drag will be falling because of pressure).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rosenkranz","CreatedById":57152,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T21:30:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUmmmmm, maybe I\u0027m wrong here but the aircraft is going faster because your thrust to weight ratio is increasing as your fuel is used. That has nothing to do with your drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, your Cd is calculated in real time so your drag never changes as fuel drains. What does change is your center of mass though which will change your flight characteristics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost all parts have a \u0027drag\u0027 of .2 per ton.
