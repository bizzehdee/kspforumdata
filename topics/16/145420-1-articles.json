It took me scores of tests to finally get a basic aircraft that was stable on takeoff and which I can land on ocean no problem and have landed on land a few times. I accidentally overwrote this ship file in my save directory, but I did have a backup of the directory from a few days ago; in examining the dates, I _think_ this is the old model (the one that works reasonably well). I\u0027ll check in game in a bit and edit this if I\u0027m wrong. ADDIT: yeah this seems to be the \u0022good\u0022 one that works fairly well, though weird that the flaps need to be \u0022inverted\u0022 not \u0022normal\u0022 in order to produce the dramatic lift for a slow takeoff . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/UVGpQcft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESeagull 104\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI managed to fly this baby half way round Kerbin to the pyramid, land it in the desert, and then taxi up till the terrain got too rough only to realize: hatch was blocked (which strangely does NOT seem to be the case in this specific file as I just did a test flight and Jeb managed to jump out just past the runway! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I did a redesign, and figured I\u0027d \u0022improve\u0022 it a bit (more delta-v, etc.).

What is wrong with Seagull 104a that causes it to swerve on the runway terribly (and exhibit bad lift)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. What is wrong with both craft that causes them to pull to port (left)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Can someone point me at a resource to help me understand all the variables and values in those craft files? (I can see that a lot of problems can probably be solved by achieving perfect numbers in the craft file that are tricky to do in the in-game GUI build pane)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Any general suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Any way to set up roll trim and pitch trim tabs on the ailerons and elevators?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy understanding of aerodynamics is pretty rudimentary, but I find KSPs handling of things not that edifying. For example control surfaces, angle of attack, lift COMMENTS/ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA. In order to achieve stable flight I found it necessary to use the wing configuration in both of these versions of Seagull: a much oversized swept wing attached near the belly of the fuselage and with the fuselage tilted anti-normal relative to the wing. This to me is a weird design (though I guess it does reflect that in modern real world craft like the stealth bomber?) and it is also weird that it seems to be the only wing configuration that I can get to be relatively stable in flight and landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB. Along with the above, I found it necessary to use \u0022flaps\u0022 (the control surfaces that have all axes set to inactive and with start deployed \u0022inverted\u0022 at 38% which are proximal to the fuselage in both the designs above). Any slight change to these flaps has dramatic consequences, though with the values right around where they are in Seagull 104, it seems to provide _roughly_ the sort of flight I\u0027d expect: general stability in roll and yaw, slow translations, a tendency to lift even at low speeds, and the ability to descend even with nose pitched up a few degrees (you know, the way you LAND a freacking airplane!?! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E EVERY other design [including the stock designs] wants to go NOSE DOWN once a certain low speed threshold is crossed on approach for landing]).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC.

I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s too many for me to install just to test this for you.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLooking at your pictures, I agree that the nosewheel looks a touch off-line - I guess u accidentally attached it to one of the wings instead of the fuselage. I also note that none of your gears is attached in a true 0 position. Any angle of any kind can have undesirable effects, so I would make sure that your gears all point straight forwards and deploy straight down \u003Cem\u003Ewithout any angle at all\u003C/em\u003E. In my experience, using any of the widgets on gears is basically asking for issues.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nVeering on the runway can be caused by a lot of other things, including bugs. I would recommend swapping the LY-10s for LY-50s (if you can) which seem a lot less susceptible to such issues. Another advantage is you won\u0027t need (tho tbh u probably don\u0027t anyway) to double up on the rear wheels - 3 gears should be enough.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother tip for the gears - attach them under the wings instead of on top. If u need to move them higher, move the whole wing - clipping thru the wing when the gear lowers can cause phantom forces.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRegarding flap deployment direction, I would try removing them and placing the same part (flipped and mirrored) on the opposite wing. However it could be another issue, or maybe something to do with the game\u0027s auto-detection of where the flap is being attached?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can trim your aircraft\u0027s pitch, roll and yaw with alt-wsadqe during flight, tho precision-trimming is tricky and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E overrides it anyway. An alternative would be to use a mod like Pilot Assistant which does a great job of trimming your plane and holding or changing course for you (but if forgotten/misused may crash your plane).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther things to try:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nStrapping the wings with Struts. On larger aircraft with multi-part wings I\u0027ve witnessed strange deflections during phys-warp, which to me suggests that mirroring is not truly symmetrical. Anyway, moar struts helps stop this happening.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGiving the wings a little attack- or anhedral/dihedral-angle might also help null out any imbalance. Generally it\u0027s better to angle the wings than angle the whole plane.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso if u can narrow down the specific parts mods that u\u0027ve used in that craft I\u0027d be willing to try it out for u, but I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m seeing in your pictures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-05T17:32:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor starters, do not clip any part of a landing gear through any other part, even the wings (some of the housing will naturally clip through, that\u0027s ok, but you seem to have the whole housing moved up through the wing).\u00A0 This is problematic in 1.1, it may or may not fix the problem of veering off the runway, but you will not be able to fix it as long as they are clipped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWheels in 1.1 are very specific to their contact area.\u00A0 Don\u0027t put them on backward, don\u0027t angle them, don\u0027t clip them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre the wings angled downward from the fuselage?\u00A0 That creates downforce, it puts air over the top of the wing and kills your lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo answer the question, the trim can not be set in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 KSP\u0027s trim implementation is lacking, it can\u0027t even be assigned to a flight stick.\u00A0 It\u0027s really bad.\u00A0 You can adjust the deployment angle but that affects everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-05T17:44:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2016 05:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-05T19:23:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks guys!

I figure it is the latter but be good to clarify.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I really appreciate your feedback. Now that we\u0027ve identified it, I\u0027m almost positive the forward gear is not quite right so I\u0027ll fix that and see what it does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nADDIT: re the issue of the angle of attack . . . honestly it is not something I feel I have masterful understanding of in real life, so add in that this is a game modeling that dynamic and I honestly am pretty much lost. I know that in general the point is to get air traveling more rapidly under the wing than over, but I was under the impression that a sizeable portion of that dynamic in real life comes from aerofoil cross-section . . . whereas in KSP our options seem to be: angle of the wing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI came up with this design (the relatively massive\u00A0 \u0022wing sled\u0022 with the fuselage sitting on top and fuselage tilted) through trial and error. Like I said, every other design I\u0027ve tried (including the stock ones like Velocitize) exhibit horrific nose dive (stall speed I guess that would correspond to?) when I attempt to land them and a certain low speed threshold is crossed. This one doesn\u0027t suffer that issue: it practically just glides in for a landing and one almost has to point the nose DOWN and kill the thrust to GET it to drop at all!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this would be much less of a issue if the stock designs in the game files were better performers. Based on my limited understanding of aerodynamics, and what I\u0027ve gathered from trying my own designs as well as a couple of the stock designs, and then glancing at the rest of them, every single one of the stock designs is laughably bad. Some of them might look like real aircraft, but none of them function worth a damn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nADDIT: and one last comment for this post: I wonder if my horizontal stabilizers are a bit undersized relative to the wings and that might be accounting for the roll during pitch up maneuvers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was so painful just to get to this design (which is functional, but not yet \u0027perfect\u0027) that I\u0027ve been loath to ask questions or to try too many different things in game. But stretched out over a longer real life time span, I can see how fiddling with this stuff is very engrossing and look forward to trying more variations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-05T19:46:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2016 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Diche Bach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-05T20:46:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222705979\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022145420\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221470424984\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002276097\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Diche Bach\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Diche Bach said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you guys say \u0022no clipping\u0022 on the gear, what do you mean?
