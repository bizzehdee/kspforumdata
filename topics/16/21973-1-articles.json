Closer to the gravity source or further away?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr does it not matter at all because I am not changing my velocity? (theoretically)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example of when I would encounter this problem is when intercepting Jool and performing an aero-capture, I am left with a highly elliptical orbit around Jool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd more often that not, it is at an undesirable inclination for intercepting Jool\u0027s satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question is, without circularizing my orbit at the desired Moon\u0027s alltitude, where is the best place perform my inclination correction burn, at the peri or apoapsis?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, I have landed on all the planets and their satellites, I\u0027m just looking to see if there is a slightly more efficient way intercept orbits of other satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-11T21:51:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is more economical to change inclination when you are higher up. It is even sometimes worth spending fuel to raise your apoapsis, change your inclination, and lower your apoapsis again. This also means that the best place to do your burn is the moment when you enter the planet\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you also want to do the burn at the point where you want your new inclination to be. For example, if you want an equatorial orbit, you need to do you plane change at the point where your current orbit crosses the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tuguley","CreatedById":43744,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-11T23:30:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh alright thanks.

Try to get the future orbit as flat as possible from way out there, since it takes extremely small amounts of fuel (RCS is sufficient, in some cases). Since even small errors will have a huge effect on the future orbit, if you can get it mostly flat, you should be pretty darn close to equatorial after you capture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T01:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf adjusting your inclination to match another object\u0027s orbital inclination, you want to do it at a crossing-node, where your orbits meet when viewed edge-on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to adjusting it after aerocapture, you can set your inclination before aerobraking by aligning your trajectory along the desired inclination.
