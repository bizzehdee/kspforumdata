Now, I have boosted into circular orbits before; mostly by luck, it should be said. But the process of circularising my orbit has been really long and painful, and I\u0027m obviously doing something wrong here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s put it out there. Simply put, assuming you have a spacecraft with ample propellant, what is a quick and simple way from going from an initial, highly eccentric orbit to a circular orbit of a specific altitude (in this case 150km)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the theory of a Hoffman transfer, I can even draw one on a whiteboard; so I\u0027m not looking for theory.
