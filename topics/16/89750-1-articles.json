Since 0.25 you can press Z to go to full throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an example of \u0027annoying\u0027 - At launch, I have to mess around enabling SAS, disabling cross-feed on docking-ports, synching gear with the screen-indicator, checking action-groups work, etc. If I accidentally press \u0027space\u0027 nothing happens at zero throttle. At 100% (if Squad REALLY need to cater for the terminally stupid) the ship would launch or explode. At 50%? Who can tell, anything could happen. So putting throttle to zero BEFORE checking everything is now something else I have to do every time I go to the pad THEN put it to 100% for launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T03:57:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe whole launch setup isn\u0027t that good.

And in addition RCS ports have a toggle but they don\u0027t have a definite off or on so that you can\u0027t set action groups properly, and just to be more annoying, the toggle doesn\u0027t work until after you start the engines.
