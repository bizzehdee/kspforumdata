The other issue is that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E is more realistic than stock aero, in that lift increases with the square of airspeed, so you have to add a huge amount of lift to reduce the landing speed by not very much. \u00A0 I wonder if you combined \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E with infernal robotics and procedural wings to make a swing wing design you could have your cake and eat it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for your F-106, \u00A0 \u00A0is the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E quite close to the elevons by any chance? \u00A0I suspect they may be having to push \u0022down\u0022 rather hard to get the nose up on landing, which may add to the high speeds. \u00A0How about adding control surfaces to the leading edges of the wing, and using the leading edge devices ahead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E to control pitch, with the elevons only controlling roll. \u00A0That way you are lifting up not pushing \u0022down\u0022. \u00A0Alternatively, lock the elevons\u0027 pitch function and use some monstrous \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system (multiple Vernor thrusters?) to control pitch on landing approach....\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-15T07:11:30Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2017 07:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by AeroGav\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-16T20:40:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh incidentally, 100 m/s is the speed the space shuttle landed at . \u00A0 \u00A0120 m/s is just insane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real \u00A0F-106 BTW\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornfield_Bomber\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornfield_Bomber\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n173 mph landing speed, which is still damn terrifying and fast even for a supersonic fighter. \u00A0But that\u0027s only 77 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEurofighter Typhoon 140knots, \u00A072 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSAAB Viggen \u00A0(A delta canard with \u003Cstrong\u003Emuch \u003C/strong\u003Esmaller wings than the craft i made) has an approach speed of 119knots, 61 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-17T03:20:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222985706\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157721\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221489537404\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175881\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KnightRider\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 15 March 2017 at 11:23 AM, KnightRider said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, how can I make my high-speed aircraft perform better at low speeds and altitudes? \u00A0I understand that it\u0027s difficult to do that, since getting an aircraft to perform well over a wide range of speeds and altitudes is very difficult, but I\u0027m currently having issues with my latest X-plane stalling at speeds below 120 m/s, which makes landing a pain. \u00A0I typically end up trying to come in as slowly as possible (in the vertical direction) at 120 m/s and then flaring/cutting power, but this just leads to me bouncing down the runway several times, flipping over, and destroying the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs with the real ones: slats, flaps and spoilers.
