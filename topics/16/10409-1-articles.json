If you go watch Apollo 13 closely you notice the crew will yell \u0027gimbal lock!\u0027 from time to time. This happens when two of the three pivot axes line up causing the gimbal to lose the ability to track one degree of freedom.\n\nAlthough to be totally correct, a gimbal is a device that drives the nav ball, that ball\\\u0027s correct name is \u0027Flight Director/Atitude Indicator\u0027. The Apollo crews call it the 8-Ball."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T15:22:48Z","Content":"The Gimbals were and are the parts that allowed a gyroscope remain stationary as the craft around it rotates, more info [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal)"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T01:15:38Z","Content":"I\\\u0027m not sure why everyone thinks the pro and retro indicators are green...

If they look the same to you, there\\\u0027s something wrong with your monitor. Try adjusting the colour temperature, or get a program that will do it automatically so your eyes don\\\u0027t get burned out from a 9500K monitor at midnight. I am, of course, speaking of f.lux ([Google it](http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=f.lux)).\n\nThe prograde should be yellow, and the retrograde green. The colour difference is easily seen on my monitor, so if it doesn\\\u0027t show for you, there\\\u0027s something strange going on. Check you don\\\u0027t have any strange video card settings (unnecessarily high brightness/gamma settings, etc)"},{"CreatedByName":"Candre","CreatedById":15181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T07:02:07Z","Content":"Sure, I\\\u0027ll try that. I think the problem may come up again with other users, though. Maybe the pro/retro pair would be easier to differentiate if they were the same shape as the KSC/anti-KSC indicators?\n\nSorry for being off topic again. Maybe I\\\u0027ll put in a suggestion in the dev forum later."},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T10:58:15Z","Content":"Yep, then we would get even more confused, as they\\\u0027d look too similar to the KSC indicator pair.\n\nNo, I think just altering the colors so they look slightly more differentiable would be acceptable.
