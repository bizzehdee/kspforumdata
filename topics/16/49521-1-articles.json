So what do I have to do to end a mission properly ( so I can receive the SP afterwards) and what does \u0022recover a probe\u0022 mean?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BostLabs","CreatedById":57527,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T21:01:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehit escape key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eselect spaceport\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efrom spaceport click on tracking station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efrom tracking screen select your mission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eclick recover button (lower left green icon/button)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eselect recover from the pop up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epoints show up in after recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efrom there you can go back to spaceport and go to the research station and spend points on tech.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sundancer","CreatedById":83716,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T21:16:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also a \u0022recover\u0022 button hidden behind the altimeter. Simply take your mouse up to the top of the screen (above the altimeter) when you\u0027re watching your craft and, provided it\u0027s landed, there should be a \u0022recover\u0022 drop down menu. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis only works for the vessel you\u0027re currently controlling though.
