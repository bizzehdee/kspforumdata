If not, are you willing to cheat a little? You can go into the debug menu and turn on \u0022infinite EC\u0022 for a few seconds until the transmission completes. Then promise yourself to put on enough batteries next time. The total EC you need for a scan seems to depend on the number of biomes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
