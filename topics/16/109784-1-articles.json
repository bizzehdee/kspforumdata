My Minimus fuel base really needs a forklift truck and it will need to move about and rotate as separate things. The I,K,J,L keys don\u0027t work either. I think they would be the best option but....\n\nI was able to get 60 mps out of my old Mun rover and need to be able to keep the gyros on to do that sort of racing about."},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T10:21:42Z","Content":"Just reassign the rover keys to arrows.
