And the COL is rather close to the COM. It also has no yaw control, so you should expect it to enter a flat spin at the slightest provocation. Add a tail."},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T18:46:00Z","Content":"Everything everybody else said ... \u002B you have this very heavy nuclear engine mounted so far back. This will pull your center of mass towards the rear of your plane, making it hard to get the center of lift even further behind ... especially when some fuel is drained."}]}
