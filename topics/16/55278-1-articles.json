Where they can be useful, is to, for example, add 4 radially to a decoupler, effectively making it wider. You can then use struts from above and below onto that, possibly allowing struts where they would not normally be possible, and creating some nice triangular bracing. A rule of thumb, however, is that you need to strut twice, once going up, once going down, as the girders will pivot on their attachment. when pushed up/down by the struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, they can provide a useful strut attachment point, which then needs to be braced itself, but don\u0027t provide any structural integrity on their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: In the case of the example shown, 2 stacked Jumbo 64s, I would rarely strut that joint directly, but it\u0027s personal preference how you achieve structural integrity. I typically strut from the boosters attached to the lower Jumbo, up to the in-line stack decoupler above it. As long as there\u0027s at least 3 or 4 boosters spread evenly around the Jumbo, that tends to be sufficient. The boosters need struts anyway, or they will pivot on their attachment or decoupler, so I more or less kill 2 birds with 1 stone. It does leave a little flex on the Jumbos after the boosters decouple, but that should be reasonably high in the atmosphere, with less aerodynamic load, less gravity load, etc. I then only strut the Jumbos directly if it actually proves to be necessary after testing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-05T08:32:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2013 08:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Murph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thiosk","CreatedById":81242,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T08:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the clarification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ships are getting bonkers in scale, so coming up with viable part-reducing approaches that ensure stability are important.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T08:35:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thiosk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thiosk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you for the clarification.\u003Cp\u003EMy ships are getting bonkers in scale, so coming up with viable part-reducing approaches that ensure stability are important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re welcome.

For example, the EAS-4 (which is a StrutConnector part) and the small gear bay (which has a ModuleLandingGear module) do it in their respective OnStart functions, which are invoked when the spacecraft launches. The small gear bay throws off the CoM marker, a perennial problem for plane builders: in the SPH, the gear is accounted at 0.5t, which is a lot -- but in flight they\u0027re massless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve definitely used strut cubes to make attachment points to which I sent some struts, for tall floppy rockets.
