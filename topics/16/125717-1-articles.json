I did have a vertical launch SSTO in 0.90 that used ramjet and rapier engines for a completely reusable craft. The aero changes made this one obsolete. Change happens.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith that as background. I have built my first new plane using two ramjets and an aerospike. The COL is behind COM. Mechjeb says it has an SLT of over 2 in the SPH. First issue is kind of minor - on takeoff the craft, at first, flies like a dolphin swims by bobbing up and down. I checked the tail and it seems level. The tail is attached to the rudder - higher than COT, so I am guessing that is causing the behavior. Once I begin to climb it quickly smooths out. It is so smooth that climbing at around 45 degrees is hands off. It slowly levels at around 20k. Still I would like to understand what is happening at takeoff.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNext issue, at 20k I cannot build speed. About 800m/s is pretty much it. Using a slight dive I can get over 1000m/s but then I don\u0026#39;t seem to have enough lift to start climbing again. I have to fire the aerospike to climb, but that means spending precious oxidizer too soon.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have made an 80k Ap but ran out of O2 before being able to sufficiently raise Pe. This brings up my last issue - why are there no oxidizer only tanks? I have plenty of liquid fuel left. I guess I can try adding a short rocket fuel tank and removing the fuel. Seems like a poor fix.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSorry I don\u0026#39;t have a pic to post. I\u0026#39;m not on my KSP computer at the moment.

Since you\u0026#39;re using an aerospike, the vacuum Isp is 340 and Tsiolkovsky says:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\ndV = ln(M/Mo)*Isp*g = 1800\u003Cbr\u003E\nln(M/Mo)*340*9.8 = 1800\u003Cbr\u003E\nln(M/Mo) = 1800 / (340*9.8) = 0.540216\u003Cbr\u003E\n1-(M/Mo) = 1 - e^-0.54216 = 0.41738 = 41.7% \u0026lt;-- your propellant mass fraction (i.e. how much of your plane\u0026#39;s mass at takeoff that has to be devoted solely to LF/LOX for the aerospike)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo assuming you\u0026#39;re going with the old recommended value of 15 tonnes per turbojet, your plane has a maximum mass at takeoff of 30 tonnes - 12.51 tonnes of the plane has to be rocket fuel. Note that that\u0026#39;s the mass of the FUEL, not the mass of the FUEL TANKS (subtle but important difference there).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour turbojets need no more fuel than they used to - 150 units of LF per turbojet is plenty for the run-up, and since the Mk1 Fuselage holds 400 units these days, a single tank is good for two engines (and you have a little surplus). You don\u0026#39;t need to airhog anymore though - one intake per engine is plenty.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese days you also need to begin flattening out and starting your run-up to speed a lot sooner than 20k. Most spaceplane jockety these days begin their runs in the 10-12k regime; flatten out and accelerate, keeping yourself 5-10 degrees above the horizon (generally rate of climb will be less than 100 m/s if you watch that gauge). If you start seeing heating bars, steepen the climb. You probably will see flames; that\u0026#39;s natural these days.

I am still having a big issue where between 15 and 20k I lose upward pitch. I use imbedded Mechjeb and it kind of acted like it was trying to takeover. So I disabled it.

Last I heard the guideline was one Turbojet and one rocket (in the neighborhood of 200 kN) per fifteen tonnes of mass at takeoff, or one RAPIER engine per thirteen tonnes at takeoff. Again, you\u0026#39;ll want a little over two-fifths the total takeoff mass of your plane as rocket fuel if you stick with the Aerospikes (which are, in my experience anyway, good engines to couple with Turbojets).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T19:17:52Z","Content":"\nTurbojets are not that good at providing thrust at the highest speeds and altitudes, but the RAPIERs excel at it. Before trying anything else, I would simply switch out the jets for RAPIERs, drop the aerospike and see how that goes. On days when my piloting skills are in the zone, I can make it to somewhere between 1400 and 1500 m/s on the air breathers (this is really cutting it thin in terms of heating, though), only needing between 200 and 250 units of Ox to complete the ascent. I use a Nerv to circularize, however, so you might need a bit more than that. Nevertheless, bottom line is that if you\u0026#39;re breaking the sound barrier without issue you have enough engines, it\u0026#39;s just you might be using the wrong ones.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T19:19:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 07:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A_name\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T19:51:34Z","Content":"\nAdditionally, I also second the comment that you\u0026#39;re doing your speed run too high up. I\u0026#39;m not sure what your flight profile looks like as a whole, but you want to start pitching down gradually to gain speed as soon as you hit 8km, i.e. where the lightest blue bar on the atmosphere gauge ends. By 10km you should be well over supersonic, maybe around 400 - 500 m/s. I don\u0026#39;t use Turbojets much for SSTO\u0026#39;s due to the aforementioned poor performance at high speeds and altitudes, but for RAPIERs the sweet spot for max thrust seems to be between 12 and 15 km. You should be hitting 1000 m/s at around 15k. Also, you probably have noticed before that due to the curvature of Kerbin, when holding a certain heading at very high speeds the plane will \u0022pitch up\u0022 relative to Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s horizon as the planet pulls away from under you (although the craft itself doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really rotate at all). Use this effect to your advantage to get some vertical speed out of your plane before the air breathers flame out. How I usually do it is I stop giving the plane control inputs at around 15km altitude or so. So for example, if I was pointing 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 up at that point, by the time the air breathers flame out I\u0026#39;ll be pointing roughly at 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. This gain in vertical speed is at the expense of a bit of horizontal speed, but I prefer this way than having to actively pitch up, which causes drag and stress on my plane. This approach also allows you to rely more on wings than rocket thrust to counteract gravity, which might just be more efficient on the long run.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T20:10:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A_name\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T20:37:27Z","Content":"\nWell, giving up for the day.

If you use AIRBRAKEs, make sure you set them specifically for braking purposes only - i.e. don\u0026#39;t use them as pitching or rolling surfaces - they\u0026#39;ll just slow you down if you forget to set them up properly (particularly annoying during the speed-up part of the flight). Set them as soon as you\u0026#39;re below 70k.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T18:30:49Z","Content":"\nI had airbrakes on an early attempt but didn\u0026#39;t know I could set them for brake only. Shouldn\u0026#39;t that be the default? (Just saying) I will give them another try now that I have a working craft. I have RCS tanks and did use them on reentry. When the nose RCS thruster exploded, the ship was surrounded in flame. I quickly looked to see if Jeb was still there in the lower right. So yeah, airbrakes. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAre my round RCS tanks really worse (drag vs weight) than adding another fuselage section for mono?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T21:23:03Z","Content":"\nThey do add some unnecessary drag by the tail. If you want to keep them, I might suggest stowing them inside a cargo bay - you\u0026#39;ll save some mass going that route, rather than including a dedicated monoprop fuselage section. Incidentally, the cargo bay would also be a good place to put a probe core for the craft if you ever want it to do unmanned operations (like rescues) if for some reason you didn\u0026#39;t have access to Drone Cores (say in a mid-career save), and the walls of the cargo bay make excellent mounting points for prograde- and retrograde-firing RCS linear ports; you no doubt know already that places to put those can be tricky to find when it comes to spaceplanes. The cargo bay is just a suggestion in any event.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI myself haven\u0026#39;t found much utility in AIRBRAKES other than as, well, brakes...and IMHO agree that the \u0022just brake\u0022 setting should be the default. That is what it is, though.\n"}]}
