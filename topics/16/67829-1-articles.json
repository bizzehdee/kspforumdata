I was only playing briefly, but I launched a standard ship into circular orbit in preparation for an incoming asteroid and to do some tests. I had plenty of fuel left, so decided to decouple the high altitude stage and then turn around and grab it with the claw. I deployed it so the little grabby hand came out and then proceeded to try and grab the fuel tanks. It was essentially one of the new 2x enginge NASA booster and a big orange tank. I tried at multiple points on it. The discarded tanks were classed as debris, so I thought it could be an interesting tool to deorbit anything that I leave in space after a launch and tidy up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt \u003Cem\u003Eappeared\u003C/em\u003E that the claw didn\u0027t grab onto it or act anything like a docking port.

It requires accuracy - if you dip the claw too deep into the part, it will not stick.

I was perhaps being a bit rough with it, but I\u0027m sure I should\u0027ve got some activity from it.

I could either deorbit them, or use them again later perhaps. I usually deorbit jetissoned lower stages with probes or Mechjeb (radially attached as a probe controller), however there are times this is undesirable, difficult or impossible. At later times I may wish to tidy up the space at 100km or so above Kerbin so a tug to do some cleaning would be great. As you\u0027ve said as well you could put them in a cluster together, and being as (I\u0027ve read, but not yet been able to test) we can transfer fuel through the claw that would be a in space refuelling site perhaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes I can confirm that.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers again.
