The Dipole (little black box with two wires coming out) is good to 500km. The communotron 16 is good to 2.5Mm, both are Omnidirectional antenna meaning that they will connect with everything within range. Dishes have to be pointed. Generally I use the DTS-M1 to talk to other satellites in the same orbit and the other dish to cover everything else. I would put 2 of the large dishes on, one pointing at Kerbin and the other at the Mun. The DTS-M1 one should point at the next satellite in the series, and one should point at the previous satellite. (i.e if you have 3 satellites in a triangle you should have one DTS-M1 pointed at each other satellite) You really don\u0027t need the Communotron-16 at all if you do it right. With my launch profile I circularized at 80km (Still within the range of the Dipole) and then turned one of the dishes to Kerbin and activated it. Once I got out of range of the Dipole ( \u0026gt;500km) it automatically switched over to using the dish, at that point I didn\u0027t need anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh poop, I need to remove a couple of things...Namely the Parachutes from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57988-WIP-0-23-x-RealChute-Parachute-Systems-tweaks-and-bugfixes-v0-3-3-2-9-01-14/page15?highlight=RealChute\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERealchute\u003C/a\u003E and the Radiators from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-23-KSP-Interstellar-%28Thermal-Helper-Solar-Sail-Impactors-Fusion%29-Version-0-10-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Interstellar\u003C/a\u003E Totally forgot about those!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed!

I remembered the payload fraction challenge and decided I was going to need a minimum 400 ton launcher, but probably more like 600 to 800 tons. I put a strong square base together with girders and struts, and attached twelve 2.5m tank stacks with 4200/5400 fuel each and a mainsail engine. That was 60 tons per stack, or more than 720 tons considering extra bits to attach them together plus fins and reaction wheels. Even though it was a single stage unit, it got my rocket into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother consideration I took into account was the number of tons that the payload and rocket weigh. Sometimes I add this up by counting each part from heaviest down (and estimate once I get to the little stuff), or I use Kerbal Engineer to tell me. You have to be careful with Kerbal Engineer though because it wont tell you the total weight including the bottom stage if you have it set to show stages and the bottom stage has no rockets yet. You want at least 20kN thrust per ton. An 800 ton rocket needs therefore 16,000\u002BkN. Twelve Mainsails gives 18,000kN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most important part after that was lots and lots of struts, carefully placed because I didn\u0027t want to overwhelm my computer. Then I put a bunch of canards on the bottom and a few in the middle and near the top. I forgot the RCS thrusters and that was problematic once I got into the upper atmosphere--I had to link each tank across the stacks and down to the engines with fuel pipes because the structural connections between tanks kept breaking and causing them to stop emptying. I got a setup that allowed every engine to draw fuel from anywhere in the stack, but it didn\u0027t empty evenly. The powerful Canards kept it straight through the atmosphere but once my lift was gone, almost 100 units of torque were not enough to make that giant thing turn in any reasonable amount of time and the engine thrust was off balance to the mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T22:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, here goes with the promised design, although it\u0027s a bit redundant now. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MkLWPRC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MkLWPRC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T30s on the first stage, LV-T45s on the second, LV909 on the third. Small SRBs to get it off the pad. Otherwise just uses FLT800 tanks, FLT400 tanks and a wee bit of strutting to hold the stages together. Flies OK, although you need to be a bit careful with the gravity turn. As soon as you lose the SRBs you\u0027ll start to decelerate but it\u0027ll pick up again at around 70 m/s. First stage should get you to about 10km up, second stage will probably get you to orbit with care, or not far off it. I still needed about 250m/s delta-V out of the third stage to hit orbit but my ascent profile probably wasn\u0027t optimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zmXrX1W.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zmXrX1W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird stage in above kerbostationary orbit, using cupola module and Mk 1 lander can as approximate mass dummy payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zf4lbJ1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Zf4lbJ1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApoapsis value didn\u0027t get captured but you can hopefully tell from the velocity that we\u0027re comfortably past stationary orbit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E With fuel left to spare for plane changes and fiddling with orbital parameters.
