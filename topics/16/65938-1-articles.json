It\u0027s the middle rocket in a cluster of nuclear rockets. The rocket still works, but it doesn\u0027t fire when I press space to stage. I can still activate it manually/using action groups. In addition to this, I just realized that I can\u0027t actually stage at all after I fire the rockets. The space-bar does nothing. I can still manually activate stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cqmUGmR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cqmUGmR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it has something to do with the clipping I used to make it possible. I used the method where you flip the girders upside-down into the rocket, than attach the rockets to the bottom of the girders. Anyone got any ideas for fixes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just realized this probably should have gone into support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VDNKh","CreatedById":105749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T02:54:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour launch clamps aren\u0027t in the correct stage.

I\u0027ve got a feeling the center rocket is getting damaged by something. You can also right click on the engine and see if there is still the option to manually activate it. If you can manually activate the engine then there is something else going on, but if you can\u0027t then the structure of your rocket is somehow breaking the connection to the center engine. It stays visible in your staging (unless the part moves out of physics range) but won\u0027t respond since it isn\u0027t connected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shiny","CreatedById":13706,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T03:12:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, I can activate everything manually.
