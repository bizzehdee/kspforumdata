Now although it would be possible, it would be annoying and time consuming to try and balance 2 different fuel types (liquid and oxy) in 4 different tanks, so I\u0027m wondering if there would be balancing issues if I simply emptied one tank at a time into the engines\u0027 tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI considered adding the fuel lines myself, but iirc if u have 4 tanks emptying into a single main tank the game will just empty them one at a time anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-26T19:55:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2013 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by FrontierProject\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maackey","CreatedById":39248,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T19:34:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, CoM does matter in vacuum.
