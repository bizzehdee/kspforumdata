To actually earn the science you need to get them to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. This can either be done by transmitting them via radio - which will give only part of the maximum possible results - or you need to recover the results on Kerbin. The latter can be done by recovering the \u003Cspan\u003EScience Junior itself on Kerbin, or by transferring the results from the\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Ethe \u003Cspan\u003EScience Junior to another part that is then in turn recovered.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis transfer can either be done by using an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experiment_Storage_Unit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EExperiment Storage Unit\u003C/a\u003E and collecting all science results on the vessel into that storage, or by using a Kerbal on EVA that is close to the \u003Cspan\u003EScience Junior, right-clicking on the \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EScience Junior, and grabbing the results (the data) from there.
