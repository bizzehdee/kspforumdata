When driving fast I constantly switch SAS on and off. If your travelling on level ground and then move to an incline then double tap SAS to adjust it to your new position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) RCS stabilisers. At speed the slightest change in terrain elevation will send you into the air. I use linear RCS ports aimed directly up around the center-of-mass of the rover. These act to push the rover down onto the ground (kinda like spoilers on a sports car!) I don\u0027t have them on constantly, but I keep tapping them and vary use depending on terrain. When your in docking mode ctrl (i think its ctrl, maybe shift, at work atm and cant check) will fire your upward facing ports. They also help the wheels\u0027 brakes by increasing your contact with the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Set your wheels up. I tend to disable the brakes on the front wheels and disable steering on the rear wheels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) RCS brakes!
