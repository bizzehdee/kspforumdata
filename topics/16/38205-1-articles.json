Say you\u0027re hurtling toward\u0027s Duna at 10,000 mps, for example, you need to burn most of that to achieve a stable orbit. Normally these kind of maneuvers take up a significant amount of my mission fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I\u0027ve got this ship, consisting of a large lander coupled with a LDFB (long distance fuel buddy, carries fuel, you know), currently on its way back from Mun. What I want is to get it into a stable 70,000 km orbit around Kerbin, so that I can reuse it again (assembling these things is a pain). I\u0027m pretty sure I can do it, but what I want to know is what\u0027s the most efficient way of doing it? I know, for example, that with our good friend the Oberth effect, adding 10mps to your orbit at a low periapsis can make a much greater difference than otherwise (since your additional velocity is introduced at a time when velocity is most poten), meanwhile, it\u0027s obviously much easier to kill your orbit whilst orbiting at 10mps at a very high altitude, rather than at 2,000 mps at a low one. So I know how to make use of the Oberth effect whilst escaping from a planet, but what about returning and stabilizing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, right now I can see two options;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I do one relatively small burn at Mun\u0027s altitude to lower my Kerbin periapsis to 70,000m, then do another, necessarily much more powerful burn at the periapsis in order to lower my apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I make several burns at varying periapses and apoapses, lowering my orbit each time, such that the route makes a sort of spiral shape. This way, I avoid making one huge burn whilst travelling at stupid-meters-per-second at 70,000m. But as far as I can see, the twi approaches seem to require the same amount of detla-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do I do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khrissetti","CreatedById":29557,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T19:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAero-brake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is to say, dip your ship\u0027s pe just into the atmosphere (try 60km) and you\u0027ll see your ap come down as the atmosphere drags on it.
