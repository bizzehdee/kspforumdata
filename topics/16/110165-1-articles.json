I\u0027m not particularly good at building spaceplanes, but I\u0027ve built my first Mark 3 one that can get a significant payload into orbit. \n\nMy issue is reentry, I can\u0027t seem to find a way to prevent parts from overheating and exploding (even ram intakes, and Mark 3 parts). I\u0027ve tried reentering at many different angles, but can\u0027t seem to prevent it. How do you guys get large spaceplanes to survive reentry in 1.02? Any general tips or guidelines?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T02:09:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 02:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jonboy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T22:47:20Z","Content":"How steeply are you entering? If you honestly cannot get through without overheating, then try multiple passes. Gradually slow your velocity in the very thin atmosphere, until your orbit naturally drops low enough.

Have you tried flaring the nose at much as possible during the initial descent to bleed off speed and stay higher up? That alone was enough for me to not burn up (at least from Kerbin orbits)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jonboy","CreatedById":134111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T23:13:22Z","Content":"Even flaring the nose 5 or 10 degrees up caused me to flop...

Nose very high, like 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 up, puts you into the territory of maximum drag, as well as reducing your rate of descent. The drag scrubs off speed, the reduced rate of descent pushes the great balls of fire into the future.\n\nI\u0027ve yet to do much with mark 3 stuff, but mark 1 and 2, I can drop Pe to 0 from 75\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC100km circular orbit, with any major issues from heating. I tend to sit the plane flat across the airflow above 50,000m, i.e. nose 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 up, (there\u0027s very little air up there, but there\u0027s enough that it does scrub off some extra speed by being at the most draggy attitude). Below 50,000m, it varies, but pulling up hard works well to scrub off more speed if things are looking too fast.\n\nUntil your speed is down to below 1000 m/s, and altitude below 25,000m, you\u0027re not trying to fly, you\u0027re trying to brake. Think drag, not good aerodynamic flight."},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T00:27:12Z","Content":"You could use drogue chutes in the upper atmosphere and cut them so you can land"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T00:41:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You could use drogue chutes in the upper atmosphere and cut them so you can land\n\nPretty sure they will still burn off.\n\nTry airbrakes.

The suggestion was to use drogue chutes, if they could be deployed before the heating even starts in earnest, i.e. put out \u0022semi-deployed\u0022 at the highest possible altitude, getting some braking out of them, and then burning off when the heating starts. Yes, of course they will burn off instantly if you deploy them during great balls of fire.\n\nI\u0027m not at all surprised at main chutes burning off at 1000 m/s, as that would usually be much lower altitude, close to or just after the peak of the heating."}]}
