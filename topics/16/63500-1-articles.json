The drill is working and the storage tank is filling up with kethane, but when I turn on the kethane converter nothing happens. It gives me the option to deactivate the fuel and oxidiser conversion implying that they are in fact active but nothing is taken out of the kethane storage tank and no fuel or oxidiser is created. There is no shortage of electrical charge. I do have batteries on top of the converter and I also have four hard points on the side but I was careful to avoid the four drawer shaped protrusions. It says the cooling is 100% efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-18T16:49:13Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2014 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by THobson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T18:10:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFuel line has to feed backwards: from tank to converter\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T18:15:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo here for more info: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35664-Kethane-Usage-and-Proper-Fuel-Routing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35664-Kethane-Usage-and-Proper-Fuel-Routing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, you need a direct line for fuel flow \u003Cstrong\u003Efrom\u003C/strong\u003E the fuel tank \u003Cstrong\u003Eto\u003C/strong\u003E the converter.

The safest way is to attach a fuel tank directly to the converter, then transfer fuel manually if you have to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if by pipe, you mean KAS pipe, then you should know that fuel doesn\u0027t flow through them, at least not in the way you might expect.

KAS pipes sort of work like docking, but apparently not entirely. This screws up fuel flow and causes this issue, there is a really \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64362-Fuel-Flow-Rules-%280-23%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ein-depth tutorial\u003C/a\u003E on fuel flow that explains exactly how it works. The easiest way to set it up is to attach a little fuel tank to the converter then use TAC fuel balancer to shift around, this is much better than manually filling up a bunch of tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T23:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are running Kethane, I also suggest TAC Fuel Balancer.
