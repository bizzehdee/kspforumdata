If you\u0027ve never done one before, you\u0027ll be a bit anxious from the unfamiliar long time spent going fast, flat, and fairly low. But just roll with it, burn as you think necessary to kill horizontal speed, and let your parachutes do what they can. Once the chutes fully open, it\u0027s just like anywhere else. Either you\u0027ve got enough chutes that you can let it float, or you just have to give it a little help with thrust, like with landing on a very low-gravity world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-01T00:10:20Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2013 12:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weegee","CreatedById":72084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T03:12:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery good advice.

The atmosphere above 10,000m does very little to slow your speed, and most of the terrrain is around 3-4k in height so it leaves you with a very margin for error. Landing site is important too. There are some deep valleys which have lower altitude but are quite hard to aim for, but there are also the giant dark bits which are lower altitude.

I had a nice kethane jet that few great on Duna, but this was more due to thrust than lift. It could drop down from orbit, catch enough air to function, and then fly around anywhere it wanted to just fine, but COULD NOT LAND SAFELY. The slowest it could go forward while still keeping the vertical velocity below -10m/s was 80m/s. Given that most of Duna is quite hilly, the gravity is so low that wheel brakes don\u0027t do much good (especially with lift fighting traction), and the air is so thin that airbrakes don\u0027t do much, either, this was a recipe for disaster. I tried parachutes but it was too heavy to float down and putting a drag chute on the tail tended to make it lawndart. So I gave up on that and made an ultra-slow, ultra-high-lift STOL biplane, which I could touch down at 30m/s. It still rolls (mostly bounces) about 500m before it stops but it\u0027s slow enough and tough enough not to break doing it. But this caused major problems getting it off the ground at Kerbin. Flying Duna is a bitch \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, back to landers, your more vertical approach is also quite doable. You have to kill off the same amount of velocity either way so the question is how you share the workload between engines and parachutes, which is more a function of how big your ship is and what you want to do with it after you land. The more parachutes you have, the less fuel you burn on descent, which means the more you have to get back into orbit with, if that\u0027s the plan. This favors the low, flat approach. OTOH, if you\u0027re just dropping a probe rover, you don\u0027t need to save fuel for ascent so parachutes aren\u0027t as important and you can come in steeper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, parachutes are heavy and you need lots of them to do much good on Duna, so you pretty soon start running into diminishing returns. Just from playing with the parachute calculator, it looks like about 20 tons is the practical upper limit for a returnable lander that can get any real fuel savings from parachutes. Beyond that, you\u0027re going to be doing most of your braking with the engines anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moar Boosters","CreatedById":79218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T20:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is the publicity shot for my DunaVentura single stage aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s197.photobucket.com/user/jimbob2777/media/screenshot401.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i197.photobucket.com/albums/aa53/jimbob2777/screenshot401.png~original\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot401.png~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately it doesn\u0027t show the truth behind my landing.
