The rovers in this case were loaded radially onto the sides of the transfer stage/lander, flew that way all the way out to Duna and then separated after landing (lithobraking). The Sedan can land...but it has no legs, so it either will land on the engine bells or they\u0027ll snap off when it tips over (as what happened in this case). The method employed here was one-way only; it\u0027s trickier to design a craft that will retrieve the rovers once you\u0027re finished with them (I haven\u0027t designed a craft like this as yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the best part for a rover body goes, it depends on what you want the rover to do. I personally find that it doesn\u0027t matter so much as long as all the hardware critical for its operation (probe core, battery packs, RTGs if that\u0027s what you\u0027re using for main power) is either encased in parts that have high impact tolerances (structural panels and modular girders) or has those parts situated around them such that there is no way short of a full-on crash that the critical parts will sustain a direct impact. You see my Hellhound 7s delivered by the Storax Sedan 7? They follow that philosophy; they\u0027ve got an OKTO2 probe core at their heart and their main structural piece is an Inline Reaction Wheel (leave that on when the rover\u0027s in operation and it becomes nearly impossible to flip).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of folks will tell you the best piece is the large Structural Panel, and again that\u0027s because of the high impact tolerance (80 m/s) - you\u0027ll never be able to drive that fast unless you\u0027re doing something stupid like driving with JATO, because your tires will fail first. You can\u0027t really go to wrong with one. Only caution I\u0027d advise there is to make sure any critical bits aren\u0027t sticking slightly through the panels. The rove on which the Hounds above were deployed I lost nearly every Negative Gravioli detector aboard due to them clipping ever- so-slightly though structural panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERover design - build them low, build them wide, SAS is good, lock the steering on the back wheels, use the docking controls to drive or re-map your keyboard for translation and keep the important stuff protected. Follow those guidelines and you should meet with a good deal of success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-03T01:16:27Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2013 01:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T08:14:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr.Rocket\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr.Rocket\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhats the best part for a rover body?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepends on what youre going for - fast scout, taxi between landing site and ground base, expedition craft with lots of personnell, mining rig ... let your imagination go wild!

Use the rovemax model 1n wheels or the really tiny ones.

Angle the wheels... now this is tricky, have worked out if you angle outwards it seems to kill it ( i may be doing it wrong), but angling along the line of travel 8 notches (when you alt move it) seems to work perfectly, any more and forget it. the angles improves stability immeasurably!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Delivery - lots of options as mentioned previously. Attach them to the side of the lander, under the lander (semi sky-crane), full blown sky crane, or my latest invention as seen below which i don\u0027t even have a name for (rover package?)note: requires novapunch and procedural fairings mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

Supposed to be a self-contained dual rover with refueling station system. You can see the 2 rovers and the yellow tanks are for refilling rcs fuel. The docking ports on the rover and fuel tank are at the same height when on the ground (if i can get them all the stand up right). The second-last pic in the series is the delivery rocket. Got it to the Mun but stuffed the landing, am sure it still needs tweaking for mun enviro, but works perfectly on kerbin. Basically a big rocket to get it there, a large lander with three kerbals on the top, and the rover package underneath. the lander and rover package are landed separately but close together so the kerbals can jump on.
