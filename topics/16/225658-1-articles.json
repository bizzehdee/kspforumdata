I recently joined this forum, and I was wondering if you guys could help with this issue I was having with my brother. I have set him up in the past with my computer, and he has a laptop with a version of KSP on it, but he doesn\u2019t know anything about orbital mechanics or how to make a functional rocket. He\u2019s a smart kid (11) and wants to learn, but he has resisted doing any of the tutorials and when I try to teach him anything, he gets up and leaves. Is there any way to teach him without the tutorials or anything like school? Let me repeat, he really wants to learn. Thank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miklkit","CreatedById":201493,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-06T15:05:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYoutube?\u00A0 Mike Aben and orb8ter are very thorough, but slow.\u00A0 Matt Lowne moves much faster bur breezes past some basics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-06T15:16:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums! Another way he might be able to learn is through Youtube videos - this is how a lot of us learnt before tutorials were in the game.
