If you\u0027re worried about the amount of fuel it takes to move from a 150km orbit to 600km then, no, you don\u0027t have enough fuel to go to Eeloo. Such a small orbital adjustment should be inconsequential compared to interplanetary escape (from Kerbin) and injection (at destination). Same for the amount of time the burn takes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Not really. One thing to remember is that with a long burn-time starting from a low orbit you may well push the ship back into the atmosphere, or even crash, while making the burn (pointing down ahead of the node when you start). Starting from 600km should solve that problem as well as allowing faster timewarp. As has been pointed out KAC is great, you can use maximum timewarp just in the spacecentre screen, without focusing on any ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T09:23:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pecan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pecan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1.

Then you can use so called Oberth effect to get most kinetic energy out of your velocity change. If you start from 150 km orbit and go first circular 600 km orbit and then make a trans Jool injection, you probably lose several hundreds of meters per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is the reason why real planet probes (Galileo, Cassini) took high risks when they went very near to the target planets during the first braking burn. It was necessary to keep needed dv\u0027s achievable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there is one problem in low initial orbit. Orbital prediction of KSP and Mechjeb assumes that burns are instantaneous. But large interplanetary burns are very far from that. Vessel can rotate over large angle around Kerbin and prediction fails severely. In worst case you fall back into atmosphere and even in good case you need corrections of hundreds of meter per sec. Therefore I prefer higher orbits for interplanetary burns. If you leave from 300 km orbit and have TWR of 0.25-0.35 actual dv deviates some tens of m/s (10-30) from predicted and is relatively easy to correct by aborting burn manually or by midcourse correction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022endl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022endl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2. is there a better way thats less fuel intensive\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet there is. Optimal way is to start from lowest possible orbit and burn whole burn to prograde direction. It means than you rotate your craft during the burn. Mechjeb\u0027s Smart ASS can do that easily, but the problem is where and when you begin the burn. First you have to determine and achieve exact orbit (LAN and inclination). Alexmoon\u0027s porkchop plotter gives inclination straight and you can get correct LAN by using angle to prograde -information. Most difficult thing is determining of burn start time. I do not know suitable software. It would not be an extremely difficult task to program a calculator and I have considered it, but it takes several days if I want reasonable user interface and it gives quite little benefit over traditional \u0022add moar boosters\u0022, at least in current version where money is not bottleneck resource at all. And on the other hand, it is fun to plan, build and launch monstrous rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T10:53:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022endl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022endl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2. is there a better way thats less fuel intensive\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could always try a gravity assist (although if this is your first trip to Eeloo i\u0060d not advise it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a calculator for a fly by available \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80978-Flyby-Finder-for-KSP-V0-50\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe guy who makes it has made a trip to Jool in about 1050Dv (IIRC)...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T13:08:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hannu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hannu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, it is significantly more effective to make transfer orbit injection burn at low altitude.
