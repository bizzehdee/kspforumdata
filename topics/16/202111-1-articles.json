Try leveling off or even going into a shallow dive at about 5000m to pick up speed. Once over mach 1 the engine thrust will start to rise and you can pull the nose back up a bit to climb out. Air breathing thrust will die at just over 20km so pick up most of your speed at 10-15 km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
