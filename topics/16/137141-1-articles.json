Build a plane that can get there, add any science stuff I have, let\u0027s face it. If you\u0027re going a long way from KSC, might as well make use of the journey and grab every thing you can.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI will nearly always pack a parachute or two if there is a possibility the area is in a mountainous region, or somewhere that might not have the space for the plane to land safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick saving is a must. No one wants to start over in planes, they take so long to get to the poles or half way around the planet.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce you land, quick save, do what ever needs to be done, QUICK SAVE. Then it\u0027s a choice, either walk, fly and \u0022drive\u0022 to the next spot. Often times, if the next spot is only a few hundred metres to 2000 meters, I will use the plane as a land vehicle rather than attempting to take off and land again. It is a little bit slower, but it\u0027s also much safer. Just be wary, if you run and use physics warp I find the stationary plane will randomly explode (at least on 1.1).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMake good use of quick saves. When the mission is done, if you plan to fly home rather than \u0022recover vessel\u0022 make sure to quick save before take off. I honestly suggest not quick saving again until you are within eye sight of KSC. Worst case scenario you QS half way home over water, only to find that you don\u0027t have the fuel left to make it. At least in that case you will QLoad back to land and recover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mahnarch","CreatedById":114432,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T13:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, make sure you have \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/94432-11-waypoint-manager-v250-2016-03-29/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EWayPoints\u003C/a\u003E if you don\u0027t, already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt makes life a lot easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T13:36:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T15:52:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack in 2014 I built this hybrid aircraft/rover for such missions.
