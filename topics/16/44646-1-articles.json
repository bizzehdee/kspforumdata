I\u0027m lefthanded but I\u0027ve always used the mouse with my right and keyboard with my left. Keyboard layouts always end up being about muscle memory/preference for me anyway, I don\u0027t see how it\u0027d make a difference. If you use your mouse with left and are used to holding your right hand on the keyboard, I suppose normal would be to probably start where you hold it when typing, maybe IJKL-UO for rotational keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never really heard of dedicated left-handed mapping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ratahpla","CreatedById":81062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T00:09:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure someone who plays this game left-handed will understand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T09:36:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always recommended a game pad for left handed players. Some of the models out there (G13, Cyber Snipa) can be easily setup for right or left handed playing (the device(s) isn\u0027t contoured either way). In my instance, I have flight combat sims where I use a joystick with my left hand and a game pad (G13) for the right, but I\u0027m right handed (old gamer!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all games (including KSP) allow for key re-mapping. Johnno is right, it really is down to personal preference. Minecraft, for example, G13 for the left hand, mouse in the right.
