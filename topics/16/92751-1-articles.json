If you find it too complex you could go for NEAR. A bit less realistic but much more forgiving and still a tremendous improvement over stock.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it\u0027s because I haven\u0027t built many planes yet, but I\u0027ve never really had a problem with FAR vs. NEAR, and FAR does make some things easier (for example, more gentle reentries).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe single biggest piece of advice I can give is to forget everything you learned about how to get to LKO. Using FAR/NEAR, what you do instead is design for 1.2-1.6 TWR (I strongly recommend 1.2-1.4 unless you are using short-duration SRBs), and make sure you have fins at the bottom (to pull center of lift/pressure/drag behind center of mass). You then begin a true gravity turn: at 60-100 m/s, make a 2-5 degree turn (earlier and steeper for high TWR rockets), wait for your prograde vector to catch up, and then ride that prograde vector all the way through to upper atmosphere. Once you\u0027re at 20-30 km altitude, you can begin to have your own ideas about where to point your rocket, but until then, aerodynamics will screw you if you try to deviate from prograde by more than ~5 degrees*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Under 5 degrees, though, aerodynamics (if your rocket has fins) will tend to pull your rocket back to prograde. Thus, if you nailed the 2-5 degree turn at exactly the right moment, you can literally go \u0022Look Ma, no hands!\u0022 all the way up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary factors behind this all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1: FAR removes the souposphere, and you as such have \u003Cem\u003Emuch \u003C/em\u003Eless atmospheric drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2: With proper fin placement, aerodynamic stability will return you to prograde if you stay close to prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3: Regardless of fin placement, moving far from prograde in low atmosphere is a quick way to flip out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4: A consequence of #1-3: you\u0027ve got to start your turn early, because otherwise you will waste a lot of dV going straight up, because you\u0027ll be unable to turn horizontal until very high atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#5: Another consequence: you can generally get away with a lot less TWR than in stock, because you\u0027re not losing nearly as much to atmo drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#6: Build for 1.2-1.6 TWR (probably best in the 1.2-1.4 range), have fins at the bottom, and turn 2-5 degrees at 60-100 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#7: You will probably want to use KIDS (KSP Isp Difficulty Scaler) or some RSS config, because your dV to orbit will shrink drastically and make your LKO boosters seem laughably small. I personally use 6.4x RSS and RealFuels with the stockalike config.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*From personal experience of building many 1.6 TWR rockets: not worth it. You will struggle and curse to get your velocity vector closer to horizontal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, fairings. You\u0027ll need them for anything except already-aerodynamic payloads: I tend to remove fairings around 45km altitude, but I\u0027m really not sure where the crossover point is. There will be some point at which the reduced atmo drag is no longer worth carrying the mass of the fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-14T04:26:40Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2014 04:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eoff topic split\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T17:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdding fairings adds weight and therefore drag.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically that\u0027s not true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only real fairing parts in the stock game are nose cones (though I suppose there are probably some mods that provide additional parts). While most parts have a drag coefficient of 0.2, nose cones have a drag coefficient of 0.1. This lowers the overall Cd of the part. For example, let\u0027s say we have a Jumbo-64 fuel tank (64 t) with a Skipper engine (3 t). Both of these parts have a Cd of 0.2. The way the game computes the Cd of an assemblage of parts is to use a weighted average based on mass. If all the parts have a Cd of 0.2 then the weighted Cd is also 0.2. Suppose we add a large nose cone (0.4 t) on top of the fuel tank. The Cd of the assembly now becomes,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECd = (36 * 0.2 \u002B 3 * 0.2 \u002B 0.4 * 0.1) / (36 \u002B 3 \u002B 0.4) = 0.199\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of drag produced is inversely proportional to the ballistic coefficient. In the stock game the ballistic coefficient is simply BC = 125/Cd. Therefore, without the nose cone the ballistic coefficient is,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBC = 125 / 0.2 = 625\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand with the nose cone the ballistic coefficient is,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBC = 125 / 0.199 = 628\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding the nose cone slightly lowers the drag. However, adding the nose cone also increases the mass of your vehicle, lowers its mass ratio, and decreases the amount of delta-V the vehicle can produce. The loss in dV from carrying the greater mass may offset any gain from lowering the drag. I haven\u0027t done the math to see if there is an overall advantage or disadvantage in adding nose cones. When I have some time to spare I\u0027ll have to put it through a simulation and see if I can find a definitive answer. Nose cones also add a little cost, so that\u0027s also a factor to consider in career games.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T18:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsidering how slight the difference is for very simple rocket in your example, the increase in mass is going to far outweigh the reduction in drag on larger, more complicated rockets where the drag reduction is even tinier and the mass increase is still the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only application I can see for nosecones is as a fuel-saving measure for faster-than-terminal-velocity ascents.
