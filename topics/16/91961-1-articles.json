I have yet to see it properly discussed or even worked around. People routinely have radial decouplers properly operating on their spacecraft. When I use them to remove SRBs from mine, most often only one set actually operates and another set fails to eject. I have a nice rocket that I want to get into orbit now. The primary stage SRBs eject as commanded. The secondary (longer burn) SRBs remain attached and drag my \u0022third stage\u0022 liquid rocket down due to the weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried various decoupler versions, various decoupler configurations, and various decoupler strategies.

Also considering the SRBs were permanently attached and moving things around for mounting points. The decouplers blow, they just don\u0027t release. Now after re-reading your post, I will try this one again... making absolutely sure that they are physically attached to the decoupler rather than the ship itself. I have attempted this before but it would seem it is the only reason why the SRBs remain after firing the decouplers. Still, if it is obvious that I am attempting to attach to a decoupler, when the alignment during assembly changes color and allows the attachment, it should just be right... correct?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phunk","CreatedById":77377,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T19:21:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe boosters on the lower stage are not attached to the decoupler, they\u0027re attached to the tank with the decoupler clipping through them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
