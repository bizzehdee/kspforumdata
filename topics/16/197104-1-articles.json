Maybe some mods will let you do do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually try and have a small tank on my stations for just the purpose you\u0027re describing. Maybe something that\u0027s about 10% of the size of my fuel tankers seems to work pretty well. Then I can completely drain the tanker, fill the small tank, and transfer from the small tank back to the tanker. That\u0027s about enough to get the tanker from say \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E back to Minmus to refuel.

The extra mass might hurt your payload capacity slightly, but it also means it\u2019s really easy to fill up \u003Ci\u003Ejust\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0enough fuel to return to the surface without a complicated juggling act.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr you could try using a mod to record a launch and then reuse the recorded flight instead of having to fly each mission yourself. You would only have to get it right once that way and then you\u2019d be able to automate it in future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
