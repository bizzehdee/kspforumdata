I tried new game, but it\u0027s the same. I do see LV-909 in my Technology tree (\u0022Survivability\u0022) though.\n\nIs this some known change in new KSP release (1.0.2), or maybe some bug with my installation?\n\nThanks in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:41:52Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s found in Survivability, but rather in a 45/90 science node."},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:44:55Z","Content":"It\u0027s under Advanced Rocketry, a tier 4 (start is tier 1) node (icon is a rocket with two boosters/fins at an angle)"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:46:44Z","Content":"I know it\u0027s not what you asked, but my analysis thus far shows the LV-909 to be a worthless engine.\n\n Take a look here:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118130-1-0-LF-O-engine-comparo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118130-1-0-LF-O-engine-comparo)\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"igordavid","CreatedById":142769,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T23:00:10Z","Content":"All - Thanks for the responses.\n\nFor some reason it\u0027s listed both in Survivability and Advanced rocketry for me. \n\nAfter I researched it in Advanced rocketry, too, I got it now.\n\n@goSlash27 - at this stage, I am playing game from the beginning in Science mode, I think 909 will save me lot of hassle as other engines are pretty heavy for command module only... ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThanks again!"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T23:04:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For some reason it\u0027s listed both in Survivability and Advanced rocketry for me.\n\nThat sounds like you may have a slightly botched install.

Just fish that folder out, put it somewhere safe, have steam reinstall the game from scratch, then copy the folder back. It should work just fine.
