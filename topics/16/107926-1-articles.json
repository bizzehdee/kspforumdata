Scientists can also reset the science junior and mystery goo containers so you can reuse them without needing a mobile processing lab (though I\u0027m not sure if they need to be levels up to gain this ability).\n\nEngineers can repack parachutes and repair broken rover wheels. They also improve the rate of ore mining/processing if they are on board.\n\nEDIT: I\u0027m pretty sure these bonuses do not stack if you have more than one of the same class on your ship, the kerbal with the highest skill will be the one that counts."},{"CreatedByName":"SpeedDaemon","CreatedById":38448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T18:39:02Z","Content":"Higher level scientists also improve science/day when researching in the mobile processing lab.\n\nEngineer level also determines what they can repair (I think one-star = repack chutes, two = fix wheels, three = fix landing legs)"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T18:44:32Z","Content":"I have a related question, when do you really need an engineer?

Engineers are a must for rovers, because you\u0027ll certainly break the wheels at some point. The problem with scientists is that, by the time you trained them enough, you already have most of the tech tree unlocked."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T18:49:40Z","Content":"the first time I\u0027ve needed an engineer was to repack the drouge landing chutes for a survey-kerbin plane.
