During my MJ abusing days, I managed to land on the Mun with a vertical approach and tipping the plane to horizontal on the very last seconds.

It\u0027s a simple but hard technique that requires some intuition involving trig and vector algebra.\n\nEssentially, you want to keep more horizontal velocity than normal for the final suicide burn. Then you can start your suicide burn as normal except earlier than your velocity dictates and incorporate a pitch-down below retrograde into the burn instead of following retrograde. Your horizontal thrust is related to the sine of you AoA to the horizon and vertical thrust is related to the cosine. The vertical component is used to control decent, and you use a high initial horizontal velocity so that the horizontal thrust takes you closer to zero. At 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 your vertical component is still 50% of the total thrust! Due to the need to follow a non-prograde course, this technique only works without an atmosphere. If your craft has an atmospheric landing procedure for a place like Duna, it is probably operationally simpler (if less efficient) to use that procedure if applicable.\n\nPlanning the manuver mentioned does require calculus to account for the varying pitch (on top of the rocket equation). It might be easiest to select a fixed pitch find the thrust components and calculate a ballistic launch from surface to an arbitrary time. The final conditions of that launch (altitude and velocity) can be used as the start condition of your landing burn. You can use use the simplification that acceleration values will be approximately equivalent. A few hundred of a few thousand dV for a high payload rocket won\u0027t realize much change in acceleration capacity.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T20:04:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T20:47:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...you can use an altered powered descent to end on your side...\n\nI feel that this is the specific solution I was looking for.

Backwards landing, here I come!\n\nFurther investigation reveals that factoring the pitch manuver into your burn makes for some mean integrals.\n\nI now recommend using AoA to control decent/deceleration balance. It is easy to design a craft that can be tailstrike safe at 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. At that angle, your vertical thrust component is about \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00E2\u20AC\u0153. If your surface TWR is at least 3 you can counter gravity at this pitch.\n\nThe hard part is that you are committed to a significant horizontal thrust in this landing configuration. This limits how much thrust you can use fighting gravity Here is the Kerbal approach I recommend. (Practice landing procedure at a flat site)\n\nBurn for a low Pe on farside. The lower without impact enroute, the better.\n\nNear Pe, kill enough velocity to guarantee impact.\n\nAt 1 km above terrain (no less than 500 m), use a vertical burn to control vertical speed. Pitch down a little to reduce horizontal speed to a controllable level (200 m/s or so). You need to give yourself a low enough speed so that you can avoid obsticals if needed. The idea is to do a constant altitude decent while keeping a certain horizontal velocity.\n\nA few hundred meters from impact, just keep decent to -20 m/s as you approach the ground. As long as you can arrest your fall, you can spend as long as needed killing horizontal speed.\n\nTens of meters above the ground pitch to a landing AoA use pitch control and throttle to control horizontal deceleration and your fall.\n\nYou can tolerate landing as long as your vertical speed is less than 10 m/s and your absolute horizontal speed is less than 120 m/s (forwards or backwards), but the terrian is a bigger threat the faster you go (even the hills can be scary with gravity this low). Forward velocity will also need retro-rockets (or at least RCS) to kill above 20-40 m/s.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T21:34:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"}]}
