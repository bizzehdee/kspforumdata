If you want to transfer the fuel only in one direction, one duct should be enough. But it is, like it is. I needed an extensive search on the forum, as I ran into the same problem at my Eve mission. I wanted to transfer fuel from a fuel tank, which I left in orbit, and which I detached later, through the command pod, and was frustrated, why I couldn\u0027t do it with a single duct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca data-fileid=\u0022undefined\u0022 href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/hJR4bgQ.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022background-color:#e6e8e9;font-size:15px;\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hJR4bgQ.jpg\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 style=\u0022border-style:none;vertical-align:middle;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/hJR4bgQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-06T05:35:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2024 05:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 6\u0022\u003EMay 6\u003C/time\u003E by DennisB\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-06T07:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if it\u0027s related to the fact that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E resource pump doesn\u0027t work when the 2 ships, the tanker and the one in need of fuel, are in any way docked to one another.
