It turned up the readme file. :/ I made a save in the admin mode, it saved in the normal location. My instinct is that KSP recognizes when windows doesn\u0027t let it save in the default location and tries to save somewhere else, but that is just a guess. It is also possible that Windows might be redirecting it someplace else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the KSP store version.
