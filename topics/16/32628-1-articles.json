MechJeb has a Delta V Stats tab. Here\u0027s a thing of you don\u0027t like MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may need a calculator, a scientific one. Here\u0027s an equation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta V = In(StartMass/EndMass)*SpecificImpulse*AccelerationFromGravity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn( is the natural logarithm. It\u0027s included on most scientific calculators as a primary function, I\u0027d say near \u0022log\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I mean by EndMass is the mass of the stage after ALL fuel has been spent, so for fuel tanks that mean their DRY mass, normal mass for anything that doesn\u0027t store fuel/monoprop. Dry mass is in the part info. StartMass is of course the total weight of the ship fully fueled and loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecific Impulse is the efficiency of engine. Now, I am not entirely sure how to figure out the Isp of multiple engines, it would be beneficial if we all knew. You can find the Isp of the engine in the part info, if the engine is going to be used in vacuum and in atmosphere then do the equation twice using atmosphere for one and the vacuum for the other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccelerationFromGravity is Kerbin\u0027s surface gravity: 9.81. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope I covered your question.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T18:34:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to note about doing the calculations is that you have to apply some common sense to it. For example, RCS tanks have a wet and dry mass, but they would not apply into the DeltaV calculation for your main engines...they MAY constitute a slight reserve of DeltaV is you got in a pinch, but mostly they\u0027re for maneuvering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24623-Tutorial-Video-Krash-Test-Kerbals-How-to-science%21?p=303573\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post303573\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edoing the calculations myself\u003C/a\u003E for that reason....knowing where the numbers are coming from provides confidence to my estimates.
