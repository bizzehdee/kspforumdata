This tells you the numbers that relate to the ones on the calculator. The phase angle is the angle between your position and the target position as measured from the dominant gravitational influence (the sun in interplanetary travel), the ejection angle is the angle between you and the prograde or retrograde of the planet/moon (in it\u0027s orbit around the sun/planet) at which you need to burn (although this can vary depending on the power to weight ratio of your vessel) and the ejection velocity is the theoretical speed you need to be going (although again it can vary).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"123kde","CreatedById":44443,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T02:01:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok, so wait, what about the ejection angle? thats what im having the most trouble with. so what do i do with that? i still dont know what thats supposed to be, or how im supposed to know what it is, and when i do, when to burn and how much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphox","CreatedById":32691,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T02:19:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour ejection angle is the angle relative to the planet your ship needs to be at in order to reach the desired destination in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you zoom out in the map mode, there will be a line coming out of Kerbin. That is it\u0027s prograde. Your ejection angle is the angle from a 180 degree axis along that line that your ship needs to be at when you burn prograde, and you simply burn until you reach an encounter with your target of choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, getting to the inner planets is easier if you go into retrograde orbit around Kerbin (heading 270 degrees west instead of 90 degrees east). It takes a little more fuel to get into that orbit though, but the calculator requires you to use a retrograde orbit to use the angles correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for exact angle, there\u0027s no way you can get that on your own unless you download AdamKSP, the MechJeb beta, or something of the like. I used an on-screen protractor for a couple injections. You can also just \u0022guess\u0022 it and if you do it right you should be close enough for an encounter. Just make your screen look like the pictures on the calculator, and remember to go retrograde orbit if you\u0027re going to inner planets such as Eve, and prograde out of your ejection angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be doing a video tutorial on this tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iamaphazael","CreatedById":49843,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T02:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike person0:5 said, the ejection angle is the size of the angle with it\u0027s vertex at the center of the planet you\u0027re orbiting, and rays passing through your ship and the direction of motion of the planet. The gist of interplanetary transfers is that you\u0027re leaving orbit of a body that is itself orbiting around the sun, so it has some speed that it\u0027s travelling and is pulling you alone with it. If you\u0027re trying to transfer to an outer planet, then you want to leave orbit in the same direction that the planet is already moving, but if you want to go to an inner planet, you want to leave orbit in the direction opposite that. So, the ejection angle is just the place in your orbit that you want to start your burn at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"123kde","CreatedById":44443,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T23:13:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok, but when im at the ejection angle, which way do i burn? straight up? or in the direction im going (the little green circle on the nav ball without the X in it)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"123kde","CreatedById":44443,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T23:16:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eor... am i missing it completely?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pebble_garden","CreatedById":30150,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T03:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are at the ejection angle, you burn prograde (assuming a circular orbit).
