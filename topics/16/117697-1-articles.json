It will be actually the first time I will make it to a planet other than Kerbin, Mun or Minmus without cheating.\n\nPlan:\n\n - Apollo-style (part of crew stays in orbit)\n\n - Landing module glides down to eve slowly, precise horizontal landing\n\n - EVA walk, photography, setting up flag, 5 o\u0027clock tea, etc...\n\n - Back to LM\n\n - Inflation of balloon\n\n - Separation of landing gear to save weight\n\n - Separation of balloon when it does not give any more lift\n\n - Ascent to Orbit\n\n - Docking with Orbital Module\n\nIs this a good idea for a first time eve mission? Can this mission profile be used for larger missions involving rovers and bases too? Should I try it small and unmanned first?"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T14:25:16Z","Content":"Balloon?

I suggest doing some uncrewed test missions beforehand to figure out exactly how much delta-v the lift-off vehicle will need to make orbit, determine how high the balloon takes a craft in Eve\u0027s atmosphere, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T15:50:56Z","Content":"Tried it before, didn\u0027t work well, but that was back in 0.23-ish times. The problem is that you don\u0027t have enough velocity at high altitude, and turning on rockets before you reach max balloon altitude and while it\u0027s still inflated causes too much drag. But, starting at zero velocity when you deflate is kind of like being on a really tall mountain, however you still need a good sized rocket which means you need the larger heavier balloon =even larger rocket. But, the largest balloons also don\u0027t deflate so that\u0027s a problem too."},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T17:38:04Z","Content":"Sounds like a very ambitious flight profile. I\u0027d love to see how it works out ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAs others have noted, your main concern is likely going to be the need for a fairly large and powerful rocket, even with the balloon-assisted ascent. Eve is a little more massive than Kerbin, so you\u0027ll probably need a pretty potent \u0022kick\u0022 to get up to orbital velocity, even from higher in the atmosphere."}]}
