Here\u0027s what i\u0027ve come up with so far, and would like to get your feedback before i\u0027ll try and implement this \u0022for real\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal is to have three satelites around both Kerbin and Moho, in a 120\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 split, to cover the whole of each planet for ground and orbital operations. Each of those satelites would have a Communotron 32 (range 5 Mm) so the three Kerbin satelites (2868 km orbit) can \u0022see\u0022 each other (and mission control) with just the Communotrons. And the same would be true for the three Moho satelites (those would be in a similar ~2800km orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to relay connections between those two clusters i figured each of the satelites would have a dish. The dishes of the three Kerbin satelites would be targeted at \u0022Moho\u0022. Given that the \u0022viewing cone\u0022 angle of the dish is wide enough that should enable each Kerbin satelite to \u0022see\u0022 each of the three Moho satelites with just one dish. The same but vice-versa would be true for the three Moho satelites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tricky part now is to figure out which dish has enough range AND a \u0022viewing cone\u0022 angle that is wide enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo figure out the range requirements i figured the theoretical maximum distance between Kerbin and Moho should be the sum of their Apoapsis\u0027s (or whatever the plural of Apoapsis is called :-) ). The idea behind this \u0022formula\u0022 is if both planets reach their Apoapsis, but on opposite sides of Kerbol. I couldn\u0027t think of a scenario where they would be further apart, right??? (objections?) This, of course, leaves out fators caused by different inclinantions, but i figured for a \u0022ball park\u0022 number it should be close enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the \u0022viewing cone\u0022 angle i figured the angle should be OK if the width of the cone at the maximum distance between Kerbin and Moho (see above) is at least twice the orbit of the Kerbin satelites (2 x 2868km = 5736km). That way all three Kerbin satelites should \u0022fit\u0022 within the cone and therefore be \u0022connectable\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that the Kerbin Apoapsis is 13.599.840.256m and the moho Apoapsis is 6.315.765.980m, my range requirement would come down to just short of 20 Gm (19.915.606.236m to be precise).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd using the formula \u0022cone width\u0022 = 2 * tan(alpha) * distance, where alpha is the \u0022viewing cone\u0022 angle of the dish, i come up with an angle of roughly 0.00825\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you think this is the right approach?

Otherwise not all the satelites orbiting Kerbin (or Moho) will be visible to the targeting satelites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe closest distance between Kerbin and Moho should be the difference between Kerbins Periapsis (= Kerbins Apoapsis) and Mohos Apoapsis.

One important thing to note though: 2868.75 km is the \u003Cem\u003Ealtitude\u003C/em\u003E for Keostationary orbits; what you actually need is the semi-major axis of 3468.75 km, which means that in a equilateral triangle configuration, the satellites will be more than 5 Mm apart.

(If you are playing Career Mode you \u003Cem\u003Eprobably\u003C/em\u003E would have unlocked Reflectron KR-14 in the tree first, but this dish has a cone size of only 0.04 deg, so you will again need extra antenna (and electricity) to actually point directly at each other.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, if you didn\u0027t know, for very small angles (I would say \u0026lt; 1 deg is small) you can use the approximation tan(alpha) ~ alpha, given that alpha is expressed in \u003Cem\u003Eradians\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope it helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEric\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"match","CreatedById":91708,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T15:55:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wmheric\u0022 data-cite=\u0022wmheric\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi Max,\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t look up and check the quoted numbers for the apsis but if they are correct, the approach looks fine to me.

A satellite will be within this measure at all times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with 3 satellites orbiting @ 2.868 Mm and targeting the satellite with an 88-88 dish, you should expect the 88-88 on the distant satellite to maintain continuous connection at ~ 5737.3 Mm [tan .03 = 3.004026 / x].
