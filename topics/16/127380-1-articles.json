Orbital velocity is already so low and atmosphere so thin that it hardly heats up. Make sure the heavy part is on the bottom, or it will flip over. You can use drogue\u00A0chutes to keep the craft upright (you will need a few extra though as the atmosphere is so thin. I always carry some spare chutes on my powered landers just in case they topple over or something else happen, chutes will save the day a lot of the times, but you need a lot if you are not using engines to slow down to non-destructive landing speeds (\u0026lt;10m/s)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-09T19:14:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2015 07:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
