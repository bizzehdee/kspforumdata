ASAS will be able to take control of SAS, pitch/roll/yaw, control surfaces and vectoring engines in order to maintain a fixed heading. Activate it to fly straight, basically. It won\u0027t work if you don\u0027t have enough control authority, though, so use vectoring engines, RCS and SAS modules in conjunction for the most effective results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-08T15:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, SAS/command module SAS are gyros that will resist course change, ASAS is a flight computer that will use all steering mechanisms at it\u0027s disposal (including SAS) to keep the ship to the course it was on when you enabled ASAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use the Avionics package much but I believe it\u0027s a blend of the two, something like ASAS behavior for roll but SAS-like behavior for pitch and yaw - although it contains no gyro itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike the command pod gyros I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way to use the normal SAS modules to turn the ship rather than keeping it on course - you have to use RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-08T15:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Avionics is just a modified ASAS with slightly different behaviour.
