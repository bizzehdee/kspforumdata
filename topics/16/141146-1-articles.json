Science Jr and Goo packs are not part of my recovery modules.\u00A0I do a crew transfer and get Bob on EVA to get science from Jr. and Goo and return to Command Pod. When I attach to Command Pod, I get no option to store science. When I board, I get no notification anything was stored. When I return, the experiments provide me the exact same amount of science with no diminished amount which tells me nothing is happening. Forums have indicated you can store experiments on command modules, and that with my ship setup,\u00A0I can store one per biome in each the MK1 Crew Cabin and the Command Pod. I\u0027m guessing the impression I\u0027ve received is wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould I just be transmitting my data instead? Last mission I transmitted on, Bob couldn\u0027t reset the equipment, I don\u0027t know, maybe I wasn\u0027t doing it right or getting close enough to the equipment. I could close the doors on the Science Jr, that means I should be able to reset it, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is all very new to me and all the convos in the forum threads have mentioned this stuff, but somehow skirts around providing me with exactly what I need to be doing with this setup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-03T20:16:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have two command pods, you need to run each experiment, collect the data, and store that data twice--once for each command pod.\u00A0 If you are not finding the results in one, check the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTransmitting data works best for situations when you need the science points right away or you want to try to squeeze a few extra points out of a single module that you will also later recover; it\u0027s always better to recover, in the long term.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-03T23:22:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, something is not going correctly. We need to be really extremely clear about details now:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 1) When Bob is doing his EVA, he goes to the SciJr and Goo, and you click on them, and do an experiment. This stores the experimental data\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Einside the Goo and SciJr modules themselves.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Now Bob clicks on the SciJr and Goo\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eagain\u003C/em\u003E, and selects the \u0022Collect data\u0022 button. He gets a popup warning message about how \u0022the unit can only be reset by a scientist!\u0022 You click the \u0022Remove data\u0022 button in the popup window. Now the data is stored in Bob\u0027s pocket. Now the button on the SciJr and Goo says \u0022Restore\u0022. And you click that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you do all of Step 1 a second time, and get a second copy of the experiments stored into Bob\u0027s pockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 2) Now click on Bob, and click the \u0022Review Data\u0022 button, it will show all the experimental data\u00A0he is carrying in his pockets. Does it show two of each experiment? If not, there is a big problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow Bob goes back to the Crew module (not the command pod!), and selects \u0022Store Experiments\u0022. He will only get that button when he is very close (nearly touching) the module. Half the experiments in Bob\u0027s pocket now get transferred into the module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow Bob goes to the Command pod, and grabs the ladder. He can either store the data with the button, or he can just board the pod -- the data will be stored in the pod when he boards, but you will definitely get messages about it. Now, if Bob had data in Step 2, but you get no messages, then there is a big problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo please do these steps one time through and tell us what happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
