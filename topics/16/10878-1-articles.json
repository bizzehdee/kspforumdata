The highest speeds I have attained were during moderate dives from 14-15km back to 11km, and while flying level at 14-15km does result in a slight increase in speed, your engine efficiency drops at least 15% and so it isn\\\u0027t worth the fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T14:32:21Z","Content":"\u003E flying level at 14-15km does result in a slight increase in speed, your engine efficiency drops at least 15% and so it isn\\\u0027t worth the fuel.\n\nI might be wrong but i\\\u0027m pretty sure engine efficiency relates only to thrust vs fuel consumption. Fuel consumption is only dependent on throttle setting. \n\nSo for a given throttle setting, lower egine efficiency does not mean more fuel consumption, it only means less thrust. \n\nBut who cares that you have less thrust (with the same fuel consumption) at greater altitude if you\\\u0027re actually going faster due to reduced air resistance?"},{"CreatedByName":"Doctor Lag","CreatedById":23856,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T17:01:09Z","Content":"Too-thin air will also decrease efficiency.
