So, I wanted to start tossing some debris up into the L-points around Kerbin - only no amount of Wiki- and Forums-scrubbing revealed anything on the subject. So I was wondering: Does the game physics model entertain Lagrangian orbital mechanics? Has anyone done any work figuring out the L-points for any of the planets in Kerbol\u0027s system? I\u0027d love to try (most likely unsuccessfully) to park some stuff at Trojan points, give Lissajous orbit a shot and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-27T17:46:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2013 05:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Andr0s\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnswered.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T16:56:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP uses singlebody physics so there are no L-points etc. Meaning you can only ever be in a single sphere of influence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeostationary orbits are about the only fancy-ish thing you can do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T17:11:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELagrange points actually get suggested so often that they\u0027re on the Do Not Suggest list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re set on visiting L-points, you could check out Orbiter:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andr0s","CreatedById":80489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T17:18:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you gentlemen! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMr. Shifty, you dream-smasher \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E (Sorry I didn\u0027t see the do-not-suggest list, still stumbling through forums.

The Kerbin-Mun L1/L2 would be about 2.2 Mm away from the Mun, which is actually just inside the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence, meaning that objects there would orbit the Mun with a period of about 22.2 hours. Since an object orbiting at a real L1 or L2 would remain stationary with respect to the Kerbin-Mun axis, it would only take minutes or seconds for the difference to become apparent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose you could kill your rotational velocity out there, point your engines at the Mun and try to do a continuous low burn to keep your altitude constant. If you have a 10 ton vessel, it would only take about 134 N of continuous thrust to stationkeep, which an LV-1 could easily manage.
