However, I\u0027ve been taking a good, hard look at the Clamp-o-Tron Sr. since 0.20 came out. My chief reason for using the quad port was to sturdy up the connections; my understanding is that the Senior does this fairly well as well but that it has a tendency to \u0022break\u0022. My big beef with the quad port is that I occasionally don\u0027t get them aligned properly and have to re-dock modules together. So I\u0027ll ask the experts: should I switch over to the Sr., or should I continue using the quad port?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext big project is to improve on my interplanetary design, doable by adding more of the existing service stage designs. Because each one of those is 130 tonnes a pop I\u0027m building a \u0022superheavy\u0022 tug module - 25 LV-Ns, gives me the thrust of a Mainsail and the Isp of LV-Ns, made for flying some seriously heavy loads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GJames","CreatedById":58866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T15:38:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard that the quad docking port setup is stronger, but it is a pain to dock. It took me about 20 minutes even after I had rendezvoused the two craft.
