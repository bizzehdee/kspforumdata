If you delete the original root part you have to put another in its place. The root part appears to have to have a node (it can\u0027t be something like a wing) but it doesn\u0027t have to be a command module. So if you remove a rocket from its command module then delete the command module, you\u0027ve got to drop a new root part in its place and then reattach the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raxacorico","CreatedById":67631,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T02:39:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, thanks for the help. I figured out that the new root part was being placed in the 3D space inside my rocket when I clicked on the part in the partsbin. This moved my camera to the bottom of my rocket but I couldn\u0027t see the new root part. I guess it would be better if they just let you drag it in like a normal part, the way you guys described.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T02:42:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESame thing happened to me, and I had to ask here - was coming to answer your question from my own experience, but it seems someone beat me to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
