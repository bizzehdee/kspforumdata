That is, you want to pick up the least gravity slingshot possible. Now, trying to get low altitude science is directly contrary to that, of course. Because the lower you get the more gravity you feel, and the longer you feel it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, the orbit you start with takes you from low orbit around your homeworld out to your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E. If you meet nothing while you are there, you come back to a nice low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E around your homeworld. But (unfortunately) you encounter a celestial object on your voyage that gives you a slingshot --\u00A0prograde and somewhat radial in\u00A0(from your homeworld\u0027s perspective). To get back home once you leave this \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, you need to get back to that nice low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E around your homeworld that you had when you started. So you have to cancel out whatever gravity slingshot you picked up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich means that (from your homeworld\u0027s perspective) you want your burn to be retrograde, and maybe somewhat radial out. And for oberth reasons, you want to do the majority of your burn near your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E if you want to maximize efficiency. This has the added benefit of getting you out of the Mun/Moon\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E quickly, which reduces the slingshot. So, the spot where you are moving retrograde WRT the homeworld is exactly over the backside of the mun/moon, and probably the best place to start burning (prograde, WRT the local \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E) is just before that point.

I\u0027ll assume you\u0027re in a circular orbit around the Earth, at 303km (the lowest orbit cheat menu will put you :P) and matching inclination with the Moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is an example of what it looks like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uZhJT6F.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/uZhJT6F.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis kind of gravity assist is super \u0022threading the needle\u0022 type business (especially when it comes to the resulting perigee), so a couple of few m/s correction burns will be needed to get it completely perfect, but it\u0027s a basic free return with a low perilune and a perigee near Earth\u0027s atmosphere. A few m/s in correction burns will make it perfect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most important thing is the amount of overshoot you have relative to the Moon\u0027s orbit, if I rotate the maneuver node about the orbit to get the Moon out of the way, this is about how much overshoot there should be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sUM8wLX.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sUM8wLX.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe free return works because essentially\u00A0the Moon\u00A0performs an orbit-lowering gravity assist (by passing behind the moon), so first you need to overshoot to give the Moon\u0027s gravity something to lower. If you have too much overshoot (i.e. hyperbolic) you might be able to still achieve your goals, but you\u0027ll end up in a retrograde orbit around Earth after the gravity assist rather than a prograde orbit, getting the prograde orbit is unbelievably\u00A0sensitive, in\u00A0 contrast, it\u0027s relatively easy to get a retrograde orbit (this will reduce trip time to moon though). If you have insufficient\u00A0overshoot you won\u0027t be able to get both a low perilune and perigee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince it\u0027s super-sensitive to the exact timing and the exact deltaV of the ejection burn, some kind of maneuver node editor (which I didn\u0027t actually use here) helps though you\u0027re still going to need at least some tiny correction burns. And of course, because the Moon\u0027s orbit is elliptical those exact numbers aren\u0027t going to work for you unless the moon is in exactly the same place! Nevertheless starting with about that amount of overshoot should save some time in finding the exact burn required\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium
