At that point there\u0027s a sudden spike in aerodynamic pressure that might topple you over. And with most of your fuel in the first stage your CoM will be pretty low even if it is slowly rising again, while the lighter payload is extremely long and will give the stronger aerodynamic forces more leverage against you.
