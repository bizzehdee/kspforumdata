But that physics bubble and atmospheric control switching is still going to be a tricky thing. \n\nOh, the problem with both aerostats and the parachute tank re:spaceplane resupply is that in order to dock with a floating or slowly dropping refueling point, you have to lose most or all of your horizontal velocity that you paid for to get to that point, and depending on how thin the air is and the design of your spaceplane, you might not be able to get it back without a horribly inefficient altitude loss. I don\u0027t see this ever being a good idea (in mostly-stock) compared to orbital refueling, where you get to keep your orbital velocity and you can detach without plummeting towards the lithosphere.\n\nRemember, that\u0027s the reason (ok, one of the reasons) IRL why jet fighters refuel from jet tankers, and not fuel blimps or the tops of really tall towers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T19:42:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 07:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by thadisjones**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T19:51:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Oh, the problem with both aerostats and the parachute tank re:spaceplane resupply is that in order to dock with a floating or slowly dropping refueling point, you have to lose most or all of your horizontal velocity that you paid for to get to that point, and depending on how thin the air is and the design of your spaceplane, you might not be able to get it back without a horribly inefficient altitude loss.\n\nExactly.

To make something easily catchable without intensive precomputation (that is, catching it by being more or less in the right place by eye and then jiggling maneuver nodes), it must be in a high, wide arc. And if you can do that, it means you probably are close to achieving a stable orbit anyway, by adopting a more efficient ascent trajectory."},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T21:04:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Exactly.

I\u0027m going to build an Eve ascent vehicle that is not designed to orbit, but rather shoot straight up (pure radial burn) in order to be caught by an orbiting \u0022skyhook\u0022. The skyhook will have to slow its orbit to 0, catch the freefalling ascent vehicle, and then return to orbital velocity.\n\nBWAHHAHAHAHA!"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T02:18:25Z","Content":"Wow... it\u0027s waaay harder than I thought it would be. I\u0027ve just been practicing on Kerbin. Getting the timing down is horrendous. But what really makes it hard is that you can\u0027t switch vessels in the atmosphere. Meaning... I can\u0027t start my skyhook\u0027s deorbiting/rendezvous burn until my ascent vehicle is already close to its apoapsis.
