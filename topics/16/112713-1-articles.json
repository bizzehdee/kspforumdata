You just have to be in an orbit.\n\n2) The order of things matters for some of the contract conditions. Perhaps the contract in question only checks to see if you went from a hyperbolic path to an orbit, without checking if you went from sub-orbital to an orbit. I have noticed that I don\u0027t get credit for a sub-orbital condition unless I first establish an orbit. (The exception is Kerbin itself.)\n\nAn example of what I am talking about is that I had some tourists on the surface of Minmus. (They got there riding in a part that, for some reason, was not granting them any experience.) I transferred them to my command pod. But they still didn\u0027t get credit for landing on Minmus, even though they were landed on it. So I lifted off about a meter and then let the ship drop back down to the surface. Aha! The received credit. So you don\u0027t get credit for being landED on Minmus, you get credit for landING on it. Perhaps a similar thing is true of orbits.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T23:43:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 11:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison**"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T23:48:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You have to actually have both your periapsis and apoapsis above the surface of the body to have it count as orbiting.\n\nThat is pretty much what I am asking, if I remember correctly the highest peak on Mun was only around 10km which is why I thought 12.5 would be more than enough, if it isn\u0027t then what would be?"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

(A fun trick to pass the time: what\u0027s the lowest equatorial circular orbit you can manage without scraping your toes.)\n\nTo be in orbit, you have to satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. Your periapsis is above ground (or, for bodies with an atmosphere, above the top of the atmosphere)\n\n2. You have an apoapsis (i.e. you\u0027re not on an escape trajectory)\n\nOther than that, you can be as low as you like."},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T05:05:43Z","Content":"Built a new rocket for the mun since I finally unlocked the MPL (just need to nab a few volunteers to run it yet) and landed it on Mun.
