Deleting the sections does the trick! Thanks for listening...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk sounds crazy - I want to delete all science earned from Duna exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a surplus of science points. Enough that I believe I can delete the Duna portion of it and still have a bit extra to ensure that I don\u0027t screw up my fully exploited tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion - is this possible? I can see in the save file what appears to be the registers for the science earned and the max science possible for each science experiment conducted in Duna biomes. Is it fair to assume that by setting these variables to Zero that I can delete all Duna Science? OR, should I delete the entire entry sections relating to Duna for each experiment package? I suppose I could backup my save, just hack away and see what happens till i get it correct - but seems polite to ask and involve any interested parties ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional info:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA snip from my save file.

So executing a Duna \u0022Science reset\u0022 is a critical success factor. If this works out, then it might be fun to try it on other planets/Moons over time. There\u0027s probably a challenge like this out there somewhere but I\u0027m just doing this because... KSP! Perhaps doing a \u0022science reset\u0022 on Kerbin and designing a mission to extract all science in one go - could be fun...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EW.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-24T05:45:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2014 05:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wallygator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdated because it been answered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wooks","CreatedById":101499,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T14:08:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried to get all the science from Duna and Ike once but missed a couple readings, I hope you can do better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/LbB81-fcCLw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T17:26:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes I\u0027m going to give it a go using my Apollo style hardware.
