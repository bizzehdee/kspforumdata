I know it\u0027s realistic to want to protect your rover against re-entry heat from planets that have atmosphere.

And being a noob at building rockets and rovers, I have no idea how I can make a heat shield for it, and also have the rover hooked up to a rocket, and have that rocket not spin out of control when I try to do my departure burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-30T05:13:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2013 05:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Benie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EQuestion answered!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T05:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now, re-entry is only a visual effect and generates no heat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T05:02:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere isn\u0027t reentry heat in .20, so there\u0027s really no need to it.

If you have any weak connections they could pop off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd do remember to pull in your solar panels before entering the atmosphere if you have extendable ones.
