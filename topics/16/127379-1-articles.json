You can fix this by plotting a radial (the blue circles) manoeuvre as soon as possible.

But in Kerbin orbit very minor changes to your escape burn can have a very big impact on where your course ends up. Burning a manoeuvre node never works out exactly as plotted.\u00A0If burning manually, switch to the map and watch how your course plot changes during the burn. When you get near to the end of the burn, throttle right back and be ready to kill the engines when your predicted path is in the right place, not necessarily when you\u0027ve burnt exactly as per the manoeuvre node. If you end up slightly off-course, you\u0027ll only need a small correction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hupf","CreatedById":152424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T14:54:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have trouble with overshooting on burns or with tuning maneuver nodes just right, maybe try the following: only use a node to get the right burn direction / ship orientation\u00A0figured out (radial in this case, as mentioned by ElWanderer, i.e. the cyan marker in the navball). Then open the map view, focus on the Mun and start burning very slowly (i.e. one quick \u0022Shift\u0022 press). Observe the trajectory change very carefully and only increase acceleration if you\u0027re comfortable with the speed of the trajectory change.

The trouble is you don\u0027t actually want to raise your Ap quite as high as Mun\u0027s orbit, but a little lower so that the Mun pulls you into an spinwards orbit (i.e. the same eastwards direction as orbiting Kerbin), or a bit higher and further ahead so that you get pulled anti-spinwards the other side (but this means you need to lose more speed to land).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MircoMars","CreatedById":61811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T07:36:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor 1)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nright click on mun and select \u0022focus view\u0022, now you see the flight\u00A0trajectory in relation to mun. plan and execute transfer burn, notice, you can see in dotted line which way you\u0027ll pass mun.
