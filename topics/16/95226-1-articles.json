For instance if your vehicle is front wheeled drive and you accidentally also left the back left wheel motor enabled the vehicle will gain speed on its\u0027 left side faster thus wanting it to turn to the right.

Keep your center of mass low. If you imagine the line from your center of mass to the contact point the wheel makes with the ground the more vertical that axis is, the easier the rover will be to topple. When you place the vehicle on an incline such that that axis is vertical or more relative to the force of gravity, Then you are beyond the point of return and the vehicle will tip unless you have sufficient torque to keep it upright.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T00:33:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Dwarf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Dwarf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think slashy\u0027s got it.

I had a very close look at it several times, it looks like the wheel is pushed/pulled faster and faster left to right. The faster you go the worst the shaking. In the worst cases I managed to lose the wheels during the first 50m of the ride. And really, there is no apparent meaning for the shaking cause it is not a matter of \u0022heavy load\u0022 or misplacement. Moreover, if it then works w/o angle snap, I think the issue should be angle snap itself. I might even be able to reproduce the issue at will. I\u0027ll check it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T17:54:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Signo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Signo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI experienced the shaking just with rugged wheels and often this is tied to the rover non going straight.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI pretty much exclusively use those wheels; I\u0027ve still never had an issue with them that wasn\u0027t just a design flaw (wheels a few degrees off, etc).
