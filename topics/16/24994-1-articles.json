Translate forwards or backwards with H and N works fine, but when I want to translate in any other direction the long front end is faster than my Commandpod and I get in some kind of rotation which makes it unpossible for me to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s because the commandpod is heavier than the struts? And then the struts probably works like a long lever strengthen this effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I compensate that? ASAS would probably work but burns to much RCS Fuel.

You could also replace the lower sets with the linear thruster variant, which only fires in one direction per thruster, but is stronger. Or, you could add more thrusters at the capsule end, but that\u0027s an inelegant solution that would add to part count and burn through your RCS propellant faster. However, it is possible to dock a ship like that, if you are prepared to counter-act the rotation with attitude burns after the translation burns. It\u0027s much more work, but can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T16:58:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to put a set in the center of mass of the whole module; I see sets at both ends but none in the middle. It\u0027s the middle set that will aid in translation. You\u0027ve also got more thrusters (and therefore more torque) in the bottom set, so you\u0027ll probably need to add a second set near the top to compensate.
