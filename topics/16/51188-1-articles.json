How low should my periapsis be to capture but not crash? If you get this question wrong you have the potential of spoiling hours of work which is not fun. Are there any tools out there to calculate aerobraking maneuvers? Better yet, has anyone built a table of sample aeorbrakes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built this little tool in MATLAB for ye-olde-KSP before there were periapsis markers and time-warp. It was designed to take a snapshot of flight info and determine if you were in orbit and if so a few orbital parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag55/nholzric/orbit_display_zpsc6127acb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022orbit_display_zpsc6127acb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve modified it based on drag information from the wiki to \u0022calculate\u0022 aerobrake maneuvers. I put \u0022calculate\u0022 in scare quotes because aerobraking is an extremely finicky maneuver, made worse by having to read flight information out of KSP (can you pull an angle off the nav ball down to a degree, a tenth of a degree, a hundredth of a degree??) in real time. All this when some fraction of a degree can make the difference between escape and crash. So, is my drag model correct? Maybe. Is the tool so dependent on precise measurements that it will never be useful? Probably. These are things I worry about; my question for you is, do you know of a set of data with which I can test my model?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T16:50:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wondered the same thing - a table of useful Aerocapture periapsis would be very useful!

The periapsis and apoapsis are outputs from my tool. The aerobraking calculator gives a thrust angle of 50 deg which matches the input to my tool. So, that\u0027s good evidence that my model works.
