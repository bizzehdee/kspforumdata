Read that I could rename. So built two ships to get the other requirements done, forgot antenna. Built a third module to add the antenna. Docking was somewhat okay.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTurned out, renaming did not help. Tried both as all docked,\u00A0 as all undocked.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, I built a replica of the old part up in orbit, equipped an antenna, and sent it up. Turned out, that once I docked the two modules to it, it completed the mission. But as I tried returning back to my old station, with the third lander module, I encountered difficulties.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHad to reload. Well, quicksave was before going out to the new station ship. So undocked, did the process again... But, somehow the game had lost track of things. It did not complete the contract for me, even with the new module with pre equipped antenna, new habitat modules, etc... Like it had done on the first try!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nGave up in the end.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny suggestions?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am compentlating building a third station, just to get this one contract done...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-11T14:48:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to gameplay questions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
