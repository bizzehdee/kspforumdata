Simply put, you download a distribution image, throw it onto dvd/flashdisk, boot it and look if you like it. Booting up from removable medium takes a while longer, but you can try things without hassling with installation to disk. You can also test if your hardware is properly supported. Some to choose from (but there are much more if you are picky):\n\n[http://www.linuxmint.com/](http://www.linuxmint.com/) (kde, gnome2 and \u0022conservative\u0022 gnome3 desktop)\n\n[https://getfedora.org/workstation/](https://getfedora.org/workstation/) (gnome3 desktop)\n\n[http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) (unity desktop)\n\nKDE is very sophisticated and configurable, good if you like to tinker with things.\n\ngnome and unity are more like \u0022one (well thought out) size for all\u0022\n\nIf you know any linux user who can help you, just ask and get same distro. Once you have your favourite, look for tutorial for that specific flavour. Most distributions have some \u0022getting started\u0022 documentation right at eye level."},{"CreatedByName":"Lindy","CreatedById":68803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T19:10:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ok thanks i didnt realise they came with instructions on running them dual with windows. which version of linux is best for KSP?\n\nI don\u0027t know if any one distribution is any better than the other for KSP or any other game, but Ubuntu is popular with many new users. I myself use Fedora with a KDE desktop. One thing you can do is to dl several live cd versions of different distributions to see which you like best.

Proper shell usage makes most things easier and/or faster once you get the hang of it. On second thought, this should have been listed last, as there\u0027s no real reason to get down and dirty with this until you\u0027ve got a decent installation up and running.\n\n- A common question seen around the web is someone asking **which distro** they should go with. My advice: Try one, and see if it works for you. There is a myriad to choose from, most of them geared towards different uses. If you\u0027re new to the linux area, I recommend going for one with a fairly large user-base, as it makes it easier to find someone who\u0027s found a sollution for whatever issue you might stumble across.\n\n- **Harddrives and partitioning** will most likely be very unfamiliar to you at first glance. But depending on how you are with this topic already, you might be OK. For an install I recommend having a dedicated linux harddrive. Not that it matters in the long run, but it does eliminate the need to resize an existing windows/NTFS partition. Basically, it goes like this: Linux supports many filesystems. Most of them default to ext3, reiserfs, UFS or ext4. NTFS is usually supported, but for reasons beyond the scope of this post, you probably don\u0027t want to install linux on an NTFS partition. What this means is that your linux install can read your windows install, but not the other way around. Don\u0027t let this paragraph scare you, tho. Most installers simplify this A LOT, alloming fairly painless repartitioning depending on your need.\n\n- **Drivers** CAN be a pain in the retrograde. But don\u0027t let this be a turnoff before doing some basic research. When I installed a linux distro a few years ago just to check how it worked as a desktop OS, I was suprised to see how far linux in general has come since last time I checked (which was around 2001) this means two things:\n\n - Hardware vendors (or some of them, at least) are now taking linux seriously, and release drivers for the linux platform (NVIDIA does this, for example)\n\n - Common hardware made by hardware vendors who aren\u0027t as nice often have a driver made for them by a third party\n\nAnyway, the most common sources of grief here are gfx adapters and wifi cards. Google whatever you have and check its linux compatibility.\n\n- Live distros can help you gauge how well you like linux before actually going for a full install. On top of this, many install images actually boots a fully functional OS and lets you check it out before running the installer as if it was a regular program.\n\n**Software** - Most windows software has a linux-native equivalent, unless said software is also released for linux. Some might even resemble the windows original. For those of us who traded MP3s via e-mail before the days of Napster and the like, winamp would\u0027ve been the tool of choice. For linux you have xmms, which looks exactly the same and.... OK, I\u0027m digressing worse than [Doofenschmirz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Heinz_Doofenshmirtz) here. Basically, if your software won\u0027t run under linux, some other will do the job instead. \n\n***And that\u0027s all I have to say about that***\n\n ***- Forrest Gump, 1994***\n\n Except from this:\n\nWhen I installed Linux Mint a while back on one of my laptops, I decided to fire up steam and install KSP to test for issues, both of which ran fine out of the box. It just works. Also, I believe Mint is geared towards ease of use for desktop users. The only issue I had was that I had to select a different NVIDIA driver than the one Linux Mint chose for me, and that took around 30 seconds. Personally, Arch Linux is my favourite nowadays, but I wouldn\u0027t use it as a desktop OS.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T23:58:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund**"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T00:28:17Z","Content":"I dual boot Ubuntu, it\u0027s easy enough to do, you will have to partition your hard drive, but Linux provides a tool to do just that during install.
