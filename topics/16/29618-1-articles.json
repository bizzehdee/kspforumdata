In .20, it seems as though debris has been removed from map view entirely. While this is a welcome change in many aspects, it ended up hurting my mission as I need my lander to dock with fuel tanks that I left in orbit. Using Haystack, I can only find the ascending and descending nodes of the debris; the location and orbit are still not shown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to know if there is any way to re-enable the debris on Map / Orbit view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not, it\u0027s a simple enough solution to just add a module to the fuel tank next time, but this also affects anyone who wants to manually collect or destroy their debris after it has entered orbit, and players cannot predict the off chance that they will run into debris.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T21:42:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you place your mouse near the center of the top edge of the map view, you will find a filter menu for all types of vessels, from debris to stations, and also Kerbals and flags.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeft-clicking will filter only the icon you just clicked, while right-clicking will toggle them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheaterman","CreatedById":32757,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T21:51:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short - right click the debris-shaped icon that appears when you hover the top of the map view screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Qoph","CreatedById":68114,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T21:55:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, thanks.
