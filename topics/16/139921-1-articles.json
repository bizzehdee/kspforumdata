You now have 5 minutes before you touch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen switch between ships and make sure that each one\u0027s docking port is facing the other one. Warp for a microsecond to get everything steady.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you go to your most manouverable ship, and use IJKL H/N for RCS maneuvres. Use H to head towards your target, and use ONLY IJKL to align the prograde vector with target. Don\u0027t ever rotate using WASD - it will just ruin things for you. If the target ever moves off the dead centre of the navball, use IJKL to shift the prograde vector to the other side of the target icon to push it back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSwitching to \u0022locked\u0022 view can help (since this probably means right and left work as you see it on the screen, and up and down are reversed), but you should just use this to confirm what you see on the navball. If you force yourself to watch the navball first, and outside view second, then you\u0027ll be better prepared to understand what is happening in more difficult situations (like for example if you are out of monoprop, but need to dock anyway, or you simply cannot move one of the vessels and need to navigate around it to get to a docking port).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncidentally, this is a significant issue when flying real planes. There are basically two sets of rules and qualifications for flying, VFR (visual flight rules) and IFR (instruments). If you ever fly through clouds, you need to be IFR qualified because if you rely on the outside view you can easily get disorientated and crash. Very easily. However if you are flying VFR you need to watch what\u0027s happening outside more than the instruments, otherwise your find your attention being \u0022grabbed\u0022 by the instruments and you can easily end up not paying attention to what is obviously going wrong outside as you try to get your instruments lined up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore the best way of resolving the issue in KSP (IMHO), until you can fly perfectly with instruments alone, is first you believe the instruments, then you check that this corresponds to reality outside, and if something seems wrong between the two then you resolve the difference in your head quickly before it becomes a disaster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-16T22:55:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2016 10:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T22:54:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(double post)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-16T22:54:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2016 10:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
