And completely possible through the use of mods. The main one being KOS which will allow you to write a scriptable auto pilot system. I have just began experimenting with the KOS system and have successfully written a program that automates a rocket from launchpad to LKO. There are programs that can automate rendezvous and docking two crafts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would do a little research on the capabilities of the KOS system and test on a smaller scale. You can definitely achieve a automated launch, orbit, and docking by running a different program for each stage of the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts definitely something worth exploring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T15:58:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like the image doesn\u0027t work (though if you right-click and open in a new tab, you can view it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for automated depots, I believe there is at least one mod which does what you\u0027re asking, though it may be still a work in progress.
