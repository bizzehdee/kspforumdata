Probably, this is why the wheels can\u0027t seem to turn my rover at all, and why it takes ages to pick up speed (3\u002B minutes to ~6-7m/s for wheels that at normal size do 30m/s), despite the rover only weighing like 50kg.

Tweakscale modifies all the properties of a part based on some rules - tank capacity, mass, thrust, etc. Capacity is easy; it scales with the cube of the (linear) scale change. All the other properties are probably less straightforward, and the assumption made by the mod for motor torque could either break down for extreme scale changes or be flat-out wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019d check that mod\u2019s forum thread for help there - but I\u2019d suggest doing some experiments first with a simple buggy and tracking what changes about the behavior as you change the wheel scale and nothing else. That would help identify whether it\u2019s actually a problem with Tweakscale, and if it is, knowing what it \u003Ci\u003Eis\u003C/i\u003E doing would be helpful in figuring out what is \u003Ci\u003Eshould be\u003C/i\u003E doing and how it should be changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boersgard","CreatedById":189025,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-19T22:43:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I\u0027ve tested a new rover, and it\u0027s working better, but not 100% perfect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, I made a full size barebones rover to test wheel authority, power, and torque - everything was fine. Then I downscaled the wheels to 31%, and along with it came a drop in speed and power. It also created serious bugginess with the rover shaking around like it had parkinsons - which I fixed by decreasing friction control to 0.1, spring strength to 0.3, and dampener to 0.4 in every wheel. I\u0027m guessing the values were too much for such a small and light vehicle that the physics didn\u0027t like it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 25% scale, the wheels were giving me about 6-7m/s velocity, with ~40 second to 360 at full speed, at 31% scale the wheels do about 12-14m/s, with ~10 second to 360 at full speed. Which was a dramatic improvement to be sure; acceptable enough. However, when I tested the rover in a more real-life situation, by launching it from a spaceship-attached hangar using the hangar mod on kerbin with mun gravity, the wheel authority disappeared completely again - I could still accelerate to 12-14m/s, but turning was out of the question without using reaction wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn further testing it seems like hangar loads scaled parts differently from how the default launchpad does. A reaction wheel set to 5.0 torque and 5% torque limit should max out at 0.25 torque, but what I discovered is that the launchpad actually loads the wheels with full torque, despite having turned it way down. Hangar on the other hand, loads the vehicle with the actual torque settings I applied while building it - what I don\u0027t understand is why this then also destroys my ability to turn the rover with my wheels, but my max speed/acceleration isn\u0027t affected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere just seems to be a whole lot of really buggy behaviour around scaling small wheels and parts.
