Is there any way to jink conics so I can pre-set the orbit like I can do with Kerbin intercepts? Or do I just have to wait until the asteroid is in-system (or go out and get it while it\u0027s still in a solar orbit)?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-03T15:12:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2014 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ArmchairGravy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlonioFludrasco","CreatedById":98915,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T07:14:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to edit something that raises the limit of SOI transitions of the orbit plot, I didn\u0027t remember exactly what, so you can see the resultant orbit after munar encounter, and if it\u0027s effectively on a collision course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T10:18:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECONIC_PATCH_LIMIT in the settings.cfg\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T20:52:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECONIC_PATCH_LIMIT in the settings.cfg\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, cantab!
