Please give me any info. I read I don\u0027t need oxidizer for LV-N anymore, so that\u0027s one info.\n\nThanks in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T12:15:04Z","Content":"There are to many changes to list them all in one post. However you have to know that single-stage-to-anywhere is dead. In the 1.0.2 SSTO-s are only practical to LKO. Try to build with as little wing as possible. Flight profile has dramatically changed with \u0022nerfed\u0022 jet eninges.

Use it as a heavy upper stage engine. Also what viktor said, SST-anywhere is almost dead, at least for vertical liftoff things. A spaceplane without a payload might still make ike and back but I\u0027m not sure."},{"CreatedByName":"seyss","CreatedById":137952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T19:06:26Z","Content":"Sorry I wan\u0027t clear.. my ship isn\u0027t SSTO ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) thanks for the info"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T03:44:36Z","Content":"Atm Isp really means something now - pre-1.0 uses a constant thrust variable fuel consumption model which is a really bad model and significantly overpowered those engine that perform bad in atm. Now things are on the right track. So you need an engine that is doing the right job, and KR2L doesn\u0027t sound the right engine to take off on launchpad with decent air pressure.\n\nFor me, I don\u0027t use any fixed engine - everything for me is designed from top down, and when I get there, I\u0027ll pick the right engine."}]}
