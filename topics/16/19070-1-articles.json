Takes off fine, very solid and straight. However at around 13-18 thousand meters it begins to list to one side and is soon spinning out, even with advanced SAS turned on. I am new to the game and im not sure if there is something i am missing, but it makes getting to the mun difficult if i cant even get into orbit.

The ASAS just auto controls the rocket to keep it pointed where you want. SAS act as spin counters. The cause of the flippy rocket isn\u0027t related to this. At 13-18km, you start losing the ability for aerodynamic control. If you have a weight imbalance or are using all non gymbaled thrust, it can cause a tip to start to form with no way to control it. Try posting up a pic of the rocket and maybe we can see for an asymetric fuel tanks or what engines if you cannot see any of these. Try having some gymbal engines engage at this point so you can use thrust to help guide the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndOfTheEarth","CreatedById":24503,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T23:41:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThings that will help stop spin and wobbling:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Vectored Thrust.

For control surfaces of any kind to be effective, they need to be as far away from the centre of gravity as possible. I typically put an ASAS right at the top, just under the capsule\u0027s decoupler, and a bunch of canards right at the bottom. Putting them on the SRBs isn\u0027t terribly effective because you\u0027re going to jettison them after twenty seconds, so you\u0027ll want them on your fuel tanks, but remember that they will rotate and bashing into your fuel tanks is unlikely to make for a good ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith configurations like yours I\u0027ve had good luck placing them on the \u003Cem\u003Eside\u003C/em\u003E of the tanks; this lets me put them further down than if I placed them on the outside.
