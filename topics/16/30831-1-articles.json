Unfortunately, when I tried to use the planes, I hit trouble- the hydraulic ejection manifolds I used to detach the planes from the main ship eject from the main vehicle, but stay attached to the planes, which provides just enough extra mass and drag to make them really want to nose-dive unless the engine is throttled up very high and the control surfaces turned all the way upwards. I\u0027ve been messing around with different decouplers, but nothing seems to work- I can\u0027t hold it from the rear because you can\u0027t attach anything to aerospikes, and there don\u0027t seem to be any radial decouplers out there that let go of both sides when fired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, does anyone have any tricks out there for this kind of thing? I can think of a few solutions already, but they all involve bigger planes or less efficient engines and I just want to know if anyone has a better system of getting aerospike-powered planes to Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-03T02:08:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2013 02:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by GreeningGalaxy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T03:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that there is no radial equivalent of the decouplers that attach to both sides.
