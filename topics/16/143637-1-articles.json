Awhile back I recall reading about issues with wheels that caused undesirable results with most aircraft. Specifically, that the wheels bounced and broke often. I read a few threads regarding adjusting the suspension and dampening but I\u0027m still experiencing this issue. My question really is: Are there still problems with wheels or is it more likely I am doing something wrong? Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T19:30:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople are still reporting problems, while others including myself havent had much of an issue being able to takeoff and landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry not to use the smallest wheel size, and use a larger wheel than you initially think you may need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bandus","CreatedById":8358,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T19:50:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for taking time to answer! Unfortunately,\u00A0I am playing in career mode so unfortunately a larger wheel isn\u0027t a viable option at the moment for me. Do you know if Squad is looking into making wheels (even the small ones) a bit more robust? With my first plane in career mode, once physics engage it almost immediately starts \u0022bouncing\u0022 on the runway. As it gets up to about 70 m/s I can actually see the wheels coming through the texture of the landing gear cover for the rear gear and eventually it just wobbles until a wing strike occurs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T22:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom your description, you are using the LY01 gear. To fix a wobbling problem like that, you want to move the landing gear outward farther from the fuselage. Generally the wisest choice is to mount them on the wings, halfway out to the tip. The LY01 gear are fairly delicate, and you will probably want to land at a significantly lower speed than 70 m/s. Probably something more like 40 would be good. And make sure you float down like a feather until the wheels touch -- don\u0027t force the landing to happen early.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bandus","CreatedById":8358,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T23:27:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022external\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0I tried this and it helped a bit.
