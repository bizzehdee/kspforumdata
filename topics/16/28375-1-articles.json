It can stay pointed toward your orbit normal or anti-normal. It will spin, but stay pointed in those two directions. If you\u0027re on a 0 degree inclination, orbiting the equator, you can face directly north or south on the horizon of your nav ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe this is a result of KSP\u0027s simplistic physics model during time warp. Anything above 1x and your ship rotation is halted. So, you could always face Kerbin in 1x with just the right rotational speed, but as soon as you time warp, it stops.

The only solar panels to be found were dynasat, and CardboardboxProcessor\u0027s KOCMOC mods, Mechanical Mouse\u0027s Kethane was all the rage, it used electricity, and his satellite pack had the first Ion engines.
