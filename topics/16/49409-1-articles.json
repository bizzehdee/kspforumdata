I had to revert several times as I\u0027ve had stages, or portions of, stick to the current stage. Whether it\u0027s a failure of the decoupler or something not working right about the solid rocket boosters. I\u0027ve had instances where I had the large boosters, that I though were attached to a central one by decouplers, stay attached while the decouplers go flying off by themselves. I\u0027ve had to stack decouplers in the VAB, just to fight off the affinity these booster have just to stick to each other. I\u0027ve had launches ruined when one or two of the three small boosters stay attached. It seems to be a problem with both the side mounted decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T12:11:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you don\u0027t have part clipping enabled, that can sometimes cause the boosters to clip through the decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T12:14:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso make sure your boosters are connected to the decouplers and not the center stack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darkeldar","CreatedById":83293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T12:19:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I never enabled clipping, so where do I look to check.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T12:26:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eclipping isn\u0027t enabled by default, so if you didn\u0027t enable it it isn\u0027t.
