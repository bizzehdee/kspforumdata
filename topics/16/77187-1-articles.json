My standard Duna lander uses one of the shortest 2.5m tanks, so if I ran low, I\u0027d just add a bit of fuel using a rover-glider with a claw. You could also send an upgraded version of your existing lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oafman","CreatedById":110386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T15:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like 2 things are required; a lander/ascent vehicle with more dv, and a vehicle to return from orbit with more dv.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you able to rendezvous and dock ships in orbit? If yes, great. If not, it\u0027s probably time to learn!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause sending a ship which can land on Duna (close to your kerbals!) launch from the surface, reach Duna orbit, and then return to Kerbin is much harder than building a ship with a detachable lander, which can return to the mothership in Duna orbit, dock, transfer crew, ditch the lander and return home. (it\u0027s certainly possible to build a single ship to do it all, but is a much bigger engineering challenge, and may not be possible with the parts you have available). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could go for a design along the lines of the below image, which I recently sent to Duna. It had plenty of dv (way more than was necessary to get back into orbit), mainly because it had aerospikes, which are very efficient. If you have unlocked them, they\u0027re a good option for Duna. If not, there are alternatives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft was actually for 2 kerbals to return. But you could easily replace the materials bay with a MK1 lander can - it has plenty of dv \u0026amp; TWR to spare. Note that the extra fuel tanks on the sides detach half way to orbit, and of course the rover is left on the surface, so the ship has quite low mass by the time it is circularising its orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne issue you will have is getting the new lander close enough to your Kerbals. Jetpacks do work on Duna, but they won\u0027t get you too far. And walking kerbals for miles is a miserable experience, especially one at a time with 3 of them, so you want to land as close as possible. And trying to do that by eyeballing it is difficult, and takes practice. So I think your best solutions to this are (i) get Mechjeb to land it for you - it is very accurate, or (ii) take a rover, land manually, as close as you can, then drive to collect them and bring them back to the lander. The problem there is you\u0027ll need a bigger rover than I took, as mine had a capacity of only 1 kerbal. But it can be done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZegaaB7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZegaaB7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"butterknife","CreatedById":114777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T16:04:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve got aerospikes yet.
