It might be related, or it might just be my bad designing or piloting. The weird thing is that generally on test flights, it lands correctly the first time and then when I quickload it tumbles upon landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-24T17:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think if you manually set the friction of the front wheels to 0 in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, it will work much better.

The rear wheels will land first and friction will pull the nose down, but the front wheels are too high so it can pivot a lot before they touch the ground and will make them \u2018dig in\u2019 and flip the plane. The short distance between the wheels and short overall length make it easy to rotate on its pitch axis so you\u2019ll front flip very easily, the wheels are really close to the centre of mass which reduces stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo fix it, make the fuselage longer, move the rear wheels further back and keep the front and rear wheels as close to level as you can, or have the front wheels slightly lower. This will make the plane more stable on the ground and easier to land as the wheels are further from the centre of mass, although moving the rear wheels too far back will make it harder to pull up when taking off unless you use nose mounted fins or canards to lift the nose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u2019re also landing quite fast, it\u2019s entirely possible to get a much larger and heavier plane to stay in the air at under 40m/s. Cut the throttle and glide for as long as you can at an altitude of 5m or so until the plane runs out of lift and drops gently to the ground, then go easy on the brakes- set the front brakes low to avoid making the plane pivot forwards and crashing it\u2019s nose into the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
