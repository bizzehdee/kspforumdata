You make a burn somewhere and get an intersect node, you wait a bit and you are passing close by to the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You set the navball to target mode, you then burn \u003Cstrong\u003Eretrograde to target\u003C/strong\u003E, thats a purple icon...just incase you are burning on the green retrograde for this step. If you are doing this correctly then the speed displayed by your navball which is in target mode should decrease to more or less zero. If it falls, but then starts climbing again before hitting zero or close to it then you are definitely burning on the wrong indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be very clear, once you set a target in map view two purple icons appear on the navball, these are used for exactly this situation, one is target prograde, the other target retrograde. In general watch that target speed display, it should never rise while you perform this step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Once your relative velocity is more or less zero then the intersect marks on map view stop meaning very much, they just describe closest approach as the 2 ships drift slightly closer together and/or further apart. As long as your target speed is around zero then you will track the target and remain more or less where you are relative to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. There are a few edge cases to watch for, attempting to intercept craft in very low orbits is dangerous, you might get your close approach of only 5km or whatever, but its 5km vertical, the target was at 72x72 and your approaching craft is gonna hit the atmosphere, this obviously wrecks everything and happens to me a lot. I prefer not to dock below 80km for this very reason, so that a sub-10km closest approach is always gonna be vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T00:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you are doing when you burn retrograde in target mode is more closely matching the two orbits. Once you have the relative speed at zero, or close to zero, if you are still some distance away from your target vessel you should then burn prograde towards your target, but not too fast or you will just fly past when you get even closer. In all likelihood this will indeed move your intersect point around your orbit, but it should make the intersect distance between your two craft a lot closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you get closer to your target you may find that the prograde marker is drifting away from your target marker, in which case you can just repeat the above process as required.

Intercept. This is the part where you use maneuver nodes to arrange for your ship and the target to be in the same place at the same time, or at least as close as possible. Careful fiddling with the maneuver node will generally get you an intercept within a kilometer or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Fine tuning the intercept. This involves making small burns as you approach the target, in the last few kilometers, so that your closest intercept is zeroed in to a few dozen meters (from the kilometer-or-so you got in step 1). This involves close observation of the navball and light touches on the throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Kill relative velocity to target, right when you\u0027re at your closest approach. Also a navball-and-throttle operation. You\u0027re now parked right next to the target, just a few meters away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Actually dock.
