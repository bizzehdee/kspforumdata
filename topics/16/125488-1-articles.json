I have built this plane in the SPH, with symmetry on at almost all times (except for tail and landing gear). If the tail looks offset, that would be because I have used the offset tool to try to correct the drift that happens almost all the time. It does not affect flight, but I want to publish this ship on the forums and I want the best performance possible out of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6KSjBjG.png\u0022 alt=\u00226KSjBjG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImages above,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill post another image soon, but the lift direction is not tilted (camera angle).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T02:19:06Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 02:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by X9Squared\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T03:46:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you attached the main gear to those swept wings, that\u0027s probably your problem.
