As for planning such a trajectory, that\u0027s a bit more difficult. I suspect that it\u0027s possible with 8K DV, but I don\u0027t know how feasible it would be to find a workable solution via trial and error. There should be a program floating around this forum that\u0027s capable of planning flyby maneuvers. I don\u0027t know if it can handle the weird case where your destination planet is also your planet of origin, but it\u0027s probably the closest to what you\u0027re looking for if you just want to go to Eve and back. The problem gets more complicated if you want to chain together multiple gravity assists, like NASA did with the Voyager missions, and I\u0027m not aware of any existing tools that\u0027ll do that for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-02T04:20:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it shouldn\u0027t be much in the way of gravity assists, as I just want to do a close pass by eve and then burn to intercept kerbin.
