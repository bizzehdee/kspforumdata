Immediately after leaving Kerbin SOI, I refined the approach and had encounters with both of them. When the alarm clock called me to the Moho SOI change, there was no such thing. I had to spend 800m/s to set up a new encounter. Then I checked with the Eve probe and found that it had lost its encounter as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis being Ion probes, I have lots of delta-V to spare. No harm done. But what happened? I did *NOT* fast-forward across any SOI change. To repeat, I set up the encounters while already outside of Kerbin SOI. Between then and now, the probes were on rails in the Suns\u0027 SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T22:56:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow deep were your encounters?

Since you already have KAC, I recommend setting up maneuver nodes part way through the transfer. That way, you can check on the transfer and make corrections early enough that they\u0027re cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T23:58:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Master Tao\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Master Tao\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow deep were your encounters?
