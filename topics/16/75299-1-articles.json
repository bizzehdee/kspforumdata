I hope the forums don\u0027t get angry at things like too much posting and such, this is a very difficult game lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo first of all....I landed on the MUN for the first time!!!!! Completely manual and without any mods, very happy about this and proud. But anyway I decided to take the chance and recover my samples in the hope that I could make it back to Kerbin, unfortunately I only had 1 and a half tiny tanks of fuel to exit the MUN. after many many failed attempts I managed to break out of its gravitation at about 770m/s which I account as being quite lucky as that is as I ran out of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I\u0027m caught up in Kerbins orbit and my plan is to do a rescue mission of some sort to recover the \u002B- 200 research points on this out of fuel vessel. I really need the points see. Luckily it is caught in a flat orbit over Kerbin space station, I have no idea how but it\u0027s good news. So how would I go about doing this? The stranded ship/vessel has no docking port is there any other way I can save this excursion as I am very proud of it? The research is....almost sentimental of value too haha\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T14:25:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse the claw to grab it and drag it back home.

If your orbiting the Mun equatorial in the same direction the Mun orbits Kerbin (i.e. you took off at a 90 degree incline from pretty much anywhere but the polar regions), wait till your craft is directly between the Mun and kerbin and burn prograde, this will take your perigee perfectly into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere with a very short burn. If your orbiting the opposite direction, start with your craft on the far side and it will do the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-17T14:41:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2014 02:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T14:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the vessel is in orbit near a station, I would ditch the vessel (sorry), and have your kerbonaut EVA, gather all the science from the vessel, then spacewalk over to your station.
