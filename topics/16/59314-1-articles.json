That dictates what separation phasing orbits will be established at and, therefore, whether they will be needed at all. At Kerbin, for instance, it wants to create a phasing orbit 100km above/below my space-station. Placing the station at 250km means there is sufficient room below it that MechJab can go directly from 100km launch-orbit to rendezvous, including a margin for deformed orbits and to keep the numbers round ^^. By extension, any required outer phasing/rendevous orbit would be at 400km and my \u0027traffic control\u0027 rules make 550km for parking orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the Mun MechJeb wants a 30km separation and launch-orbit would be 10km so traffic control says: inner phasing/rendezvous 10km, station 45km, outer phasing/rendezvous 80km, parking 115km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally; I tend to design landers to go \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eonly\u003C/span\u003E from low-orbit (10km for mun) to the surface and back.
