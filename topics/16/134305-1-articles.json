Depending on your craft and the exact profile flown, it may even have higher total heat flux, too. It is extremely unsafe and should never be attempted unless flying spaceplanes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason for this lies in vertical speed. On any given orbit, your vertical speed is lowest at the apses (where it flips direction), and highest halfways between them (where it flips its rate of change).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, inside the atmosphere, there exist different regimes; some of which you want to be in, and some of which you don\u0027t want to be in. The upper reaches are an area you don\u0027t want to be in, because you experience a lot of heat load for pretty much no drag. Unscientifically speaking, heat scales linearly, drag scales exponentially with atmospheric density at constant speed. So as you go down further, your heat load only increases moderately, but your drag goes up sharply and slows you down much better. Therefore, the middle reaches of the atmosphere is where you really want to be at. Then, in the lower reaches, atmospheric density inreases so quickly that, even though the increasing drag still works in your favor, your craft\u0027s heat tolerances are simply exceeded. Therefore you don\u0027t want to be in the lower reaches either until you have slowed down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing back to vertical speed: imagine your apoapsis is at 70km, and you start with a timid periapsis of 40km. Where is your vertical speed the slowest? At your apses. So you immediately enter the upper reaches of the atmosphere at a very low vertical speed, which means you spend a really long time where you don\u0027t want to be. You rack up more and more heat without really slowing down for a while. When you approach your periapsis, you still aren\u0027t in the middle reaches, yet your vertical speed is already decreasing again. This goes until a point where you have, through sheer persistence, lost enough speed for things to flip. Suddenly, your periapsis starts falling away from you, while you\u0027re still 40 kilometers up and getting cooked hot for only moderate drag. Your vertical speed starts increasing, and you start losing altitude rapidly just as you enter the middle reaches where you really want to be. But you drop through them like a rock. Along comes the 20 kilometer mark where the atmospheric density really starts ramping up, and this is where you G-meter and your heating spikes up as your craft rams into the wall of air. Here, your forward motion is finally arrested properly, but potentially at the cost of sensitive parts that may not be able to bear that short, high peak. And unfortunately, you are now on a fairly steep trajectory downwards, because your vertical speed was allowed to climb so much beforehand. It may be okay if you have a lightweight craft, and are coming down over the ocean; but something heavier, or something approaching over land (especially the highlands) will simply not have the time to slow down enough for safe main chute deployment. So you better brought drogues - which, of course, are not available until a fair ways into the tech tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if you started from a 100km periapsis, going towards a 25-30km periapsis? The highest vertical speed is halfway between the apses. That\u0027s where the upper reaches of the atmosphere are. You blitz through there, because you don\u0027t want to be there; they don\u0027t help you. Then, as you enter the middle of the atmosphere, with you periapsis somewhere around 25km and slowly sinking, you start leveling off naturally. You level off in a regime where there is ample drag, yet not enough heat to overwhelm your craft\u0027s tolerances. Pulling nice and steady, moderate G\u0027s, you slow down precisely in sync with your sink rate, and make a gentle and safe arc towards the surface that lets even heavier craft get a chance to pop their chutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you are flying a spaceplane, you can do the super flat profile because the spaceplane generates lift and can manually arrest its vertical speed in the middle reaches. In a capsule or similar non-lifting reentry vehicle, you need to rely on orbital mechanics to arrest your vertical speed for you so you have time to slow down. To do so, you need to go in steep enough to make things work. Thankfully, capsules generally have the benefit of ablative heat shields, and do not need to fear sustained heat loads (which sometimes kill spaceplanes that try to soak too much for too long).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a 100km ap, 25km pe reentry does not allow the craft to slow down in time to open its chutes even over the ocean, however, then the craft has too high a ballistic coefficient (it is too aerodynamic for its weight), and it needs to either be fitted with airbrakes and/or drogue chutes, or redesigned entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-16T15:18:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2016 03:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HorusKol","CreatedById":117326,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T23:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222459275\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134305\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458101159\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156531\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FullMetalMachinist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, FullMetalMachinist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222459275\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134305\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458101159\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156531\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FullMetalMachinist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, FullMetalMachinist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis first album is a fairly \u0027normal\u0027 early career tourism craft. \u00A0While it needs a little help keeping the right orientation during parts of reentry, it\u0027s pretty straightforward. \u00A0Note in the 4th and 5th pics how I\u0027m using body lift to slow down my vertical decent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022#\u0022 rel=\u0022external\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EReveal hidden contents\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/thnT9/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are just some of the \u0022general rules of thumb\u0022 for reentering crafts.
