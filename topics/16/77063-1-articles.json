Those need to follow the same rules they follow for engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretend your converter is an engine. Do you have any fuel tanks hooked up so it could run? It doesn\u0027t look like it though ships as complex as yours are hard to figure out sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConverters fill fuel tanks in the same way that engines drain them, including backwards through yellow fuel lines. Build a ship with fuel tanks connected DIRECTLY (and not radially!) to the converter and those tanks will fill. Connect others with yellow fuel lines with the arrows pointing towards the converter and those will fill as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same restrictions do not exist for rcs or any other resource.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T12:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe converter\u0027s weird in that way ... it \u0022consumes\u0022 negative fuel.
