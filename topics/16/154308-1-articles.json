usually do it basically the same\u00A0way, but with one change \u00A0Once I hit the periapsis of my Hohmann transfer from Kerbin (which is hopefully\u00A0tangent with Moho\u0027s orbit), I do a retrograde burn so that the next time I get back to the same spot, Moho is there also. \u00A0The amount of this burn depends on where Moho is relative to my ship at its periapsis, of course. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has the advantage of shortening the duration substantially, since you only have to make one more trip around the sun and you apoapsis will be closer than Kerbin (meaning that trip will go faster). \u00A0It also reduces the amount of burn you have to do when you actually capture around Moho, which is particularly nice if you have a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E ion or nuclear rig. \u00A0The disadvantage is that, by doing this retrograde burn in deep space, you lose the Oberth advantage of

your orbit in between the two burn phases. \u00A0This add complexity but saves a little delta-v, and also breaks the ejection process into more\u00A0manageable chunks if you have lower \u003Cabbr

are my suggestions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Ions are perfectly acceptable for capture burns, but don\u0027t use them for ejection from kerbin, accuracy on\u00A0ejection\u00A0burn is essential when trying to capture at Moho, and trying to eject with a\u00A0 .1TWR can result in hundreds of m/s of mid course correction and added capture burn time.\u00A0 Not, on ejection from kerbin, put a 500ms burn 2 orbits\u00A0before your ideal transfer window to increase ejection accuracy by reducing the magnitude of the final ejection burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuilding on \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022

minutes you\u0027re getting a lot of inefficiencies on the outer portions of your burn. One method I\u0027ve used is to do \u0022periapsis kick\u0022 burns on several orbits in a row. Each one raises my apo and gives me more velocity on my subsequent orbit. Let\u0027s say you have a 12 minute burn. Do two 4 minute burns on your first two orbits, on the third orbit complete the ejection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt takes a bit more work to do this, because after each burn you have to create another maneuver node. Also, you have to plan a bit so that your final burn occurs at the right time, but I\u0027ve found I save a lot of fuel doing it this way - as much as 25%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-06T19:37:04Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2017 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Tyko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-06T20:00:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy \u0022planning\u0022 for a periapsis kick consists of setting up the full burn for the transfer, then reducing it to maybe 420-430 m/s prograde and moving it 3 orbits back in time.\u00A0 You end up coming out of that burn with an orbital period of about 90 minutes, very close to 3 times the previous period.\u00A0 Note that you\u0027ll want some sort of node editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-06T22:14:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222912825\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154308\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483732848\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022102688\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryxal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Kryxal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy \u0022planning\u0022 for a periapsis kick consists of setting up the full burn for the transfer, then reducing it to maybe 420-430 m/s prograde and moving it 3 orbits back in time.\u00A0 You end up coming out of that burn with an orbital period of about 90 minutes, very close to 3 times the previous period.\u00A0 Note that you\u0027ll want some sort of node editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat\u0027s a great technique.
