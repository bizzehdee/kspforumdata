That\u0027s bad; it means a high relative velocity, since your ship and the planet are going in different directions, which is a big deal at interplanetary speeds.

Most likely delta-v map uses \u0022ideal\u0022 delta-v, based on assumpltion that you will wait till best transfer window, which means that your orbit will be quite similar to target\u0027s, which means you\u0027re heading almost same direction at almost same speed (in space scale, you know), so you won\u0027t need much \u0022braking\u0022 to lose excess kinetic energy and remain in target\u0027s are of influence, i.e. in orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Like said in previous post, you can use only transfer planner if you feel like having enough time (well, it\u0027s worth doing several times on your own at least to get the idea of how it works, which will make things much easier in future) or you may use corresponding mods. MechJeb, for example, has interplanetary transfer planner with graphical interface, which will allow you to see when it\u0027s best transfer window, how much time you need to wait for it and how much time flight itself will take (it\u0027s important, because waiting time\u002Btransfer time is generally your mission\u0027s time, sometimes it\u0027s possible to spend 500-1000 more delta-v and greatly reduce this time). Even if you don\u0027t want to use this mod, it\u0027s useful to try at least in order to see how optimal and bad transfer orbit will look like and how much delta-v you\u0027ll need to spend to circularize in target\u0027s orbit in both cases. Then you\u0027ll be much closer to doing this stuff intuitively, even without using planning tools (not so precise and efficient, but c\u0027mon, at least it\u0027s fast in real-time terms).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizbanger","CreatedById":141991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T05:17:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is I used Kerbal alarm clock to work out the right transfer window for Dres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I must have stuffed something up during the transfer and ended up coming in too fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any best practice type of steps you guys follow to make sure the orbits are similar?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T05:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222336738\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128613\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451107052\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022141991\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fizbanger\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Fizbanger said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is I used Kerbal alarm clock to work out the right transfer window for Dres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I must have stuffed something up during the transfer and ended up coming in too fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any best practice type of steps you guys follow to make sure the orbits are similar?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust eyeball the geometry.\u00A0 A \u0022wrong\u0022 orbit is immediately obvious to the eye if you know what to look for:\u00A0 The right transfer orbit from Kerbin to Dres will be an ellipse whose periapsis is right at Kerbin\u0027s orbit and whose apoapsis is right at Dres\u0027 orbit.\u00A0 It doesn\u0027t cross either orbit, it just \u0022kisses\u0022 each one tangentially.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecrosses\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E either orbit-- that is, if the periapsis is significantly inside Kerbin\u0027s orbit, or the apoapsis is significantly outside Dres\u0027 orbit-- then it\u0027s wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that doing a transfer burn is not simply a matter of launching at the right time;
