I used a lot to explore Jool\u0027s moon.\n\nI like space stations.\n\nTo explore the Mun I built a space station, not as big (only 2 orange tanks and 2 identical and very small landers)\n\nThe station always start spinning, very slowly. I have e very hard time docking to it. On my big space station I never experienced slow spin. I just oriented the nose and translate to the docking port. \n\nThere is no reason for the station to get any movement until docking contact. \n\nHave you experience that ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T12:41:50Z","Content":"Do you have SAS controls in the stations and is the SAS turned on? \n\nwith my stations i have always built SAS wheels into the design and enough electric charge for the dark side of a planet/mun so they can always run the reaction wheels because i always just assumed they would spin otherwise so idk if it is a new thing, but if it is it is a good feature to add, the SAS thing also makes docking wayyy easier, your craft will only push the other craft away it wont change its rotation if you bump into it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T12:43:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 12:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Roflcopterkklol**"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T13:05:51Z","Content":"SAS fixed the problem.

You may have an accidental [Kraken Drive](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kraken_Drive) on your hands. \n\nAs I understand it, somewhere on your station there is a part or strut that is clipping into something else, resulting in an unbalanced force that causes the station to wobble. I remember reading somewhere that holding such a ship steady with reaction wheels can convert this wobble into linear motion that can alter your orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T08:40:37Z","Content":"The only parts I clipped are lights which I always insert into their parent to make it look better. On the Laythe space station, I had dozens of clipped lights (in docked ships and in the station itself).\n\nEven if I deactivates reactions wheels (one large in the station, the return ship command pod and the 2 landing cans), the station is still spining.\n\nI think I even had an explosive wobbling (not sure)\n\nIn one of my rendez-vous I arrived at the station with my landing ship, and I saw the station near an explosive wobbling (for one I wasn\u0027t controling the station. It took some time to recognize the effect. I barely had time to save the game.\n\nBTW : Warping doesn\u0027t fix explosive wobbling but it stops spinning for a very short time.\n\nSave and reload fix explosive wobbling though."}]}
