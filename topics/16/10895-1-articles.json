I\\\u0027ve managed to make a plane that is capable of going roughly halfway around Kerbin, and I can probably make it go further by allowing spent engines to be jettisoned.\n\nIf your plane is slightly tail-heavy, it will tend to pitch up easily. Counteract this by adding engines situated above the wings, towards the middle of the plane.\n\nIf it\\\u0027s nose-heavy, it\\\u0027ll be difficult to pull up. Counteract this by placing engines under the wings.\n\nThat\\\u0027s how you re-balance with thrust -- engines above wings tend to make the thrust push it down a bit, whilst engines under the wings will make it want to go up instead. You can also re-balance with weight, by moving existing engines around or adding extra fuel tanks or structural pieces. If it\\\u0027s too heavy, add some more wings -- the Delta Wings are the best, and ALWAYS make sure you have enough control surfaces to ensure maneuverability.\n\nIf it\\\u0027s too hard to pitch up or down or perform a roll, add more horizontal control surfaces -- ailerons/elevators -- and if it\\\u0027s too hard to turn left/right (yaw), add vertical control surfaces (rudders)."},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T08:54:01Z","Content":"If you have canards get rid of them.

It turns beautifully this way (or at least, the plane I\\\u0027ve tried all this on works well this way). The plane I use is quite heavy, with three sets of wings AND a makeshift tailplane, and five engines. It still manages to land when all the fuel\\\u0027s run out and the engines are dead, though. Gracefully, to boot.\n\nI will make one more recommendation. SAS (Avionics Package) to keep you stable on the runway, turn it off to actually get in the air, then re-enable it to get you to a good \u0027safe\u0027 altitude, where there\\\u0027s room for mistakes. Keep SAS on constantly when in the upper atmosphere (rarefied air makes it harder to control the plane; you\\\u0027ll need a lot of assistance), and you can use it either on or off for landing; it seems to work pretty well both ways, though I prefer to land without it."},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T18:33:24Z","Content":"Vexx, can you post a craft file if it\\\u0027s stock?"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T22:05:26Z","Content":"Oh, I\\\u0027ll just post a link to the thread in the Spacecraft Exchange, since I already made a thread there.\n\nFlying instructions are included.\n\nHere:\n\n[http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12528.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12528.0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T11:19:30Z","Content":"I\\\u0027ve cfg-edited in a copy of the Basic Jet that has no thrust vectoring, and it does seem to improve the situation slightly.

How do I turn around -- back towards the runway -- without the plane rolling upside down and flipping out of control? I noticed other people having this problem.\n\nThere are two things you can do to turn your plane around. Use A if your plane is small and agile, and B if it\\\u0027s large and heavy.\n\nA. Flip your plane over on its back to change direction, then use Q or E to put it right-side-up again.\n\nB. Tilt to the left or right with Q or E, then make a lazy, gradual turn using S.\n\nAlso, there are a few of things you can do to improve general maneuverability:\n\n1. Turn precision controls on with capslock.\n\n2. Press ALT-S until the pitch gauge is on the second line up from the middle.\n\n3. Use an avionics module. It\\\u0027s like SAS for planes.\n\n4. Put wings behind the center of gravity.\n\n5. NEVER steer with A and D. Always roll 90 degrees in the direction you want to go, pull up with S to turn, then set yourself right-side-up again.\n\nHope this helped!"},{"CreatedByName":"Maizah","CreatedById":25601,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T15:26:22Z","Content":"it\\\u0027s also worth noting that planes dont like to turn if they\\\u0027re going real fast. anything 200m/s\u002B is unlikely to be willing to turn.\n\nflight is a lot more challenging than space travel ya know. the real problem with space travel, is simply getting out of the atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"DonGonzo","CreatedById":23313,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T21:04:42Z","Content":"1: Make sure you have adequate flight surfaces for control of all 3 axis.\n\n2: Make sure your have sufficient lift to hold the engines up so they don\\\u0027t fall through the vertical, causing nasty pitch changes\n\n3: Until you\\\u0027re sure how the airframe will perform while banking, avoid rolling past 45 degrees.\n\n4: Until you\\\u0027re sure how the airframe will perform while turning, avoid pitch input while rolling\n\n5: If the aircraft cannot get off the ground without running off the end of the runway first, it is too heavy or does not have sufficient flight control surfaces.\n\n5a: Obviously if once you have an airframe and you go about making it heavier with external stores etc. this rule does not apply.\n\n6: The keyboard is very unfriendly for flight, and joysticks cost less than keyboards\n\n7: Once airborne, test thy aircraft... how low and how slow can you fly it.\n\n8: When flying clean [no stores attached], without huge amounts of thrust the nose should tend to pitch right at the horizon, if it tends to pitch up even when trimmed the rear is too heavy and / or does not have enough lift.\n\n9: Make sure your joystick control for flight surfaces isn\\\u0027t at max sensitivity [mine are right around minimum], but make sure the throttle is very responsive... when you turn throttle all the way to low responsiveness, responsiveness get very sluggish making gliding difficult."},{"CreatedByName":"Monkthespy","CreatedById":7644,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T22:07:39Z","Content":"About the fly by wire thing at the SU-30.\n\nYou could use Mechjeb\\\u0027s killrot, but however, I\\\u0027m not sure if this is powerful enough for stability."}]}
