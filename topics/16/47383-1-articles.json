I\u0027ve been experimenting with this in game a bit too, but I\u0027m finding it difficult to find that window in the first place from which to fit a model. If I start burning before the window, my speed will drop to 0 then I have to shut down (or I start going up again) and then I have to burn again later to kill off the speed I gain from falling. Conversely if I burn to late my speed doesn\u0027t fall enough and a blow up on impact. Without a formula I\u0027ve been erring on the side of going early, but as I move on to progressively more difficult objects to land on (Tylo for instance) I\u0027m trying to conserve as much delta-v as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-11T03:17:31Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2013 03:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by staplic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blue","CreatedById":1917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T16:26:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETylo requires approximately 5km/s of delta-V if I recall correctly, for a landing and launch-to-orbit on its surface.

Burn retrograde at the periapsis at a proportionate throttle level so that your lateral velocity decreases to a controllable stable level in an appropriate time for the descent. (On the mun, this can mean getting it down to 50~20m/s before reaching 1000m from the surface. It varies widely, since on Gilly you can land with reckless abandon using exclusively RCS, and on Tylo you\u0027ll likely be burning at full throttle until the last 250m from surface contact.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. While decreasing your lateral velocity by controlling the throttle, control your vertical velocity by changing the angle of thrust (changing the angle of your rocket) up or down relative to the surface. (On the Mun, 30% throttle at a 5~8\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 upward angle from retrograde or thereabouts is enough to get a descent within a few minutes, descending at a velocityless than 100m/s vertically.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.
