I am really having a hard time trying to decide what to map where. My first attempt was more configured to control, but then I made my right analog stick just for camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I am having trouble getting a configuration that works well with Stage, Docking, EVA, and Rovers. Does anyone have a suggestion on how to configure this in a way where no critical reflex moves require the keyboard? I did a search, but it threw out \u0022PS3\u0022 and I really couldn\u0027t find what I was looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: After thinking about it more, I may just focus on EVA and Docking with the gamepad, because one size fits all might not work, and those are the more delicate situations. And they are similar in that I use translate controls mostly for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-07T03:05:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2014 03:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by jBeta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
