the planet is already rotating that way, so you can use it for free delta-V.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you want to go to the north pole, then launching east won\u0027t help you because your destination isn\u0027t in that direction.\u00A0 Similarly, if your destination planet is outside of your origin\u0027s orbital plane, then transferring within the origin\u0027s plane won\u0027t get you to your destination, because your pre-existing direction of travel doesn\u0027t go there.\u00A0 You can choose to transfer when you\u0027re at the ascending or descending node relative to the destination, but you might wait a century for a transfer window that aligns with the node--if there ever is one.\u00A0 You can go at the right window while staying in your orbital plane, but when you reach the destination\u0027s orbital distance at the correct time, you\u0027ll find that the destination planet is somewhere to your celestial north or south (i.e., \u0027above\u0027 or \u0027below\u0027 you relative to your plane, for whatever value those words have in space).\u00A0 In order to actually intercept your destination planet in a good transfer window, you\u0027ll need to leave your orbital plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally, the best place to do that is as far from the line of nodes as you can get on that leg of the orbit--i.e., the mid-course correction--but if we\u0027ve already established that this is a ballistic, or single-burn transfer, then that\u0027s not an option.\u00A0 The only burn that you can use to make the encounter is the initial interplanetary ejection burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn most cases, you can add a bit of inclination (and possibly a bit of radial, too) to get a satisfactory encounter, but in extreme cases, the only solution to encounter a planet that will be a few billion kilometres to your origin plane\u0027s celestial north when you get there is one that arrives from the celestial north itself.\u00A0 This doesn\u0027t necessarily mean a totally polar orbit, but a burn that has you ejecting at 30\u00B0 inclination when you don\u0027t need to do so is going to be inefficient no matter how you arrange it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224168773\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022209458\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221661819859\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00221837\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frostiken\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/29/2022 at 8:37 PM, Frostiken said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if Mechjeb can\u0027t account for mid-course plane changes, what can?

it\u0027s just extremely inefficient to use a one-burn transfer when you\u0027re on that sliver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of the issue is that there\u0027s no single solution to the problem of how to get from your origin to your destination.\u00A0 There are literally infinite paths to take.\u00A0 The porkchop plot exists as a tool to help you choose from a group of solutions that offer some value or benefit over other possible choices, but it\u0027s important to remember that choices in that range\u00A0 are all trade-offs of one another.\u00A0 One set of solutions covers fast transfers, which take less time in transit.\u00A0 Another might cover immediate transfers, which let you leave right away.\u00A0 Another set covers efficient transfers in terms of delta-V expended.\u00A0 There are valid use cases for all of these:\u00A0 a fast transfer may be the best option when you have a life support mod to consider.\u00A0 An immediate transfer may be needed for a rescue mission.\u00A0 An efficient transfer is good for when you have limited delta-V or want to save it for some other part of the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, when setting up the plot, there are still a few assumptions that the planner has to make.\u00A0 One of them is whether you want a ballistic transfer (that is, one burn at the beginning that gets the encounter), but sometimes that\u0027s not the best one in terms of your delta-V budget.\u00A0 Sometimes, a mid-course correction is cheaper, for the same reason that sometimes, it makes more sense to raise your apoapsis before making a drastic inclination change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me try to illustrate the problem a little better.\u00A0 I don\u0027t have a good Paint drawing, so I\u0027ll just have to be descriptive.\u00A0 When you\u0027re transferring to another planet, you have to account for the fact that you\u0027re already in motion, co-orbiting with the planet about the star.\u00A0 Generally speaking, efficient transfers are those that take advantage of your existing motion, because if you can use existing motion to your advantage, then you can subtract the cost of that existing motion, since you start with it and don\u0027t need to expend propellant to get it.\u00A0 This the exact same idea as to why it\u0027s more efficient to launch to the east; the planet is already rotating that way, so you can use it for free delta-V.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you want to go to the north pole, then launching east won\u0027t help you because your destination isn\u0027t in that direction.\u00A0 Similarly, if your destination planet is outside of your origin\u0027s orbital plane, then transferring within the origin\u0027s plane won\u0027t get you to your destination, because your pre-existing direction of travel doesn\u0027t go there.\u00A0 You can choose to transfer when you\u0027re at the ascending or descending node relative to the destination, but you might wait a century for a transfer window that aligns with the node--if there ever is one.\u00A0 You can go at the right window while staying in your orbital plane, but when you reach the destination\u0027s orbital distance at the correct time, you\u0027ll find that the destination planet is somewhere to your celestial north or south (i.e., \u0027above\u0027 or \u0027below\u0027 you relative to your plane, for whatever value those words have in space).\u00A0 In order to actually intercept your destination planet in a good transfer window, you\u0027ll need to leave your orbital plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally, the best place to do that is as far from the line of nodes as you can get on that leg of the orbit--i.e., the mid-course correction--but if we\u0027ve already established that this is a ballistic, or single-burn transfer, then that\u0027s not an option.\u00A0 The only burn that you can use to make the encounter is the initial interplanetary ejection burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn most cases, you can add a bit of inclination (and possibly a bit of radial, too) to get a satisfactory encounter, but in extreme cases, the only solution to encounter a planet that will be a few billion kilometres to your origin plane\u0027s celestial north when you get there is one that arrives from the celestial north itself.\u00A0 This doesn\u0027t necessarily mean a totally polar orbit, but a burn that has you ejecting at 30\u00B0 inclination when you don\u0027t need to do so is going to be inefficient no matter how you arrange it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, you can, to begin.\u00A0 If you want the very best in terms of efficiency, then I\u0027d suggest using a transfer calculator (e.g. the Alex Moon planner or the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/84005-112x-transfer-window-planner-v1800-april-11/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Emod that incorporates it into the game\u003C/a\u003E) and using the information from it to set up the burn.\u00A0 But that\u0027s not strictly necessary; you can get very good corrections on your own.\u00A0 The best place for a mid-course correction is a point 90\u00B0 of true anomaly away from your encounter with the destination--or, rather, I should say from the point where you would\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to encounter your destination, since you won\u0027t encounter it without the correction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should also point out that the ballistic transfer is sometimes the better choice.\u00A0 MechJeb\u0027s advanced transfer calculator is very good.\u00A0 It automatically offers the best available ballistic choice, and that is usually negligibly different from the one with a course correction.\u00A0 \u00A0Let\u0027s not forget that that sliver of inefficiency doesn\u0027t matter much unless the transfer that you want falls on it.\u00A0 If--\u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E--it does, then sometimes, you\u0027re close enough in inclination that a mid-course correction is more expensive than simply working with the inclination difference ... or, of course, picking a different transfer.\u00A0 The option that works best also depends a lot on your mission:\u00A0 even when the delta-V difference is slight, different trajectory choices will affect your orbital insertion when you arrive at your destination, and possibly cost you more in terms of local manoeuvres if you\u0027re looking for a specific inclination on arrival.\u00A0 An example of where this is relevant would be when you\u0027re transferring to Jool:\u00A0 arriving in an inclined orbit over Jool in itself doesn\u0027t mean much, but if you want to visit the moons, then you\u0027ll probably want to arrive with an inclination close to matching theirs.\u00A0 Of course, changing your arrival characteristics so that you get favourable encounters requires a mid-course correction anyway, so you may be stuck with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to try your hand at figuring this for yourself, then I strongly recommend perusing\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/interpl.htm#transfer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERocket and Space Technology\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and getting a feel for some of the mathematical relationships involved here.\u00A0 The link will send you partway down the page;
