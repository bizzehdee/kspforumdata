But if you\u0027re not, we have to wait for the orbit of the return vessel to be close to overfly the landing position and launch at the same inclination it has (because Mun rotates, slowly, it may take time for the orbit to move in relation to the landing position so to align).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce on an orbit coplanar with the return vessel, you can use normal rendez-vous procedure (hope you already practiced that, if not do with the training scenario before).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T19:24:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA test launch is often useful to help with launch timing. As diomedea said, hopefully everything is equatorial here -- otherwise it gets more complicated. But just do a quicksave, and then wait until your return vessel is exactly overhead. Then launch and circularize, and then see how far ahead of you the return vessel got while you were ascending. Then subtract in your head, reload the quicksave, and launch that much \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the return vessel flies over your head. One thing that can help, is that when you are most of the way to orbit, you can turn on targeting mode and consider the whole last half of your ascent to be a high-speed docking maneuver. As diomedea said, hopefully you have practiced a fair bit on the details of finalizing a docking, and basic docking maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T19:46:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t feel like doing all that, just launch a bit late and go for an orbit at 10 km, then plan a transfer to intercept the ship.\u00A0 As long as you launch into the same plane, it\u0027s not really tricky, just set up a maneuver to reach the other orbit and slide it along or add orbits to execution time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DD_bwest","CreatedById":164906,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T19:47:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat i do to launch to the right inclination is to launch with the orbit marker directly above and the command \u00A0vessel ahead of your position, boost up briefly \u00A0then aim directly at the target with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E for a sec, this will put your prograde practically \u00A0in the same inclination, then just follow that intol orbit. \u00A0put yourself in a 30km or a 40km orbit and match inclinations at the nearest an/dn to put it spot on. \u00A0 now follow normal rendezvous steps to wait until its coming up behind, create a node to lower your pe to intercept, and slide its timing until you get a good one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nunless your playing to max realism and dont want your kerbals waiting around orbit for a while, exact positioning isnt all that important, just matching inclination.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-13T19:51:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2017 07:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by DD_bwest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
