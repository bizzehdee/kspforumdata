I still would have assumed it would drag the nose down, however, not up. Down would have made sense to me. It\u0027s also odd that it only triggers at some point after I perform the gravity turn.

You can see on the navball your direction your vessel is facing upwards in relation to your prograde vector. So if indeed the top is taking more drag as Kasuha suggest, you would expect it to pitch upwards as this point. This is simply because at this point its already tilted upward in relation to it\u0027s direction of travel. At some moment this unbalanced drag force, due to increasing speed, rises above the strenght of the control and the ship starts to turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome other tips: your ascent speed is pretty low after dropping the boosters. Due to this your spend a lot of time fighting gravity which costs a lot of fuel. I think you\u0027ll find if you leave out one fuel tank from the the first stage (so four fuel cans instead of five) you maintain a better acceleration, and you\u0027ll actually end up with more fuel remaining in orbit; it\u0027s more efficient to ascent with a speed closer to terminal velocity. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Basic_maneuvers\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T12:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere, schematic description why your ship pitches upwards.

Drag depends on mass of the part and its drag coefficient. A rocket made of all parts with the same drag coefficient can fly through atmosphere in any orientation without any forces trying to rotate it. Put a part with lower drag on it and it will rotate the ship to stay in the front.

Just a different phrasing but between that and a good night\u0027s sleep it makes perfect sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to make sure I grok this, the problem is two fold. First, my choice of SRBs as injection boosters for the interplanetary ships is causing me to have significant drag across the top when I get into a gravity fight while still in atmosphere and I\u0027m cruising more sideways than upwards. Secondly, when the mass in the lower portion lowers to some critical point, it no longer has the weight on one end to counterbalance the drag on the other. This sideways drag is what is causing the issue, where a straight up/down doesn\u0027t tackle the parts in the same manner, allowing for SAS to keep control of it for the minor differences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy George, I think he\u0027s got it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T18:06:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WanderingKid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WanderingKid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESecondly, when the mass in the lower portion lowers to some critical point, it no longer has the weight on one end to counterbalance the drag on the other. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, mass of that part plays no role in that.
