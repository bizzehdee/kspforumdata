Your prograde marker will move along the direction you\u0027Re going at, but the maneuver marker will move along the navball so that all the thrust you apply to your ship goes directly to accomplishing the maneuver you set earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T11:54:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESplit the burn time to get as close to the path you are aiming for as possible. If a three minute burn, start 1 minute and 32 seconds before the mark, extra 2 seconds to get the engine to full power and shut down when the burn time approaches zero Ignore the marker as it will drift off at the end of the burn. Do plan on a short correction burn halfway to the destination. Since it will usually be a couple of seconds, you don\u0027t need to apply full power. Just watch your path change and delta v marker hitting x when you have reached the desired results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T14:52:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA maneuver node has two parts, one that indicates the delta-v you requested (X m/s at Y heading) and the second part that provides a projected route following that burn. While the second part is calculated from the first, the first doesn\u0027t know that the second exists. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game calculates a projected orbit based on an instantaneous burn at the node. For short burns t = 0 is a good approximation, but for longer burns things like the direction of gravity and your heading will change markedly before you finish. The game doesn\u0027t compensate for that in any way. Instead it tells you to keep burning to finish the original [X,Y] burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difficulty is that you, the pilot, don\u0027t want an [X,Y] burn. You want to get to destination Z, which is described by the second part of the maneuver node, but that spot on the navball just doesn\u0027t care. You have to watch your map and try to compensate so that your actual final orbit matches the projected orbit. It should be close, but the longer your burn is, the worse the agreement between projection and reality will be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor escape orbits it can be fairly easy, particularly for fast escapes (non-Hohmann transfers or going to Eeloo or Moho, for instance.) You just look along the two orbital paths and pitch up or down (toward the zenith or nadir, I mean, I\u0027m assuming the ship to be upright and facing in the direction it\u0027s heading) to make them match. In most cases you\u0027ll wind up pitching up above the maneuver node toward the end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you wait and do all of the adjustments later? Of course. But if you\u0027re going to be burning, you might as well burn in the right direction in the first place to save some fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
