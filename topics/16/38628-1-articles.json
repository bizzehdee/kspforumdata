Instead, bring your apoapsis up to the appropriate height, and adjust your periapsis so that you\u0027ll be in position next time you reach apoapsis. How do you do this? By tracing the period of your orbit: the time from apoapsis back to apoapsis. Then just factor in how far away your target location is when you reach AP, adjust for the 6-hour sidereal day of Kerbin, and you\u0027ll come up with an ideal period for your orbit so you\u0027ll get back to AP with your target location below. Once you get back to that point, then circularize. For example, say KSC is about 1/3rd of the planet to the east of where you are when you get up to geosynchronous, and you want to be right over it.
