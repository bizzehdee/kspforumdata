Basically, it\u0027s an unusually shaped SRB that you typically put on top of your capsule. It is probably easiest to make an action group to decouple it and let it fall back to Kerbin when you\u0027re out of the atmosphere but haven\u0027t started your orbit insertion burn yet, although you might as well do that manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T21:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdding a decoupler is indeed the correct approach. Make sure the arrow points to the capsule so you don\u0027t get left lugging the decoupler around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that if you\u0027re tipping your capsule with a docking port you don\u0027t need a separate decoupler. You can just right-click the docking point and choose to decouple whatever is attached to it. Or use an action group to simultaneously decouple node and fire the LES so it blasts itself clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to combine the LES with a nose-mounted parachute, have a look in the craft construction techniques thread in the Spacecraft Exchange Forum, there are some techniques there you can probably adapt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kbkline","CreatedById":94494,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T11:53:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the answers.

Especially since I often have my escape tower attached on top of a docking port instead of rigged to a proper decoupler. So what I do is set up AG0 or AG9 to activate the escape tower and undock it from the port at the same time once I\u0027m far enough along in my orbital insertion that I figure I don\u0027t need it any more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
