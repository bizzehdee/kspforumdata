Juno-powered plane can fly easily up to ~10 km, then a Terrier can pop it up high enough to snag the target zone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the Terrier because it\u0027s small and lightweight.\u00A0 Not only does that make it not bog the airplane down, but also, engines are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eheavy\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and having a big heavy engine at the back end of an aircraft moves the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E backwards and can reduce airplane stability.\u00A0 The Terrier, being nicely lightweight for an engine, doesn\u0027t cause so much of a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(\u0022But Terriers are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Evacuum\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E engines!\u0022, I hear you cry.\u00A0 Yes, but do bear in mind that at a mere 10 km altitude, you\u0027re already almost 90% of the way to a vacuum, and the Terrier gets very close to its excellent vacuum Isp.\u00A0 You don\u0027t have to get very high above sea level for Terriers to become effective.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the main thing to maintain aero stability is to design it so that shifting fuel loads don\u0027t muck around much with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 There are two main things I do to cope with this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emake sure the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E isn\u0027t way in the back of the plane\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 I do this by putting only one relatively lightweight engine in the back (a Terrier), and then mounting my Juno engines \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eamidships\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E rather than at the back end of the plane-- e.g. a pair of Junos, one on either side of the fuselage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emount the fuel tanks symmetrically fore/aft around the middle of the plane\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 If your fuel tanks are mostly-fore or mostly-aft of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, then your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E will shift dramatically as they drain, which can kill your stability.\u00A0 Whereas if the fuel tanks are in the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emiddle\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, then the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t move much as they drain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do this by putting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks (for the jet engines) amidships, with the jet engines themselves.\u00A0 Then a small (say, 2-ton) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tank for the Terrier is also amidships.\u00A0 If I need to make the airplane longer (to provide better lever arm for control surfaces, to adjust \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E position, etc.), the Structural Fuselage part works great-- it provides a lot of length without adding significant drag, and is very lightweight.\u00A0 I may not need to add a Structural Fuselage, depending on the overall airplane design; when I do add one, most commonly I put it at the back end, right in front of the Terrier, so that it moves the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA final note, if all else fails:\u00A0 If you\u0027ve got a plane that works fine to accomplish the objective, and its \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eonly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E problem is \u0022hard to land afterwards because it became unstable\u0022 ... well, you could always \u0022cheat\u0022 and just tack on a radial parachute or two for landing it.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022
