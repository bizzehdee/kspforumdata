You have to find your stall speed and land just a hair faster than that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to find out what your landing speed is, is to take your take off speed, the speed at which your plane actually leaves the ground and subtract 5m/s. This is a pretty safe number to start at and work your way down from there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally aerodynamic craft, that dont produce much drag have problems with stopping, so this is why I use flaps and airbrakes as much as possible for my \u0022slick\u0022 craft. You may also have a REALLY high power to weight ratio making it difficult to find that engine balance point for landing. I had this problem with one of my Mach 6 aircraft, it would not slow down quickly for landing, so I would start my landing approach over the ocean to the west of KSC and idle the engine until I hit the mountain range west of KSC, then go one tick on the throttle till final approach. Then I would glide it in from there. And even then it\u0027s landing speed was around 200m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T21:28:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do flare before landing, but it\u0027s not much use when I can\u0027t seem to come in below 130 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T21:32:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dizzle\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dizzle\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI do flare before landing, but it\u0027s not much use when I can\u0027t seem to come in below 130 m/s.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI land at about that speed on some of my craft.

You are complaining that your plane stalls before you can get it slow enough, which would be alleviated by bigger wings.
