If you\u0027re not fast enough, profitable enough, or aggressive enough, a competitor may achieve something before you, and you miss that opportunity permanently. In those games, efficiency matters.

Despite the sense of progression that Career and Science modes provide, KSP is first and foremost a sandbox game. Within your Career file, you are given a ton of wiggle room to take different approaches to running your space program; you really aren\u0027t forced to take a specific path towards your goals, whatever they might be. You very well could make that 100k by doing ten missions, or do it all in one; it\u0027s the player\u0027s choice. Player choice is what actually gives things in KSP value - funds, resources, and even Kerbals\u0027 lives are meaningless unless the player gives them value. In general, someone playing a game is putting in their time and expecting to get entertainment out. Time vs entertainment is really the core element of all value in KSP; funds have value because they represent time spent (grinding for funds) and can be used to produce entertainment (fun missions). If you can get funds in an enjoyable way, they lose value because you have to spend less time doing not-fun stuff to get them. If each of those ten missions is suitably entertaining, or each goes ten times as fast as the one big one (including development costs), then it\u0027s worthwhile to do all ten instead. But, in general, doing things at larger profit margins for bigger rewards produces more funds for a given time investment, and are often rewarding and entertaining as well - big missions are cool. Efficiency matters only to the extent that it remains more time effective than less efficient methods, taking into consideration that funds and infrastructure (like mining colonies) cost time as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, exactly what activities are \u0022fun\u0022 versus \u0022not fun\u0022 in KSP is extremely subjective, and different players\u0027 approaches to the same problem will vary widely. Some people (myself included) enjoy the engineering and design elements of building an SSTO. Efficiency may be less of a requirement (as in, the space program will fail without it) and more of a goal to strive for. That\u0027s why there are a number of challenges featuring SSTOs; some people just enjoy making the most efficient/simple/small/easy to use spacecraft they can, regardless of how practical or necessary they are for career mode. \u003Cstrong\u003EThere doesn\u0027t need to be an in-game justification for everything players do; what matters are out-of-game factors, such as time use and enjoyment of the game.\u003C/strong\u003E It\u0027s up to each player to decide how they want to tackle each mission, and how they want to devote their in-game and out-of-game resources towards finding a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T17:32:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Goomblah, you talk sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T10:29:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Goomblah\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Goomblah\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003Cstrong\u003EThere doesn\u0027t need to be an in-game justification for everything players do; what matters are out-of-game factors, such as time use and enjoyment of the game.\u003C/strong\u003E It\u0027s up to each player to decide how they want to tackle each mission...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell put \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only valid answer for \u0027why\u0027 you take any particular route in KSP is \u0027because you want to\u0027.
