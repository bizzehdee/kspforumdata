The problem is, every time I try to burn (luckily I have a quicksave), I end up with an Ike encounter and I can\u0027t see where it\u0027s going. By the time I can see the trajectory again, it\u0027s almost as low as Eve. Is there a way for it to display past the Ike encounter? Even worse, I\u0027m worried that at a speed capable of returning to Kerbin I\u0027d end up impacting with Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-21T22:36:06Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2013 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dizzle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enigma179","CreatedById":67703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T22:26:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can change the conics so you can predict past the Ike encounter.
