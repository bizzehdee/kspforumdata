What I do to adjust the inclination of my orbit to match another is the following (it would work just as well to get perpendicular to it):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Get into orbit around the object - a large, relatively circular orbit (more a not highly elliptical orbit, really.) The reason for this is that the smaller your velocity is, the less delta-v you need to change the orientation. A larger orbit also gives better visual cues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Go to map view and focus on the object I\u0027m orbiting. Bring up my navball in map view (number pad . key)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Rotate the map until the orbit of the object (the Mun in your example) and my ship\u0027s orbit both appear to be lines. Here\u0027s a picture of what I mean. I didn\u0027t have any ships up at the time, so this is the orbits of the Mun and Minmus aligned correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s19.postimage.org/8rw45mcc3/orbits.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022orbits.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you reach this point you\u0027re on something called an orbital node, a point on the line where the two orbit\u0027s planes intersect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Time warp until your ship lines up with the object you\u0027re orbiting. In my picture, that would be Kerbin, in your scenario, the Mun. There are two points on your orbit where this will happen, the one closer to apoapsis is preferable, because you\u0027ll be going more slowly, but either one works in the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Determine what compass direction you\u0027re heading. Align your ship prograde (pointing in the direction you\u0027re going) and read the direction from the navball. This is another reason that a relatively circular orbit is better, since reading the direction from the navball is quite difficult when the vertical velocity is a large component of your total velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Adjust your ship to face normal to it. Add or subtract 90 degrees from the navball direction and turn in that direction. Adding or subtracting will depend on which way you want to tilt your orbit relative to the orbit you\u0027re trying to achieve. If your orbit starts tipping the wrong way, just turn around and burn the other way instead. In your case, you don\u0027t care whether you\u0027re starting out headed south or north on your polar orbit, so it doesn\u0027t make any difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Burn until you achieve the orbit you want. Adjust the direction of your burn as you perform it so that it stays perpendicular (\u002B/- 90 degrees) to the direction of your travel. For example, if you started out headed at 90 degrees, and you burnt north (0 degrees) to change your orbit, the direction you\u0027re going would slowly begin to nudge northward. Your burn at 0 degrees would no longer actually be normal to the direction of travel and your orbit\u0027s properties other than inclination would start to change. Slowly changing your direction of travel further in the negative direction would fix this. Ideally, an inclination change won\u0027t change your speed at all, so that\u0027s a good indicator of how close to perpendicular you are. This will be important with a major directional change, as you\u0027re intending to do. Again supposing you started out at 90 degrees and burnt at 0 degrees to get into a polar orbit. By the time you finished you would be pointed due west (270 degrees) in order to remain perpendicular to your direction of travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Once you\u0027ve got your orbital inclination the way you want it, adjust the periapsis and apoapsis as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PigletPG\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PigletPG\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EStart your flight FROM a polar orbit.
