I tend to like to sorta RP my engineering choices, and because this was a nice NPP I intended to bring there I decided I would include a confinement (containments are for wussies) building and a control room.

(I seriously wonder why the KSP version of the NRC has not knocked on my door and asked me to stop my nuclear operations at this point) So I am asking this, is there any way to transfer the heat to the radiators I set up surrounding the confinement building, or do the radiators have to be touching the reactor unit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T08:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like you are using stock surface radiator panels. These are not suitable to cool this specific reactor, for multiple reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) The radiator panel must be attached to the heat source. Stock KSP offers two types of radiators; the flat surface panels you used here, and the deployable \u0022thermal control systems\u0022. Only the latter actively pull heat from hot parts all over the ship. The former simply have a high conduction factor, meaning heat flows easily into them from adjacent parts. Therefore they must be directly attached to whatever they are to cool, and they are not directly attached in your construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) A part\u0027s ability to radiate heat is proportional to its own temperature (exponentially so). A part\u0027s ability to transfer heat by conduction is also proportional to its own temperature, and that of the other part(s) it interacts with. This means that the radiator will need to be quite hot to work properly, but in addition, the source part (the reactor) needs to be even hotter so that there can still be a significant heat flow towards the radiator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the reactor is, by its very nature, heavily shielded and insulated, and doesn\u0027t conduct well to neighboring parts regardless of the temperature differential. Also, doesn\u0027t like to get hot - it in fact has fairly stringent cooling requirements. If it exceeds its nominal temperature (around 800 to 850 K, should be given in the part stats/description), it will start to lose power output. If you go too high over the nominal temperature, there will not be any power output left at all. And if you go even higher, the core will start to melt down, causing increasing permanent damage until the reactor is ultimately destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore you \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E use the deployable \u0022thermal control system\u0022 type stock radiators, or a comparable solution from another mod, in order to be able to actively draw heat from the reactor. They don\u0027t have to be attached directly to the reactor, just to the same vessel - so you could still build your own \u0022confinement chamber\u0022 and have maybe an attached \u0022cooling tower\u0022 which carries the radiators.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-19T08:28:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2015 08:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"QuesoExplosivo","CreatedById":102949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T12:41:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.)

Standard radiators only radiate heat from the parts they are directly attached to. They might disperse some heat that convects over into them from adjacent parts, but that is quite inefficient. The thermal control systems, in addition to being deployable radiator panels, come with a set of internal heat convection pipes run throughout the craft, drawing heat from the hottest parts first and radiating them out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, build your containment chamber with the thermal control systems instead of the radiators.
