Engines have two values for this, one at sea level and one in vacuum. High Isp is good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, you want to find an engine based on the thrust you need for a job, then find the engine with the best combination of Isp and mass for the role you want. Each of the engines has a role that it fills best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T30/LV-T45 - Engines for ascent/descent of medium sized rockets. Can be stacked to make a great heavy lifter, the 45 provides thrust vectoring in exchange for decreased thrust and increased mass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMainsail - Heavy lifter. A better option is the LV-T30/45 combination, stacked, but that can cause part count problems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoodle - Large lander engine. It\u0027s not really very good at that job; this is one that doesn\u0027t get used often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-909 - Good small lander engine. Sometimes an LV-N will be better. Also useful for spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-N - Excellent for transfer stages between planets or other large delta-v maneuvers. It can be a good lander engine when the lander also has significant maneuvering to do, but its length is problematic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMark 55 Radial - Liquid engine for increasing TWR. It\u0027s kind of awful compared to the other engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E24-77 - Can be used to increase TWR for landers or spaceplanes. It\u0027s not a great engine by itself, usually, but it\u0027s good when you\u0027ll need a burst of extra power for a short time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerospike - Good rocket for use near sea level. Practically speaking this could be stacked to make an efficient heavy lifting rocket for a first stage on Kerbin and is pretty standard for Eve ascent vehicles. It\u0027s also useful on spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-1 - Surprisingly effective engine for probe maneuvering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Epic DaVinci\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Epic DaVinci\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat would you say is too fast?

At sea level that\u0027s something like 110 m/s, and at 10km it\u0027s about 250 m/s.
