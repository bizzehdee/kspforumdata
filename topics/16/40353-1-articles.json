By switching over to docking mode, the controls by default affect translation instead of attitude. W/S keys become translational controls (forward and backward) and the A/D keys translate left and right.

Here\u0027s a good example of a very stable but simple rover:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/stable_rover.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022stable_rover.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E At a glance, it almost looks like a car that\u0027s had the frame removed. It also has a ton of free space on it, meaning if you use mods, you can load it up with stuff like the Kerbal Attachment System and make it a proper utility vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Of course, how you drive is also important. A stable rover is well and dandy, but if you handle it poorly, it won\u0027t do you a lick of good. Some of the most common driving problems and how to deal with them:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGoing airborne!\u003C/strong\u003E - Drive slower! There\u0027s a safe speed limit for most planets and moons, and it\u0027s slower than you might think. Make good use of your brakes to stay below that speed. For the Mun, it\u0027s between 10 and 15m/s, depending on rover stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFishtailing!\u003C/strong\u003E - In KSP, this tends to happen due to a mix of uneven terrain and imperfectly-set wheels. Try to make sure your wheels are always set evenly, and reduce your steering to only front-wheel or rear-wheel drive by disabling steering on the offending set. You can\u0027t prevent fishtailing completely, which leads us to...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERollover!\u003C/strong\u003E - Rollovers are easy to deal with, if you know how. You just have to be okay with stopping after and re-obtaining your bearings. Turn into the direction of the rollover (so if you\u0027re tilting left, turn left, for example). As you reach stable ground again with all four wheels, stop the turn and start hitting the brakes. \u003Cem\u003EDo not try to brake while you\u0027re in the midst of a rollover!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpinning through the air!\u003C/strong\u003E - Worst-case, you start a rollover just as you hit an edge, and you start spinning through the void. Turn SAS on and start turning against the spin, and try to keep your front wheels up as you do. You want to land roughly flat, but if you can\u0027t land flat, always land with your rear wheels more down than your front. Front-first will cause you to flip forward, and that\u0027s really not good (obviously).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So! That should hopefully help. Above all else, practice! Practice design, practice driving, practice safety maneuvers, just plain practice everything! You can\u0027t get better at responding to problems if you never run into them, so the occasional failure is a good thing. It\u0027ll make you a better rover driver, in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T17:46:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI spent some time, driving about ~20km on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn today.
