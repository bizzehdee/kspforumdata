You do that by highlighting the text you want to be the link, and then pressing the \u0027Link\u0027 button at the top of the text box. It\u0027s the one with the symbol of chain links. You are then asked to put in the address of the link you wish to create. In the case of a username pointing to the user\u0027s forum profile, mouse over an already existing link to that user profile elsewhere. Then right click and select \u0027Copy Link Location\u0027 or some similar option (depends on your web browser). When you are asked for the address of the link as you create it, you simply paste the value you just copied from elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just right-clicked on your name in the post I am answering, then copied the address using the method mentioned. I know that this points to your user profile.
