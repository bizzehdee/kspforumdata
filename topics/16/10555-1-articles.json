One is a direct descent; as soon as you enter Munar SOI you head for the surface. The other option is to slide into orbit after entering Munar SOI and then perform a de-orbit burn. Apparently the direct descent is the most fuel efficient (though not by much) but it\\\u0027s much harder.\n\nI usually use MechJeb these days for my landings (getting a bit lazy I know). What I used to do though is get in a low orbit around Mun, say 15-20km. I\\\u0027d then make a nice burn de-orbit burn so that my downrange distance to landing (or impact) would be about the same as my altitude (10-20km). Kind of like a right angled triangle.\n\nThen once I\\\u0027d descended below about 5-8km (or if my velocity exceeded 300m/s for a measure of control) I\\\u0027d make a steady burn with the intention of reducing my velocity to near zero at zero altitude (obviously it\\\u0027s not that easy manually so make adjustments as you go). Remember to keep your ship pointed towards *retrograde* so as to help cancel both horizontal and vertical velocity.\n\nMain thing I\\\u0027d say is to keep your ship stable and orientated with your horizontal velocity vector so your controls actually match up with what happens on screen and don\\\u0027t let your velocity get out of control. You obviously need to be able to decelerate enough for a soft landing. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-15T01:44:07Z","Content":"Very nice guide!

Wish there was something like that when I was starting out. Some of the statements about ascent in the first 10km are not quite right though. I don\\\u0027t want to toot my own horn but this post in the Goddard Challenge thread summarizes what Kosmo-not, Jebbe, Izkierka, others, and myself discovered about an efficient vertical ascent:\n\n[http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=7161.msg106460#msg106460](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=7161.msg106460#msg106460)\n\nFor this \u0027most efficient\u0027 ascent you need at least a TWR of 2, in fact the capability of 2.5-3 would be a sensible range. A TWR of 1.0-2.0 at launch makes for an excruciatingly slow and inefficient ascent (as I found out in my first attempts at rocket building).\n\nMechJeb implements this optimal ascent scheme for the vertical part of the ascent to orbit, but the post referenced\n\ncontains an ideal speed vs. altitude table for manual flight. If you follow it closely, you\\\u0027ll end up with about 50/50 \u0027gravity loss\u0027 vs. \u0027drag loss\u0027, but in practice 60/40 or 40/60 would not be too bad. (The efficiency curve has a broad maximum). If you have the choice, better to go up a little too fast than a little too slow. \n\nAnd from launch, it\\\u0027s best to get up to ~120 m/s as quickly as possible - by 1000 m altitude if you can - so use full thrust (\u002BSRBs), then throttle back if you have to. \n\nYou certainly would not want to include all this detail in the guide - perhaps mention that there is a \u0027compromise\u0027 speed between gravity and drag losses on ascent. But I\\\u0027ll leave the wordsmithing in your very capable hands."},{"CreatedByName":"Excalibur","CreatedById":12839,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T12:30:13Z","Content":"Thanks closette - I\\\u0027d missed that post on my travels through the forums!\n\nI must admit I did skim over a lot of the gory details, especially concerning the initial stage of ascent.

Primary concern is to get off the ground.\n\n- Aim for at least 200m/s at 10k (ideally ~250 260m/s, more than that is overkill). If less, back to the drawing board. \n\n- Velocity should not decrease {to much} each time when the next stage kicks in. If it does, back to the drawing board.\n\n- When exiting the atmosphere, velocity should be about 1200~1500m/s. There\\\u0027s usually enough time before reaching Ap to get near orbital velocity (~2250m/s).\n\nAbout TWR: \n\nwhat really matters is the average TWR of a stage over the time it\\\u0027s used. TWR of a stage improves as it burns fuel. So a 1st stage TWR of 1.5 at liftoff is likely double that or more by the time when it\\\u0027s almost out of fuel, and the average TWR for that stage is quite respectable in spite of the slow liftoff."},{"CreatedByName":"closette","CreatedById":11773,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T17:44:59Z","Content":"Fair points - perhaps 100 m/s minimum by 1000 m is more attainable. That\\\u0027s where SRBs come in - don\\\u0027t leave home without \\\u0027em! Lots of thrust for just long enough to get you up to speed, then away they go. The initial TWR for an SRB\u002Bradial decoupler is 5.9, which can only increase the overall launch TWR of your craft if it\\\u0027s carrying any payload at all (from an ASAS module to a Mun lander). \n\nI agree that by 10km one\\\u0027s vertical speed should be in the 200\\\u0027s (280 m/s is the optimum ascent speed at that altitude).\n\nWhen staging I often see a small dip in speed. It\\\u0027s hard for this not to happen if you\\\u0027re at 100% thrust, because just before you stage compared to just after, you have more engines with nearly-empty tanks and therefore a higher instantaneous TWR. Hard to quantify but a few m/s drop is OK.\n\nAs for optimum TWR, I looked back at some calculations I did (attached, cleaned up a bit from an earlier version I posted months ago) and the efficiency vs. TWR curve in that document shows a very broad maximum around the optimum value of 2. In fact any value of TWR from 1.5-3.0 gets you at least 90% of the maximum efficiency. \n\nI would want beginners to know that they should design for TWR of at least 1.5 at low altitude where the atmosphere is thickest.

Both very Kerbal but doesn\\\u0027t get you to the Mun.\n\nThe TWR sweetspot and thinking about design in terms of \\\u0027fuel tanks per engine\\\u0027, is not immediately obvious.\n\nIs my gut right when it tells me gravity drag is generally more of a problem for heavy payloads that require a large heavy rocket? \n\nI figure that a large craft with an average 1st stage TWR of ~2, making a little over 200m/s at 10k, would actually become less fuel efficient if you\\\u0027d add the fuel and engines (or boosters) needed to get it up to 100m/s at 1k.

If your rocket is under-powered, a shallow angle should help reduce gravity drag while the airspeed tends to stay below terminal velocity anyway. An over-powered rocket should use a steep angle, to get clear of the atmosphere early, so as to put that extra thrust to work asap.

My ad hoc reasoning is that \u0027gravity drag\u0027 is then dominating over \u0027air drag\u0027 so it\\\u0027s time to start building up orbital speed.\n\nBy 30km altitude the terminal velocity for most craft is equal to the orbital velocity, so I try to be pitched over by at least 45 degrees by then. But not too far over, or you\\\u0027ll have to push through many km of atmosphere before getting out!\n\nI used to be fussy about steering the craft exactly to align the thrust and velocity exactly during the gravity turn, but I learned from MechJeb that \u0027steering losses\u0027 are generally small compared to gravity and drag losses. It\\\u0027s even possible that such a pure gravity turn is NOT the optimal ascent profile for some rockets.\n\nBut these are details that should probably not appear in a beginners\\\u0027 tutorial - better that they be discovered by practice and patience using a given launch vehicle.

If the rocket is more of a giant space station carrying behemoth, pitching over earlier (~5k) and taking a smoother trajectory is better, just because it becomes easier to control.\n\nI tend to pitch over between 5 and 10k, depending on the rocket and I try to smoothly pitch until I\\\u0027m matching the orbital prograde marker at ~60k.
