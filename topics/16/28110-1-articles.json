From an established orbit (usually 100 K) I create a node. Use the sliders to create a path (orbit) that intersects the Mun near or on top of my landing target. I then burn accordingly. Once I start getting a good visual on my target craft I start killing my horizontal velocity while watching my altitude. I try and end up as vertical as I can and about 1k out from my target under 1000m in altitude. It\u0027s then a balancing act between descent engine and RCS thrusters to get me where I want to go. Takes practice. Can\u0027t tell you how many missions I had to abort. Make sure you have enough fuel.
