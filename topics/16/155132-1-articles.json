I just finished assembling my first Duna ship in science mode and am having a bit of trouble. The ship is below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fcvkAfJ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fcvkAfJ.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a simple stock ship with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E added. There is the large Duna burn stage at the bottom, with an orbit insertion/maneuvering stage above it (orange tanks). The two landers will drop down to Ike and Duna respectively, and once I am done gathering science I will have it all transferred to the storage module below the command pod, which will detach from the maneuvering stage and head back to kerbin with the tug at the end. However, despite trying to stabalize the vertical fuel pods on the maneuvering stage with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E struts, every time I accelerate they seem to break off.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UIriC40.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UIriC40.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody have any ideas on how to prevent this? I do have a port on the front of the tug, so I could send up more struts for Bill to place on the tanks. The struts fixed the initial problem, which was the tanks would wobble and snap off. I think the mission would still work if I just dropped the tanks altogether, but after spending the time to get them up to the ship I would like to keep them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T20:19:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor some reason \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks seems to be very weak for holding onto heavy things.\u00A0 If your design was flipped over, where the light part was on the outside, you\u0027d be in a better position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know a\u00A0few possible ways to deal with it, but I wouldn\u0027t call any of them great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne is to\u00A0strut the orange tanks to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks.\u00A0 That will help with the snap off they\u0027re incurring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, accelerate at say 1/5 to 1/4 the burn rate until those orange tanks are empty and the mass is less.\u00A0 Annoying, but the lack of g-force should help keep them attached.\u00A0 You will probably want to experiment to find out where your limit is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T21:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou also try a \u0027side saddle\u0027 mount kinda like I used on my Jool-5:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot270.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1065.photobucket.com/albums/u384/DerekL1963/Jool%205/screenshot270.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLook at the drive units, you could mount your tanks \u0027flipped\u0027 (on top of the sidesaddle tanks). \u00A0I\u0027d use Sr. ports though, rather than Jr.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe \u0027sidesaddles\u0027 are structurally attached, not docked. \u00A0Here\u0027s how the core looked at launch. \u00A0(See the thread linked in my .sig for more views, which may help you understand how it all fit together.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot58.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1065.photobucket.com/albums/u384/DerekL1963/Jool%205/screenshot58.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-17T21:09:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2017 09:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by DerekL1963\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"troherg","CreatedById":108945,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-18T05:16:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the responses! I did end up trying to redo the fuel pods, putting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E after the orange tank and then putting struts all over the place. It helped a bit, but I ended up just having to keep the throttle down to about 25% for the entire Duna burn. On a plus side, I put some poodle engines on the new pods to try to balance the forces on the pods when I accelerated, so once I dropped the transfer stage I was able to go full throttle in the Duna \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E!
