If you hover a cursor or reticle over each of those markers, more data\u00A0will appear -- the intercept distance, the relative speed at that moment, the time until your ship next reaches that point, and an additional marker that shows where the target vessel will be at that moment. You can also \u0022pin\u0022 that information open by clicking the correct button (depending on your preset, which you didn\u0027t say). It only gives readouts to a tenth of a kilometer, however. I have no idea how you got a number of 590 meters? I think you may be mistaken about that. In any case, every time you pass one of those markers, the information on it will update to be for the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enext\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0time you reach that point in your orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe time for your ship to get to the next intercept is always accurate, and the intercept distance will always be what the game says it is. In the debug menu, there may still be a setting you can click to use a \u0022legacy\u0022 intercept calculation method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get two ships to be at the same place\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eat the same time\u003C/em\u003E, you have to burn (usually prograde or retrograde) and watch one of those two intercept markers. They will show the intercept distance decreasing and decreasing to some minimum (depending on how accurate your orbit matching was), and then it will start increasing again. Stop burning then. If you want it closer, then adjust your orbit a bit until the two orbit lines touch. If you wait for one orbit, you can see how much the intercept distance changes, and then wait for the proper number of orbits until the intercept will be fairly close before you go adjusting things by doing burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want clearer information about where the other ship will be at that moment, sometimes you can change focus to\u00A0ship #2 and select ship #1 as the target. You\u0027ll get basically the same info, but from the other perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-04T05:50:12Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2018 05:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
