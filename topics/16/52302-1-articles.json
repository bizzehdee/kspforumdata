I have always had a dream of building a space station/fuel depot around every body in the Kerbol system. So I was thinking the sun might be a fun one to knock off, so does anyone know how low to the sun you can be before burning up/exploding/whatever?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T02:33:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the wiki, the closest one can get before the heat destroys your ship is about 1300m.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fatfluffycat","CreatedById":73913,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T02:48:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need like 25,000 delta V to get in a low solar orbit, maybe even more......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T03:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fatfluffycat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fatfluffycat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou need like 25,000 delta V to get in a low solar orbit, maybe even more......\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you have that much in the tank, it\u0027s a lot more fun to burn it prograde instead of retrograde at a Pe of 1301m and see how fast you\u0027re going when you pass Eeloo \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
