I\u0027m not sure if it will allow you to view all occupants in each case though. Worth checking out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smegghed","CreatedById":64312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T22:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried.

I could also try to build a \u0022set\u0022 with external seats I guess too.

I\u0027m also trying to view the kerbal\u0027s faces while in IVA mode. Is this possible yet? I\u0027ve seen video\u0027s where it\u0027s been done and I\u0027ve come across references to some number pad secret but I\u0027ve not found anything that works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
