Minus payload, divided by 36 tons (for jumbo tanks) you\u0027re looking at 3 jumbo tanks with mass leftover for two mainsails. So payload - decoupler - jumbo tank - mainsail - decoupler - jumbo tank x2 - mainsail. Alternatively a skipper on second stage, slightly better delta-V. Should just about get you to orbit.
