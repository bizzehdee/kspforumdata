Watching Scott Manley\u0027s videos using control panels and researching other things, I came up with the Phantom Glider:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c4e1oxY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c4e1oxY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll stock parts. After trying to make this thing take off from the runway and failing using various methods, I figured: \u0022What if I make a plane that carries this up to the atmosphere or orbit limit and release it there? It has an Ion drive, a tank and enough solar panels to power the whole system.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I made the Eventide Star FJ (Fighter Jet):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LsxHmV2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LsxHmV2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plane can easily climb up to the orbit and reach 1241 m/s.

Keep in mind that the glider has no batteries or landing gear at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone has an idea how I do this?

If you can, mount decouplers on the wingtips and then attach fuel tanks, engines, wheels, intakes and wings on decouplers, reenforce with struts and you can fly, and once up to altitude, just decouple Flypods (as I call them) and fly on. No vessel-switching or spin-outs as long as your glider thing is stable. But those 1x1 panels do not generate lift, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re looking for, use structural wings or canards.
