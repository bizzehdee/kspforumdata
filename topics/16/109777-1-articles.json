I\u0027ve tried with both the initial ones and the larger ones you get later in the tech tree that hold the boosters further out. Those are better but I do still sometimes have the same problem"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T07:35:04Z","Content":"Yes. You have to make sure that the booster is actually attached to the decoupler, not radially attached to the central stack.\n\nSince the boosters attach where the mouse pointer is (approximately the CoM), you need to make sure this is over the decoupler.\n\nEspecially with the longer SRBs, I always make sure to double check that there is the expected distance between the boosters and the stack.\n\nIf you want to position the boosters further up or down relative to the decoupler than you can when placing it (either for aesthetic reasons or to adjust behaviour on separation), you can shift them up or down with the offset gizmo."}]}
