Avionics doesn\u0027t have an integral term, so will allow your heading to drift off the setpoint. ASAS has an integral term, but is relative to a fixed point in space rather than a surface-relative heading, so you will inevitably pitch slowly up as you fly along. For autopilots, you can use MechJeb\u0027s Smart ASS to set a surface-relative heading, and I believe there is a similar function in the Lazor system but I\u0027m not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sephta","CreatedById":66104,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T07:38:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESetting the pitch only via the ASAS won\u0027t do the trick - as you go quite fast with a SSTO, your angle to the surface normal changes quite fast - you\u0027d have to adjust your pitch constantly, so you could easliy fly manual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb and Lazor Flight System adjust your Pitch quite well (Lazor has some better finetuning for planes built in though...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut: you always should build a plane you can fly manually: if the sutomatic system can\u0027t cope with a situation, you should be able to fly that thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T15:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmpYear and RemoteTech both use the same flight computer module that lets you do this.
