You can completely customize the difficulty of each individual contract type, and how they generate, as well as the rewards they offer.\n\nAs an example, if eccentric orbits on satellite contracts aren\u0027t your thing, you can either make the random orbits rounder, or disable them entirely and opt for more synchronous and stationary orbits.
