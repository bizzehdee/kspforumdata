I did another orbital mission with Bob, and then a suborbital mission with Valentina to complete some contracts. However, I have a little problem.. I landed on Kerbin near KSC, safe and sound. Then I wanted Valentina to do an EVA, and I sent her out. I didn\u0027t notice that the hatch was against the ground, though.. I recovered the craft, and no Valentina! I do not pick her up on the tracking station, and in the astronaut center it says \u0027missing in action: Valentina.\u0027 How do I get her back? Is she gone? Thanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T22:50:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 10:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainApollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T20:50:00Z","Content":"\u0027Missing in action\u0027 means she\u0027s dead.

When you recover the craft, the kerbal will end up MIA, instead of recovering with the craft (because, technically, the kerbal at that point isn\u0027t part of the same vessel).\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
