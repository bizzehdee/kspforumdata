I had managed to get a spaceplane to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E before but couldn\u0027t get it efficient enough to be usefull. Now I\u0027d made a similar version using the ramjet and aerospike instead of the terrier and panther, and lo and behold: it was horrible. Could not even get upto mach 2. With some debugging and\u00A0 using the aerodynamic forces overlay I found out that the aerospike engines where creating an absolutely devastating amount of drag at the speed of sound. Same exact plane can go mach 5\u002B and get into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003Elko\u003C/abbr\u003E by just replacing them with terrier engines, but the low thrust meant that it does cost most of my fuel. Looking online the aerospikes are loved by most people for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E use, so I am not sure what I am doing wrong.
