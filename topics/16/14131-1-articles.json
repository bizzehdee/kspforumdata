Has anyone calculated the kerbal --\u0026gt; Mun --\u0026gt; Minmus --\u0026gt; Kerbal free return trajectory? Or even just the Kerbal --\u0026gt; Mun --\u0026gt; Minmus trajectory to slingshot to Minmus from the mun? It should save fuel and would be fun, besides, and I know it *should* be possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suck at math however \u0026gt;\u0026lt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fowlplaychiken","CreatedById":30748,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-12T03:53:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I saw this on youtube:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/sVQOAz_CT4s?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems to also confirm the theory although I have found no threads or links on a how-to or the math involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life we have a system of inter-system \u0027highways\u0027 formed by overlapping SOI\\\u0027s.
