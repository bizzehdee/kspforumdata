On the vast majority of the manned rockets I\u0027ve ever designed, the final powered stage was more than able to fulfill basic abort requirements in most circumstances.

With one exception: SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your SRBs get loose, well, god help you. They are FAST when they\u0027re not attached to a rocket, far faster than any liquid based design I\u0027ve yet built, and have a nasty tendency to curve inwards, presumably due to the radial decoupler unbalancing them. On a number of my designs this has resulted in broken-loose SRBs having a fair chance of hitting the uppermost stage, or on a few occasions even the pod itself(I remember one that skimmed right along the outside of the pod, taking one of the radial parachutes off but the pod surviving. Interestingly that SRB started on the opposite side of the rocket from the parachute it destroyed.) That was the one thing I really found a LET to be uniquely useful for: mostly outrunning rogue SRBs (even with 16 sepatrons for a Mark 1-2 pod, it STILL couldn\u0027t quite outrun them if they went straightish!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost every launch failure I ever had after cutting the SRBs loose, decoupling the damaged sections was able to handle without a LET.
