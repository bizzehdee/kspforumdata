I built a lander with two of these babies on it to go to Mimnus to extract water from the ice there. Only problem, I click the \u0022Extract Water\u0022 button in the tweakables, and nothing seems to happen. The only thing I can think of is that it doesn\u0027t have enough power. Ive got 8 of those RTGs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve checked out the wiki and the forum page, but neither seems to provide much insight on the topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone out there know what I\u0027m doing wrong, and are there any resource extraction tutorials out there I can look at?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-18T15:25:58Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2014 03:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MerlinsMaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T13:16:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, you need more power, also extracting anything is not a fast process.
