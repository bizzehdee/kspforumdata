I already have a bus to go there with 3 parts: kerbin departure stage, interplanetary\u0026amp;Eve departure stage and crew vehicule. The thing that i still need to have is a lander. I did experiments with asparagus staging but i didn\u0027t even get to a Kerbin orbit. And my probes are telling me that Eve has even a highter gravity. So i\u0027m asking you as a community how have you done your manned Eve landing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T21:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t even attempted an Eve return mission, and I\u0027ve played around with SSTOs and visited most of the other planets. Taking off from Eve is extraordinarily hard; you\u0027ll need at least 10 000 m/s of delta-v in order to achieve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, a one-way mission is really easy, as Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere means parachutes are more effective than usual, so you can land large payloads with few parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to return from Eve, and with a 3-man capsule no less, you are going to need a lot of asparagus staging.

Coincidentally I had the same plan, though I didn\u0027t execute it with the same as his expediency:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA large mission rover, crew drop pod, and a return launcher. Only the return launcher needs to actually be able to leave, which makes it much simpler in terms of engineering, what to do with the other things. (Make them as big as you please, and just leave them on the surface when you\u0027re done with them.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso like Scott Manley, I made my return launcher mobile, on a set of 8 of the largest wheels, so that it could transport itself to a higher elevation and/or more stable ground once it had landed on Eve. The highest point on the planet is a mountain 7km high, which reduces the atmosphere enough that the Delta-V budget goes down to about 7.5km/s to reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScottyDoesKnow","CreatedById":70796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T06:33:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit: just realized this thread was resurrected from a year ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my Eve return mission: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/JEeCM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/JEeCM\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can currently return from any altitude on Eve with a 1.6t payload.
