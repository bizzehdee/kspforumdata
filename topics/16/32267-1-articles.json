Joking aside, I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s any special way to get into geostationary orbit in KSP. Googling that plus Earth have shown a very specific height you must reach to get to geostationary orbit(GSO) and you will automatically be in a GSO. My main question is why can\u0027t you have a GSO at \u003Cstrong\u003Eany\u003C/strong\u003E height, provided you\u0027ve increased your speed accordingly? \u003Cstrong\u003EAND\u003C/strong\u003E How can I reach a GSO in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus: What is the best way to modify an \u003Cstrong\u003Eexisting\u003C/strong\u003E orbit to get it into a GSO?

When you go up, your orbital speed decreases, and at some point it\u0027S slow enough to match the surface\u0027s. However, you can\u0027t just decide to have a given speed on the orbit of your choice. Your orbital speed is directly dependent of your orbital altitude. So if you were to burn until you were to negate your relative speed to the surface at a non GSO orbital height, your apoapsis would raise you would loose that orbit. The only way you could have a GSO at lower or higher altitudes would be to continuously burn towards or away from the planet to simulate a higher or lower gravitational force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second point, it depends. If you want a circular GSO, you are indeed going to want to zero your inclination before going to GSO altitude. Else, a GSO can be considered for any orbit that has the same period as the rotation of the parent body. So there\u0027s a lot of possibilities for that. That being said, you can simply burn prograde until your apoapsis reaches GSO altitude then circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, to obtain a circular orbit, you\u0027re going to have to take things slowly. Getting a near perfect circular orbit by hand can be a bit long. All you want to do is basically not overshoot your inserttion burn after liftoff, but you don\u0027t want to undershoot it too much neither. Then, if your periapsis is higher than the orbit you want, you will want to very gently burn retrograde at your apoapsis. If it moves, warp to your apoapsis and repeat. If it\u0027s lower, you will want to burn prograde. It works exactly the same way if you want to adjust your apoapsis, but you will want to burn at your periapsis then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to download MechJeb.

Of course the gravity direction varies as you go around - but all this does is make the calculation for v different - the principle remains the same. If v was greater the orbit would not be circular - it might even escape the gravity well altogether, if it was less then the same is true the orbit becomes elliptical, and if its small enough we hit the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z5ZVSDr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Z5ZVSDr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote my diagram is not great the red x should be vertically above the black one... just pretend it is. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kialar","CreatedById":60893,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T07:30:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this thread helps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/16653-Geostationary-Orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/16653-Geostationary-Orbit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t reach the wiki, but the Kerbin-Document there holds information about the geostationary orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T08:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe others have touched on most of the salient points.
