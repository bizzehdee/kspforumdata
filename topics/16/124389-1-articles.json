There\u0027s a lot that\u0027s going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with most problems with shuttles, the issue is the CoM changing while you\u0027re burning fuel. You can see the pitch indicator getting maxxed out in the lower left of the screen. Normally, your shuttle will nose up as the CoM shifts from the fuel tank toward the shuttle, but in your case the opposite is happening. I suspect the cause is that you\u0027re burning fuel from the top tank first. You can try to move fuel from the rear tank fowards. You can also try angling your engines less so that they have less tendency to pitch your shuttle up, though that could cause instability at other times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T19:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf what empiro said is indeed the cause then the tac fuel balancer will help you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samsunix","CreatedById":152573,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T22:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for answers.
