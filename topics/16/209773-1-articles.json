I know this because (in addition to remembering building and launching it, etc.) I have an alarm clock entry for a maneuver node for it, but \u0022switch to\u0022 doesn\u0027t do anything. Weird. Ok, go to the tracking station to look for it, and... I can\u0027t find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe KSP/The Kraken swallowed it for tribute, but barring that, is there log/debug data I can find that would let me know if I accidentally forgot to do something with it and it crashed into something or was otherwise destroyed? Maybe I set the alarm on a maneuver node that I didn\u0027t notice was on the far side of an encounter or something? No idea how far back this would have happened though, in game time, it was on a year\u002B run to Duna...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-17T08:05:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, there are logfiles.

There are some backup save files inside KSP/saves/(your save name)/backups that might be useful for this, copy and paste them into /(your save name) and they can be loaded in-game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-17T11:46:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it was a manned ship, you can look for the crew in the astronaut complex.
