So your ship needs less fuel overall if you use a small lander. Small reductions in weight at the top (upper stages) of your ship have a huge impact in how much thrust you need at the bottom (the first stage, at launch).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cost of adding a few docking collars and tiny engines is very minor compared to the cost you save by not needing extra giant boosters and fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cost savings really add up if you are planning multiple trips to the surface. Refueling a very small lander does not require very much fuel for each descent to the surface. Refueling a larger ship without a dedicated lander will require more fuel each time, because the extra weight requires more fuel to be consumed during each descent. Again, the more fuel you need to bring along for each descent the more your rocket will cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dzikakulka","CreatedById":116606,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T19:40:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes it is. It saves a lot of fuel - you probably can do an extra hop or two between biomes and still return than you would if moving that whole mass at once.
