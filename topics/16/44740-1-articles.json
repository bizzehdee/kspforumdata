It could be that you have set your trim to make your craft spin ( trim is set by holding alt, then using your WASD keys to change the little sliders on the bottom left of the screen).

Checked the trim, had not used it so didn\u0027t think of it, and it was maxed on all 3 axis. Thanks Trey. You\u0027re the Man. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Found the cause. I had assigned a joystick to some functions. It had miss-identified the joystick but the axis worked. That joystick was unplugged but the other one, that it used as identifier, was still plugged in. As it\u0027s a set of pedals the values were at min. and seemed to set trim on all axis when MechJeb was re-installed. Had to re-trim and then the trim was re-maxed. No mas joystick with KSP until the routines can tell one joystick from another. Not swapping multiple controllers every time I switch games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-02T19:52:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2013 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Steve-S\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECause found\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
