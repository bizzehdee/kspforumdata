I realized that my flight profile requires a lot of powered flight before clearing the atmosphere, and i believe i could make the whole thing work if i could minimize drag. i\u0027ve seen a youtube video of a similar design making it, but it goes faster in the atmosphere with less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E than my model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nunfortunately, the game gives no indication on how to accomplish that. Having a thing that looks aerodinamic and one that actually is aerodinamic according to this game\u0027s physical engine are two entirely different things. sure, i activated the aerodinamic overlay, but a few red arrows aren\u0027t all that clear. and most of them are inside the plane, not visible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntoday i had a moment of insight, where i decided to look at the game wikia, that reports drag factors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nexcept, i\u0027m seeing that every single wing has a drag coefficient of 0.2 and a lift generated of 1 (1 what?) every 100 kg of weight, every single fuel tank of 0.3-0.2 (whatever that means) regardless of size or inclination, the MK3 cargo bay has 0.2-0.3 (why the different order over the fuel tanks?), nose cones have 0.1 regardless of shape (i always thought that the more inclined nose cone had better aerodinamic to compensate extra weight...). basically, it\u0027s no use at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni know about not having open nodes. i reluctantly gave up on having a clamp-o-tron (except a shielded one, but now i\u0027m seeing the wiki reports the same drag values for it than it does for the standard version).

An additional hint for Eve is that anything on your craft that is not absolutely required for your return trip to kerbin should be discardable on Eve with decouplers. Which means, things like all but one of your solar panels. It\u0027s perhaps smarter to have one big and one tiny solar panel -- that makes it easier to discard the big one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as far as determining drag and minimizing it, you do it by building airplane after airplane on Kerbin with different parts, and test flying them, and then judging their top speed and acceleration capabilities.
