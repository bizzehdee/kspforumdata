When they are pitched up and down, they generate a force on the craft. Normally, this force would adjust the flight angle of a plane or rocket. However, when your craft is on the ground, the force does two things if applied properly: it pushes your craft into the ground (downforce) and it pushes your craft forwards.\n\nDownforce allows for faster acceleration (as your wheels are gripping the ground better) but it alone isn\u0027t capable of making your car go faster.\n\nThe forward force, however, propels your car to speeds that it otherwise could not reach. Using this force alone, I\u0027ve gotten a relatively normal car\u0027s speed past 40 m/s. \n\nSo, that\u0027s basically the reason. Hopefully I won\u0027t be ninja\u0027d by the time I post.\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T22:02:51Z","Content":"Are you sure that\u0027s not just the self-limit on the \u0022ruggedized\u0022 TR-2L wheels?"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T22:34:18Z","Content":"UpsilonAerospace nailed it.\n\nThe effect is called infinigliding.
