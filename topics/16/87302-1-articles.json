When you see the contract in the contract tab, press the [\u002B] next to notes. It should give you all the detail on the orbit. Remember though, most of the time, it accepts 5% deviation, so you shouldn\u0027t worry too much about getting it COMPLETELY perfect. It gives you the apoapsis, periapsis, longtitude of ascending nodes etc. etc., all the information you\u0027ll need on the orbit to get it exactly right. As long as you get the general shape, then it should be fairly easy to just raise the apoapsis and periapsis to where they should be according to the notes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso keep in mind that satellites (at least in my experience) require an antenna, and a goo container. If you get it in the orbit, and it has an antenna and a goo container, all that\u0027s left is to release the controls for 10 seconds (don\u0027t press ANYTHING for 10 seconds, and I think you may need SAS off as well) and the contract should complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have had a few instances where it didn\u0027t complete, or the orbit disappeared, sometimes restarting the game helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is based on my own experience, and I haven\u0027t done many fineprint satellite contracts, so some of this may be incorrect.

Try to get part of your orbit just touching the target orbit, preferably not crossing too steeply. Also check your inclination at the ascending or descending node, and do a maneuver there to zero your inclination. Not necessarily in that order. Finally, where the orbits touch, play with the maneuver node until the orbits match.

They are fairly forgiving. The general idea is to get your apoapsis and periapsis at the right distances, then you will see the AN and DN nodes pop up on the target orbit. Wherever these nodes cross your orbit, burn normal or anti-normal, which are the purple handles on maneuver nodes. This will adjust your relative inclination to match the target orbit. (It also might adjust your apoapsis and periapsis, so keep an eye on that.) It\u0027s very similar to rendezvousing with something. With this method you should be able to eyeball any orbit, even the trickiest Molniya orbit, without using any other tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy to see that you\u0027re enjoying the mod!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
