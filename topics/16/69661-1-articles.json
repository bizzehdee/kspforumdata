The same amount of fuel as the tug, but with the lander and lab\u0027s weight in fuel too, with a bit extra gives about 10km/s of dV). Send both off and when I get there, rendezvous, transfer fuel across (I could do it by docking of course but after so long spent in the ship, I like to give the little guys some time to stretch their legs) and I have enough fuel to get home. I usually don\u0027t bother getting a stable orbit around Kerbin - the lander has space for 3, but only one pilot.
