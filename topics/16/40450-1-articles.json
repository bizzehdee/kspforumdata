I sent that storage module and then prepared for re-entry and you know the arch keeps shrinking cause of the atmosphere and that makes me land near the sea or very far. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EHow To Land \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPRECISELY\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E on atmospheric planets?\u003C/span\u003E ( ~4km from target )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Answered! thanks for everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-01T14:05:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2013 02:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MrPopcup\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T10:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to accurately predict the effect of the atmosphere on where you\u0027ll end up.

There\u0027s at least one other thing out there that can provide the same Information Mechjeb does for most things, except that. So far as I know it\u0027s unique in the \u0027re-entry simulation\u0027 department.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to do it manually, the thing you have to remember is that the atmospheric drag is going to make you land short of (But in line with) where the initial orbital estimate shows it at. The thing to remember there is that the atmospheric density increases exponentially as you descend. Laythe\u0027s atmosphere is aproximately 80% as thick as Kerbin\u0027s at Sea Level, and has a lower scale height, so it\u0027s going to be even more bottom-loaded than Kerbin is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gravity is lower too, though, by a similar factor, and I\u0027m not sure what that\u0027s going to do to the final Descent speed. There\u0027ll be less drag, but also less gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the key thing is, you\u0027ll lose most of your speed when you hit the lower atmosphere, so for precision you want to avoid having a shallow trajectory coming in, or you\u0027ll lose so much speed to drag that you\u0027ll end up WAY short of where it originally said you\u0027d land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing in fairly steep might help. Less horizontal velocity to lose in the first place would reduce the deviation from the initial predictions. It also means a lot more G-Forces though, as you\u0027ll descend more quickly and thus the drag will ramp up faster without much change to lose speed to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not very good at targeting an area manually myself so...take my BSing with a big grain of salt. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synapse","CreatedById":72502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T10:41:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah you could cut all horizontal velocity in space and just drop down on your target...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T10:46:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that always helps me with manual landings putting them on point is starting from a very high orbit (the higher the better). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will use a lot of fuel, and I really mean a lot of fuel which isn\u0027t a problem for me since I over engineer everything anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext step is to get your orbits inclination to cross directly over your landing site. Once done select your target on the ground (assuming you have a craft/flag down there already)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow pick the spot directly over your site and plan a maneuver, you are basically going to be flipping your ship around and doing a breaking burn until you more or less come to a dead stop letting gravity bring you down.

I tend to be in the map view a lot while landing and using the navball to adjust my course until I\u0027m really close to the surface (and if all went well, the target).
