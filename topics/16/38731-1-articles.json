After you press escape, just return to the space center, don\u0027t go through the revert flight procedure. Then you can go in the tracking station, select your pod, and recover the crew from there. The tracking station is the only place you can recover crew from. The only way your save will be reverted to an earlier time is if you use the revert flight button.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0x7be","CreatedById":71709,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T11:04:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rockbloodystar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rockbloodystar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eso you have to lose some of your save time? as it reverts to my previous save?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, this does\u0027t revert anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
