I have 3 in my MK1-2 command pod, and I have Jeb in my dunan lander lifter waiting for the duna transfer window. My intention is to just send Jeb to duna, should I perhaps allow one of the kerbals to reenter kerbin with his EVA pack, or should I rescue him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I have since decided that I need more science. My rover has all the basic sci junior and goo, thermometer and barometer, same as my lander. problem is I only have a single pod with which to store the science gathered on my roving missions. as my rover itself will remain on the surface So I ask, how can I best retrieve science from Duna. and when I say retrieve, I mean for return to kerbin. My original thoughts where a fleet of unmanned mini rockets with enough DV to leave dunan sands and fly back to kerbin at every launch window \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso can anyone suggest a good way to get my landing sites within a few KM of each other as I\u0027m not looking forward to the drive lol \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"el_coyoto","CreatedById":49292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T10:39:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI quite like the idea of unmanned drones tugging back sweet, precious science to Kerbin while the Kerbals are \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ehaving fun\u003C/span\u003E exploring. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor precision landing, you have several options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELuck : using quicksave/quickload, rinse, repeat.

Also with regards to parachutes I have about a dozen radials and 3 XLs on my main lifter which weighs in at 15ton, and while my 10ton rover does have 4 xl chutes, it also has 4 rocket engines with about 1000dv and a kerbin TW of 1.5 and it flies like a dream so it can happily touch down unassisted if needs be\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plan is to land my unmanned mini lifters at strategic locations around duna, which I can travel to in my rover and store experiments from the surrounding area, the mini lifters then return to orbit and either, refuel ready for their return trips or redock with a hub attachement on my tug and get dragged back to kerbin. each mini lifter will have command pod a materials bay, a goo tank, a thermometer and a barometer, and enough fuel to reach orbit and rendezvous with the main ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T12:46:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI kind of hate to say this, but Duna only has one biome, so there\u0027s really no need to drive around to do science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you are roleplaying, in which case that does sound like an awesome mission profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FREEFALL1984","CreatedById":104993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T13:02:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah its more a personal mission of mine in preparation and experimentation for future game updates when hopefully duna Eve and the other planets will have biomes added, I did use it on minmus and the mun in a single mission (hence my big heavy rover has 1km/s dV) as an experiment and I managed to get a whole bunch of science in one fell swoop although rather than docking my mini lifters to the main ship I just sent them straight back to kerbin individually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T13:13:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy max-out-the-science-from-Minmus mission was a more standard affair.
