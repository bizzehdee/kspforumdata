Under Stock aero the fuselage doesn\u0027t create lift like in the real world so must be replaced with wings. Other tips I can add is keep your CoM close to your cargo bay so there wont be large changes when you unload heavy items. Lastly CoM should remain pretty constant between full tanks and empty tanks.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T14:31:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109712-Expedition-My-First-Shuttle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erecently accomplished this\u003C/a\u003E (NOTE: I did use FAR), I can tell you that you shouldn\u0027t need to worry about the tanks depleting evenly. If you build your plane first (with no fuel, as you expect to land), then mount the tanks in the correct position, it should move your center of mass forward from where the plane would have it by itself. So, there is no concern of your center of mass ever being behind center of lift as the tank depletes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust make sure when you place your tank, you have more of it ahead of the center of mass than behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding the plane part is a lot easier with shuttles because you only have to plan for a one way trip... down. So you can put the landing gear anywhere and you don\u0027t have to worry about picking up enough speed. The trick is definitely the rocket part... that and landing without engines.
