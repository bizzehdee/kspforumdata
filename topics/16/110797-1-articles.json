I can\u0027t answer it either because I don\u0027t know.\n\nHowever, why not test it? Take a satellite you don\u0027t care about or don\u0027t mind replacing, set it to debris, and see if it gets deleted? You could even back up your save first (just hit F5 to make a quicksave) so you could restore it and not even risk losing the satellite."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T20:37:26Z","Content":"There is a debris limit in the settings, when that limit is reached the oldest debris is deleted when a new one is created, so in time all\\* debris is replaced.\n\n\\*Unless set to unlimited debris."},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:27:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can set them all to the same category, then choose to hide anything of that category through the Tracking Station.\n\nDo this instead there will be less problems if something goes wrong.\n\nTo change their catagory right click on the command pod select rename, select your desired catagory done!\n\nThen click on the undesired catacory in the tracking station so you dont see it."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T03:18:26Z","Content":"yep; I generally set them all as \u0027stations\u0027, hide the stations from the map view, and then use the \u0027base\u0027 group for both stations and bases."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T03:51:38Z","Content":"By the way, I play RemoteTech and am in the regular habit of setting comm satellites to \u0022debris\u0022, never had a problem with it (they still communicate, never had a problem with them despawning).\n\nOf course, I don\u0027t have a very high-debris play style, so I don\u0027t think I ever approached the default 250 limit. In any case, if you\u0027re ever worried that it could be an issue, just give your satellites distinctive names before making them debris, and then every once in a while go to the tracking station and manually clean out a bunch of non-useful debris, to make sure you don\u0027t get close to the limit."}]}
