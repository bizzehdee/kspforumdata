I had a near circular orbit around the sun and set out to fall straight into it with no horizontal velocity. As soon as I got my zero, i quicksaved and went to time warp since I was pretty far out away from the sun and the game froze and my velocity changed to NaN m/s and I can\u0027t load the quicksave no matter what I do. I also can\u0027t load the flight from space center or start another flight and switch to it or else it freezes. Is my flight boned? I wanted to try and edit the velocity through the quicksave file to be like 10 or something so it\u0027d at least be moving a bit but I can\u0027t find what text to change to make that happen? Anyone know where that is? or something else to do?
