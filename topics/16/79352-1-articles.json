I am trying to determine my aircraft range but I have two different indications. MechJeb tells me I made 88.73 km from the Space Center, however KSP flight data gives me 58.55km ground covered. Thing is I flew straight the whole time, so all the distance covered is supposed to be while going away from KSC. Does this have to do anything with the planet\u0027s rotation? And which one should be trust more to get the real range?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.termivel.eu/upload/ksp_ground_covered.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp_ground_covered.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-24T19:48:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2014 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tsynique\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T18:22:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt could be that Mechjeb switched directions.
