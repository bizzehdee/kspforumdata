[Facepalm]\n\nFirst, without a SoI change, if you are willing to sacrifice some orbital altitude, the most efficient plane change is to calculate the direction of your velocity difference. For the simple problem of 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 plane change, you just want to be going the same velocity orthogonally. Just burn halfway between retrograde and normal until your plane is correct (don\u0027t change heading during burn). Pathagerous tells us that such a manuver costs a tad more than 1.4 times your current velocity in dV. You will lose a little altitude, but the linear approach is cheaper than the integral approach. Altitude loss is proportionate to TWR.\n\nIf your SoI has any nearby Muns-- I mean moons, you can perform cheaper plane changes with a gravity assist. 850 m/s for a Mun encounter 10-50 m/s for a mid course inclination change, a little more for corrections and aerobrake (above 50 km) and you can be in any Kerbin inclination you want for less than 1 k/s and a few Kerbin days!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T23:14:52Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T23:36:50Z","Content":"Pro tip : Just set the mun as target, its orbit is perfectly equatorial.
