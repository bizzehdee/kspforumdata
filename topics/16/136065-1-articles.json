It was all going fine until I decided to go mine on Bop to refill tanks before landing, and discovered that I couldn\u0027t exit the craft without dropping one of my (vital) stages. So if I\u0027d landed like that I would never have planted a flag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince Tylo and Kerbin are so very similar, except for all that \u0022slowing down in atmosphere\u0022 thing, I don\u0027t think there is much to do other than build what you know would get to orbit fine from Kerbin, then make sure it can actually land without falling apart, and include ISRU so that you can do it all again. After all - if it can take off then it certainly has a high enough TWR to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, I\u0027d guess, you\u0027d forgo refuelling and just use a Terrier\u002BT400 to get most of the way back up to orbit, with smallish asparagused boosters to get TWR high enough, and stick that on top of a much bigger, orbit-capable (therefore Tylo-landing-capable) rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-05T00:38:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding on Tylo costs 2270\u00A0m/s, and returning to low orbit costs 2270 more. \u00A0That gets you a total required\u00A0\u0394v of\u00A04540 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTesting it on Kerbin won\u0027t give any sort of accurate results if you are using any but a select few engines whose TWR and Isp don\u0027t vary significantly with pressure, and the atmospheric drag will also impose design constraints \u00A0(read: flips)\u00A0not present on Tylo. Therefore, I propose the following solution:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding on the Mun from low orbit costs 580 m/s. The return costs 580 more. The Mun\u0027s surface environment is a lot like Tylo\u0027s. If you want land on the Mun, return to orbit, and repeat this 3 more times, you would need a\u00A0\u0394v of 4640 m/s. That\u0027s enough to land on Tylo and return to orbit with some leeway for orbital maneuvers and the like. So if you think your ship can land on Tylo and return to orbit, you should transport\u00A0it to low Munar orbit and try\u00A0landing on the Mun four times in a row without refueling. If your lander has two or more stages and not all of them are designed to withstand contact with the surface, you can simply hover above the ground bringing your velocity to zero. It gives the same effect in terms of fuel consumed. Bring enough RCS propellant to rendezvous and dock with a vessel in LKO, which is a similar environment to Tylo\u0027s near space. A ship that can successfully complete those tasks should be able to do a landing and return to orbit on Tylo, provided it is transported there first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last tip: Make sure your landing legs can function under Kerbin\u0027s gravity, which is similar to Tylo\u0027s. All you have to do is set the lander on the launch pad and see what it does. You don\u0027t have to fire the engines up on Kerbin at all;\u00A0KER will tell you if the vacuum TWR is higher than 0.8 on Kerbin, or 1 on Tylo. As stated before, most engines suitable for a Tylo landing are basically worthless in Kerbin\u0027s thick atmosphere.
