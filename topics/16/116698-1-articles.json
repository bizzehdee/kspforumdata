I still use tri-docks even though I have the large docking port so that all my new ships will be compatible with my old ones. The station on the right is in fact two separate pieces tri-docked together, designed back when I had a 140t launch limit. The plus side, the connection is secure, the downside, the front end of your spaceships will look like electric razors.\n\n![FE6GEUal.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FE6GEUal.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T07:21:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 07:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edax**"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T21:41:07Z","Content":"I tried this precisely once.
