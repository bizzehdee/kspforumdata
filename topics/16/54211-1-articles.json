However, I am not great at making rockets that carry heavy payloads(especially since my rockets seem to lose control), and I don\u0027t know how to transport a Rover from Planet A to Planet B at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould anyone give me a tutorial on how to build rockets capable of transporting a Rover fitted for Minmus, a Kethane craft that can mine Kethane and convert it into Fuel all in one(optional), and a base for Minmus? (I don\u0027t want it to be modular, just to be able to house around 6 Kerbals, and have enough fuel to return to Kerbin if need be), or at least give me reference pictures of how such rockets should look like?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Turvok","CreatedById":60891,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T15:54:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the Rover part there is a thread with a few pictures ideas here. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/58909-Suggestions-for-a-good-Mun-payload-lander\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/58909-Suggestions-for-a-good-Mun-payload-lander\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like speed daemons picture the most about halfway down the page But Specialist290 has a couple nice posts as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T00:17:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne important tip: If you\u0027re building around an asymmetric payload (which rovers often tend to be, pseudo-skycrane or no), you\u0027ll want to make sure that the Center of Thrust is lined up with the Center of Mass. Otherwise, your rocket will tend to list to one side during burns, which can be especially inconvenient during your descent burn. Asymmetric thrust makes for \u0022fun\u0022 landings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
