It\u0027s more efficient because you don\u0027t need to make a plane change. There must be a phase angle between the nodes and Minmus that is the best time to burn, but I don\u0027t know it. Making a plane change in low Kerbin orbit is more expensive, but makes setting an intercept easier. In the middle is plotting two burns - an intercept then a mid-course plane change at the AN/DN. Trickier as you may have to fiddle both manoeuvre nodes to get an intercept in the first place, and.the first burn never quite goes to plan so you may need to re-plot the plane change.\n\nYour burn from Kerbin orbit should put your Kerbin apoapsis close to the distance that Minmus orbits (about 46-47Mm) - that way you\u0027ll be going very slowly when you reach Minmus.

So the best ways to save fuel are:\n\n1. Hit minmus at the ascending/descending node to save 200 or so dv in plane change. But hard to do because it reuires good timing.\n\n2. Fiddle with your transfer maneuvre so you accelerate as little as possible to do it. You\u0027ll probably have to pay back every dv you overshoot twice.\n\n3. Once on the way to a contact you can achieve massive changes in the position of your minmus orbit with very little dv. Accelerating or slowing down 2 dv can make the difference between near-equatorial and near-polar orbit or between orbiting minmus clockwise/counterclockwise. Changing This one is probably the best thing to do and mods like mechjeb\u0027s maneuvre node editor or precise maneuvres (i think it is called but i use mechjeb for that) will help with that because you can change the nodes by 0.1 and 0.01 increments easily. Set a maneuvre node 10 or 15 minutes on your path. Focus view on minmus and look where you\u0027ll pass. Adjust all 3 axis of the maneuvre until your pass happens in a inclination/altitude/direction that can easily be changes to your target orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T16:10:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rofltehcat**"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:10:54Z","Content":"Everyone else here has a lot more intelligence than I have to offer.

Burning at those nodes is pretty much the only place you\u0027ll be able to intercept Minmus, unless you either align your Kerbin orbit to Minmus or adjust your maneuver to take such inclinations into account.
