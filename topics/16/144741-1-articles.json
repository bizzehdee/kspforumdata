However, my plane keeps rolling to the left on the runway even before i start the engines. If i put wheels on, the plane just veers to the left and eventually crashes.Im using a very very similar design matt lowne uses on his long range \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E guide.Any solutions guys? I tried making the front gear higher than the rear ones, strutting the wings to improve stability. But it only improved the situation by a little.Any other solutions?

The trick is to take the wheel friction control off auto. Then, you set the friction of the nosewheel to 0.1 and the friction of the main landing gear to 1.5 or anything higher than what it currently is set to.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
