Thats why I get a lot of flaming effects while launching my rockets and going at relatively high speed between 35-50 km up, and at the same time the reentry almost doesn\u0027t decelerate the pod enough to open the chutes when falling down the last 10 km, making drogue chutes a very nice addition to any capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually like the change, I can easily adjust my launch profile to be a little steeper and I really think it makes drogue chutes more useful, which is a good thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe beginning of career is a bit dangerous though, drogue chutes are located deep down in the tech tree...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T22:18:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gasofidas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gasofidas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eand slightly lower drag when going very fast very low\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed it\u0027s much more difficult to slow down to a safe speed for parachutes, and I\u0027ve found myself opening them at \u0026lt;4km.
