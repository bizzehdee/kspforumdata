I was flying it on long flights around Kerbin where I set MechJeb to cruise at 4000 m altitude. I noticed something interesting, which is that the maximum cruise speed decreases as latitude increases. At the equator, it could cruise at 280 m/s but this speed\u00A0gradually drops to 250 m/s at\u00A060\u00B0 latitude, which is a difference of more than 10%. As I flew back towards the equator, it gradually increased back up to 280 m/s. Even more interestingly, the blade pitch at which this maximum cruise speed occurs decreases from 49\u00B0 at the equator to 46\u00B0 at\u00A060\u00B0 latitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe electric motors are always at constant (maximum) RPM and the mass of the aircraft is strictly constant as no fuel is involved at all. This is not an issue of bad controls as the plane is just not physically capable of cruising at\u00A0280 m/s at 60\u00B0 latitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the reason has to do with the temperature, pressure and density of air varying with latitude.
