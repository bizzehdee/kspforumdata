Lets say you want to set a marker at the north pole, or near an anomaly mapsat found to get you to the location without having to many corrections. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know kerbal engineer gives you your current latitude and longitude, and mechjeb landing function can tell you how far you are from the point, but nothing gives you a visual reticle\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sol_Rokks_Teddy","CreatedById":57145,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T13:33:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ein the newest release of mechjeb, there is a landing autopilot that lets you set a visual marker on the planet from the map view. The only other way to mark a location (that i know of) is to send a prob to the surface and use it as a reference.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T13:42:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb 2 will give you a marker on the map at your desired target and current projected impact point, as well as (I believe) a NavBall cue aimed at the target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T15:31:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot it. I stationed a probe near the KSC runway to assist my SSTO landing approaches which proves a big help!

I\u0027ve got one 100m off each end of the runway, and another 5km west of the runway, forming a line.
