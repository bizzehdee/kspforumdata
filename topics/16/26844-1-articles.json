One is an Attack 3, which is great, save that it lacks a rudder twist capability. To solve that, I use another stick for my left hand, a Logitech Wingman Extreme Digital, which has a twist-rudder. Rudder of course, is only significant in a/c that does have significant yaw, and of course, for ground steering. As to button mapping, I don\u0027t have a fixed assignment--usually I tend to reassign all buttons depending on the a/c I\u0027m flying. Three buttons do not change though--my trigger button is always GROUND BRAKES (I come from flight simming and that\u0027s like a default there), the thumb is for engine cutoff, and the 3rd button (top on the Attack 3) is for gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to why I don\u0027t use the Wingman as my primary stick, well I noticed that Logitech sticks that have twist-rudder feature tend to wear out more easily than ones that don\u0027t (I\u0027ve been using Logitech sticks for over 10 years now), so my 4-year old Attack 3 is still really crisp and responsive, compared to my Wingman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-RODION\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-18T05:24:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2013 05:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by rodion_herrera\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
