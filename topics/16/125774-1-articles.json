Perhaps it would be better to include some links to existing PSA threads judged to be important enough for inclusion. We will not be merging in other threads, as PSA threads are on a variety of topics nad that would intermingle the various conversations, plus it would encourage duplicate threads (checking for titles about the topic would not show a merged PSA thread). \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the meantime, there is nothing inherently wrong with PSA threads, despite being disliked by some.
