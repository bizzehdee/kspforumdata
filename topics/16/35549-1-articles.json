Yay! But then you try to bring it home and the thing tumbles uncontrollably right after the re-entry flames die out. What the...? I mean, it flew perfectly going up, so what\u0027s gone wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI submit that this is due to the change in wing loading caused by the loss of fuel mass. When a spaceplane starts out, it\u0027s as heavy as it will ever be and it\u0027s moving slowly. Thus, you have high mass and low lift, so a fairly high wing loading. As the plane goes up, mass decreases while lift increases with speed but also decreases as the air gets thinner. As things typically work out, the air peters out long before the lift vs. mass balance gets very far out of whack. Thus, a spaceplane can be stable from runway to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen to achieve orbit, you have to do a fairly large burn at apopsis, which takes a lot of fuel. Then you probably burn more to synch up with a space station, and then de-orbit. This brings the mass way down at a point where there\u0027s no lift at all and the thing\u0027s flying like a rocket, so you have no idea of the aerodynamic changes you\u0027re making.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now you re-enter. Typically, nothing very aerodynamic happens (even with FAR) until after the re-entry flames stop. Then suddenly you\u0027re in pretty thick air (about 20km) going WAY fast, much faster than you passed through this same altitude on the way up. So suddenly this HUGE amount of lift kicks in, from the original wing area moving very fast through thick air. But at this point, your spaceplane is as light as it will every be, minus all the fuel it used going up and whatever payload it delivered to orbit. Thus, the lift force totally overpowers the weight force and the spaceplane goes into a death tumble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the wing area isn\u0027t too big, then eventually you\u0027ll regain control before you run out of altitude or the spaceplane breaks up during the tumbles. But the bigger the spaceplane, the more wing it needs to get off the ground, so the worse the problem becomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anybody has a solution to this problem (especially if it\u0027s FAR-friendly), I\u0027d love to know it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Castun","CreatedById":4581,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T21:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing the TAC fuel balancer can certainly help, as it can automatically balance fuel between tanks on the fly.

As right now landing one for me requires parachutes to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Another thing is you also have to worry about how balanced the top and bottom of the plane is. As any imbalances off the CoM will make it spin if using thrust greater then the torq can handle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-04T19:10:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2013 07:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Aragosnat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T20:49:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget the CAPS LOCK button.
