The main thing ive started doing is assembling massive orbital docks where i store ore on them. Then when i get enough ore to have the dry mass of a new ship i want to have built at said dock, i jettision the ore and hyperedit said ship to the spot. I know there are mods that let you build in orbit/other planets, but i hate their complexity and the fact that i then need to drag alot of extra parts around.

For mun/minmus this is moot (especially if you play sandbox/science, or career with excessive money), but anything farther out ive actually had better results using a medium to small scale irsu operation, and then have a heavy lifter that goes to orbit with alot of fuel, and delivers to whatever vessels need it, then returns to the actual mine (which i usually leave on the ground as dragging ~10 tons of IRSU gear is not exactly very practical specially since i dont need to use it in the air.

(I need to get around to posting some pics, but I just joined the forums yesterday....)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the last kind, I include mining gear as part of the ship and just take it with me wherever I go. This means that once I get a ship off of Kerbin and to, say, Minmus, I can fly without any practical limits to any airless body in the solar system and never have to rendezvous to refuel. I just land, mine/refuel, and move on. I did this once in career mode after having accepted several \u0022build a station/outpost around/on body X\u0022, and fulfilled all of the contracts on one mission. Quite handy.

Your advice will be appreciated![/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI haven\u0026#39;t bothered to read this whole thread so I\u0026#39;m certainly repeating what others have already said. But I\u0026#39;ve been building my games around mining since 0.20 (Kethane, Karboninte, K\u002B, and now Ore) so I have some fairly strong opinions on the subject.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst off, unless you have no intention at all of ever going to other planets, mining within Kerbin\u0026#39;s SOI is never, ever, worth bothering with. It\u0026#39;s way simpler to just send out fuel from the ground if you want to go anywhere else. And even if you\u0026#39;re going to stay in Kerbin\u0026#39;s SOI forever, mining there is only useful as an exercise in base-building and learning how the resource system works. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSecond, if you plan on going to other planets, mining within Kerbin\u0026#39;s SOI is never, ever worth the trouble. It\u0026#39;s way simpler to just launch what you need to leave Kerbin\u0026#39;s SOI than it is to set up a whole mining complex on Minmus and bring fuel back to LKO to refuel your interplanetary ships. Besides, even in a career game, such operations never pay off because you\u0026#39;ll never use them enough to recoup in fuel savings the immense cost and time sink of setting up and running such a thing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo that leaves mining at other planets. And whether you do this or not, and how complex you make it, depends entirely on what you want to do out there. If all you want to do is send single exploration missions, then it\u0026#39;s no big deal to equip them for self-refueling in the field. After all, you\u0026#39;re going to be landing on various planets and moons anyway, it\u0026#39;s easier to send out the mining/refining hardware than it is the fuel for a round trip, and being able to refuel usefully extends the mission and provides some self-rescue ability. So I recommend doing this. But because you\u0026#39;re basically doing 1-and-done missions, there\u0026#39;s no sense in building any permanent infrastructure.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOTOH, if you want to invade other planets, build massive, permanent colonies, etc., then you want to make those colonies as self-sufficient as possible. Which means setting up 2 separate mining systems per colony. One based on a convenient airless, low-gravity moon to refuel spaceships that never land, and one on the ground with the colony to provide for its dirtside needs, including refueling the cargo rockets that meet the occasional interplanetary ships in orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou\u0026#39;re playing sandbox so money\u0026#39;s not an option. Therefore, there is no cost savings in making your own fuel. It\u0026#39;s simply a question of what you want to do with your game and how much time you want to spend building, running, and maintaining infrastructure instead of exploring. It\u0026#39;s kinda like owning an electric train set. Do you keep all the track sections loose so you can rearrange them as desired, but just have track on the floor with the occasional hand-placed prop? Or do you nail the track down to a table so you\u0026#39;re stuck with it, and then work on building the surrounding environment around the track layout?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clear Air Turbulence","CreatedById":149987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T04:06:53Z","Content":"\nThanks, those are very useful comments.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne question: a lot of you seem to have refineries in orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIsn\u0026#39;t it more efficient to refine on the ground, and just take up the fuel?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T04:25:47Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Clear Air Turbulence\u0027]Isn\u0026#39;t it more efficient to refine on the ground, and just take up the fuel?[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes, from the POV of maximizing fuel delivery in orbit for a given amount of ore mined. This is because empty ore tanks weigh more than empty fuel tanks (the fuel made from ore weighs the same as the ore---conservation of mass).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHOWEVER, there are 2 reasons not to do this. First off, ore tanks, despite being heavier, are way more compact than fuel tanks, so it\u0026#39;s easier to build ships around them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the big one is the sheer complexity of refining on the ground. If you want to go for max efficiency, then you don\u0026#39;t lift the drills or refinery. That means you need at least 2 ships to get fuel to space: a fixed ground base with drills and refinery, and a fuel tanker lander. And you have to be able to dock these together somehow on the ground, which is very difficult with docking ports everywhere except Minmus\u0026#39; flats, clumsy and Kraken-inducing with the Claw, and bug-ridden wtih KAS. And if the good ore is in hilly terrain, then you also need a fuel rover to truck fuel from the base to the nearest flat landing area, and have to be able to connect this to both the base and the fuel tanker.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut all fuel made from ore is free of cost, whether you\u0026#39;re doing career or sandbox, so there\u0026#39;s no incentive to be as efficient as possible. And it\u0026#39;s a lot less time-consuming to minimize the number of steps in the process, the number of vehicles you have to design, build, test, and then get out there, etc. Thus, to make things easier on themselves, a lot of folks have a mining lander that drills and humps ore to an orbital station with the refinery. This station then refuels the lander so it can get more ore, and uses whatever is left to refuel other ships. This works perfectly well for most applications. Only those who have truly industrial ore consumption and are into efficiency and building the perfect colony need go the extra mile to refine on the ground.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clear Air Turbulence","CreatedById":149987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T10:29:37Z","Content":"\n[QUOTE][COLOR=#333333]the fuel made from ore weighs the same as the ore[/COLOR][/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow I did not know that.

I am saving Eve for last, I guess.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nActually, Duna and Dres are really crappy staging areas for trips to Jool. This is because the further out from the sun a planet is, the slower the planet moves around the sun and the further it has to go around its orbit. So none of the outer planets change position relative to each other very fast. This makes transfer windows between Jool and Dres, for instance, be decades apart. So unless by chance you happen to be near one of the rare transfer windows between outer planets, it\u0026#39;s usually a lot faster to go from Dres to Kerbin to Jool than it is from Dres direct to Jool, even if you have to wait at Kerbin for the window back to Jool.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are in general 2 options for getting from 1 planet to another: less fuel or less gametime, and these are mutually exclusive. The stock KSP solar system is so small that it\u0026#39;s really not hard to carry all the fuel you need for any given trip, although that\u0026#39;s expensive in money if you play career. But if you can make your own fuel in the field, you don\u0026#39;t need to take as much with you, so the cost of the rocket goes way down. If you\u0026#39;re in sandbox, however, money doesn\u0026#39;t matter. And the passing of time within the game only really matters, career or sandbox, if you play with life support, which limits how long ships can be in space. Without such a limit, then it doesn\u0026#39;t matter to you as a player how many years it takes the ship to get from point A to point B.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo make an Eve colony independent of Kerbin, you definitely need to mine for other things besides fuel. You need to be able to build your own rockets there because taking off from Eve pretty much requires dropping stages, so Eve lifters are 1-use tools. This means you have to mine and process stuff to turn raw dirt into rocket parts over several refining stages. There are at least 2 mods that let you do this, Extraplanetary Launchpads and USI-MKS (not the Lite version). Both require building large, complex bases and supporting infrastructure. Lots of fun but a huge time sink and it takes a long time before it\u0026#39;s all up and running.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Octa","CreatedById":140058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T13:35:58Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Clear Air Turbulence\u0027]Hmm.

I am saving Eve for last, I guess.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI just typed in some numbers in the online launch window planner to compare direct flights to the outer planets and flights with a refuel on duna. Turned out the direct flights to Jool and Eeloo are cheaper by 1000 m/s, except for Dres. There you can save 700m/s, but you arrive 4 years and 200 days later than with a direct flight for kerbin, you actually turn a lot of time into a delta save of 700 m/s. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEvery flight assumed a 100km orbit at departure and and arrival. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow the question for the ones who actually know how to do the math: How can this be turned into a gain?\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs far as i understand, this can only turn out to be efficient on paper if you take all aspects of the missions into consideration:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The Ships can be lighter, as the longest burn is 700-2500 m/s cheaper than a direct flight\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Lighter payload means less fuel und funds spent. For the payload itself and most important for the launcher\u003Cbr\u003E\n- You must bring a ressource miner, refinery and storage to duna, which means 1-2 aidditional launches (they can fly with along with the first vessel to duna, if a 500 day stay is enough to get fill up the other vessel)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen using vacuum engines like terrier, poodle or nukes, it looks hard that a fuel station can actually save funds. Just a few m/s as safety margin and it can turn out you need another mission which refuels there to get a plus.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nShould anyone be interested, i saved the calculated flights into a text file.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T14:39:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably worth it. \u00A0In 0.90 I had a ISRU-like mod where I\u0027d land a very large mining vessel with built-in refinery on the surface of Minmus and leave it there for 15-45 days. \u00A0The whole thing would take off and dock with a fuel depot in orbit around Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it\u0027s less efficient to bring the drill up/down with you, but at a large enough scale vessel (think 7x of the big orange tanks being filled up), it doesn\u0027t matter much. \u00A0Plus I didn\u0027t have to deal with trying to connect vessels up while on the ground (even though I had MKS/OKS).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T16:10:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222286926\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022125796\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221447940158\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022140058\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Octa\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn \u200E11\u200E/\u200E19\u200E/\u200E2015\u200E \u200E7\u200E:\u200E35\u200E:\u200E58\u200E, Octa said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just typed in some numbers in the online launch window planner to compare direct flights to the outer planets and flights with a refuel on duna.
