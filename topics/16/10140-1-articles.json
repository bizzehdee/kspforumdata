Attach struts all over the place and it can help fix it, mainly between engines and other parts like fuel tanks, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T16:22:03Z","Content":"Reinforcing your engines with (just enough) struts should help. But engines break off mainly due to too much weight resting on too few engines. So maybe your craft is underpowered? Adding engines might make it more efficient, and also solve the launchpad footprint issue. Kerbal rockets often look more like pyramids than aircraft."},{"CreatedByName":"The Doctor","CreatedById":24011,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T19:34:52Z","Content":"I noticed that it might be a bug.
