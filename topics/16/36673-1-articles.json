It seems we cant continue to do that in .20, the chute just \u0022snaps off\u0022 and the little parachute icon goes red.

The current code for parachutes makes them disappear whenever you contact the ground. Unless there is a bit of the API that you can use to disable this behaviour, someone would have to reimplement the parachute logic to get the behaviour you describe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RatBeer","CreatedById":63063,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T13:07:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhhh, guess i may have to resort to mods. cheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
