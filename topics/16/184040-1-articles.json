I would launch empty transfer stages from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and fuel them on orbit.

You pay the cost of a Minmus transfer up front, but once you\u0027re refueled you have a ~930 m/s head start on your interplanetary burn (net benefit 770 m/s if you assume 160 m/s to leave).

You can also without much loss eject straight from Minmus, so now you\u0027re always within 12 days of a transfer window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you have to define efficiency. It\u0027s actually (and slightly) less FUEL efficient, as you use more fuel. It\u0027s more COST efficient because any fuel you don\u0027t lift off of Kerbin is not only free, but it doesn\u0027t need any fuel to get it off Kerbin. It\u0027s (far) less TIME efficient, though. You can do a full trip to Duna and back in the time it takes you (the player) to do all these fuel runs, rendezvous and dockings, and ejections at the exact correct time and in the exact correct direction to take full advantage of the Oberth effect at Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever it can be extremely FUN efficient, which really is all that matters when playing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-26T21:48:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter trying all the above methods a number of times, I have decided that I like to use method 3.
