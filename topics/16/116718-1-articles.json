Getting the z-axis perfect on surface docking is nearly impossible, especially if variable fuel weight can enter the equation - and why wouldn\u0027t it, you\u0027re likely docking to move fuel.\n\nKIS/KAS will do it with the least work and can accomplish either non-docking refueling via pipe or assist in some methods of docking by using winches to pull yourself into position, if your docking ports are built to allow for that. It will also allow you to do a bunch of other fun things, like replace parts if they get broken (and you packed spares, say some extra solar panels in case you smack into one while derping about on EVA) or build new structures on a surface. You don\u0027t have to do that if all you\u0027re after is the pipes. You can also use winches as EVA tethers so your kerbals don\u0027t drift into space if they lose their grip or miss the target. Personally, I think any race that can build a nuclear engine and generate fuel from mined ore in a compact unit can also tie a rope around their waists, ya know?\n\nInfernal Robotics can offer an alternative method of docking alignment by attaching moving parts, like rails, to your landing struts or even to docking parts themselves, allowing you to do things like adjust either an adapter or the entire craft\u0027s height, as well as create cranes, robotic arms, rotors, and whatever else you can think of to do with the basic planes of movement.\n\nTake the plunge and install them both. Take what suits your purpose now and if you decide you want to play with the new legos these give you, they\u0027ll be there. They certainly open a lot of avenues for craft building and EVA activities."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T11:48:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...attaching moving parts, like rails, to your landing struts or even to **docking parts themselves**...\n\nPutting docking ports on robotic parts has been a no-no for IR for a long time, IIRC.\n\nIt\u0027s tempting I know, but weird things happen...\n\nBest bet, IMO, is to use KIS/KAS.

It\u0027s a small probe core, with two small RCS tanks on each ends, and docking ports on those. One end is connected, via a connection point and winch to the fuel dump, and the other is left free - I can then fly the little robot to my ship, plug it into a docking port and then pump the fuel and RCS in as needed. \nIt\u0027s only randomly exploded on me once so far - and flying it, in gravity, is a bit tricky, but can be done with fine control and careful toggling of the RCS and reaction wheels.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"Tazin","CreatedById":147235,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T12:27:48Z","Content":"Temstar\u0027s method is what i always use, except with rover wheels instead of landing legs.
