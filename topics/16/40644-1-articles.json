The higher the Isp the more powerful is the thrust applied to the rocket with the same fuel mass. The Isp is usually given in seconds but actually the physically correct unit is distance per time which is usually given in meters per second or feet per second. To avoid confusion which unit of speed is used, the physical correct Isp (in distance/time) is divided by the surface gravity of Earth (9.81 m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2). This results in a value given in seconds. To use this Isp in formulas it must to be converted back into distance per time which requires multiplying with the surface gravity of Earth again. As this value is only used to convert between those two units, the specific impulse doesn\u0027t change when the gravity changes. It appears that KSP use a value like 9.82 m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 and thus using a little less fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I select engines, I mainly look at max power. When you play around with it you will get familiar with which ones are for which application.

If your thrust-to-weight ratio (Thrust/(Mass*9.81)) is \u0026lt;1, your rocket will not leave the pad. Ideally (for most-efficient launch), you want this number to float in the 1.8-2.5 range for getting off Kerbin, but it doesn\u0027t matter much once you\u0027re in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMin power is 0 for all engines except solid rockets. Once you activate an SRB, it burns at full power until it runs out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISP is the \u0027efficiency\u0027 of the rocket. Rockets are least efficient in thick atmospheres (at sea level) and most efficient in vacuums. Don\u0027t worry about what the number means (I never do), just know that a higher ISP will get you further for a given amount of fuel. Also, the atmosphere thins out very quickly, so by the time you hit 5-10km the vacuum ISP is all that really matters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPropellants are what the rocket burns. All rockets use the 0.9/1.1 mix at the moment, same with fuel tanks. The only exceptions are the airplane parts, which use liquid fuel/intake air, and ion engines, which use xenon/electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass was not listed by you, but it is actually very important. There is a \u0027correct\u0027 rocket for every job. Even though the NRV has double the ISP of any other rocket, it weighs a lot and provides very little thrust. This makes it poorly suited for a launch stage and too big for small orbital stages (less than a few tons). An engine needs to push both your rocket and itself, and the more massive they are the harder this is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, the two most important stats for your rocket are TWR and delta-V. TWR is really important for getting into orbit or landing with rockets, though it matters little once you\u0027re actually in orbit. Delta-V is very important, it says how \u0027far\u0027 your rocket can go, in terms of how many m/s it can accelerate with the fuel it has. You can look up the equations for delta-V, but I won\u0027t go into that here. But know that it takes roughly 4600dV to get off Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are really interested in these stats, try the mods Kerbal Engineer Redux or Mechjeb, as they will calculate these and lots of other parameters of your rocket (doing this by hand is very tedious).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T17:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe quick answer on ISP: fuel economy.

You will get off the ground with anything higher than one, but the higher your TWR, the faster you will get into orbit. dv is more important once you are in orbit. You can have a TWR of less than .000001 and still change to another orbit. If your TWR is this low, though, it will take quite some time to make a noticeable change. A good plan for space flight is to use an engine with a very high TWR as the first stage of your rocket to push you off the ground. Then ditch it and light off a second stage with a TWR greater than one until you are in a stable orbit. On Kerbin, a stable orbit is any orbit whose perigee is higher than 70km (above Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.) Once you are in orbit, efficiency is the name of the game. Use high Isp engines such as the LV-N, LV-909, Poddle, or, if you have the patience, the PB-ion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine mass does not change, unless the engine breaks off of your rocket. Thrust is how much force, measured in kilo-newtons (kN) that each engine can provide at full power. 1kN equals 1000 Newtons (N.) Newtons are used to measure force (if you have not taken, of remember from, physics.) You can calculate how much force your rocket is applying in a downwards direction by multiplying its mass by Kerbin\u0027s gravity. As with every where in physics, the metric system is used. You calculate a rocket\u0027s \u0022force\u0022 on the ground using the equation F=ma, or force equals mass times acceleration. In this case, acceleration is Kerbin\u0027s gravity, which incidentally is the same as Earth\u0027s, 9.8m/s^2 (32ft/s^2.) Lets say your rocket has a mass of 1000kg and is siting on the pad at KSC. You multiply the 1000kg by 9.8m/s^2 to get 9800N, or 9.8kN, of force. That means you would need 9.8kN of thrust to make your rocket \u0022float\u0022 over the pad or at least 9.81kN to make your rocket ascend. You can find your TWR by taking the ratio of your thrust and comparing it to your weight (which is not the same as mass.) Lets say you were cheating and using infinite fuel and you had a hypothetical engine that provided exactly 9.8kN of thrust. Your TWR would be 1.00. In KSP, as in real life, however, your mass is constantly decreasing as you burn fuel. This means your thrust (assuming no throttle input from you) stays constant while your mass (and your weight) decrease. This causes your TWR to increase as you burn the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta V (dv):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDv is a measure of the extent of how much your rocket can change its velocity (not the same as speed.) Dv is officialy notated as a triangle (Greek symbol for delta, used in physics to show change in a variable) then a v. First off, velocity has a vector to it. This means it has a direction to the speed. In space your velocity is critical to your orbits. In order to raise your orbits, you thrust pro-grade, thus increasing your velocity. To lower your orbit, you thrust retrograde, thus decreasing your velocity. Dv is a measure of how much you can change your velocity, usually measured in m/s or km/s (1km/s=1000m/s if you live in the U.S. like I do and don\u0027t know.) For example, if you wanted to raise your velocity (assuming no outside influences such as drag or gravity) from your current velocity of, lets say, 1000m/s to 2000m/s then back to 1000m/s you would use 2000m/s or 2km/s. Why? You use 1000m/s dv to increase your velocity to 2000m/s per second. You then use an additional 1000m/s to slow yourself back down. Dv can be calculated using only simple algebra and the Tsiolokovsky (I would butch his name trying to pronounce it) Rocket Equation. The equation is as follows: Dv=ve*ln*(m0/m1). In plain English, delta v equals the product of the effective exhaust velocity times the natural logarithm of the quotient of the initial mass divided by the ending mass. Ve needs to be computed on its own. When it is factored into the the equation, the equation looks like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDv=(g*Isp)*ln*(m0/m1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere g= the gravity of a body\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp= the specific impulse seen on the engine statistics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the final equation, in plain English, is delta v equals the product of gravity times specific impulse times the natural logarithm times the quotient of the initial mass divided by the ending mass. If you have a calculator, all you have to do is plug the numbers into the equation to get the correct answer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbits:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit is defined as free fall around and object. For example, if a baseball is thrown fast enough (ignoring aerodynamic drag,) by the time it should have hit the ground if the object was flat, the surface has curved away from the ball. As long as the ball continues traveling at this velocity, it will never hit the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital Information:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust some useful terms to know:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApoapsis (sp?, AKA: Apogee): The highest point in your orbit or ballistic trajectory. You will never be farther from the surface than this without input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeriapsis: (sp?, AKA: Perigee): The lowest point in your orbit. You will never be closer to the surface than this point without input. On ballistic trajectories, your periapsis will be zero and the object will impact the ground at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEccentricity: A measure of how circular your orbit is. An eccentricity of zero means you are in a perfectly circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital Period: The time it takes to complete one orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypes of Orbital Transfers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are used to place your craft on a trajectory to intercept another object. The most common type of transfer is the Hohmann transfer. In this orbit, you place your periapsis above your target if you are in front of it, and below it if you are behind it. Raising your periapsis will cause you to move slower, allowing your target to \u0022catch up\u0022 to you. Lowering your periapsis will cause you to accelerate, allowing you to \u0022catch up\u0022 to your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket Design:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn efficient rocket can place a high payload fraction into orbit. A payload fraction is the fraction made by dividing the weight of the rocket and payload (a capsule or spacecraft, for example) by the weight of an otherwise empty rocket (fuel is included in an empty rocket, just not the payload.) An easy way to achieve a high payload fraction is to \u0022stage\u0022 a rocket. Staging involves dropping empty fuel tanks and other parts when they are no longer needed, leaving another stage to continue pushing a payload into orbit. A design commonly used in KSP is called \u0022Asparagus Staging.\u0022 Using Asparagus Staging, one pair of boosters on opposing sides of a central booster core feed into another pair of boosters on opposing sides and so on until fuel reaches the central core. The first pair of boosters feed all the engines on the stage, including their own, then fall off after they have depleted their fuel. Then, the next pair burns and so on. Other things to take into account when designing a rocket are structural stability and control-ability. Struts are often used to increase the structural stability of a rocket or craft to prevent it from falling apart during flight. RCS, reaction wheels, and fins/ control surfaces help to control a vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Note on Space Planes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace planes do not need a TWR greater than one to take off (although it is still a good idea to have a TWR greater than one.) The lift generated by their wings counteracts the force of gravity when they are designed correctly. Remember, though, that they spend much more time in the lower atmosphere and are subjected to the pressures affiliated with low altitude flight. Spaceplanes are difficult to design. If you do decide to design them, make sure the center of lift is behind the center of mass or the aircraft will do a low altitude loop and crash shortly after takeoff. For beginning players, it is a good idea to wait to design successful rockets before attempting to design a spaceplane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this has answered your questions and provided you with enough understanding of the game for you to enjoy it.
