Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E rovers that have a total generating capacity about of about 1/2 or less than the total max draw of all the powered wheels, and have a fairly big\u00A0(usually a few thousand EC)\u00A0battery\u00A0to provide excess juice for accelerating and hill-climbing. \u00A0Also, you can disable the motor on some of the wheels if you don\u0027t need the extra horsepower at the moment. \u00A0You can, in this way, make a rover that never runs out of juice, at least if the sun is shining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe size of the battery determines how much hard work you (or the size of the hill) you\u00A0can do before you have to pause for a recharge. \u00A0It usually takes some testing to figure out the idea size of battery and the amount of generation capacity for a given rover design. \u00A0If you have enough battery just barely to climb the biggest hill you\u0027re likely to meet (considering generation while doing so), then as you coast down the other side, the generators will charge it back up for the next hill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as to what you use for a generator, you have the options of RTGs, solar, and fuel cells. \u00A0RTGs don\u0027t make much juice so it\u0027s very expensive to make rovers with lots of them. \u00A0Still, it\u0027s often a good idea to have 1 as an emergency, always-there battery charger, plus it will keep a probe core alive if you park the rover for any length of time. \u00A0But really, you\u0027re main options are solar and fuel cells, or a combination of both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolar panels work just fine on Mun (slightly better than on Kerbin due to no atmosphere), at least when the sun is shining. \u00A0But Mun\u0027s nights last about 3 of Kerbin\u0027s days so you might have to park and warp ahead that long if you intend to go any great distance. \u00A0But OTOH, it\u0027s dangerous driving in the dark so you might want to wait out the night anyway, regardless of how you power the rover. \u00A0Remembering that you don\u0027t need generation for more than about 1/2 the total wheel draw, a\u00A0few of the OX-State-XLs should do you pretty well, provided you have enough battery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFuel cells are kinda overkill for small rovers. \u00A0The big one\u00A0makes\u00A0way more juice than you need most of the time, they require fuel tanks, and the tanks eventually run dry. \u00A0Now, if you have a medium rover (8 or more powered wheels) that has to do a lot of hill-climbing, a big fuel cell can be quite handy. \u00A0It will keep you going without having to stop and recharge the battery. \u00A0Just turn the fuel cell on when you really need it and shut if off the rest of the time. \u00A0Now, if you\u0027ve got a huge rover with multiple ginormous wheels on it, fuel cells are pretty much required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-01T16:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless you have absolutely no space, I\u0027d stick a static solar panel or two on the roof, at least as a supplement. \u00A0They\u0027ll generate enough to make up for their mass pretty quickly. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus driving at night is annoying, so the panels are likely to be useful when you\u0027re cruising around anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"baldamundo","CreatedById":138417,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-01T21:10:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, honestly I find it really hard to see when the stock fuel cells are worth taking.
