They get closer and closer, and when a facing pair are close enough, it starts to apply magnetic force to both of them to help encourage them together.

The tolerance for joinder is a lot more strict - it has to be pretty much exact. The reason for this is that this code path only really exists for two docking ports that have been already placed face-to-face in the VAB, to catch them at vessel initialization and make sure that their state is changed to \u0022docked\u0022 and not \u0022just welded together like any old fuel tanks.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that when you bring your fancy triple-clampotrons together, in order to get all three to lock together and form a physical joint, you have to be VAB-snap-precise. This takes many many tries, and 19 times out of 20 you\u0027re gonna get one docked pair and two that are noticeably sliiiightly cockeyed. Once that first pair is joined and the vessels dock officially, no \u0027roll\u0027 happens around that axis any longer, so you are stuck with whatever slight misalignment you still had at the time on the other two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s still possible, though. One good tip is to point your ships normal/antinormal (north/south) so that your docking adapters are meeting up and down. This will eliminate the need to always be gently compensating for (ie, fighting) the libration effect of the rotating reference frame. But it still takes forever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T20:28:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tokay Gris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tokay Gris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can dock multiple ports.
