I am pretty sure it\u0027s due to memory issues or that I screwed up the install on the latest cool mod. I\u0027m wondering how do you pros deal with recovering to a \u0022last\u0022 save to limit having to redo a bunch of things?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my situation. I made a big beautiful (to me) Mun station. Every so often it decides to explode in a ball of glory (not neccessarily this station specifically but others too) when I switch to it and then timewarp. I usually am good at quicksaving randomly, but this time I was not. Is there a trick you guys use to avoid \u0022auto-saving\u0022 and just reloading the last auto save? I feel I\u0027ve done it a couple times on accident maybe, as I didn\u0027t lose much when I reloaded. This time I have a choice to reload the last auto-save which loads me just after the explosion or something that is several hours prior and 2 rendezvous and dockings later. Not a big deal but still it takes quite some realtime. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current best idea is to only switch ships via Kerbal Alarm Clocks \u0022Jump to Ship\u0022 which saves every change. That doesn\u0027t seem ideal for say my satellites that I just leave orbiting places for several weeks at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you guys do?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-24T07:18:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2014 07:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by J3ansley\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-24T06:16:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EALT-F5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoften, to filename containing date\u002Btime\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-24T06:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuicksave, often.
