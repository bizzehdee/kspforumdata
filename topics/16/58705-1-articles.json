If you go this route then you can weld (regular attach) 1 pod to each sci-jr, since these 1-shot experiments are gonna get used up at the same rate they can be jettisoned together. You already have the 4-symmetry that will work with this; as you flyby each moon you grab a high-space reading, then a low-space one on the opposite sci-jr, transmit them both and jettison the matched pair of experiments before moving to the next moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfering from stable orbit around each moon means a lot of window calculations and considerably more dV for little benefit (provided you are comfortable setting up the low-space flybys, cant recommend conics mode 0 enough). (Given that you have KSPI im assuming enough dV to do this the long way is readily available; it would just be much faster, ingame time and your time, to grab the readings on flyby) Im assuming no landings are planned since that doesnt seem setup to land on anything but the smallest worlds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: also, you are like 2 sci-jr\u0027s/pods short of optimal as far as i can see.
