But for a few possibilities:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Yes, it could be a fuel use CoM shift. Try to cluster your fuel tanks as close as you can around CoM, and use fuel lines to control the order in which the tanks drain. Avoid putting tanks near the nose. In the SPH, always check to see how the CoM moves when the tanks empty; you can empty tanks by right clicking on them and adjusting the tweakables. You may also want to shift your CoL a bit further behind CoM to make the plane less sensitive to mass shift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You may have problems the other way, with CoL too far behind CoM. Too far forward is unstable, but too far back makes it hard to keep the nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You may have been climbing too steeply, leading you into a stall when levelling due to insufficient speed. This can be related to insufficient wing area; the less wing, the higher the stall speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You may have insufficient pitch authority. To control pitch, you want substantial control surfaces that are placed as far away from CoM as possible. Surfaces on mid-mounted wings are for roll; they\u0027re useless for pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and an assortment of other things that aren\u0027t coming to mind right now.
