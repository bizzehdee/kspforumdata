Back when you were asking for gravity assist help, I took your save and tried to fly your proposed mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving Ferram Aerospace installed made the Laythe landing interesting and the takeoff impossible, but that\u0027s just me asking for the pain; if I could reach 250 m/s airspeed the rest of the ascent would work. Your craft loves to pitch up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVall was rather hard; without the Rapiers in closed-cycle still attached, I couldn\u0027t hand\u00A0the whole ship safely. And I had no idea how you were going to take off from Vall with a full load of fuel and oxidizer without some kind of long, high\u00A0jump ramp, because I sure couldn\u0027t. And there was no point in putting monopropellant in the Mk3 cockpit back on Laythe; that was silly of me to take on so much extra mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt one point I landed, refueled and launched your complete Tylo lander at Vall. Maybe after a few runs back and forth I could have refueled your mother ship\u00A0in orbit\u00A0as long as I didn\u0027t put any oxidizer in the top tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never did get past Vall. That moon has surprisingly strong gravity and a more surprising orbital speed. The transfer from Laythe to Vall wasn\u0027t stupidly expensive though; no more than 1200 m/s if I recall. A Laythe-Laythe outward assist might have saved some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission report thread is here \u00A0-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155135-the-liv-tylo-a-jool-5-odyssey/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s some pictures of the Kerbin launch, the laythe approach and landing (in the dark, on the side of a mountain, with stock visual enhancements - ie. no ambient light at all). \u00A0 Far more dangerous than any of this, is some footage of a poor Kerbal trying to use it\u0027s bathroom (extremely dangerous, can spaghettify the Kerbal and destroy the ship) and also of the rover trying to kill off its passengers one by one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith stock aero, landing on Laythe at 4km altitude took place at about 40 m/s. \u00A0 I think by the time we get back to Kerbin we\u0027ll be under 30 with all the mass-shedding. \u00A0Takeoff was rather underpowered and it takes for-ever to accelerate, but does at least like to keep pointing in the same direction if you don\u0027t touch anything so it was mostly 40 minutes of pressing the screen grab button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeparture from Laythe was with max \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and no ox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/AiMmmfOj8Qk?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeparture from Vall was with half \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and no Ox. \u00A0 \u00A0If you thought my Laythe departure was sketchy, see this -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/LzfsGzaS8b4?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if i can reach Pol with the delta V i have. \u00A0Taking off with any more fuel on board seems unlikely. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have two fallback plans\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nGet a gravity assist from Tylo to Pol. \u00A0 It might make the difference\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGo back to a save on the surface of Vall, \u00A0and find a way to separate the Tylo lander. \u00A0Fly it to orbit under its own power. \u00A0The plane will then be able to get off with a lot more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E on board - in orbit it can then re-dock with the lander, and carry it to Pol. \u00A0 How do i separate them though?
