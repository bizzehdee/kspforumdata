Reactordrone is right that you have a major overheating problem. Since your radiators are on, that must mean that they are not placed correctly to cool your drills. The overheating you are seeing is typical for a drill that is not being cooled at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022ore rate\u0022 is the maximum rate at 100% efficiency -- which happens at a core temp of 500K. So you have to multiply by the efficiency level, which means you are getting 1/8th of that rate, IIRC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne tip -- one converter-250\u00A0can convert much faster than 4 drills can mine, so you only need one converter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, it\u0027s supposed to be abysmally slow without an engineer. It\u0027s still pretty slow with an engineer. It\u0027s meant to take several hours (at least) to get enough ore to fill a fuel tank. Mining operations are meant to be left running continuously for weeks to fill a nice big tank ready for launch to orbit and use. As you found (ignoring old KSP versions) the drills and converters can run in the background, unattended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-10T00:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, it most assuredly does work on rails while you\u0027re away flying other missions.

They work better, and can be placed anywhere on the ship. They don\u0027t need to be near the drills. One medium thermal control per large drill will\u00A0prevent overheating.\u00A0And having an engineer on board is not a bonus, it\u0027s absolutely essential. My first trip to another planet was an unmanned mining ship I sent to Duna. It took about a year and a half to refuel. I\u0027ve never had an unmanned mining vessel since. A three, four, or five-star engineer will change everything. As long as you have power, with those large drills, you can refuel a gigantic fuel shuttle in just a few hours (or a few days, depending how large, and what your ore concentration is).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-10T00:52:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2017 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt Kerbalkrunch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-10T07:43:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EHeat\u003C/u\u003E: If you are using version 1.2.2, there is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/13403\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebug #13403\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0preventing core heat from leaving the drills (which makes them overheat outside of the atmosphere). \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case you haven\u0027t signed yourself up to read the bugtracker, the fix posted there is to edit\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EGameData/Squad/Parts/Resources/*Drill/*.Drill.cfg\u00A0to make\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EUseSpecialistBonus = false (being sure to change at least the /final/ of the redundant definitions of UseSpecialistBonus in those files).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven the name UseSpecialistBonus, you might worry that this change would prevent engineers from helping the drilling process,\u00A0but in fact the change seems to have no side effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EWhile you are in there, you might want to change AutoShutdown =false, \u00A0because \u003C/s\u003Ethe drills shutdown upon lack of electricity\u00A0(not just upon overheating) and require manual restart. \u00A0(The usual solution to this problem is to switch away from any solar powered drilling operation only during the day.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EThroughput\u003C/u\u003E: I have also noticed that \u0022Ore rate = 0.13 units/s\u0022 is not the current rate of drilling ore;
