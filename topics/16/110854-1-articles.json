You have a lot of exposed parts, especially those radial bulgy tanks on the adapter-- that drag is gonna get you. Move all that paraphernalia into a 1.25m service bay (it only masses 0.1t), with an appropriate nosecone in front of it. That makes your ship a nice smooth cylinder.\n\nSecondly, you have the \u0022Thumper\u0022 SRB driving the thing-- that\u0027s way overpowered (by default) for that tiny middle/upper stage, as stibbons has suggested. At the very least, make sure you\u0027ve put a thrust limiter on that SRB so that it doesn\u0027t slam you past Mach1 right away. If you\u0027re trying to pick a number, I find a TWR of about 1.5 works pretty well. Look at the craft\u0027s total mass on the engineer\u0027s report, multiply by 1.5, multiply by 9.8, then divide by 275 (the thrust of a BACC), that\u0027ll tell you what to set it at.\n\nI\u0027d also suggest that your mass ratio between that huge BACC booster and your tiny 1-ton 2nd stage is a pretty big gap. Maybe consider downgrading the SRB from a Thumper to a Hammer, and then upping your 2nd stage from 1 ton of LFO to 2 tons. (And of course make sure to re-do the math to figure out how to set the thrust limiter on the SRB.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T07:29:17Z","Content":"Small rocket are harder to fly (well, less forgiving) than bigger ones. Your rocket don\u0027t have control surfaces (winglets), nor thrust vectoring. And I don\u0027t see reaction wheel.

I had some results with that, even I don\u0027t use them anymore.\n\nBut reducing thrust, as others explained, is he way to go."},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T07:43:36Z","Content":"I\u0027ll break it down for you.

That\u0027s not a viable launcher.\n\u003E Use a LFO stack with thrust vectoring, and maybe some basic fins.\n\nCompletely disagree. Small probes can be launched with a single SRB as lowest stage, no problem.\n\nWith the reduced specific impulse of all the SRBs it got a little harder, as they don\u0027t yield that much delta v any more. \n\nHere are my suggestions:\n\n- Why do you bring RCS tanks if you don\u0027t have (and need) RCS thrusters? Get rid of those.\n\n- Payload is not very aerodynamic. Infact the way KSP calculates drag it\u0027s propably very draggy and makes your craft want to turn around during atmospheric flight. Try putting everything inside a service bay.\n\n- There are no batteries or solar panels on your probe. It will run out of power when you don\u0027t fire your engines.\n\n- You need some way to control your craft in space. Add a reaction wheel or you will have absolutely no control when engines are not firing.\n\n- The LV-T45 engine is desingned for use atmospheric use. If you have unlocked the LV-909, use that one for everything above 30km.\n\n- SRBs are great as a cheap lower stage. However, they have no thrust vectoring (gimbal) in KSP. Use fins with actual control surfaces to compensate for that, as those can steer you in atmospheres. Also, set the thrust limiter on the SRB to maybe 20% for your very small payload. The whole thing should not be going faster than 300m/s at 10km. Don\u0027t worry if it doesn\u0027t take off from the pad very fast.\n\nSeeing that your current design has abolutely no control while the SRB is burning, I\u0027d like to add a link to Scott Manley\u0027s tutorial on ascent in KSP 1.0. You need to do a gradual gravity turn in the new aero and he shows how it\u0027s done. \n\n[https://youtu.be/_q_8TO4Ag0E](https://youtu.be/_q_8TO4Ag0E)\n\nThat beeing said, one could propably point your rocket slightly east at launch and then don\u0027t touch the controls untill the SRB is burned out, but it\u0027s not optimal.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T08:19:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 08:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chaos\\_Klaus**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T09:33:17Z","Content":"You have 0.3 command torque and nothing else for control authority in your first stage. That would flip even in 0.90.\n\nAdd a small reaction wheel and switch to delta deluxe winglets at the bottom. That should fix it. For the future, see these tips:\n\nSpinning out of control essentially comes down to a contest between drag and control. When the drag overcomes your control authority, you go for a spin. You can decrease drag by staying closer to prograde and building a more aerodynamic rocket. You can increase **control** using engine gimbals, stabilizer wheels, and **control** surfaces.\n\nAlso note that drag increases significantly right around mach 1 (340 m/s). So you should stay pointed as prograde as possible at speeds around 280-400 m/s.\n\nOn a rocket **control** fins should be as low and outside as possible. If you are using control fins on more than one stage, the CoL needs to stay below the CoM at all times, even as the tanks empty."},{"CreatedByName":"Pingonaut","CreatedById":15723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T19:59:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Turn SAS on. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E If you haven\u0027t already, also thrust limit the BACC booster.
