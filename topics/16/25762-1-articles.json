I\u0027ve gone through a number of tutorials and have my descent velocity down to 3 m/s yet I still bounce when the lander legs touch down. At that point I usually have some horizontal drift so the craft lists to one side and if I\u0027m not quick enough, or I panic, the lander ends in its destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips out there for getting my Mun lander to \u0022stick\u0022 once it touches down? I thought about using RCS to \u0022push\u0022 the lander down into place once the legs touch down, not sure if that will work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll get a picture of my Mun lander up here one day, it\u0027s a combination lander/rescue pod with a Command Pod MkI and a Hitchhiker Storage Container. Strapped to that are four LV-N engines to power the craft to the Mun with enough fuel (I hope) to get back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help/thoughts/ideas would be greatly appreciated. I\u0027m pretty sure the low gravity of the Mun is what I\u0027m struggling with, just not sure how to counter that. Jebediah had a blast during the last crash, literally.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T18:53:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEliminate as much of the horizontal drift as possible.

You might also try widening the base of your lander; if you make it low and squat, it\u0027s less likely to tip over.

Don\u0027t panic. Also, depending on your lander\u0027s design, you might be able to right your lander by retracting and extending the legs... but this might also hurl your lander up and crash it down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the lander can control module is built for doing landings in IVA, and has a radar altimeter(maximum distance 2000 meters) and vertical speed gauge, as well as a (way too shiny) Navigation ball. This might help you manage your descent, since you can see both the vertical motion numbers and the ground itself in better detail than you can from outside the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T19:49:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA little trick that helps me. kill all your velocity at 1-2 km above the surface.

If you have both ASAS and RCS on the lander, they will fight to keep the ship from tipping over. Yes, pressing N to force the ship onto the surface can help. Don\u0027t use the middle-sized landing legs, the LT-1 model, because they are EXTREMELY bouncey. And if you\u0027re just learning how to land, a capsule AND a Hitchhiker module makes for a kind of a large ship to practice with. At least remove the Hitchhiker until you get better at landings, and maybe use a 1-man capsule instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
