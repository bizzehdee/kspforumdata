On initial ascent, prograde is wherever you point the rocket. Of course you will have to circularize with a prograde burn and you will want to do so at Ap.

Maybe I\u0027m an idiot and missed something, but I think if you stick SAS on prograde starting at ascent then do nothing to adjust your AoA, you\u0027re going to go in pretty much the direction you were initially pointed and nowhere else, so unless you can somehow adjust your rocket to your desired AoA on the ground, you\u0027re still going to be flying the initial part by hand until you get enough speed to safely start maneuvering. To be fair, I have little experience with nonatmospheric HTO ascent vehicles, so maybe some of you genius designers have made easily adjustable AoA takeoff craft, in which case you rock! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what do you mean about controlling throttle?

Take off and immediately pitchover so that you maintain zero vertical speed as you build horizontal speed. As you gain speed you will be able to pitch closer and closer to the horizons.
