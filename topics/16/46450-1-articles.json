With a standard spaceplane SSTO you gain pretty much all of your speed while flying horizontally at around 25-30km. With a vertical ascent profile I would be surprised if you got much more than a couple of hundred m/s before you run out of air at 35km, even if you stack hundreds of intakes. This means you are basically building a single-stage rocket that has to haul around a load of dead weight used for only a tiny portion of the delta-V required to achieve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Nevertheless, I would definitely use turbo-jets and whatever rocketry setup required to haul that thing from 35km to orbit. Try to spend as much time horizontal as possible between 20km and 30km, completely flat if possible without wings! I think the number is about 0.07 air per turbojet, not sure about jets (likely much more).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-24T21:21:54Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2013 09:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by giltirn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SofusRud","CreatedById":59276,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T21:48:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of the craft is a crew shuttle for my Laythe colony efforts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been basing my design on some SSTOs that Brotoro built a while ago.

For space you want an engine which vectors, since control surfaces are useless there.
