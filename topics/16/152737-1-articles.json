Using gravity assists to get captured on Jool is pretty straightforward as using Tylo and/or Laythe will get you captured around Jool. On Kerbin and Duna, however, it\u0027s not so clear. You might get a decrease in velocity if you get behind Ike or the Mun, but it\u0027s never quite enough for a capture. I\u0027ve always wondered if it is better to use the moons for an assist and use a retrograde burn or if doing that just loses the Oberth effect of the larger body the moon is orbiting and ends up costing more d/V.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magzimum","CreatedById":167187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-29T10:09:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not familiar with a method to compare the two (slingshot vs. low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E with Oberth), but who not try both?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the moon of your choice is in the right position, it mayh be possible to get a slingshot, thereby slowing down a lot, and (through some adjustments) still achieve a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E around the central planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-29T10:35:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is because Joolian moons are bigger, thus their gravity well is much deeper, so by doing a fly-by close to Tylo, it\u0027s more like you were doing it with Kerbin, rather than Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-29T11:21:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, It depends a little on how fast you\u0027re coming in. The Mun is only moving at 540 m/s, so that\u0027s about all it can give you. So if you\u0027re coming in at 6000 m/s, you\u0027re not going to get much out of it.
