Could anyone help me with why?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Alright it won\u0027t let me upload my craft file nor when I tried to put it into a RAR. Anyone know what I need to do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: It seems to be happening to more than one of my landing engines and RCS tanks now. The thing is that in the middle there\u0027s a fuel tank for the engine, below that the landing engine and above the fuel tank a RCS tank. There are four of these and they\u0027re all attached to a middle pillar by a strut, the strut is connected to the fuel tank in the middle. The engines and tanks seem to fall off once I get out of my \u0022fast forward\u0022. I fast forward 50x and wait until I\u0027ve gotten to my apoapsis when I\u0027m in orbit or whatever the name is and then when I go out of it they just fall off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-04T20:12:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2012 08:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Olsson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-04T20:57:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI posted something similar in the general discussion board.
