I eyeball and guess at the placement.\u00A0 I believe that the mobile lab has the greatest share of mass, so I will consider that the primary part--meaning that the best solution places most\u00A0of the thrusters on the lab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPractically, one thruster will be on the longer radial part; the way this works is to imagine a circle drawn about the centre of mass in the plane horizontal to the ground and to place thrusters at the points where that circle intersects the skin of the vessel.\u00A0 The centre of mass for the whole structure is below the centre of the lab, naturally, and pulled somewhat towards the radially-attached parts, so that circle (its size is adjustable\u00A0so long as it intersects the skin of the craft in three places) will erupt and submerge\u00A0at two places on the far side of the lab and a third somewhere on the larger radial part (and possibly a fourth and fifth on the shorter parts).\u00A0 So long as the thrusters are correctly spaced on that circle (and the circle is on a horizontal plane), they are all equally spaced from the centre of mass, the torques cancel out, and you won\u0027t have to concern yourself about torque from up-and-down translation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0centre of mass is easily determined, so I won\u0027t go into further detail about that, but the remaining issue is lateral translation; your solution needs to be rather precise.\u00A0 To solve it, figure out a circle that has the thrusters closest to equally-spaced around it.\u00A0 In other words, the three (or four) intersections need to be at as close to one hundred and twenty degrees (or ninety degrees) as you can make them.\u00A0 You are stuck with the one on the radial part; the most you\u0027ll be able to do is move it in or out from the centre of mass unless you add a cubic octagonal strut or the like--but it should be on the inside of the right angle.\u00A0 The finesse comes from placement of the thrusters on the far side of the lab from the long radial tube, since those thrusters\u00A0can be moved from side to side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor thruster placement, forget symmetry; you have to place them one at a time.\u00A0 That ought to make sense:\u00A0 symmetry is only effective on symmetrical craft.\u00A0 If the craft lacks symmetry, so does your propulsion solution.\u00A0 The trick is that the solution you want\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0symmetrical about the centre of mass, even though the vessel is not.\u00A0 Ideally, you would be able to calculate the correct thrust and limit the thruster nozzles accordingly, but there is no way to throttle individual nozzles.\u00A0 Single-direction \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports provide more flexibility but also potentially more headache.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you move this vessel,\u00A0don\u0027t forget to activate caps lock while translating, assuming you\u0027re going to do it in space--on the ground presents different challenges.\u00A0 That puts the thrusters into precision mode, which works to throttle asymmetric output a bit to correct for minor deficiencies in placement and further reduces or eliminates problems with torque.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter all that, note that there probably is no in-game way to totally eliminate torque on that vessel while constraining the major translation directions to coincide with the principal axes of the craft, meaning parallel to the axes of the lab (for the landing legs) and the radial tubes (for the docking ports), but it likely is quite possible to reduce it to something manageable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo conclude, I would place my ports slightly higher than the axis on the long radial tube, between the blue line and the hatch on the lab (at about the bottom of the door seam), and on the other side of the hatch a bit farther away from it than the second thruster is.\u00A0 Then I\u0027d\u00A0work from there.\u00A0 If need be, you can put one thruster on each of the three radial tubes and a fourth on the lab; however,\u00A0the increased radius both allows you greater precision to reduce torque in placement and\u00A0extracts greater punishment in the form of a longer lever arm if you err in\u00A0that placement.\u00A0 You may be best served by using advanced tweakables to shut off thrusters for rotational adjustments (use reaction wheels for that) and keeping \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E solely for translation, in which case you would want your thrusters as close to the centre of mass as you can get them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-26T19:23:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2018 07:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EThere\u0026#039;s another short section hiding on the other side that I didn\u0026#039;t notice at first.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"putnamto","CreatedById":184648,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-26T19:20:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor those that asked, this is how im getting it to orbit, with a test flight i was able to reach a perfectly circular orbit of 400k ap and 70k pe.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A2ZSsxT.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/A2ZSsxT.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe reason its assymetrical and it has landing legs is because im planning to build a surface station in orbit of the mun, then land it their. this is one of the four cardinal modules that will plug into the station core before landing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nand thank you very much \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125721-zhetaan/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125721\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125721-zhetaan/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Zhetaan\u003C/a\u003E you have given me plenty of food for thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-26T19:22:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2018 07:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by putnamto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-27T16:22:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs others have said, it\u0027s a LOT easier if your craft is symmetrical.
