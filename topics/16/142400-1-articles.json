The 100km target was the best but even that is worse than a normal gravity turn. A little tweaking of when you start and target altitude might get you a reasonable and consistent launch profile though, as long as your launch vehicles all have similar thrust to weight ratios throughout their flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/swampmonster/Kerbal%20space%20program/target%20following_zpsbb8hfeza.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022target%20following_zpsbb8hfeza.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
