When you say \u0027wobble\u0027 I think you mean that your craft just shakes apart, even in space. I failed my first attempt at the Jool 5 challenge because of this.

When a correction happens, either manually or with SAS, the craft will try to flex. If it is not rigid, it will bend and then try to straighten out. As it does this, different parts of the ship are acting on each other, changing the perception of the crafts direction of movement and making it less accurate. The front end throws the back end, and the back end retaliates by throwing the front end.\u00A0Using SAS of course will shake the ship apart as it tries to compensate for these exaggerated errors. Even if you are not using SAS, your indicators will show a drift that will not represent your total craft, as the different parts are not moving together. It\u0027s impossible then to really know what you should do with the controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can stop wobble by making your craft more rigid with struts etc. or by not caring where your craft is going.

I suppose if your craft is light enough, you can have a situation where you can\u0027t actually shake it apart without an honest effort, but the problem is the same. Your front doesn\u0027t know what your back end is doing, and your indicators are way off as to your direction of travel.
