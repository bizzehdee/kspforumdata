By the time my rocket is in orbit, there is ~800dv left on its (Edit: Skipper powered ) lifter stage, and planning a manoeuvre node tells me it\u0027s going to take about two minutes. Only one minute in, I drop that stage, and now I\u0027m powered by one nuclear engine and have 24 minutes left on the burn. So question number one, how do you time this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn several of my efforts, I\u0027ve found that, by the time I\u0027m 15 minutes in, I\u0027m pointing directly at the blue manoeuvre marker and yet my remaining dv on the node starts going up. My orbit doesn\u0027t look like it\u0027s moving. I can turn and point prograde and watch the orbit get a lot larger a lot quicker - but that doesn\u0027t address the fact that, based on the Alexmoon calculation, a large amount of the Eeloo burn is supposed to be on the normal plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you plan a move like this?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-24T08:19:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2014 08:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by technion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brooklyn666","CreatedById":88321,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T08:36:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour biggest problem is that you\u0027re starting your burn at the wrong time. The maneuver node is telling you your burn time based on your current engine, but it also assumes your burn will be one instantaneous impulse. What you want to to is time it so that you are halfway through your burn AT the node.

After a while you happen to be in a very different place and the blue marker is misleading - it doesn\u0027t show you right direction or dv anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two tricks for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrick 1: Notice where the blue marker is pointing at T\u002B0 and keep that direction even if the marker runs away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrick 2: Go to map view and check your trajectory and your planned trajectory. The planned trajectory has an escape marker on it (a circle) and when you put your mouse over it, you can see the time in which you are supposed to be leaving the SOI. Rotate the map and zoom in to see them both at maximum possible zoom (you need to rotate it so the planned trajectory is running \u0022towards you\u0022). To get roughly correct escape trajectory, you need to place your real trajectory\u0027s escape circle over this planned circle with matching timestamps. Forget about blue marker - continue burning in original direction while the two markers get closer. If the real one appears to run by the planned one, add radial/normal deviation to make them converge again. Also watch the time, don\u0027t let the real time go below the planned time or you\u0027ll need to correct retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will spend more dv than the maneuver told you. Not only you lost on Oberth effect, you also spend some dv on not burning in the right direction. But in the end, only small correction should be needed after leaving the SOI to get the intercept you need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-24T11:26:33Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2014 11:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T11:44:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022brooklyn666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022brooklyn666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E.
