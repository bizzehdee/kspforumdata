As someone said above, just click the first segment out straight, then drag inward to make a cone. One thing to be aware of - the fairing has to be closed to fly with it, IIRC. Either closed to a cone point like you want to do, or closed against another inline stack to make an interstage fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
