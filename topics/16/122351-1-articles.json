If that is the case, you are going too shallow. Your angles may be alright, but you sound like you are at a low degree at too low an altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me get you something I typed a while back; copy/pasted. Two different discussions. One is about your apoapsis. The other, attaining orbit.:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EYour apo is formed entirely from two places: 1) your vertical velocity (if no horizontal velocity exists); 2) your horizontal velocity at the peri. This is oversimplified but drives to my point.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EYou need high enough vertical velocity, but a fast enough horizontal velocity to prolong your time spent above a certain altitude. In essence, if you gun it straight up..sure you will make it very very high, but you are coming right back down. Similarly, if you gun it straight up, your time spent at the apo is very limited. You extend that time with horizontal velocity.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EBut of the two lessons above, the most important is your horizontal velocity. And you won\u0027t get 2000\u002B mps when you have only a couple seconds at your apo altitude to complete an orbit (no I won\u0027t say circularize. I have no idea why that is trendy to say).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAnyways, this means you need to balance your vertical velocity with your horizontal. But with an atmosphere, you need to do so delicately and not in an aggressive turn.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI shoot for 250-500 mps in vertical within the first 30sec. This is why the first stage is so important and solid booster are amazing. But you need to plan ahead for your horizontal climb while keeping in mind you move faster outside the atmosphere. In essence, make your climb nice and round, but not too round, rather than straight and pointy. This will give you ample time at apo to burn horizontally.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EWalkthrough:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAt takeoff, depending on the speed (if faster make it slightly more aggressive), IMMEDIATELY turn horizontally about 2\u002B degrees. You have little atmo resistance and you need to have gravity start helping you with your aim towards the horizon. If you turn too late, it will either be really hard to make the turn and you climb too high/sharp (if you are going fast), or you overturn and the atmo points your ship downward (if you are going too slow).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EBy setting the degree like this, gravity will slowly point your prograde closer and closer to the horizon as you will slowly accelerate past you 300-500 mps. If it is pointing down too quickly, a lot of the time the cure is acceleration, so just increase your thrust. But too much may kill potential delta v because of wind resistance. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EBy 30,000 alt, I like to be at about 45 degrees. Compensate accordingly. Slow your throttle as needed. What is important is \u003C/span\u003Eburn time NOT speed. The longer you burn, the less resistance. Think about it: if you gun it in atmo, you are limited by terminal velocity or the lesser issue of atmo resistance not to the extent of terminal velocity. But by burning long and slow, but in a manner that still gets you out of the atmo, you save all your delta v for lower atmo/no atmo acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep your acceleration consistently and evenly dropping, by gravity, from the 45 deg on through the apo and speed up or slow down as needed (if your apo gets to the altitude you want, you can stop and reignite if atmo slows you down a bit). In that burn, keep the gravity turn going as much as comfortable (20 more deg by 50,000 alt, for example), and use throttle to determine your ultimate apo, pre-final horizontal burn. If you have to, aim below the horizon or higher if you are in the target apo altitude but wish to increase your horizontal acceleration. You don\u0027t have to only point prograde once in thinner air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time you hit the apo, you will be at a much much higher horizontal speed, but still need to burn to get into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn before, through, and after the apo as needed. I like to aim so my apo stays on top of me (e.g. pointing up more, 5ish degrees, when I am close to it), but too much of this kills potential horizontal delta v accel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m rushing this at work and didn\u0027t proof so I hope it makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAs you launch, immediately, and VERY DELICATELY, aim the rocket a degree or two East. From there on, let gravity turn you and use about half throttle. The idea behind the best, most stable climb to orbit is not speed (although you need it to qualify the climb since too slow a climb destroys any chance of horizontal acceleration a minute into your climb to orbit) but instead\u003C/span\u003Eburn time. (as for speed; what I mean is that a low speed reduces the usefulness of your overall deltav, while a high speed can do the same. If you are going fast at low altitude, even near horizontally in preparation for orbit, you lost a lot of potential delta v because you fight atmosphere. On the other hand, if you go too slow and lose your asparagus without burning any horizontal, sure you got into space, but now you have to burn 2000\u002B delta v horizontally to get an orbit in a short window with a single engine because once you are at the peak of your climb, it becomes harder and harder to stay out of the atmosphere with a low horizontal velocity). But careful; this means your gravity turn will be more aggressive. You do not necessarily need to aim into your prograde the entire time. Back off a bit and aim more vertically if it is too aggressive. 45 deg is ideal at 35-45k altitude, for example. This slow, natural turn prevents the bend you are seeing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T15:22:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf by burn up you mean having reentry effects, then it\u0027s normal and not dangerous at all.
