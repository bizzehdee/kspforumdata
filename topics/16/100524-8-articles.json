The take off problems are just a matter of having the gear too far back; shift them forwards to just behind CoM, and raise them on hardpoints if necessary to avoid tailstrike.\n\nThe main problem with tail-less deltas is related to that rearwards CoM. The horizontal and vertical stabilisers just don\u0027t have enough leverage. So, get the CoM as far forwards as you can, and make sure that the vertical stabiliser/s are decently sized and that there\u0027s a fair bit of wingspan right up the back. Compound sweep wings (i.e. reducing sweep and increasing span towards the rear; stick some strakes on the front of your wings) often work nicely on deltas.\n\n![LGBUwF4.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LGBUwF4.jpg)\n\nRe: canard instability. Think about what happens when the nose of a plane starts to pitch up out of control. Wing area at the rear of the plane will tend to pull it back to level flight; wing area at the front will pull it further over. Hence canards promoting instability. But this is also why they\u0027re good for manouevrability; you get heaps of pitch authority for just a relatively small surface. They\u0027re good when used appropriately.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T15:21:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 03:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T15:09:10Z","Content":"Yeah - I was thinking about suggesting moving the mono tank up between the cockpit and the drone core, but I didn\u0027t know if that would\u0027ve moved the docking port into an impractical position or not (I never got a good look at the underside of the plane so I don\u0027t know if the original designer put an extra set of structural intakes down there or not; if he hadn\u0027t, I wouldn\u0027t see any issue with setting the port up to open up from the ventral side instead of the dorsal).

In my experience, monoprop makes for reasonably good ballast if nothing else. I did move it well forward from where it was originally; in retrospect I wonder if it would\u0027ve been better to put it in between the cockpit and the cargo bay.\n\nDesign actually incorporated a third engine originally - I took it off and replaced it with the drag chute once I started flying it. TWR was over 1 with the extra engine and the design was getting some pretty high Q at low altitude. Forgot to drain that back fuel tank after I removed the engine though; from my final fuel stats I definitely didn\u0027t need it. I suppose the design has a good fuel reserve as a result though.\n\nI was pretty sure I\u0027d overSASed it. On the other hand, RCS Build Aid was telling me I had 10 kN of torque from the main engines, so I knew I needed at least one. Plus I figured the extra mass would draw the CoM forward a bit. I think that if I were to double up the PB-NUK and move it over to the sides of the cargo bay there\u0027d be enough space for a small payload. Another reason to move that monoprop tank in between the cockpit and the cargo bay...get the cargo bay closer to the CoM. Of course, that would make the SAS less effective, wouldn\u0027t it?\n\nGot both NavUtilities and TAC Fuel Balancer installed - can\u0027t really see that from my UI on account of low graphics settings.\n\nWill have to think about those chutes..."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T13:25:27Z","Content":"Use RealChutes if you\u0027re going to use anything - you can add proper drag chutes, which can help considerably given spaceplanes can have some fairly high landing speeds."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T13:54:20Z","Content":"The trick with high-power ships is to climb steeply enough that you\u0027re out of the soup before you get too fast, and be sensible with the throttle if cruising at low altitude.\n\nDrag chutes can work, but they\u0027re really not necessary except in very rare circumstances. S-turns and airbrakes do just fine (as does getting down low with engines off early enough for drag to do the job). And when you do want extra after-landing brakes (Duna etc), a couple of tiny radial engines aimed forwards do nicely.\n\nI\u0027d change the Mk2 monoprop for a Mk2 LF tank, change the nacelles to LF/O tanks, move the drone core, docking port and passenger bay to the front and put the cargo bay over CoM (so that cargo doesn\u0027t unbalance the ship). If not using a third engine, consider replacing the drag chute with a shielded docking port and changing the inline port to more tank or cargo space. If you must have drag chutes, radials work as well as inline.\n\nI\u0027d also add some structural intakes at the bases of the tailfins, slid back so as to make them look more supported. One SAS unit is plenty, and rotate the PB-NUK so as to not obstruct the bay. The placement of the RCS doesn\u0027t appear to give any lateral thrust; pairs midway angled 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 above and below the wing on the lateral tanks, in line with CoM, would work.\n\nTo sort out engine torque, shift the lateral tanks microscopically up and down until it reduces.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T14:00:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 02:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T14:12:21Z","Content":"Oddly enough I end up using drag chutes on my smaller spaceplanes - the large enough ones seem quite happy with wheelbrakes, the little ones tend to attempt all sorts of tarmac acrobatics."}]}
