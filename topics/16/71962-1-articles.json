Do this in Target Mode, of course. Not Orbit Mode or Surface Mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll have to decide what speed to approach, and I suggest hitting F5 while learning so you can try multiple approaches. But so long as you \u0022keep the yellow thing on the pink thing\u0022 as I tend to say it, you\u0027ll always be fine. But this only works when you\u0027re close to the target (200km for an asteroid is fine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re curious, I made a video that details everything from asteroid selection to rendezvous (but nothing past that).

Match relative speeds then get heading towards it. Your orbit is around 20,000 times bigger than LKO, and about 150 times bigger than even the widest orbit possible around Kerbin, so in relative terms that 200 km intercept is like a 10 metre intercept in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linkxsc","CreatedById":67350,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-10T16:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EManaged 1 in deep space near kerbin last night.
