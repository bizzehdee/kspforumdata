Took me a few tries to figure it out, but become acquainted with the docking mode and using your RCS. Using your main engine only for docking can prove to be quite challenging. Changing your view to CHASE will also help with orientation with your thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T11:22:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs your problem with docking or rendezvous?

He taught me. He can teach you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend a mod called docking cam. it makes docking a little more realistic, plus you wont have to switch to docking mode, which I\u0027ve always found to be rather useless. Best thing to do might be to rebind your RCS translation controls to your numpad. You can then control attitude with your left hand and your translation with your right easily without having to worry about keys that aren\u0027t lined up.
