When I\u0027m in EVA the kerbals always stay upright all the time and can never flip, is there a button or setting I need to click to change this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T19:12:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you click-and-drag on the kerbalnaut in question, you can actually change the way he\u0027s facing.
