Lift is also a factor of velocity, so the faster you go the less wings you need and the less wings you have the faster you can go. But less wings also means higher slowest speed and less glide.\n\nAnd the shock cones have the least drag per air intake as of 1.0.4 AFAIK"},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T22:42:40Z","Content":"pfft.\n\ntime to let MJ shine over KER.\n\nMy friends, MechJeb has an \u0022atmospheric drag\u0022 value, which you can have visible through your entire flight!\n\nNo need to get the terminal velocity and do the maths.\n\nIt provides your atmospheric drag value in m/s much like the nav speedo. \n\nFWIW, typical flights will experience anywhere between 1-15 m/s drag. This represents constant losses while the air counters your momentum.\n\nWith a fairly aerodynamic shape and no fairings, I can consistently keep my maximum drag values below 5, as long as you don\u0027t cap ~250m/s below 10,000m\n\nNote that atmospheric is thickest (and thus the most drag is present) around 8000-12000 m, after ~20-25k, drag decreases substantially until it is largely moot above 35000m (unless you try and hang out there for too long)\n\nAll of this information has been acquired using mechjeb to get my atmospheric information. This makes it an essential mod for me"},{"CreatedByName":"Tazin","CreatedById":147235,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T16:05:24Z","Content":"Nice catch for MJ! i don\u0027t use mechjeb but i think i will install it and get the information tools without the stuff that sort of feels like cheating (not hating on people who play different than me). But still, i feel like there should be a simpler mod to do some basic and simple calculations in the buiilding process of stock aero planes: add total lift and divide by weight, add total drag of exposed parts . . . or at least something that shows the inherent drag of each part, so one can choose part properly."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T16:09:10Z","Content":"M/s doesn\u0027t make sense to me as a unit of drag.

To me it makes sense, but that value would include piloting, trajectory, and a lot of stuff that i don\u0027t care about in plane design. What i mean is, if i put wings in an orange tank, it is more draggy than a MK2 plane, so how do you put a number on that difference, right on the SPH?"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T18:21:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The value Violent Jeb is talking about is \u0022total m/s lost due to drag\u0022.\n\nIIRC that refers to drag losses during flight, a number that should accumulate over time while flying in atmo. Similar to the counters for steering losses and gravity losses."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T18:22:35Z","Content":"If you want a drag dispaly, and other stuff, [get AeroGUI.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117141-1-0-AeroGUI-v1-0-28-Apr)"}]}
