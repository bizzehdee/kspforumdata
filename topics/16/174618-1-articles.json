Most of the minibiomes at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E are touch-sensitive. So from a distance of more than a centimeter, for example, the flagpole or the buildings would appear to be in a completely different mini-biome than when you touch them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneCash","CreatedById":81605,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-05T03:42:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I was kind of hoping for something that might highlight the building a different color than the hex around it.

The surface scanner just says \u0022shores\u0022 even when it\u0027s on the runway or the pad, or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E hex...
