This stage is made up of seven orange tanks, with a total of 13 nuclear engines and 3 skipper engines. The NERVAS are going to be doing most of the work, but the Skippers are there for a little extra power. Anyway, I was sending it into an 80km orbit to dock with the other parts of the ship. I told mechjeb to do it, since it\u0027s much more efficient and precise than me. The first few stages went with no problems, but when it activated the Skippers and NERVAS one of the skipper tanks was apparently taking fuel from one of the nuclear engine tanks, which is strange, considering there are no fuel lines on the whole ship (the first few stages are asparagus staged, but they\u0027re gone at this point). Is there anybody who knows what this is or how to fix it?
