If you\u0027re in Career Mode, it\u0027s possible that you\u0027ve maxed out the number of missions you can have at one time.

It would really benefit you to send a relay sat to Minmus before landing there, anyway. Un-piloted ships may not be able to follow\u00A0through on planned maneuvers\u00A0if your ship is blocked from communicating with KerbNet when the time comes.

If you can\u0027t wait to complete the other missions, first, I\u0027d suggest saving the game and then land on Minmus anyway to see what happens. If it works, great.
