They help but I don\u0027t need them anymore. Ignore the COM and take the winglets off, you should still be able to get into orbit just fine reliably with anything that is remotely aerodynamic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is this, if you point the rocket too far off the direction you are going, you are going to flip out and lose control. All you have to do is keep your rocket inside the circle that is your velocity vector. That is it. Also you can judge how close you are by watching how much control SAS is putting in to counter forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything else is learning when to start your gravity turn (and I mean a real gravity turn, I have done it without SAS and no control inputs for something like a dozen seconds on end.) so that your velocity vector doesn\u0027t fall too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I do is start my GT at 75 M/s. I like speeds because it auto compensates for different rocket TWR\u0027s within limits. I Normally go for a starting TWR of 1.25, but anything in the ballpark should work. I tilt to 85 degrees when I get to 75 M/S. After that I follow the velocity vector down until 25 degrees. I try to aim to be there after 20,000 meters. So if my velocity vector is falling faster, I will lag behind it but still in the circle to slow it down. After about 30 KM, you can point the rocket much more aggressively. After that every time my Apoapsis is 10 km higher I aim 5 degrees lower. So at an apoapsis of 30 KM I am at 20 degrees. At 40 I am at 15 degrees and so on to horizontal at an apoapsis of 70KM. You can get to orbit with 3600 DV.
