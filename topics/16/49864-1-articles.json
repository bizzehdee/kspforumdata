I landed it there on one mission and drove it to my base site on another mission. I parked it in an open area and set the brake. Now when I go to it or my base ship near it, the back end blows up after 2 or 3 seconds. Any way to stop this? Luckily I have a save so I have tried different things like loading it and switching off the brakes or just watching it from the base ship but it always explodes. Any way to prevent this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T17:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you post a picture of your rover? It\u0027s hard to say without knowing what you\u0027re doing, but my guess is either you have overlapping parts or it\u0027s just a random Kraken attack and the only thing you can do is launch another rover. I had a problem with a rover where it would explode when it became decoupled from my descent package, but that happened immediately. The solution was to reverse the decoupled so it remained attached to my rover. I hope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T18:09:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are more than 2.25kms from another vessel, it\u0027s not fully simulauted and is really just a point in space. When you get within that distance, the game \u0022creates\u0022 the ship by loading it from a saved state. Sometimes when that happens, part of the ship can be generated stuck into the ground, causing it to explode. Does that sound like what\u0027s happening to you? If so, there isn\u0027t a fix for it right now, though the guys know about it and plan to fix it. Meanwhile, try parking the rover in a different spot, where the terrain might not coincide with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T02:16:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepending on whether or not the part count is high enough, the physics can fail to load, sometimes causing random explosions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if it\u0027s In certain areas on other planets, most often the north and south poles, the textures/models are glitched, and parts will randomly explode, disassemble or \u0022jump.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzerknoef","CreatedById":90599,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T16:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I had a similar problem, my rover topled really slowly sat there upside down for about 2 secs and then just exploded launching a lethlal rain of parts\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T20:41:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had an issue where one of my rovers would shake violently when not attached to a ship.
