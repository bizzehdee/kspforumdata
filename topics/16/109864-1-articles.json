Even with all of the engines and torque wheels disabled, it pitches back and forth constantly, as well as constantly changing it\u0027s orbit. Is there any way to find out what is causing this? The motion doesn\u0027t seem to come from a particular spot, as the changes in rotation don\u0027t appear to be uniform. eg it will swing back and forth on the same axis without rotating. KER shows 0 Thrust, 0 accel, but a thrust offset angle of 0.3 and thrust torque of 5.7kNm.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T00:17:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 12:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by icedown**"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T01:16:21Z","Content":"That might be the phantom acceleration bug.

The craft should then be still and your orbit should be constant."},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T19:35:09Z","Content":"It is rotating as well, this happens with all SAS, and reaction wheels disabled."},{"CreatedByName":"TORCHWOOD","CreatedById":144040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T02:06:58Z","Content":"There\u0027s an option on the debug menu under physics.

My theory is that gravity is acting on individual parts and if the CoM is not the center of the vessel, then the vessel starts to tumble and translates the movement into smallish orbital changes that eventually accumulate into larger ones. \n\nTry putting it into a higher orbit and see if this remedies it, or at least subdues it."}]}
