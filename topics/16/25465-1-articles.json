It varies depending on how I\u0027ve configured the wings but it usually goes out of control between 300-400m/s. I\u0027ve seen people manage to reach well over 1km/s before needing to hit the rockets to finish the orbit off, and I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s causing the issue here for me. I took some screenshots showing the centres of mass/lift/thrust if they illuminate the issue to anybody better experienced with horizontal takeoffs than me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ik2dokP,QDc2xTM,kCC7TL5,GoOnusx#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImgur linked to avoid filling the OP with large pictures.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ik2dokP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ik2dokP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-05T14:26:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2013 02:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T14:28:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty hard to tell from the pic, it might be a drag issue though, how about you post your craft file so others can try it out? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T14:46:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour Center of Lift is very close to the Center of Mass.
