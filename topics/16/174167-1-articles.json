I assume this effects the efficiency of jet engines. I have a jet powered boat en route to Laythe and another being prepared for launch. The one en route and the new one I\u0027m working on do not have air intakes other than the engine nacelle parts, one for each engine. These provide 5 air, which is more than the engines i\u0027m using require on Kerbin at sea level. But I doubt sea level on Laythe has the same conditions. Should I add air intakes to the boat I\u0027m working on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-22T12:39:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpamming air intakes does not produce any extra air.

As your speed increases, your intakes gather a lot more air. So if you find you experience flameouts going from zero throttle to full throttle at a nearly dead stop -- then just be more gentle with the throttle and you should be fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigcalm","CreatedById":143587,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-23T12:26:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoughly, sea level on Laythe == 3000 metres altitude on Kerbin.\u00A0 Now you\u0027re testing a boat which makes this trickier, but really all you want to know is whether your airtakes / engines combo works there.\u00A0 In which case, build a small plane using the same number of engines and intakes, fly it to the mountains, and see if the engines work at an altitude of 3000 metres.\u00A0 If they do, on Laythe they should be perfectly fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blakemw","CreatedById":168819,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-23T16:06:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223360852\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174167\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221524387759\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151656\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zosma Procyon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/22/2018 at 12:02 PM, Zosma Procyon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0These provide 5 air, which is more than the engines i\u0027m using require on Kerbin at sea level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv title=\u0022Found 1 error in text\u0022\u003E\n1\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not actually anything to do with how much air the intake provides, it is how much it can store, which is usually pretty meaningless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen comparing one intake with another, at low speeds and altitudes it\u0027s good enough to compare the intake area, at *very* low speeds, compare the intake area * effective base speed.
