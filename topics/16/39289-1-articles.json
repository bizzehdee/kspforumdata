Gone are the days I could end a mission and kid myself that it wasn\u0027t a horrible death for all involved. I\u0027m just not going to be happy if I can\u0027t count my Kerbals into space and count them all back home again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is time for a revolution, for me at least, in design, building ships that can be recovered easily, ships that can land, and ships that can, in emergencies, be used to dock with an rescue Kerbals from other ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo more Kerbal orphans. No more letters to Kerbal moms. The body count stops here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was wondering if anybody had any tips or designs they might be willing to share? I\u0027m specifically working at the moment on some fairly basic concepts, and I\u0027d appreciate any input people might have on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. An easy to use escape pod, either a sort of standard capsule build to use for all craft that can be relied upon to detach and fly home from a reasonable range and come down from orbit, or some kind of pod I can have the Kerbals run to when things get hairy. My previous experiments with this have tended to leave me with an escape pod that is too big though, and it becomes more work to get into orbit than it should be, and gets in the way of actually doing anything in space itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A crew transfer vehicle. Am thinking of using an SSTO for this, but am thinking it might be simpler to use some sort of basic shuttle type design that launches vertically off a rocket but has enough lift on re-entry to actually land softly. Essentially this would be a flying bus that could return the passengers safely. Was thinking something like this will be required to bring folks home from stations or from any rescue missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. A rescue ship. A proper Thunderbirds are go cleanup vessel. Something with loads of useful equipment and other gizmos (possibly from mods) to either collect the crew of a damaged/stricken/immobilised vessel, or refuel that vessel, or dock up and tug things away. Am thinking such a vehicle would be entirely spacebound once launched, have it deliver rescued crew to a transfer vehicle to drop them home, so it could be bigger and capable of longer range. Maybe docked onto a station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody got any thoughts? I\u0027ve seen rescue missions as a recurring theme in the game but that was when it was just a part of the fun, now it\u0027s serious business to get everybody home. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"espm400","CreatedById":71109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T02:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll start by saying that I\u0027m pretty big into mods, so if you\u0027re against those, the rest of what I say might as well be blowing smoke. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Barring that, you can always just build one out of structure and sepratrons. Just be sure to use docking ports to jettison it when it\u0027s no longer required. Step two, you\u0027ve got your Kerbals on an orbiting station and something has gone catastrophically wrong. For my escape vehicles now, I use a three man command pod with the smallest 2.5m tank, four small radial engines, a heat shield (for DRE), and parachutes. Usually I can get away with launching three or four at a time on a single lifter rocket, that way I have more than enough attached to my space station to get all of the crew home safely.

As I\u0027ve said many times, the original KSP aerodynamic and drag models are just awful, and FAR solves that issue. As for B9, don\u0027t get me wrong, but I hate the look of the stock plane parts, again B9 solves this problem. Not to mention just the sheer number of options it affords you (in your case, the six Kerbal crew compartment makes for a good crew transfer pod).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. As for the rescue ship, I always have a remotely controlled one in orbit around any planet I plan on building a base on. In my case, it wasn\u0027t much more than a frame with docking ports, some fuel and an engine. The crew would come up in pre-dropped LVs with just enough dV to get a stable orbit and dock. Just remember if you build it this way, you\u0027ll need more dV than you think to get back, as the ship is now toting the planetary escape vehicles. I suppose you could build one with habitats on board, but those tend to be much heavier, and usually need to be built in orbit. Lastly, the \u0027I missed the planet\u0027 rescue vehicle. I\u0027ve never built one of these, since I tend to greatly over-engineer my LV\u0027s, I always have enough to get an orbit with my target. However, there is always the possibility of catastrophic failure mid-burn, or something along those lines, in which case, you shouldn\u0027t need much more than what you were using for your inter-planetary ship. Just modify it a bit, maybe some extra docking ports, Romfarer\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/robotic-arms-pack/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ERobotic Arms Pack\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E or the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25563-0-20-KAS-v0-3-1-Kerbal-Attachment-System\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal Attachment System\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E work great if you have a stranded crew in a capsule with no docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I hope this helps.

So low lateral velocities wont be so hard\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- when going down from orbit, burn against the current velocity vector until it is right at the upper center of your navball - this means you will fall straight down. It then the velocity vector moves away, use RCS to move SIDEWAYS (i, j, k, l-keys) - dont turn, but use RCS to burn sideways against that movement. So the velocity vector stays centered on the navball\u0027s top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- if your landing place is not flat, pray - or have a lander that is wide, so it wont matter that much \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
