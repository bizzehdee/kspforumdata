Part placement and stacking order matters in KSP. There are some things you can do to reduce or even eliminate the tendency to flip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Pod_zpsav1n8wnt.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/Pod_zpsav1n8wnt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrinciples for aerodynamically stable reentry:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: The center of gravity should be as close to the ablator as possible. Stack your capsule so that physically compact and dense components ride near the ablator, while large and light components with high surface area are far away. This creates a torque moment that tends to self-correct deviations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo determine the correct order of series stacked parts, simply multiply their mass by their height. Highest values go closest to the ablator. Lowest values farthest away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: If you have solar panels, mount them as I have here. Slightly rotated, tucked in to keep out of the heat, and as far away from the ablator as possible. This will add drag to the \u0022back\u0022 of the reentry capsule, acting like a drogue. Remember, physicsless parts such as surface mount panels don\u0027t apply mass and drag to their own center of gravity, but rather the center of gravity of whatever part they\u0027re attached to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0This is a nice, stable design for an early career science capsule.
