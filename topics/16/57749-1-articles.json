First for consistency with the landing legs, which are shown in the position they will be on the pad (ladders are shown deployed in the VAB but will be packed up when they appear on the pad). Second is that there are a few cases where you want the ladder initially deployed, for example if you are role playing a mission and have your kerbal actually walk out to the pad and board the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
