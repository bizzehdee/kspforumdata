I am always overshooting or undershooting by hundreds of Km sometimes. Is there a trick to where you place your Pe in relation to KSC? I would imagine you should try to keep it in front of KSC so you don\u0027t over shoot.

The easiest way to do this is to correct after missing by several tens of km or to steer during re-entry. Clearly, hitting anything accurately with an unguided projectile would be difficult, as assuming that you simply plop your PE down on the opposite side of the world slightly beyond where you want to land, a very subtle twitch in height could change your landing position by quite a significant distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy experience with fully unguided landings is that landing something on the greens is very difficult to impossible without modifying your orbit or waiting several orbits due to inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T07:03:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe good thing about planes is that you do have some cross-range capabilities with them. Hence, landing at KSC is a simple matter of gliding through the lower layers of the atmosphere (it helps if you have a bit of jet fuel left) or simply turn around over the ocean. I even landed at the island runway once.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T07:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo trick, just practice and experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry doing your re-entry burn always at the same place and take mental note of how far east of KSC the orbit line intersects the ocean.

How much you should aim to overshoot by depends on your ship and its orbit, so it\u0027s something you just have to develop a sense for through experience, assuming you don\u0027t want to use MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring re-entry, your trajectory will naturally decline. At this point, assuming you have no fuel and must glide it in, you still want your trajectory to place you on the other side of the runway, since you obviously can\u0027t accelerate to compensate if you aimed too short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it is simply a matter of performing braking manoeuvres, such as S turns, as necessary to adjust your glide slope. You at least need to know the glide speed of your craft to be able to pull this off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you have some fuel left, things will be much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverchain","CreatedById":83000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T12:14:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStarting from a 100x100km orbit I try and get PE down to about 35-40km just beyond KSC; but it varies greatly depending on the orbit you\u0027re coming from, the steepness of the descent angle, the attitude and design of your plane and so on.
