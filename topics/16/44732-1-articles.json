No matter how may intakes you have for the jets, sooner or later you simply don\u0027t have any more oxidizer for the jets. And higher up wing lift becomes less significant, and finally only dead mass. But your question rightly deals with mass or lift or efficient design. Are you maxing the throttle or holding back? Regardless, while basic jets are more fuel efficient and less massive, they don\u0027t have the thrust or iSP of the turbojet. As such they can deal with a little more payload than the basic. You might want to switch out to turbos. Besides, their iSP actually increases with altitude while there is oxidizer available; the basic starts whining down well before that. You might want to try that switch out before modifying your craft further.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-02T21:30:35Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2013 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dispatcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGrammar.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brevillance","CreatedById":78774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T21:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may want to consider adding a bit more surface for lift, although at that altitude and speed you should have more then enough with the rockets to punch out into space. My Kerbal rescue plane which is only 4 jet engines can maintain altitude at 20k quite easily, make sure the fuel is distributing equally and that your center of lift compensates for a changing center of mass. Generally at 20k you should be able to pitch up quite a lot and keep going, although you\u0027ll probably want the turbo jet engines after about 14k and 600m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy rescue plane is only jet engines as its inter-kerbin (not an SSTO) so i go for ISP since it doesnt need to cruse at 1k m/s or 20k\u002B altitude, but if your building a SSTO you should ditch the normal jet engines for turbos, they output better power and can give you more kick at higher altitudes and faster speeds. Try adding a wider wing span, and more lift (you can lay down flaps flat onto your wings/under your wings to give bonus lift, if your having problems, slap a few extra flaps near the back to give some extra lift).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeres a pic of my Inter-kerbin design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1328.photobucket.com/albums/w538/Brevillance/2013-08-31_00001_zpsef274c2f.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-08-31_00001_zpsef274c2f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zaeo","CreatedById":52597,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T00:02:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot only that, but adding a tilt on your wings downwards at the tips will actually improve lift at high altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T00:45:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zaeo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zaeo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot only that, but adding a tilt on your wings downwards at the tips will actually improve lift at high altitudes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...What exactly do you mean by that?
