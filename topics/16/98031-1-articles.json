I put a second SCANsat probe up and allowed it to finish the hi-res scanning, at 750km, and then parked it back down in a circular polar orbit at 250km. It disappeared at some point today, Jan 27 2015... either that, or yesterday. It was there yesterday when I began a new science probe journey to Moho. I noticed today, coming in for Moho orbit intercept, that it was gone. I\u0027ve checked the Persistent.sfs file, but the probe is not there... just the accomplishments are.
