That\u0027s why in real life, it\u0027s very common to slingshot a probe past Jupiter. It\u0027s also why it\u0027s rarely worth it to use Mun, and pretty much never worth it to use Minmus.\u00A0It also has to be easier to get to than your ultimate destination. Maybe that sounds obvious, but people use Eve a lot because it\u0027s nearby and its orbit isn\u0027t too crazy.\u00A0And the exact angle and timing of encountering the assisting body is crucial to the effect it has; you can think of the shape that your orbit makes through the SOI as being like a maneuver performed at that point of your solar orbit, to some extent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for when to launch, you generally use a good launch window for the assisting body, but there\u0027s no guarantee that that will give you a good route to the destination body. That part is either luck or experimentation; some planetary alignments are very advantageous, and some aren\u0027t. As far as I can tell, even the experts can\u0027t plan assists as easily as you would plan a normal Hohmann transfer. Rather, they master the underlying mechanics of how assists work, then search and experiment until the optimal route appears. But there are some tricks you can use; for example, if you want multiple assists in a row from the same body, then your orbit after the first one needs to be in resonance with the assisting body, meaning that your orbital period is a multiple of its orbital period, or vice versa, or some fractional relationship like 2:3 (i.e., you do 2 orbits in the time it does 3), such that you end up at the same place at the same time again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, my direct experience with this is no greater than yours, but those are the things that I\u0027m pretty sure about.

In general only Eve, Kerbin, and Jool should be used for flybys as the other bodies are too small to be worth the trouble. Here\u0027s how I get to them all...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get to Moho from Kerbal you should fly by Eve. This is both the hardest one to execute and the one that gives the most benefit, little Moho is moving so fast that even a small mistake in timing the Kerbin departure or Eve flyby will make you miss Moho. However once your ship is in an orbit that crosses Moho\u0027s orbit it is usually easy to plan a Moho encounter several orbits out with only a small adjustment to your path. Even better is to go Kerbin-Eve-Eve-Moho but that requires a double flyby which neither FF nor TOT can plan for you. I use my Lambert spreadsheet to find double flybys, it can be found in the FF post. It requires trial-and-error to find a flyby, if you study\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/67400-lowest-delta-v-to-moho/\u0022\u003E this old challenge\u003C/a\u003E you will find us working out things like when the best times to flyby Eve are and how to set up the Eve double encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get back from Moho to Kerbin you should also use Eve, Moho-Eve-Kerbin is rather easy if you can wait a year or two at Moho for the next window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo flyby needed to get to Eve, though you can save about 60m/s by using a Mun flyby, see the link in the Jool flyby below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo flyby needed to get to Duna, but you can go K-Eve-Duna if you want to get to Duna cheaply outside the normal Hohmann windows from Kerbin. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/71716-an-opposition-class-mission-to-duna-with-eve-flyby/\u0022\u003ESee here\u003C/a\u003E for an example of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDres is the hardest. I have found that using a flyby of Duna to get to Dres is not useful, because Duna is too small to change your path much if you fly by it with enough energy to get to Dres, so the windows are very rare (~30 Kerbin years apart) and the gains are less than 50m/s. I even tried a K-D-D-D-Dres (triple flyby!) and find I spent more on mid-course corrections than I saved in using Duna. However, it is can be advantageous to use Jool to get to Dres! Although it takes about 200m/s more to get to Jool than Dres you can knock\u00A0 more than 500m/s off your Dres arrival speed for a net savings. If you use Eve to get to Jool you can save even more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get to Jool cheaply you should go to Eve first. Using typical values (rather than best possible with perfect alignments) it costs about 2000m/s to get from low Kerbin orbit directly to Jool. It\u0027s about 1900m/s to go K-Duna-Jool. It\u0027s about 1300-1500m/s to go K-Eve-K-Jool. It\u0027s about 1100m/s to go K-E-K-K-J. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72760-how-to-go-from-low-kerbin-orbit-to-jool-orbit-for-1051-ms/\u0022\u003EHere is a thread\u003C/a\u003E that gives mission examples of KEKKJ. I found that superb window using Lambert and trial-and-error. Another intriguing option for getting to Jool is a Juno-style Kerbin flyby with a deep space manuever.

Because they orbit so slowly there are extended periods with no fast and cheap window for this, but if you can get to Jool it can throw you to Eeloo wherever it is if you are patient. Note that you can \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/76172-lowest-delta-v-to-eeloo/\u0022\u003Euse Eve to get to Jool and from there to Eeloo,\u003C/a\u003E check out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/77575-sst-eeloo-and-back-challenge/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=1339167\u0022\u003Ethis trip\u003C/a\u003E I made using KEKKJ-Eeloo, and then Eeloo-J-K to get back. Nowadays with the modern aero model requiring lower Kerbin re-entry speeds it is useful to flyby Eve on the way back from the outer system to reduce your Kerbin arrival speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember the concept of synodic periods, in the Flyby Finder primer I give a table showing the periods between which the relative positions of the planets repeat, if you find one good window it will often repeat after a set period.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA uses more tricks than FF or TOT can calculate, for instance deep space maneuvers and multiple orbits between encounters, I do not anticipate writing anything that handles those anytime soon. Does Rich Purnell play KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a final note on flybys- they are not too forgiving of errors in timing. The more flybys you do the more precise the early ones have to be or you will require bigger and bigger course corrections to stay on track, or you might miss the last planet altogether. Try to leave the start planet within an hour of the time that TOT or FF gives you, and remember when doing mid-course corrections that it is more important to have your flyby periapsis at the right time than at the right altitude or speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T03:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaking the broad view:\u00A0 there are two aspects of gravity assists:\u00A0 the easy part and the hard part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easy part is:\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003Espeed me up\u003C/strong\u003E or \u003Cstrong\u003Eslow me down\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 That is, it\u0027s really easy to set up a gravity assist that will add energy to your orbit (i.e. speed you up), or take away energy from your orbit (i.e. slow you down).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hard part is:\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003Esend me to a specific destination\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 That\u0027s really, really hard, for two reasons.\u00A0 First, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eaiming\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E is hard, because even a tiny error will make huge differences in where you end up.\u00A0 Second, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etiming\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E is hard, because if you\u0027re at planet A, and you want to use planet B to get to planet C, then you have to wait for a good alignment of all three planets, which is very tricky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if all you want to do is the \u0022easy\u0022 kind of gravity assist (where all you care about is changing your speed and you\u0027re not trying to aim at anything in particular), then that\u0027s pretty straightforward.\u00A0 Probably the most common example of this sort of maneuver is using a reverse gravity assist from Tylo when you arrive at Jool.\u00A0 You can use Tylo to slow you down so that you\u0027re captured to Jool, saving a lot of dV.\u00A0 This is a very simple maneuver because you\u0027re not particularly aiming at any specific destination-- all you want is to capture to Jool, and you can fine-tune your orbit to arrive at a particular moon afterwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother example of an \u0022easy\u0022 type of maneuver is if you\u0027re using Eve to reduce your dV to Moho... but that is typically accompanied by a fair amount of multi-orbit navigation after the Eve encounter, unless you manage to get really lucky with Moho\u0027s placement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, if you want to do the \u0022hard\u0022 kind of gravity assist (e.g. use planet A to get to planet B)... well, that\u0027s hard.\u00A0 Personally, I never bother with this type of maneuver-- it\u0027s not worth the time or the hassle, and the amount of dV savings isn\u0027t all that much.\u00A0 But then, I\u0027m goal-oriented and am interested in getting where I\u0027m going with the least amount of fuss.\u00A0 If, on the other hand, you want to do it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebecause\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it\u0027s hard (i.e. just for the sake of the challenge), then go for it!\u00A0 \u003Cimg

In general only Eve, Kerbin, and Jool should be used for flybys as the other bodies are too small to be worth the trouble. Here\u0027s how I get to them all...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get to Moho from Kerbal you should fly by Eve. This is both the hardest one to execute and the one that gives the most benefit, little Moho is moving so fast that even a small mistake in timing the Kerbin departure or Eve flyby will make you miss Moho. However once your ship is in an orbit that crosses Moho\u0027s orbit it is usually easy to plan a Moho encounter several orbits out with only a small adjustment to your path. Even better is to go Kerbin-Eve-Eve-Moho but that requires a double flyby which neither FF nor TOT can plan for you. I use my Lambert spreadsheet to find double flybys, it can be found in the FF post. It requires trial-and-error to find a flyby, if you study\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/67400-lowest-delta-v-to-moho/\u0022\u003E this old challenge\u003C/a\u003E you will find us working out things like when the best times to flyby Eve are and how to set up the Eve double encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get back from Moho to Kerbin you should also use Eve, Moho-Eve-Kerbin is rather easy if you can wait a year or two at Moho for the next window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo flyby needed to get to Eve, though you can save about 60m/s by using a Mun flyby, see the link in the Jool flyby below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo flyby needed to get to Duna, but you can go K-Eve-Duna if you want to get to Duna cheaply outside the normal Hohmann windows from Kerbin. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/71716-an-opposition-class-mission-to-duna-with-eve-flyby/\u0022\u003ESee here\u003C/a\u003E for an example of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDres is the hardest. I have found that using a flyby of Duna to get to Dres is not useful, because Duna is too small to change your path much if you fly by it with enough energy to get to Dres, so the windows are very rare (~30 Kerbin years apart) and the gains are less than 50m/s. I even tried a K-D-D-D-Dres (triple flyby!) and find I spent more on mid-course corrections than I saved in using Duna. However, it is can be advantageous to use Jool to get to Dres! Although it takes about 200m/s more to get to Jool than Dres you can knock\u00A0 more than 500m/s off your Dres arrival speed for a net savings. If you use Eve to get to Jool you can save even more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get to Jool cheaply you should go to Eve first. Using typical values (rather than best possible with perfect alignments) it costs about 2000m/s to get from low Kerbin orbit directly to Jool. It\u0027s about 1900m/s to go K-Duna-Jool. It\u0027s about 1300-1500m/s to go K-Eve-K-Jool. It\u0027s about 1100m/s to go K-E-K-K-J. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72760-how-to-go-from-low-kerbin-orbit-to-jool-orbit-for-1051-ms/\u0022\u003EHere is a thread\u003C/a\u003E that gives mission examples of KEKKJ. I found that superb window using Lambert and trial-and-error. Another intriguing option for getting to Jool is a Juno-style Kerbin flyby with a deep space manuever. Check out\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/110561-juno-style-kerbin-fly-by-to-jool/\u0022\u003E this post \u003C/a\u003Efor how to get to Jool for about 1550m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get to Eeloo you should fly by Jool. Because they orbit so slowly there are extended periods with no fast and cheap window for this, but if you can get to Jool it can throw you to Eeloo wherever it is if you are patient. Note that you can \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/76172-lowest-delta-v-to-eeloo/\u0022\u003Euse Eve to get to Jool and from there to Eeloo,\u003C/a\u003E check out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/77575-sst-eeloo-and-back-challenge/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=1339167\u0022\u003Ethis trip\u003C/a\u003E I made using KEKKJ-Eeloo, and then Eeloo-J-K to get back. Nowadays with the modern aero model requiring lower Kerbin re-entry speeds it is useful to flyby Eve on the way back from the outer system to reduce your Kerbin arrival speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember the concept of synodic periods, in the Flyby Finder primer I give a table showing the periods between which the relative positions of the planets repeat, if you find one good window it will often repeat after a set period.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA uses more tricks than FF or TOT can calculate, for instance deep space maneuvers and multiple orbits between encounters, I do not anticipate writing anything that handles those anytime soon. Does Rich Purnell play KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a final note on flybys- they are not too forgiving of errors in timing. The more flybys you do the more precise the early ones have to be or you will require bigger and bigger course corrections to stay on track, or you might miss the last planet altogether. Try to leave the start planet within an hour of the time that TOT or FF gives you, and remember when doing mid-course corrections that it is more important to have your flyby periapsis at the right time than at the right altitude or speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThnx\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104158-plad/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022104158\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104158-plad/\u0022\u003E@PLAD\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E on the long answer \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-07T08:29:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2016 08:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by seaces\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T11:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might find this thread helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/132478-gravitaional-assist-rules-of-thumb/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt describes how to work out what is possible from a gravity assist\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
