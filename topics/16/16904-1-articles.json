For instance, one of my VTOL craft I call the Drake uses multiple delta wings four of them create the main wing in a sort of rounded triangle, two form the horizontal tail wing, and a third forms the vertical tail wing. The design worked well at first, aside from generating minor lift with just two VTOL fans place along the belly of the craft. As a result it did produce quite a bit of lift in the front. I theorized that it was because the two sets of wings on the main body were producing enormous amounts of lift, though it didn\u0027t effect much as i was still able to control the craft and nose down to achieve forward movement. However just last evening when i went to test and tweak the same craft, during test flight the lift being produced in the front was so intense that even at minimum throttle needed to achieve lift, the craft was flipping backwards or rising straight up at 90 degree angles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T16:56:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AtomicIrishman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AtomicIrishman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhen i went to test and tweak the same craft, during test flight the lift being produced in the front was so intense that even at minimum throttle needed to achieve lift, the craft was flipping backwards or rising straight up at 90 degree angles.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis bit is something I\u0027ve been concerned about. In my own vessels, I\u0027ve sometimes noticed seemingly inconsistent behavior. Usually the culprit is one \u0022minor\u0022 change that I did between flights and then forgot about. But sometimes a connection gets messed up somehow, and causes strange problems in general. I can remedy this by removing and reconnecting the cockpit. That has the effect of re-connecting all the subsequent parts, and often fixes the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AtomicIrishman","CreatedById":39214,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T20:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I\u0027ll look into it. Ive been fleshing out my two currently \u0022functional\u0022 VTOLs int he last two days, both operate very differently. But for the most part can fly at a modest pace of 150-100m/s, however landing still presents a challenge as the only way to land is to land them like a normal fixed wing, because even minimum power seems to generate still to much lift for them to gradually descend at a vertical angle of less than 45....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zauggru","CreatedById":36192,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T02:36:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe difficulty I have with VTOL/STOL is currently there is no way to group engines and give them independent throttle controls.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
