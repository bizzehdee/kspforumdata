The muted \u0022earth tones\u0022 (erm... so to speak... \u0022kerb tones\u0022? \u0022Mun tones\u0022?) are much prettier when laid out across a world\u0027s surface in Map view...but they also make it much more difficult (for me and my aging eyes, at least) to actually USE them.\u00A0 Even on my printed-out copies (which, admittedly, are lovely works of art, worth framing and displaying for their own sake), I have trouble distinguishing between some of the very similar colors.\u00A0 So, for purposes of UTILITY, I rather prefer the older-style biome maps with their jarring loud primary colors--they may have been ugly, but by gum it was EASY to tell highlands from lowlands!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo does anyone have an online reference to a set of LESS attractive (but more utilitarian) color biome maps for 1.2.x biomes?\u00A0 Or some way to remap the in-game biome colors?\u00A0 My old weak eyes would appreciate it, and my kerbals would also like to skip the tedium of landing in the same few biomes by mistake over and over.\u00A0 (They\u0027re starting to demand extra snacks as a \u0022boredom bonus\u0022!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DD_bwest","CreatedById":164906,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-18T19:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif your having a really hard time distinguishing the difference. one thing that can be done is to copy and paste the map into paint. \u00A0then make a small rectangle with 2 smaller squares inside. you can then use paints tool to sample a color and fill the squares with the 2 you are having trouble with. \u00A0 any contrast will become apparent right now to eachother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe ksp wiki if you google it has some decent biome maps\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-18T19:48:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2016 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DD_bwest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-18T20:03:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI filed this issue in the bugtracker already myself.
