Escape velocity at that altitude is ~3176m/s giving you a delta-v of 930m/s for a minimal escape from Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Using my calculator (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alexmoon.github.io/ksp\u003C/a\u003E) to calculate the solar orbit delta-v gives 854m/s (set initial orbit to 0 to get this value). So your total delta-v would be 1784m/s minus whatever boost you get from the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing a straight transfer from LKO to Duna costs 1046m/s so you\u0027d need to be saving 742m/s from your gravity assist for it to be cheaper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransferring to Jool requires 2802m/s from solar orbit vs 1996m/s from LKO. Adding in the escape velocity delta-v gives 3732m/s meaning you\u0027d need to save 3732 - 1996 = 1736m/s. The largest boost you can get from the Mun is roughly double its orbital velocity or 1083m/s so that\u0027s probably never going to be more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you could incorporate a Munar gravity assist into a single ejection burn from LKO and end up on the correct transfer trajectory that would be the most efficient, but calculating that would be a challenge!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evrion","CreatedById":70825,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T01:07:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm, I largely ignore numbers while playing, but I am interested in what is more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems here that if direct shot from LKO is more efficient, then it\u0027s the orbital velocity from being in LKO that is helping here. The question then becomes comparing the speed boost you can get from Mun to the speed boost you get from LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI: My Mun assist is usually done in such a way as to put me in a solar orbit that is either larger or smaller than Kerbin\u0027s, depending on my intended destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not have the patience to wait for the Mun AND the intended destination to line up, though i know that would be the theoretical optimum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I may just get less lazy and do some calculations (I\u0027m thinking energy methods: Eg \u002B Ek stuff, I haven\u0027t yet figured out how this delta-V stuff fits with the physics I know, so maybe that would be best) Or even better, run an experiment and try both methods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
