If you pass through the center of the gravity well at 10 m/s, in 10 seconds you will travel average velocity * time, or (10\u002B(10-10))/2 m/s *10s = 50 m, so you arrive at the edge of the SoI with zero relative velocity. If on the other hand, you expend 2.5 m/s delta-v instantaneously at the center of the SoI, you wind up leaving the SoI in half the time: (12.5\u002B(12.5-5))/2*5s = 50.

I mean, it all comes down to your velocity, but wrt what reference frame? I mean, the spot of highest orbit velocity around Kerbin can be very different than the highest velocity wrt to the sun\u0027s reference frame.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It doesn\u0027t make any sense intuitively, so it\u0027s just not you. You *do* have a potential energy advantage up there, but unless you convert that potential energy to kinetic energy, you may as well not bother, because the potential energy itself is worthless in interplanetary transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Oberth effect is gained IRT Kerbin\u0027s inertial frame, while the benefit is reaped IRT Kerbol\u0027s inertial reference. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I look at it this way: The height advantage of near-SOI orbits is really nil in Kerbol system scale. What matters is velocity. Say you need 4,500 m/sec (on top of Kerbin\u0027s 9,300) to set up a Hohmann transfer to Jool. At LKO, you\u0027ve already got 2,300 of it. Up at the edge of SOI, you\u0027ve only got 220 (assuming you\u0027re in a circular orbit). It would be a huge disadvantage to burn from up there to make up the lost velocity... *but* if you spend 200 m/s to get you down to LKO in a highly elliptical orbit, then once you get there, you\u0027re booking along at about 3,500 m/sec. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Put another way... getting a payload to Jool is work. Work is thrust applied over a distance. If you nail a rocket to a tree and light it, it provides thrust but does no \u003Cem\u003Ework\u003C/em\u003E, because all of it\u0027s chemical potential energy is expended in accelerating propellant out the back. None of the potential energy applies to the *real* work of accelerating the rocket itself. Likewise, if the rocket is travelling at a high velocity, pretty much all of it\u0027s potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, resulting in more work accomplished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The faster the rocket is going, the more work it can do with it\u0027s conversion of potential chemical energy into kinetic energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-23T21:33:25Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2014 09:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T00:04:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy personal preference is stationary orbit. Easy on the mission planning. You always get to and from Kerbin with identical burns. You can retro burn back to Kerbin for planetary transfers or burn up for Mun slingshot. Optimal transfer orbit is around 120km, you get fast(er) time speed up, low cost refueling and decent Oberth effect. Higher orbit position is up to personal preference. Minmus reduces transfer window opportunities and has an inclination problem. Mun is OK, with added ability to service bases. I still prefer stationary orbits for reasons mentioned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nilof","CreatedById":119624,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T01:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo the people championing a low orbit depot because of the Oberth effect: you are making the faulty assumption that the interplanetary transfer burn has to happen at the depot. In practice, to go to another planet you drop down from your high orbit to a highly eliptical orbit with a low periapsis, and do the interplanetary burn at periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting a depot at a high orbit is preferable IMHO because you can make both your departure stage and the depot smaller for the same flights, leading to less lag and wooblyness during docking. Also, randezvous at high orbits is significantly less time consuming and less frustrating. I find that the small burn you need to make to circularize/decircularize at high orbits is similar to or less than what i waste doing a lazy randezvous with a small plane change in LKO. At high orbits you can approximate your trajectory as a straight line for adjusting final approach, and plane changes are really cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Minmus or high Mun orbit depot is a good option. You can use it to stage missions to unexplored lunar biomes in career mode, or to test the lander on a new craft, and the delta-v to decircularize is low enough. On the other hand SOI changes can be a bit annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, avoid stationary orbit. That is a terrible staging orbit delta-v wise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
