I\u0027m driving a rover up out of a Mun crater onto the rim, and when I get to the top and move out onto the first flat polygon atop the rim, it behaves like it\u0027s made out of slow muck or sand. The rover gets slowed down on that top polygon a LOT such that I can only make about 0.3 m/s trying to drive it at maximum speed. I have to creep slowly off that terrain polygon onto the next one before the wheels finally break free and it starts driving normally again. I thought it was just a fluke the first time but I\u0027ve done enough rover driving now to see that it tends to happen a lot on the edges of lots of different craters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E   This polygon bogs down rover.\u003Cbr\u003E          |\u003Cbr\u003E          |\u003Cbr\u003E          |\u003Cbr\u003E        .----.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        _____\u003Cbr\u003Ecrater /     \\__\u003Cbr\u003Erim   /         \\__\u003Cbr\u003E     /             \\__________\u003Cbr\u003E    /  \\        |        \u003Cbr\u003E   /    \\       |     /\u003Cbr\u003E  /      \\      |    /\u003Cbr\u003E /     These polygons act correctly.\u003Cbr\u003E/                            \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-02T23:20:10Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2013 11:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T02:48:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re running into the same problem I\u0027ve run into on the Mun and have heard other people talking about: Sometimes, the terrain graphics don\u0027t quite match the actual surface polygons.

SAS Needs Resetting\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you climb the crater rim, your rover spends a long time at a fairly steep nose-up attitude. If the rover has a probe core and/or reaction wheel unit AND you have SAS turned on, you have great traction during the climb. This is because SAS tries to keep the rover at the attitude it was in when you turned SAS on. The angle SAS wants to keep changes over time but it\u0027s always going to lag a bit behind the increasing slope. Thus, as the slope gets steeper, SAS is always acting in the opposite direction, thereby increasing your traction and both your acceleration and braking power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you get to the top of the rim and the ground more or less levels off. On the typical rover, the torque of a single probe core is enough to counter gravity on Mun, so now SAS is trying to keep the wheels off the ground, more like at the angle they were just at when climbing the rim. It thus often happens that each time the slope decreases noticeably as you\u0027re going uphill, you end up with only 1 or 2 wheels touching the ground, the rest held just above the ground by SAS. Hence, no traction and so no acceleration or ability to brake or even steer. The result is \u0022bogging down.\u0022 To solve this problem, turn SAS off for a couple of seconds, allowing all the wheels to make good contact with the ground, the turn SAS back on. Voila, you can now accelerate, decelerate, and turn again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Geschosskopf Effect\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere the rims of overlapping craters intersect, there\u0027s a small force exerted on wheeled objects (only, nothing else) inwards along the line connecting the intersection points of the crater rims. This force isn\u0027t very strong (brakes can resist it) and is only really noticeable on the outside of the rim, so the force acts against gravity and makes the rover roll uphill. But if you\u0027re at such a place and are trying to move slowly downhill, this force can make you think you\u0027re bogged down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T07:08:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

I tried several times to get out onto the relatively flat terrain amongst the craters but ended up flipping backwards at the top of the rim instead of the front wheels going over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I nearly managed to make it into a smaller, intersecting crater that was further down the slope but some rather coarse geometry jammed things up and it ended up tumbling back. It\u0027s a very tough rover. Nothing broke until the last time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I decided to go up the high side because there\u0027s a small crescent of intersecting crater whose upper lip has a shallow transition to the \u0022between craters\u0022 landscape. I *almost* made it before the rover flipped back. That was one loooooong tumble during which everything but the center bottom plate, the two middle wheels, the probe body and two batteries got ripped off. The rover was still drivable! (Until the batteries died.) So I Mun-schussed down the the lowest point of the crater before hitting F9. Also got in some practice fiddling with control to keep it balanced on two wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome day I\u0027ll try going out the lower side, into the next crater to see if I can get over its lip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
