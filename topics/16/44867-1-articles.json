I have an AMD Radeon 6310 Hd graphics 1.30 ghz with 4 gigs of ram. And yet, I have all of the settings on the lowest posible and the games is basically unplayable. too much lag. Its a fairly new computer. Any thoughts, what kind of computer do I need to run games like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T23:04:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERecommended System Specs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* 2.0Ghz Dual Core CPU or higher (preferably higher)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* 4GB RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* 512MB Video Card, Shader Model 3.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* 1GB Free HD space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Windows XP, Vista, 7 or 8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* An Intel-based Mac running Mac OS X 10.6 or higher\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* A Debian based Linux distro\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T23:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour CPU is quite low indeed. KSP is very CPU demanding and currently everyone\u0027s performances are blocked by our CPU\u0027s clock speed. New or not, if your PC can\u0027t do more than 1.3GHz, you\u0027re going to have a long ride.

Not even close id say. As for what kind of pc it takes...that\u0027s a very vauge question. I\u0027m assuming you don\u0027t build your own pc\u0027s ( which is the way to go $$$ wise ) so look up some pre builds on newegg if you will. An Intel i5 is good for a CPU. 8 gigs of ram ( even though KSP won\u0027t utilize it, but other games will. ) And as for a gpu id say a geforce 500 series and up is nice though I\u0027m sure others work just fine. Any prebuilt on newegg with an i5 ( and specified for gaming ) should come with a nice gpu wether it be Nvidia or ATI\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Adampeay","CreatedById":77280,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T10:46:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks everybody or the tips. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T12:18:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe culprit being that we have to look for newer processors with high GHz numbers on each core - are there any dual cases out there, taking two motherboards ... ;p\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T13:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently running KSP on a 2.9 GHz machine with only 2 GB ram and an nVidia 7000-equivalent integrated graphics chip.
