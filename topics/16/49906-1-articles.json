Something like 30 Km or less. That way you are certain to land. Perhaps on the land or in the sea, on the daylight side or the night side, but you will land somewhere. I first tried to be cute and burn for an 80Km periapsis so that I could do a circularization burn and then time my re-entry burn to, hopefully, splash down in daylight just offshore from the launch pad. But I would usually run out of fuel and finish up in a big, ugly Kerbin orbit with no option but to organise a rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T21:38:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ChrisMayhew\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ChrisMayhew\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you to you I just managed to get my first space ship into Mun\u0027s orbit! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only problem is fuel for a return journey!!
