I can see you have some wings at the bottom of the orange tank, which would help in the atmosphere. My guess is that the craft\u0027s center of mass is slightly off balance. In the vehicle assembly click the light green weight icon at the bottom left of the screen, under the list of components, and see if it\u0027s centered somewhere in the middle of the rocket. Even small imbalances can cause rotation, so symmetry is your friend. If your craft is not symmetrical you\u0027ll need to find out where and either make it symmetrical or add an equal weight component on the opposite side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hakuryu","CreatedById":60505,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T18:44:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, you can add pieces with torgue to counteract rotating (and ASAS to use them of course). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my larger space station delivery vehicles has 8 SAS units to keep it from rotating.
