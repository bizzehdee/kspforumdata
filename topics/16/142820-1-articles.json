AFAIK, you can\u0027t break a retracted gigantor without an impact. I may be wrong about that, of course -- but it\u0027s certainly never happened to me, and you have to be able to launch them from Kerbin. So they have to be able to take a couple km per second in a thickish atmosphere. Do you have it mounted with the pointy end aimed lengthwise?
