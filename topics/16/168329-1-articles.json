The mission objective: do it in about as silly a manner as possible, more or less.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe conundrum: This is about my fourth ship I have build for the purpose, the third fundamentally different design. I thought I could be clever by arranging fuel-tanks in a train-like manner, so that I could just run the engines from the one at the and and drop that once it\u0027s empty. AGX and very many click-clicky sessions on the flow-priority buttons, the old Drainex fuel meter from SmartParts, that should sort it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0027xcept it don\u0027t.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs you can see in the video, the fuel drainage is ridiculous. LH2 fuel is drawn from the tank with flow priority 0, while oxidizer gets drawn from buggerifIknowwhere. And the tank at the end, with flow priority 90, parts with not a drop.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nExplanation I have for it: inertia is, of course, shoving the fuel away from my engines here, and the fuel pumps can\u0027t keep up.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnly solution I could think off, open TAC Fuel Balancer, set the tank I wanted to drain to \u0022transfer out\u0022, and set ALL other tanks to \u0022tranfer in\u0022, set the transfer rate to 100 and try dialing the throttle back until the fuel tanks can keep up ... has failed. I thought of it while writing this and just tried it, no joy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, have I indeed seen the error of my ways, is Dunacraft III - The Cryo Strikes Back just an idiotic design that I really should have used hyperedit to test before spending hours assembling the damn thing in orbit?\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr is there ANY way of making this work?\u003Cbr\u003E\nLike I said, I wanted to do it in as silly a manner as possible. Pretty sure there are ways sillier ways of doing it. But this one, hauling that trainload of disposable tanks, I kinda like that. And, fully expecting that, as usual, I only get things right when I try and work out what I got wrong earlier, am already mentally designing Dunacraft IV - The Last Cryo. But I really kinda like this one ... any advise is welcome!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/vNoUvJIWTDk?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-08T23:45:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t tell for sure with a high-res game crammed into a low-res video, but it looks like your bottom tanks have a higher fuel flow priority than your top ones.\u00A0 I think the game burns the \u003Cstrong\u003Elowest\u003C/strong\u003E-numbered tanks first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you can alter fuel flow priority in flight.\u00A0 Checking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[edit] Yes!\u00A0 You can alter fuel flow priority in-flight.\u00A0 Set your bottom tank to zero, the tank above it to 1, etc, etc, etc, and they should burn in the order you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-08T23:50:23Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2017 11:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Corona688\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerGolgo","CreatedById":167906,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-08T23:56:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has been my experience that the game burned high priority tanks first.
