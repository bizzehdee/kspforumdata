I stopped equipping rockets with antennas without batteries. Even with batteries, it\u0027s difficult to manage power without solar panels. You just have to bring the ship back home to collect data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, don\u0027t use the small LV-909 engine- it doesn\u0027t produce power to recharge batteries. The bigger LV-T30 and LV-T45 engines will recharge the batteries while they are running. Try not to run your batteries dry before your next big burn...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, conserve battery power. Using SAS torque to control attitude uses electricity, so be careful with your adjustments. Running the automatic attitude control uses even more power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried the solution of adding command pods, but I imagine this would work fairly well.
