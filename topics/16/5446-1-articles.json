One of the things which makes learning to fly hard is that you also need to learn to build rockets at the same time. Learning to land on the mun is hard when you need to get all the way there just to test your lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\\\u0027s separate this into stages and make it a bit easier. Only if you want, mind. But we can learn to fly without worrying about the rockets, by cheating and giving ourselves loads of superlight fuel. Open the config file for one of the small fuel tanks. Add some zeros to the amount of fuel. Now build a rocket with that tank, an ASAS module, and a whacking great steerable engine. Oh, better have some steerable winglets too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, we\\\u0027ll proceed to lift-off. Turn on the ASAS, go to full power, and head straight up. Follow the usual directions for achieving orbit. You should now be in space, with loads of fuel left - enough to mess about, for the first time, probably. Go ahead, waste it. You can much more rapidly get a feel for the orbital variations acceleration can induce when you don\\\u0027t have to worry about fuel, and making mistakes, and so-on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\\\u0027re comfortable with all that, it\\\u0027s time to head to the Mun. Build a lander - your basic cheats\\\u0027 rocket may well do fine. I\\\u0027ve found that it\\\u0027s next to impossible to land anything that\\\u0027s much (if any) taller than it\\\u0027s wide, but if you have a three metre torch underneath a one meter fuel-tank and capsule, that\\\u0027s probably fine. RCS thrusters make very little difference when you\\\u0027re coming down on a steerable engine that size, and the RCS tank adds a fair bit to the height at this stage, so it\\\u0027s possibly not worth adding them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the Mun, following the usual directions. You shouldn\\\u0027t have any trouble doing so by this point, with an incredibly stable and powerful rocket. Orbit the Mun, then, when you\\\u0027re over the lit half, kill your forward velocity as accurately as you can. The idea is to end up with absolutely zero orbital velocity, dropping straight towards the Mun. You\\\u0027re unlikely to manage it in one burn, but not to worry. Kill the engine. Rotate the rocket so you\\\u0027re burning directly against the direction of travel - the green x, as you know by now. Keep it as absolutely centred on that as you can, any time you\\\u0027re burning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow is when having unlimited fuel becomes useful again. Normally, the slower you drop towards the Mun, the more fuel you use, but now that\\\u0027s not something to worry about. Let yourself fall until you\\\u0027re, say, a hundred thousand metres up - depending on your patience - and then fire the rocket to slow you down below maybe 100m/s. Hell, come to a full stop if you like, you have plenty of fuel. Experiment a little at this height. You\\\u0027ll probably find that about one notch of power is enough to prevent the rocket accelerating downwards fast, and two to three notches will decelerate fast and send you back up. Don\\\u0027t forget to keep the thrust pointing as exactly at the green x as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note: if you overdo it and end up going back up, the marker will rotate round the globe. Don\\\u0027t try and follow it. Cut the power and wait until you start coming back down, then try to slow down again.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe closer you get to the ground, the lower you want your speed - with unlimited fuel, the only limit is your patience. I find somewhere about 20m/s below 10k metres is fine, and once I get below about a thousand metres, \u0026lt;10 m/s. If you get too low and realise you\\\u0027re moving sideways across the ground to any significant extent, blast straight up and try again until you get it right. Ideally, once you\\\u0027re fairly low, you\\\u0027ll keep the power just high enough to keep you dropping at the same rate, and click it up a notch for a second or two when you want to lose a bit of speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations, you\\\u0027ve now landed on the Mun. You dirty cheat, you. Getting home won\\\u0027t be a problem if you\\\u0027ve made it this far, so let\\\u0027s skip to the next stage: learning to build a rocket and doing it for real.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo back to the config file you edited earlier, and remove those extra zeros. Trial-and-error your Kerbals into space, and realise that now you know what to do when you get there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a lander that looks much like the earlier cheat-ship, except with a single small steerable engine and real mass fuel tanks, and legs of some kind to hold it upright. Remember not to make it much taller than it\\\u0027s wide. Add a great big lower stage to shove your lander into Mun orbit, and now try and put into practice what you learnt before about landing, except let your lander fall faster to save fuel, and decelerate faster nearer the surface. Ideally you\\\u0027d do a single full-power burn ending with you stationary on the surface, but in practice getting your vertical speed between 10 and 100 m/s at 10k metres altitude with a single mostly-full-power burn below 50k should give you enough fuel to land gently and get back to Kerbal. With the practice you picked up earlier, you shouldn\\\u0027t need to yo-yo up and down before landing, although if you\\\u0027re as cack-handed as me you\\\u0027ll probably still manage to crash a few times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations, Mun landing achieved without cheating. Return to Kerbal simple enough. Job done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I know, I know, some people will despise me for this. Others will find it make life a lot easier.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scruce","CreatedById":9059,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-13T17:58:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow try doing it without cheats. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a good Munar landing tutorial \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=4003.msg44807#msg44807\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T10","CreatedById":12936,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-14T01:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found that testing a landing craft on Kerbin worked well to prepare myself for the real thing. Easily restartable in the event of failure, can quickly redesign the lander to deal with issues arising, no need to play with cfgs, stronger gravity. The first Mun landing after my dozen or so practice runs was a success. The three main things to conisder are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Lander design - can it land without toppling or snapping?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Approach thrust - how much thrust do you need to maintain a good landing speed (protip: using H to use thrusters on full downwards burst is handy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. How to cancel lateral drift - probably the most important part. You can slow to a 0.5m/s vertical fall, but if you\\\u0027re travelling across the ground at 30m/s it\\\u0027ll end in tears. Structural and emotional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut of course, you will need practice at Mun approach as well, and this guide is good if you want to just practice transferring from a trans-Munar flight to landing speed. Take heart Kerbonauts, once you\\\u0027ve mastered the two aspects covered by dave, you\\\u0027ve done 80% of the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
