No it\u0027s not just you. The Tree can easily be completed without leaving the Kerbin system.

Can you rephrase that please?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Very little in stock. But there are a couple of fantastic mods that make satellites worthwhile, namely Remotetech2 and Scansat. The former makes you set up line-of-sight connections in order to control your unmanned ships, and the latter enables you to scan planets and moons, earning science and also making very useful maps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. A difficult question, as it\u0027s really a matter of opinion. Personally, I would say Mechjeb, because in the stock game, you have very little actual data on what your ship is doing (eg orbital characteristics, available deltav etc), and MJ gives you plenty of that, in many different ways. It is also known, sometimes negatively, for its autopilot features, and some people are critical of others who use them. But tbh, when you\u0027re faced with launching yet another fuel resupply, or yet another constellation satellite, it is nice to have the option of having your staff do it for you!

There are a couple of mods that add functionality to satellites. ScanSat I believe is one of them, as is Kethane. FinePrint also often churns out satellite contracts; that one I\u0027d actually recommend getting as it will become stock in the next update. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Aside from the aforementioned FinePrint, it depends on the experience you\u0027re looking for. Myself, I generally install mods that assist with piloting - like Kerbal Engineer Redux, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Precise Node, Docking Port Alignment Indicator and a few others. Kerbal Attachment System\u0027s also fun; it adds things like winches and pipes to the game. Someone will probably mention Mechjeb at some point; from what I understand it\u0027s like KER but with a huge array of autopilots, which makes it more than somewhat controversial.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
