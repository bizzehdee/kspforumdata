Where the primary way to gain science is by getting out and doing experiments (as Arsonide says). The other thing you can do to get a little boost is using the science lab. You can now stuff it full of experiments and it convert it to more science.\n\nIt might be tough to get started, but once you can get onto and easily around on the Mun/Minmus, science will really start to rack up. And all the planets have a lot of biomes now, which they didn\u0027t back in 0.23. So light and cheap probes that transmit science can be your friend.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Didaskalos","CreatedById":129266,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:11:19Z","Content":"OK.

It\u0027s illogical and grindy.\n\nUnrealistic? Yes. But still, I like it rather well. I still think of career as a kind of tutorial mode that gradually introduces you to parts and game concepts (yes, you can actually fail -- but if you play without reverts, I assume that you want it that way). Putting the parts you have to good use unlocks new parts, that\u0027s quite sensible from a gameplay progression point of view.\n\nThe grindy part is more problematic -- on the one hand, just doing a single sucessful Mun and Minmus landing each isn\u0027t enough to proof your mettle; but the current requirement to turn around nearly every stone is a tad much."},{"CreatedByName":"MechaLynx","CreatedById":108866,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T02:21:08Z","Content":"I didn\u0027t play much career in .90 but I can say I like career science scarcity as it is, although I am playing on hard and looking for a challenge. What I do, is exploit the little science around KSP and on Kerbin and I launch a couple of missions just to get pilot experience and science from low and high orbit around Kerbin. It\u0027s got me to the point where I have enough funds for a lvl2 landing pad and enough parts to flyby the Mun (in fact, enough \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to escape Kerbin), so I\u0027m probably close to landing, which should yield a truckload of science and It\u0027s been around 3-4 missions (I think) plus 2-3 weird launches to get cheap science from the launch pad and surrounding area."},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T03:41:52Z","Content":"I think this was a good change.

It takes some effort to set up, but its nolonger do contracts exclusively and always get a crapload of science stuff."}]}
