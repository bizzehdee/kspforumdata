However I can\u0027t make sense of your staging list, since the bottom tank drains first and is attached with a decoupler, why would you have the untouched radial tanks (and engines) to drop when you ditch the empty tank? On top of that, there are fuel lines from those tanks going upward, there\u0027s no reason for that unless you light the upper stage engines as well, which however are jumbled up in the staging and wouldn\u0027t light properly unless toggled manually. I just realized I didn\u0027t bother looking at action groups though, so maybe that\u0027s the answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what exactly do you need help with? I find no inconsistency in the fuel drain, just in your staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess I\u0027ll ask again, fix what exactly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: So I had another look with the assumption you intended to light all engines from the start. After sorting the staging I observed it going on the pad, went back to the VAB and redid the fuel lines for a confirm, then testfired again. Likely it\u0027s an issue with the fuel line logic of how many tanks it goes through, ie you simply have too many in line. I\u0027ve seen it mentioned in other cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah I can confirm the setup you have, even though logically should work, doesn\u0027t (that is assuming all engines are lit from the start).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-13T21:57:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2013 09:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Johnno\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T00:15:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I checked it too.
