What do I aim at to keep the speed more constant?\n\nIf you aim it well (will take lots of practice!), you will arrive within just a few km from your target. From there the approach is simple, but of course you will have to do that whole \u0022stop start speed up slow down, prograde retrograde turning around\u0022 thing that you mentioned, but you really only need to do two burns to get close enough. Aim at the target, burn, turn around, burn again to come to a relative stop once close enough. From there it\u0027s docking time.\n\nIf you are having issues with the \u0022turning around\u0022 part because your ship is big and unwieldy, then you can do the approach using RCS only, that way you can fire it retrograde to slow down without turning around."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T17:27:46Z","Content":"Well, the most efficient way to rendevousz that I find is still practical is to raise your Apoapsis to the target orbit, then rais your Periapsis just outside the atmoshpere. Next, set your target as target (duh ^^) and create a manouvre node at apoapsis, note that it is important that you actually intersect the target orbit at ap.\n\nNow comes the interesting part, if you left click on your manouvre node you can manipulate it as usual, but if you right click after you left click the markers dissapear and you are left with two little circles at the bottom left and right and the x at the top left (assuming this has not changed in 1.0.x). The little circles enable you to look one (or more) orbits ahead (right button) or go back (left button [note that you can\u0027t look back in time ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)]). Cycle through the orbits until you get the closest encounter within a few orbits. then adjust the pro/retrograde components of your manouvre and watch the magic happen as your encounter distance changes. Then simply kill your relative velocity at closest approach.\n\nBy using this method you should be able to get an encounter within a couple of hundred meters at the first try. If you do it right (and time your rel. velocity negation burn just right) you can get within 50m without faffing around. From then on it is all just RCS work.\n\nAlso one of the big advantages is that launch timing is not as essential as it is when doing it differently. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nLet me know if this was any help or if you want some more detailed explanations.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T17:31:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 05:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T17:53:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But what about the final approach bit.

There must be a more efficient way than stop start speed up slow down, prograde retrograde turning around. What do I aim at to keep the speed more constant?\n\nI\u0027m a bit confused by this statement. What do you mean by \u0022stop start speed up slow down prograde retrograde turning around\u0022? There\u0027s none of this, if done properly.\n\nFor brevity in the following, I\u0027ll use \u0022TRVR\u0022 for \u0022target relative velocity retrograde\u0022 and \u0022TBR\u0022 for \u0022target bearing retrograde\u0022 when referring to navball markers.\n\n1. On the launchpad, wait until your target is in the right spot (typically about 5 degrees or so above the western horizon, for something in LKO).\n\n2. Do your usual liftoff and gravity turn.\n\n3. Once you\u0027re above 30km or so, switch to map view and tune your up/down pitch a bit so that your trajectory kisses the target\u0027s orbit right at a perfect intersect (you can get it within a km or two without too much trouble).\n\n4. Do the usual coast-upwards-towards-apoapsis.\n\n5. As the target approaches, thrust in the TRVR direction to keep the closing speed manageable. Note that this is *not* going orbital-retrograde, it\u0027s only retrograde relative to the target. It\u0027s actually orbital-prograde, i.e. it\u0027s almost exactly the same burn you\u0027d be doing if you just wanted to put yourself in orbit in the most efficient manner possible.\n\n6. As the target approaches you, you can fine-tune your approach to keep your TRVR marker lined up on your TBR marker. You\u0027re going to be doing your thrust in the TRVR direction anyway; all you need to do is to adjust your direction slightly off of that to nudge the TRVR until it lines up with TBR. Should need minimal nudging, since they start off pretty close together.\n\n7. Slow yourself to a stop (relative to the target) when you\u0027re just a few meters from it.\n\n8. Rotate your craft to line up the docking ports, then a tiny nudge (0.2 m/s or so) to set them drifting towards each other, with a bit of lateral RCS correction if needed.\n\n...The important thing is that in the above sequence, *everything except step 8 is exactly what you would do to launch efficiently to orbit.* You\u0027re not \u0022wasting\u0022 anything by docking; all of your thrust is contributing efficiently to achieving orbit, just with the constraint that you want your orbit to exactly match the target\u0027s. The only docking \u0022wastage\u0022 is in step 8, and that\u0027s negligible, it\u0027s just a few centimeters per second."},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T18:18:53Z","Content":"I\u0027ve only done a direct redezvous launch once, and it was by accident.

How do you guys do a fuel efficient rendezvous?\n\nIt sounds like you\u0027re already doing it fairly efficiently. The bigger the differences in your two orbits (for example, if you\u0027re in 100km orbit, and your target is at 2000km), the more fuel it will take to initiate the transfer and to slow down, because you\u0027re basically matching your target\u0027s orbit when you slow down relative to it. \n\nHowever, one thing you might not be doing correctly is that when initiating your transfer, you want your orbit to tangent to your target\u0027s (i.e. touching it at only one point, either at your AP if you\u0027re going up to meet your target, or at your PE if you\u0027re going down). You don\u0027t want to cross your target\u0027s orbit and shoot past it. If you do, your relative speed will be much higher when you meet, and you\u0027ll need to spend much more fuel slowing down.\n\nA direct launch to intercept as some have suggested is indeed more efficient, but only if you follow an efficient ascent profile. Even if done perfectly, you\u0027re not saving too much compared to getting into a slightly lower orbit first. It\u0027s only a few tens of m/s to adjust your orbit by 10km. If during your ascent, you have to adjust your orbit quite a bit to get an intercept (or if your orbit shoots past your target to get a close intercept), then you can very easily spend more fuel compared with simply going into a slightly lower orbit and waiting until the right window approaches.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T18:35:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 06:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Empiro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T18:35:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is true only if you follow an efficient ascent profile.

However, with practice, I\u0027ve found that it\u0027s not too hard to eyeball the position; I launch straight to intercept and come pretty close without having to do a lot of adjustment on the way up.\n\nThere\u0027s another cost associated with intercept besides funds, fuel, or what-have-you: patience. I find that with practice, the direct-ascent-to-dock takes about the same dV as circularize-at-slightly-lower-radius, and requires considerably less fiddling (i.e. amount of play time I have to spend setting up the intercept). Almost-same-dV, much-less-of-my-time, translates to a win for direct-intercept in my case. I realize others may have a different set of priorities. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnother factor that can influence the choice is what mods you\u0027re running. For example, I like to play with RemoteTech, which requires having direct line-of-sight links to control unmanned craft. Until I get around to setting up a planet-spanning relay network, there\u0027s value in direct-intercept because I can get there and dock before I\u0027m over the horizon from KSC."},{"CreatedByName":"ExaltedDuck","CreatedById":145930,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T00:18:47Z","Content":"Two words: harpoon winch.
