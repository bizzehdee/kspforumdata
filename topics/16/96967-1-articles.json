But that\u0027s not important. I have successfully landed and constructed some bases before. Just... this one has some unusual shape \u002B some of parts are way above the ground (bridge). So my questions are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Into which pieces would you split this base for transportation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) How would you put those pieces together?

Assuming you are using stock aerodynamics you could attack rockets to the bottom portion of your base, you could also place engines along the bottom of your bridge for descent. Again, I would try and lift it all as a single piece, and not break it up at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Myslius","CreatedById":134570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T18:14:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI will keep in mind the possibility to launch it as a single piece. The thing that worries me about this approach is that the center of mass isn\u0027t at the center.
