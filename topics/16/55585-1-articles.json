These will have an impact on system performance as each piece has to be loaded in, as far as I am understanding it anyhow. I am sure that they will be optimizing more as development progresses, just have to give them time to work on the codes. This is also why I am not doing big bases right now, I mayy leave my tug/lander in LKO and just refuel and change the crew as needed it as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T23:01:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is your CPU\u0027s Clock speed?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lavandulata","CreatedById":95945,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T23:24:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll debris are removed and for comparison when i am loading different flight (basically any other than the station) i don\u0027t have a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CPU is \u0022AMD Phenon II X4 970\u0022 - 3.5 Ghz (4 cores).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T23:27:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETroll: MY CLOCK SPEED IS 50 MHZ\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T00:51:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your orbit is below 160km, the surface of Kerbin is still being partially rendered, which will slow things a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T01:33:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf your orbit is below 160km, the surface of Kerbin is still being partially rendered, which will slow things a bit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 160km this help a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60230-I-would-like-to-ask-you-to-configure-your-computer-for-advanced-players/page2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60230-I-would-like-to-ask-you-to-configure-your-computer-for-advanced-players/page2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might also help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T02:38:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should be able to do fine with large part count ships. My average ship is 600 - 700 parts and some of my space stations are around 1500 parts, still get good frame rates at 800 part ships, but once it gets into the thousands I\u0027ll get 10 fps or lower, but I don\u0027t really mind it all that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor any future optimization, they would have to write code that acts as a boolean operation between parts in the VAB during construction so that way they could merge multiple components into larger pieces. This would make a 1000 part ship act like a 100 part ship. The collision mesh of the multi part object would all have to be compounded together into one big mesh for a large object. This would be a significant coding challenge. Hopefully they\u0027re using custom made collision meshes and not the default collision mesh that Unity generates based off of the model. The physics should then act on the large pieces and not on each small piece individually.
