One would have to steer towards the equator then keep the craft on the equator while one finalizes the apogee. What I usually do when I want exactly 0 degree inclination is due head east as best I can and then once my orbit is finalized burn at an equatorial node to get my inclination to exactly 0. The first orbit is so close to having 0 degree inclination that it always takes just a few delta-v to perform (4 m/s seams to be above the average).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
