Just launch any time you want and get up to almost, but not quite, the desired altitude, so the orbital period is a few minutes more or less than that desired. Then just time warp. Over time, the satellite will drift relative to Kerbin (or the other satellites if you\u0027re not using kerbostationary orbit) until it gets to where you want it. At this point, burn to set your orbital period to the desired value. Your orbit won\u0027t quite be perfectly circular but no biggie as long as the orbital period is correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T14:16:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00227499275\u0022 data-cite=\u00227499275\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI plan on 3 GEO sats to cover Kerbin.

You need to put them in an equilateral triangle if you only want to use 3 sats. I can guarantee you that if you launch a probe mission to anywhere and it falls in that dead zone it will lose connection. A 3 sat setup is only slightly more difficult than a 4 sat one but what I do is put my first sat into Kerbo-stationary orbit (This is best done with a manned mission to avoid a loss of signal) and then put my next sat into a low parking orbit (Usually about 100km) and set my first as the target. Then using maneuver nodes and the close apprach markers I set up a burn to put it where I want in the formation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrAnonymous","CreatedById":100758,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T17:36:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut the sat in LKO first. Select your Geosat thats already up as a target. Make a node that reaches geosat\u0027s orbit. The separation between them should be about 6,000,000 meters. Then just circularize. If you have KER setting your orbital period to 6hrs is even more accurate. For the third sat, repeat the process. I found this out on the tutorial on the Remotetech resumed thread.
