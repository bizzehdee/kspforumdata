Try looking at the flight report window after a breakup and see which area failed first.

At its most simple form it consists of three stacks joined together side by side. The two side stacks feed fuel using fuel line into the centre stack. At lift off all three stack\u0027s engines fire, the two side stacks continuously pump fuel into the centre stack to keep it fully fuelled. Once the side stacks are empty they are jettisoned and the centre stack, still fully fuel continues on into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it gets more complicated than that, you can add more pairs and arrange them radially around the centre core to get this kind of thing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.tinypic.com/mcdi03.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mcdi03.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to understand how such an asparagus rocket work is to load one of those \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24787-0-19-1-Zenith-rocket-family\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EZenith rocket\u003C/a\u003E up in the VAB, have a look around then launch one and see how the fuel drains.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T14:57:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Use struts.

The tall outer stacks on the rocket are providing almost no lift to the payload until they are almost empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have noticed that I have used a ring asparagus rather than a spiral. By this i mean that I jettison the entire outer ring at once then the entire next ring and so on. While a spiraling approach where 2 tanks are dropped at a time in a spiral is more efficient I find that the difference is small and i prefer not to have the axis of symmetry of my rocket rotate as it makes it harder to keep on course. I would recommend this approach first as it is also far easier to build and manage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I would highly recommend mechjeb for super heavy lifters, that rocket has 500\u002B parts which brings the game to a crawl and makes manual control very hard, using the ascent autopilot which is of course unaffected by the game slowdown has been key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any specific questions on building lifters just ask \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eps. be wary of mainsail engines they are very prone to wobble, I would suggest locking the gimble on all but the innermost mainsails to help prevent rockets from shaking themselves apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epps.
