In real life when you turn the plane the plane goes the same way, but KSP seems to be hugging the velocity vector and making turns slow and confusing. Rolls seem to be out of realism. KSP is Definetely a space game but many people are interested in the flying aspect, which seems to so off to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panzerbeard","CreatedById":66380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T12:56:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP\u0027s current stock implentation of aerodynamics is... lacking, to say the least, and can cause some pretty unintuitive behavior when flying.
