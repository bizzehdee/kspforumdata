My plan is to fly it to minmus, detatch a probe while in orbit, then return the main craft and leave the probe there. I have plopped a simple prob design on the top of my ship, but when I detatch it in orbit I can\u0027t take control of it! Right clicking on it does nothing. I have tested the probe separately and it seems fine. Can anybody tell me what im doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a photo:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s12.postimg.org/47qxo34vv/probe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022probe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-27T18:10:35Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2013 06:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MDGM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T18:10:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you know that to switch ship you have to use a special key ?
