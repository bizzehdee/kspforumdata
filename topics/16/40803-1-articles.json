An orbit is just having enough speed so that as something falls, it misses the ground, because it curves away from it. so the higher the orbit the slower the orbit. Lagrange point do occur in real life, which are the result of gravity of separate bodies creating a place you can essentially orbit around, however as the game only calculates gravity from one body at a time, it is impossible in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
