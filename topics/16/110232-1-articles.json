A mode that I always play and EVERYONE seems to forget about. It has the same science gathering missions, but no funds or contacts. That\u0027s my only solution."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T14:34:57Z","Content":"Don\u0027t hire them, rescue them. I\u0027ve got 30 on staff now, with another 3 freezing their little green butts off somewhere, waiting on a rescue taxi, and I think I\u0027ve only ever hired 2, maybe 3, (because rescues were not giving me enough scientists).\n\nBut, you don\u0027t seem to like that, and don\u0027t like the current cost model. Ok, easy solution, decide on a cost model that is acceptable, then (while the game is not running) search for \u0022Funding\u0022 in your persistent.sfs, and you can receive whatever discount/rebate/refund/grant/bonus you consider appropriate, to adjust the cost model to something you find acceptable."},{"CreatedByName":"ArchGaden","CreatedById":116362,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T14:40:58Z","Content":"As far as the legitimate stock game goes, you have two options. Pay the gold price and buy expensive hires. Pay the iron price and do rescue missions. As you don\u0027t want to do either of those, you\u0027ll have to cheat or make/use a plugin. \n\nYou could modify your save file to reimburse yourself for a portion of the funds spent hiring. The save files are plain text, so it should be pretty simple to modify your funds. I\u0027m not sure if hiring prices are moddable or not, but they likely are. It sounds like that is what you want to do though, in which case, you\u0027re better off asking around on the plugin development forum.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/30-Plugin-Development-Help-and-Support](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/30-Plugin-Development-Help-and-Support)"},{"CreatedByName":"Pax Kerbana","CreatedById":129558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T18:09:58Z","Content":"Thanks guys.\n\nI\u0027m all about the contracts, science just doesn\u0027t \u0022do it\u0022 for me. It\u0027s not that career is difficult, it\u0027s that the cost of Kerbals makes ZERO sense. I have no possible idea why they made them so expensive without a slider to adjust. Why even bother to have applicants? Squad clearly wants the player to perform rescue contracts... and once you do one, they\u0027re like tomato bugs.\n\nIf you need a pilot, you should be able to hire one, not be forced to rescue 5 Kerbals in the hopes you get a pilot.\n\nThe \u0022funding option,\u0022 looks like I will need to resort to that. I guess I\u0027ll just figure out how many I want to buy and make a group purchase... then hack myself some roots!\n\nWas really hoping there was a stock way of doing this but I guess they left it out... hopefully they revise the pricing scheme or at a bare minimum make a slider for it."},{"CreatedByName":"ArchGaden","CreatedById":116362,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T19:18:42Z","Content":"I\u0027m actually surprised I haven\u0027t seen a plugin for this yet. I do like rescue missions... they\u0027re even one of my favorite mission types, but I don\u0027t like having my staffing depend on them. I\u0027ve got about 30 kerbanauts now and about half of them are deployed to space stations on and around Kerbin and its moons. I\u0027m looking to setup interplanetary stations now, but don\u0027t have enough to staff as many stations as I\u0027d like. New hires are well over 800,000 now. Once I got into the interplanetary game, the rescue missions really slowed down. I\u0027ll either end up recycling crew from older stations and leaving behind mountains of unprocessed science... or engaging in some illegitimate reduced cost hiring myself. I might poke around in the xmls and see if there are moddable values somewhere."},{"CreatedByName":"archnem","CreatedById":135259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T19:51:32Z","Content":"Yah this issue annoys me greatly, considering I can launch an entire Mun/Minmus mission for less than the cost of hiring a single kerbal.\n\n[This](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121100-1-0-x-Custom-Barn-Kit-1-0-1-%28May-14%29-No-instruction-leaflet-edition) mod might be what you\u0027re looking for tho ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAs far as a stock way to do things.... hit alt-f12 for the debug menu, but continue to hold down for 5-6 seconds.
