You may want to make the intake types a little more evenly balanced to the number and type of engines you have as well; as they are, it\u0027s going to be difficult to get them balanced properly since the shock cones have much more intake area than the radial ones. Even if you can\u0027t get them balanced perfectly, making sure the \u0022assignment\u0022 is symmetrical should be good enough to keep it stable. Technically it should fly fairly well as it is if you can make thrust stay symmetrical, but it\u0027s not going to be the most abuse-tolerant design ever \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intakes are \u0022close enough\u0022 to the center of mass (especially given most of the radials are just behind it) to not be a serious concern given the cockpit etc, but it would certainly help with stability to move the radial ones as far back as possible. As others have said you could try moving the rudders further back too, although realistically it\u0027ll just give the plane more yaw authority to overcome minor tendencies to yaw left or right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple things I didn\u0027t address before:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Can it lift off the runway cleanly before flying off the end of it?
