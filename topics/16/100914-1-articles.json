I have a 10,400 ton stock rocket, and I rigged the abort button to fire a bunch of inward-firing sepatrons. The sepatrons cause key root parts to explode, making the rocket disintegrate in a very spectular and satisfying fashion. When I was a little kid, I used to build complicated Lego sets just to throw them off a balcony in my house and see how many parts they would break into... then rebuild them, and do it again. Funny, I\u0027m 30 years old and now with KSP, I still find the same kind of thing satisfying ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
