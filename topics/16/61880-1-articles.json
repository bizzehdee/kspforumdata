I was able to connect fuel lines between tanks 2 and 3 and this allowed tank 2 to drain but tanks 0 and 1 remain full. So I rebuild the stacks, this worked for two of them they drained properly top down...without any extra fuel lines. But the third stack well I tried three times but tanks 0 and 1 would never drain and on the third time the other two stacks started doing this too even though I hadn\u0027t touched them! This is with symmetry off. So I said to heck with it I\u0027ll just connect fuel lines between all the tanks...but it won\u0027t let me I can connect a fuel line between tanks 2 and 3 but not between 1 and 2 or 0 and 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne good think I\u0027ve got the hang of connecting things, but even though they look connected and solid something is not registering.
