I have all aircraft/spaceplane tech unlocked except for experimental aerodynamics.\n\nSo im allocating around 4-5 million towards a project. My goal is to setup a mega space station in orbit around kerbin, a very large mining base on the mun, and lastly a small refueler/miner rover near the KSC runway, I think you guys can see where this is going. The SSTO spaceplane I want to build will need to be able to reach and dock with my space station where it can then be refueled, then de-orbit, land on the KSC runway and refuel there. However I cant design/launch my station until I know what my SSTO is capable of. So if anyone has accomplished a similar type of project, let me know how you did it.\n\n[skip Here] Getting to the point of my question:\n\nwhere can i find tutorials on building spaceplanes and SSTO\u0027s that are compatible with the latest version of KSP, most the tutorials and youtube videos i see are from earlier versions and those craft no longer work or arent able to survive re-entry heat. Kerbal engineer tends to get buggy when im building a spaceplane, like not showing accurate delta v data, or not showing anything at all which makes this a bit difficult.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T23:26:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tylerd**"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T20:18:48Z","Content":"I\u0027ve got something similar set up at the moment in my own career save. Caveats: I use FAR, I haven\u0027t upgraded from 1.0.2 and I haven\u0027t got mining technologies unlocked just yet. I also still recover the planes at the end of the flight rather than re-launch and refuel them, though I did a set up where I would haul a plane back to the start of the Runway with a crash cart and refuel it a couple of versions ago (0.24, IIRC). I would say that KAS (and KIS) would be essential mods if you\u0027re wanting to go with something similar. I\u0027ve been led to understand that DRE handles heating better than stock at the moment, so that might also be one to consider.\n\nLet\u0027s start with the basics: are you going to want your plane to handle passengers, payloads, fuel loads, or some kind of combination thereof?

The only spaceplane tips I have are i) use a rapier engine for your first ones, ii) start small, iii) make something that flies well as a plane first, then work on high and fast.\n\nHere\u0027s one I made earlier:\n\n[![cZN5MtIl.png](http://i.imgur.com/cZN5MtIl.png)](http://imgur.com/cZN5MtI)\n\nThe fuselage there consists of two FL-T400 fuel tanks, with a Mk1 Liquid Fuel Fuselage sandwiched between them. Wings are swept wing B and tail-assembly uses structural wing d. Building this yourself, the only \u0027trick\u0027 is that the landing gear is attached to the wings with cubic octagonal struts, to give them a bit more length. Flies very nicely, lands around 40m/s with 5-degrees of pitch.\n\nETA for below:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ... ferrying Kerbals to LKO costs next to nothing with spaceplanes.\n\nGood point - the design above cost 8k more to build than my best one-man SSTO rocket but the fuel costs 1.5k less *per launch* (assuming 100% recovery for both, which is a long-shot for rockets). Not only does that mean the spaceplane breaks-even after just 5 launches but it pays for itself completely after 21, if you\u0027re ever likely to launch anything 22 times ^^.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T21:39:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 09:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan**"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T21:26:44Z","Content":"Best advice for spaceplanes is to start small.

A truism with spaceplanes is that the smaller you can make them, the more efficient they can be. It may be tempting to load it up with fuel, but that will bite you if you try to carry too much. Making a functional spaceplane requires a lot of experimentation and tweaking, so be prepared for several attempts.\n\nYou always need a little extra liquid fuel for a spaceplane to power its jets before the rockets kick in, but you do not need much. An ideal solution are the air intake nacelle, structural nacelle, or engine pre-cooler, which carry a bit of liquid fuel inside of them. Not a lot, but unless your spaceplane is a serious gas guzzler, it should be enough. \n\nMinimize drag. Cannot emphasizes this enough. Shock cone intakes are ideal for this, but do not go overboard on intakes. As long as you have enough air to power everything under your non-rocket flight ceiling, you should be fine. Speaking of flight ceiling, most planes will start to cut out at about 20,000 meters up. Try to get to 12,000 meters as quick as possible, then go into a gentle ascent from about 15,000 meters to 20,000 to build speed. Watch the thrust output of your jet engines. When they start to drop significantly and your acceleration begins to slow (but before it stops,) hit the rockets. If you have separate jets, leave them on even when the rockets go until they cut out. \n\nThen ride that acceleration until your apoapsis clears the atmosphere.

Myself, I have a plane that\u0027ll haul six Kerbals at a time to LKO - the Raven 7 (of which apparently I don\u0027t have any screenies - which is weird, because I could\u0027ve sworn I\u0027d taken a whole bunch...). My main space station over Kerbin is orbiting at 85 kilometers and I do use it as a refueling depot and staging area for tourists. I designed the Raven with 1,800 m/s of rocket delta-V; if it\u0027s refueled in orbit, it\u0027ll make Mun or Minmus orbit easily enough and I have used the design for that purpose on a couple of occasions (that particular craft earned itself a name - *Free Bird 7*).\n\nI also have a refuel plane that I use to top off the station\u0027s tanks when they become depleted - the Vulture 7:\n\n![qKCu7Wo.png](http://i.imgur.com/qKCu7Wo.png)\n\nI tried using it to refuel the Mun space station once; it\u0027s coming back from there in this picture. Did the mission reasonably well.\n\nSo planes then. You\u0027re working with stock air, right? General guidelines for stock air are to assume a 25% payload fraction and either 13 tonnes per RAPIER or 15 tonnes per Turbojet and around 200 kN of rocket per jet (I use Aerospikes - despite the lack of gimbal, they have reasonable thrust and relatively high Isp - the high Isp in turn lets me get away with carrying *less* rocket fuel. Another decent choice are pairs of Thuds). Your payload in this case is going to be your cockpit or control module, the docking port and the hab module, plus you\u0027re going to need a source of RCS fuel (two roundified RCS tanks in a cargo bay would be plenty), a couple of solar panels and a battery or two. Put that together, note the mass and multiply the result times four - the result is how heavy you can expect your plane to be, and from that you can determine how many engines you\u0027re going to want to include.\n\nI really like Slashy\u0027s designs...I wonder how they\u0027d fare in FAR...and I still wonder why I don\u0027t have any screenies of the Raven; I\u0027ll have to remedy that."},{"CreatedByName":"Tylerd","CreatedById":147949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T21:52:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Okay, that\u0027s a start. \n\u003E  Low passenger count spaceplanes can be done very economically.

It\u0027s important to know what your wings can handle so you know when it is safe to begin aerodynamic fight after reentry.\n\nFinally and hardest, you want to judge low lift stability. Drag is a significant force for much higher than lift. Some craft are aerodynamically stable only until a certain height. A mistake while it is in unstable phase can put you into a flat spin. Thankfully this often is high enough that recovery can be done easily, but it still mucks your trajectory up.\n\nOf course it is also important to tune craft performance.

It usually starts showing at about Mach 1.5 and if you can get into it the spaceplane will work. The air-breather combination also affects how high you can go, and you can get over 1200 m/s at 20,000 m. How fast do you dare go? You\u0027re going to lose some of that deltaV as you climb to 40,000m, but there is a trade-off between time and temperature.\n\nI use MechJeb, and there\u0027s an acceleration-limiter option, applied generally. Once you get into the super-thrust speed range, using that will show you, by the throttle setting applied, if you could raise the nose some more. But as you close 20,000m drop the nose and go for speed. I keep the Ascent Guidance window open, since that gives me decent gidance for the rocket stage of the flight. Check the shape of the ascent curve at the start, you want to avoid a sharp pitch change in the transition as it\u0027s both a huge burst of drag and, potentially, a disaster for stability. In effect, it\u0027s as if you started the gravity turn very early. You can be doing a zoom-climb to bring the nose up before the transition to MechJeb Ascent Guidance.\n\nAnyway, the Ascent Guidance window has a toggle for the acceleration limiter. which applies whether the autopilot is active or not. And it had settings for the target orbit.\n\nWhat I sometimes find it that there is a surprisingly long coast to the edge of atmosphere (you\u0027re in sub-orbital flight with the right apoapsis) followed by a long circularization burn. A pure rocket might not go quite so fast in the atmosphere and, by the edge of atmosphere, have lifted the periapsis more.\n\nI\u0027m inclined to the view that a good spaceplane looks way over-powered. A light single-RAPIER setup can work well, but if you can\u0027t get frightening acceleration through the sound-barrier it\u0027s going to be tricky to get enough speed.\n\nTest flights matter. It feels like a bit of a trick, but transfer the craft file from your career game saves to those for the sandbox. Do your testing there. Is that any different from NASA testing a design in a flight simulator? Some of what MechJeb does you can see in the same light. That acceleration limiter is a way of testing the climb angle. But you have lift; you can sustain a high climb angle, but climbing with lift works better for fuel consumption.\n\nIt depends on the design but I would consider reduced throttle and a relatively shallow subsonic climb to 6,000 m, full power to boost through to Mach 1.5 (about 450 m/s) and then you\u0027re in the bat-out-of-hell stage that takes you to the transition altitude and \u0022excessive speed\u0022.\n\nThe sandbox is the flight simulator for your designs."},{"CreatedByName":"Vegvisir","CreatedById":148279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T10:08:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Okay, that\u0027s a start. \n\u003E [http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/ProBuild1_zpsyxdac06t.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/ProBuild1_zpsyxdac06t.jpg)\n\nI\u0027ve literally spent days trying spaceplanes to orbit again and again....decided to dl your craft and give it a go.
