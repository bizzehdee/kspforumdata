My advise is to only move the command module up or down with the translate tool. that way it cannot move to the side at all. I had rockets spinning all the time yesterday, now they are fine."},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:48:07Z","Content":"In a (hyphenated) word: Tail-fins.\n\nAs Kyoda would say, \u0022You must unlearn what you have learned!\u0022 =D\n\nAlso, what the others suggest. Start your gravity turn almost immediately. Then keep slowly tipping / tapping over.\n\nSeriously though, if you have tail-fins, this gets a whole lot easier and can be done without any control input!
