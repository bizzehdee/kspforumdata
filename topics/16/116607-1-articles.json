I built a small \u0022Space-crane\u0022 to help landers with moving around the Mun.\n\nI bring the crane around to dock with the orbiting space station when all of a sudden, BOOM, and it loses one of its engine arms. F3 said that a BZ-52 exploded due to overheating.\n\nHere it is after the loss, at a cool 300K:\n\n![M2O28DI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/M2O28DI.jpg)\n\nSo now, debug overlay loaded, I monitor the temp. Then this happens:\n\n![oE4jV8o.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/oE4jV8o.jpg)\n\n![vZ0saJ4.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vZ0saJ4.jpg)\n\nLook at that conduction flux!\n\nThe arm exploded seconds thereafter. I noticed that the conduction flux was oscillating between extreme positive and negative values.\n\nSo my question is: What gives?! And how many of my ships are going to suddenly combust?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T23:48:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 11:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OmegaT**\n  \nKnown issue"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T22:19:56Z","Content":"There are many threads on this already, so I guess you could say it\u0027s a known bug... but I have seen no answers, and no acknowledgement by the devs. \n\nAbout all one can do at the moment is mitigation - turn conduction factor right down in physics debug. It breaks Squad\u0027s shiny new thermal system, but it\u0027s clearly broken anyway.\n\nAs for how many ships will be affected... roll the dice. I\u0027ve taken to using the \u0022Ignore max temp\u0022 cheat and disabling conduction every time I get within physics range of a large ship, otherwise things randomly explode.\n\nAm I right in thinking those are all stock parts? Besides KER, what other mods are you running?\n\nDunno what to do about this TBH, it\u0027s killing the game for me. Maybe if we make enough noise Squad will take note?"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T22:23:35Z","Content":"You\u0027d think this is the kind of stuff they\u0027d work out in Beta."},{"CreatedByName":"Layereddiagram","CreatedById":148146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T23:00:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You\u0027d think this is the kind of stuff they\u0027d work out in Beta.\n\nThey didn\u0027t have enhanced thermal in beta."},{"CreatedByName":"almagnus1","CreatedById":78068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T23:14:35Z","Content":"How effective of a workaround is adding a lot of radiators?"},{"CreatedByName":"Edax","CreatedById":147162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T23:20:44Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had this happen a few times now. First was a probe I was going to send to Duna. It was small, and had 8 parachutes, but it exploded suddenly from \u0022overheating\u0022 while still docked. I also built a spaceship in which one of the large SAS wheels kept exploding, severing the ship in two and dooming all on-board. I have a suspect that the bug involves parts mounted on others. I had a survey scanner and docking port on the SAS wheel, and the parachutes were mounted right on the probe core. Save scumming seem to encourage their spontaneous explosions, so that there seems to be no solution other then going back to the VAH and moving attachment points off the troubled part and relaunching the ship."},{"CreatedByName":"OmegaT","CreatedById":97969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T23:46:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Am I right in thinking those are all stock parts?

Quickload now instantly causes the \u0027resonance\u0027 flux oscillation.\n\nWell, if it\u0027s a known issue then not much to do except minimize or outright disable thermal physics for now.

One rocket that was exploding shortly after reaching orbit suddenly started (partially) exploding on the launchpad after I put some rads on.

One basic rocket orbiting Mun, one satelite orbiting Kerbin, to name two. It happened in stock, with KER installed and now with a bunch of mods installed. The weird thing is, if I save before things go haywire, exit the game after the explosion, start it up and reload the game, everything works smoothly with no overheating or anything.\n\nNow I\u0027m off to figure out how to prevent the launch stability enhancers to reappear midair crashing into the ship.
