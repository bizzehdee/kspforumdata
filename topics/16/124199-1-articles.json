Most of the time, power requirements were (nearly) zero; you only need enough charge to turn the vessel around and had lots of time (like hours to months) for recharging between maneuvers. Either that, or the maneuvers would require you to run the engines long enough to recharge the batteries -- nearly every engine has an alternator, after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese days, that approach can still work... unless you want to run a lab or ISRU unit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
