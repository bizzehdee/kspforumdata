(High enough so that you see a good fraction of the planet.) Another thing is that the waypoint markers that are set further out from the center of the Kerbnet map are more and more inaccurate and become essentially useless if you set them at the rim of the planet (if your FoV is large enough).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
