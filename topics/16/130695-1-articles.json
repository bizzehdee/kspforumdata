If you search the forum it should not be that hard to find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, as Snark said, the grabber is extremely bugged... I have a low tolerance to frustrating bug so I rarely use it for anything. Expect game-crash, near-to-lightspeed instant acceleration, physic-breaking sudden stop-to-zero and orbit corruption occuring to any distant ship loaded (not just the one with the grabber). I\u0027ve seen ALL THOSE myself while playing with single asteroids. I\u0027ve never had the badluck of having a save file corruption, but it once removed all the active contracts I had in the career (not that bad but...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe MOST important advice is: do NOT \u0022push\u0022 a ship on the grabber. Meant you HAVE to be in control of the ship with the grabber when grabbing something... colliding a ship with a grabber has 100% chance of crashing the universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mpk10","CreatedById":109917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T14:11:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks guys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I\u0027m going to avoid trying this now for fear of making myself crazy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluegillbronco2","CreatedById":147986,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T14:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am currently doing a YouTube series right now were I am capturing every class of asteroid.
