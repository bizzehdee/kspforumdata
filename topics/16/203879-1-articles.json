But even then, you\u0027d ideally do the full transfer burn to your high solar apoapsis directly from low Kerbin orbit.

Well, imagine Kerbin wasn\u0027t there. Imagine if it was just your spacecraft in a solar orbit that happens to be identical to Kerbin\u0027s solar orbit. What would you do to lower your periapsis towards the sun? Burn retrograde to your solar orbit, of course. And if you wanted to get out to Eeloo? Burn prograde, of course.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESo that\u0027s what you do, except that you must do it while circling Kerbin. You are in a low orbit around the planet, but your goal is still to make a burn in the correct direction relative to Kerbin\u0027s solar orbit.\u003C/span\u003E For example, if you want to go closer to the sun, you want to make a burn on Kerbin\u0027s sunlit side, so you are ejected from Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E \u0022backwards\u0022. In other words, you make a \u003Cem\u003Eprograde\u003C/em\u003E burn (relative to your low Kerbin orbit) that ejects you \u003Cem\u003Eretrograde\u003C/em\u003E (relative to Kerbin\u0027s solar orbit). And going out to Eeloo is the same, just on Kerbin\u0027s night side. You make a \u003Cem\u003Eprograde\u003C/em\u003E burn (relative to your low Kerbin orbit) that ejects you \u003Cem\u003Eprograde\u003C/em\u003E (relative to Kerbin\u0027s solar orbit). In this way, the burn to escape Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence is at the same time a burn in the right direction relative to solar orbit, so you can just keep burning in the same direction to lower your solar periapsis (or raise your solar apoapsis) despite still being just a few kilometers above Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, depending on the amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E you must spend and the acceleration your engines provide, making a very large burn in low Kerbin orbit can be very tricky. Because the orbit is so strongly curved, and you traverse a significant portion of the circle in just a few minutes, burns you make there grow less and less efficient the longer they get. If you burn at the maneuver node, you\u0027ll burn off-prograde for most of the time, whereas if you follow the prograde marker, you\u0027ll not burn in the right direction for most of the time. Rule of the thumb is that if your burn is longer than six minutes (three before the node and three after), you\u0027re starting to get inefficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can get around this by splitting the burn. For example, make one burn that raises your Kerbin apoapsis to around where the orbit of the Mun is. (Take care not to actually encounter the Mun, you don\u0027t want that here.) Loop around once, and as you come back towards your Kerbin periapsis, make a new maneuver node there and start a new burn in the same direction as the first one - basically continuing what you started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have an escape trajectory out of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, you can keep burning until you have achieved your desired solar orbit destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ant47","CreatedById":212877,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-18T15:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, I think I have a better idea of what to do now.

My current problem is that I run out of fuel on my last stage when my peristalsis is around 3-4 million meters. Whenever I add more fuel, I just use more getting to orbit around Kerbol since my craft is already like 500 tons. I have more then enough funds and leveled-up facilities to build things, but I started playing KSP around a month ago, so I don\u0027t know what my best options are for this.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust to add: In all of my attempts I just burnt prograde until I was on an escape trajectory from Kerbin, then warped to my Kerbol orbit apoapsis, and when I was there, I would burn retrograde as long as I could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally speaking, when running into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E problems the answer isn\u0027t moar boosters/struts/fuel, but rather moar stages.
