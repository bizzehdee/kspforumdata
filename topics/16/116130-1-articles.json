(Or even cooler, one of those [Sketchfab](http://blog.sketchfab.com/post/98386380804/we-have-liftoff-sketchfab-now-supports-kerbal)thingies.)\n\nBut, just based on your description, I\u0027m pretty sure you can get more out of those whiplashesesh by nosing down some around 10,000m. I usually start out at 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0-45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 like you said, but then temporarily level off to only 10-15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or so. The reason for this is the turboramjet really hits its stride here; at mach 2-3 you\u0027ll get several Gs of acceleration. If you time it right, you\u0027ll run out of intakeair just as the skin is getting too hot. Then gently pitch up to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 again to finish the climb out on rocket power. Doing it this way gets you hundreds of m/s of extra speed, which means more fuel left over."},{"CreatedByName":"SalehRam","CreatedById":138066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T07:14:42Z","Content":"I always tend to forget the screenshots :S\n\nI could not manage to do the Sketchfab, so I uploaded normal screenshots, and edited the original post with the screenshots."},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T07:33:34Z","Content":"I\u0027m not sure you really need that much turborams, I think you could get away with 2-3 only."},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T08:13:37Z","Content":"It\u0027s not power what matters, it\u0027s your maximal speed. You want a TWR between 0.60 - 0.80 for your jets and 1.20 for your rockets. This thing made it to space with 2 whiplashes and 2 LV-T45s or what is their name nowadays (the gimbaling 1,25m engines):\n\n![Bv9UoYL.png](http://i.imgur.com/Bv9UoYL.png)\n\nThe magic was really pitching down whenever the plane stopped accelerating. Be careful, though, for it might get VERY hot. Oh, and in the new aero, streamlining your plane helps you get higher speeds. Shot swept/delta wings will increase your delta-v budget dramatically, albeit they are not the best in terms of controllability - don\u0027t forget your SAS.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T08:16:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 08:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by InterCity**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T09:38:17Z","Content":"As others already mentioned, it\u0027s most likely your ascend path.\n\nPitching up to 40-45 might get you up there quickly, but your speed probably will be lower -\u003E more rocket fuel needed to get into orbit.\n\nTry a lower pitch, lets say 10-20.\n\nYou will need to watch the temperature though.
