Biome scanning and mapping really help. I really really wish someone makes a \u0022Trek\u0022 mod to abstract long motions by walking Kerbals, boats, rovers, etc. without the tedium of holding down \u0022W.\u0022\n\nThere are several surprising uses for rovers besides transportation buggies. Any time you need to dock craft on the ground wheels really help. An orbital craft landing next to a refueling miner really benefits from a \u0022truck\u0022 so you don\u0027t have to do the infamously difficult hoverdock procedure. An Eve probe might roll to the top of a hill before liftoff as it really changes the required fuel to escape the atmosoup. Cranes are popular as are full mobile gantries.\n\nIf you want to layout navigation beacons for landing on the KSC runway a wheeled drone is handy.
