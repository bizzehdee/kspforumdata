get to Mun, you can get anywhere. \u00A0It\u0027s all the same stuff you already know, just on a bigger scale, and with 1 complication. \u00A0That complication is that you can go to Mun any time you want to, just put a node on your orbit around Kerbin at the point where Mun is just above the horizon, and away you go. \u00A0This happens at some point in every orbit around Kerbin so at most you have to wait about 20 minutes before the transfer burn. \u00A0But when going to other planets, you have to wait until the other planet is in an analogous position, which might take the better part of a year to happen as both Kerbin and the target orbit around the sun. \u00A0And the further away the target planet is, the more the position of the node on your orbit around Kerbin changes from the target being just above the horizon like with Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are thus 2 angles you need to know: \u00A0 the phase angle, which is the relative positions of Kerbin and the target planet compared to the sun, and the ejection angle, which is where on your orbit around Kerbin to place the maneuver node. \u00A0There are a number of tools that tell you these things. \u00A0The easiest (as in requiring the lest amount of figuring outside the game) is MechJeb\u0027s \u0022Advanced Transfer to Another Planet). \u00A0Set your target planet, call this up, tell it you want the porkchop ploit, pick the point on the plot that looks best, and tell it to create a node. \u00A0The plot is exactly the same as that used by the website \u003Ca

put the node at exactly the right ejection angle without you having to eyeball it, and also set it for the correct time. \u00A0Then you use another mod called\u00A0Kerbal Alarm Clock (KAC) to create an alarm for that maneuver node. \u00A0And then you\u0027re set. \u00A0You can warp ahead at full speed and KAC will stop time just before it\u0027s time to do the burn. \u00A0Then you can either do the burn yourself or have MJ\u0027s autopilot do it for you. \u00A0And in the meantime, if the burn is months/years in the future, you can be flying other missions without fear that you\u0027ll miss the interplanetary transfer window because KAC will keep that from happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, that takes care of the navigation. \u00A0The only remaining hurdle is making sure your ship as the dV and TWR\u00A0required for the trip. \u00A0For this, consult a dV map, and use either MJ or Kerbal Engineer Redux (KER) to show you during construction how much dV and TWR you have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, the whole process is kinda the reverse of this. \u00A0It goes like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDesign the mission, such as deciding if you\u0027re going to land on the planet or not, and return to Kerbin or not. \u00A0If you\u0027re going to land, then your lander needs the TWR to take off at the target. \u00A0If you\u0027re going to return, you need the dV for a round trip.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nConsult a dV map to see how much dV you need for each step along the route.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBuild the ship using KER or MJ to determine if you have the TWR for the lander (if necessary) and the dV required to get there (and return, if that\u0027s intended)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse KAC to set an alarm some days ahead of the next transfer window to the target and warp (or fly other shps) until the alarm goes off.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLaunch the ship into an LKO parking orbit when the KAC alarm goes off.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse MJ to create the maneuver node for the transfer burn.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse KAC to create an alarm for the transfer burn and warp until that stops you.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDo the transfer burn.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027re on your way, you\u0027ll very likely have to tweak your trajectory mid-flight to fine-tune your approach to the target. \u00A0Create this node (either manually or with MJ) and set a KAC alarm for this burn. \u00A0Warp ahead (or fly other ships) until that alarm goes off. \u00A0Then do the tweak burn \u00A0make sure KAC creates an alarm for when you enter the SOI of the target planet, and warp ahead (or fly other ships) until you get there. \u00A0Once in the target\u0027s SOI, it\u0027s all stuff you\u0027ve done before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"reconwarrior21","CreatedById":99347,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-13T03:29:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for
