Is it still not working?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it isn\u0027t in the Utility tab on the left column (looks like a series of three little gears) then check to make sure that you don\u0027t have any characters entered into the search field in the box on the upper left of the screen above the parts list. Normally, this field says \u0022Enter search\u0022, but if you have anything typed in there it will filter your parts list to match only the parts that match what you\u0027ve typed. Make sure that is clear. For now the search won\u0027t show you everything available because the tutorial is limiting your options temporarily. You could of course type \u0022parachute\u0022 and see if it shows up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso -- and this may be obvious -- but make sure you haven\u0027t deleted the command module from your construction area. That will grey out any parts that can\u0027t be used as a root part to build on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have any mods installed? Some mods are designed to alter the parts list, change how they are categorized, hide or remove some parts entirely. It\u0027s best to run through the tutorials in a totally stock installation of the game. You might also check and see that the parts in question are installed properly. If you can find the directory where you installed KSP, navigate to \\\\Game Data\\Squad\\Parts\\Utility and you should see a list including the \u0022parachuteMK1\u0022 folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are on Steam, there is a way to verify the game\u0027s files by right-clicking on the game, selecting \u0022Properties\u0022 then \u0022Local files\u0022 then \u0022 Verify integrity of game files.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-15T22:37:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2017 10:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
