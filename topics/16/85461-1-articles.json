They have a really high Isp, which is realistic as Isp is only supposed to account for mass the vessel loses and jets harvest much of their reaction mass from the atmosphere. But, in KSP and not in real life, that high Isp is also applied to the intake air that is also used as reaction mass. This results in the jet engine consuming fuel at a much lower than accurate rate (about 1/15th of what fuel consumption should be IIRC). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the short answer is the rocket mode is working properly but the jets are consuming fuel at a much lower rate than they should.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T19:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re overdoing the explanation there Red \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJet engines are more fuel efficient than rocket engines by a large margin, both in real life and in KSP so fuel use with jets will be a lot lower.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Srpadget","CreatedById":111267,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T20:32:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way jets and rockets create thrust is to fling reaction mass out the back end at high speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary difference is that the reaction mass that gets flung out the back end of a rocket is ENTIRELY the fuel/oxidizer mix.

The OP was intuitively thinking that intake air would be a 1:1 replacement for oxidizer so that LF consumption would be similar in both modes, and you are right to say that in air-breathing mode LF is consumed at a lower rate than that. The reason it stands out so much is that the fuel consumption rate is so much lower than it should properly be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
