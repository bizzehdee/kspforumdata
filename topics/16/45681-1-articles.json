It seems like i floating on ice or something, i cant even drive up a small hill without dropping below 1 or 2 km/h.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not a power problem, i checked all facats, wheel engines were on, power was fine (full charge) and after extensive testing on kerbin i know its a working design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it common to move at next to no speed at all on the Mun? I mean i expected to go slower then on kerbin, but barely making it above 3 km/h on flat ground...if im lucky? Seems a lot slower then it should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre they this slow or could there be a problem with my game? as i said i expected to go slower...but not even being able to make it up slight inclines? That seems a bit odd to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eheres a pic, and no the scoop serves no purpose but looks (its supposed to be a race car rover..) But dont mind that, the pic is just for a reference to size/shape. It has more then enough power between batteries and generators \u002B solar panels. It doesnt even dent the power driving full out with the lights on even at night. And it carries a bunch of extra junk on (like the scoop) so its probably heavier then it should be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem? Or just normal Mun driving speeds? (i sent it to the Mun to do some sweet 0G jumps...turns out i do 0 km/h jumps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(quick edit: It is capable of 20\u002B on flat land on kerbin, so its not like its over burdened or anything)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1328.photobucket.com/albums/w538/Brevillance/2013-09-08_00001_zps99a53f4f.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-09-08_00001_zps99a53f4f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nasakev","CreatedById":72681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T04:18:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERovers often have trouble accelerating on low gravity worlds.

Under low gravity the already-kinda-weird friction model doesn\u0027t allow for much speed or control. One way to get around it is to use ion engines to generate some downforce (although this adds more mass to your rover and requires a lot of electricity to power enough engines to do anything). It\u0027s even worse on Minus, and don\u0027t even *think* about Gilly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS or liquid-fueled engines can be used for the same purpose, but they\u0027re not as efficient (although I\u0027d advise having RCS on mun rovers anyway to control them if they come off the ground).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrPopcup","CreatedById":75533,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T04:29:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it happens to us but we found a fix:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALWAYS make your rover WIDER \u0026amp; Closer to the ground, that way your rovers Center Of Mass is closer to the ground and has more friction with the ground, Also, Do you use docking contols?

I always make my rovers as wide as possible to prevent roll overs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass wise im not sure, its pretty light as 95% of it is struts/girders and solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use standard controls, whatever controls are in play when my kerbal boards it. I dont do anything special. I use RCS to help it on those larger hills to keep up speed but i found the only acceptable way to move around on the Mun was to use RCS all the time..and it runs out pretty fast as youd expect. I mean i figured its lower gravity so i anticipated slower movement..but as it stands i cant make it up even small hills, and moving on flat ground its painfully slow..i mean 2 km/h is standard. I just felt that was a bit strange but its probably just how it is. I suppose ill keep to Kerbin for my insane jumping pleasures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
