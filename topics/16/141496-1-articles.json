There, they abandoned their MAV and transfered to the Kerbin-Return-Stage. This stage has about 2250 dv. Launch windows for Kerbin opens up in 11 days, ejection needs about 1650dv. I have strong heatshields on my MK-2-pod, thus, I guess I don\u0027t need to get back to Kerbin orbit but can directly hit atmo from interplanetary speed. Thus, lots of spare dv.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, that was the idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I realized my return stage is in a retrogade Duna orbit...When I set up my manoever node for ejection burn, I miss Kerbin at about 180\u00B0 because my craft is going in the wrong direction! Shame on me!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to raise my AP until Duna SOI edge. There I can reverse orbit for about 30-40ms, then circularize again. However, this will take about 50 days. My launch window is gone and I have not enough dv for Kerbin transfer left. Until I wait in high Duna orbit for about 600 days until a new window opens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hate to fast forward the game. I don\u0027t want my Kerbals hanging in HDO for so long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions?
