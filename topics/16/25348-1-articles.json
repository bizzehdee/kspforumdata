One of the two fuel tanks hanging under the wings (right one) was draining before the other tank was. Even though I had symmetrical fuel transfer lines running from each tank to the engines. I thought it could be a bug from the order in which the plane was assembled, so I unclipped the tanks and clipped them back in using symmetry and put in new fuel transfer lines. Now the problem persists but this time with the left tank draining first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frozenbacon","CreatedById":49001,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T02:47:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the tanks are connected to a part capable of fuel crossfeed, they will ignore the fuel lines.

This will cause them to drain equally, regardless of how fast each engine consumes fuel. So, if you have, say, a center stack with a Mainsail, and 6 side-stacks with LV-Ns, the fuel meter for all 7 engines will be exactly the same length and will all drain at the same rate, which I believe would be some average based on the mean average of all the fuel consumption rates of involved engines..\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-05T05:44:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2013 05:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by M5000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sovek","CreatedById":57251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T06:11:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, poor advice RoboRay.
