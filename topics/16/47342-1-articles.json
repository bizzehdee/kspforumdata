Because of the sudden deceleration caused by a parachute opening, if a ship is not already traveling at a significantly reduced speed, the parachute will likely cause so much force on the ship that it will tear off whatever its attached to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best ways to fix this is to either slow your decent by other means (engines or drogue chutes), or use a smaller, lighter decent vehicle. Also keep in mind that deploying the parachutes too low will cause them to fully open immediately on deployment, causing a much stronger jolt than if they partially deploy higher up, and then fully deploy at lower altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robogungt8","CreatedById":81071,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T02:50:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if this is the problem, but don\u0027t time warp when chutes deploy.

So have your drogue chute open first, then before 500 meters open one normal chute, and after the shock from that is gone, open the rest one-by-one. The shock is a lot less and will be less likely to rip your ship apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
