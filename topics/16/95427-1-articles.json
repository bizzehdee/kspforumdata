I had the correct resolution and everything. Imagine the non-fullscreen mode where it has the border and you can move it around, but with the fullscreen it has a window that size and in the upper left hard corner. Its really weird and I would put on a screenshot but I dont know how and it really messes up gameplay and I cant really do anything properly. I have also tried to re-download KSP but it doesnt fix it. Also the startup application works fine and is in fullscreen its just the actual game that doesn\u0027t. And yes it is in fullscreen \u0022alt\u002Benter\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
