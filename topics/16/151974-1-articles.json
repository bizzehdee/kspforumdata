\u00A0It\u0027s possible to work around this, but usually at\u00A0the expense of being able to re-dock the rover. \u00A0All in all, the clipping issue makes using the rear cargo ramp problematic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re committed to using the rear cargo ramp, then you have to slide the docking port up the front bulkhead of the cargo bay enough that the rover\u0027s wheels are slightly above the cargo bay floor. \u00A0Thus, when you undock the rover, it will fall a short distance to the floor. \u00A0Also remember that because the rover is hanging from 1 end on a flexible joint, it will sag somewhat when physics loads. \u00A0So either you have to raise the docking port a bit more, or run struts from the rover to the cargo bay walls to hold it up. \u00A0These struts will break when you undock the rover so no problem there. \u00A0The problem is, you won\u0027t be able to dock the rover back into the cargo bay. \u00A0Either the docking port will be too high to reach, or you won\u0027t be able to reattach the necessary struts unless you use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr

doesn\u0027t seem to work for a variety of reasons. \u00A0Thus, the only stock\u00A0alternative that avoids the clipping issue is to use a \u0022bomb bay\u0022 cargo bay instead of the tail ramp, and drop the rover out the bottom. \u00A0Then the rover will never clip the cargo bay. \u00A0But of course, in stock, you\u0027ll never be able to reattach it, and you have other design issues such as sufficient airplane ground clearance for the rover to drive out from under it, but that makes the rover have to drop further, which can damage it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, if you want to use the rear cargo ramp and get the rover back in the plane, \u00A0you pretty much have to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0Then you can redock the rover with a winch and have Kerbals attach struts to hold it in
