To my great happiness, I have landed one Kerbal on both Minmus and the Mun! However, I am still not sure what to do next. I have made some of these threads before, but this was in the past, and I love hearing suggestions! I have unlocked a lot of parts, and am wondering if I should go to Duna, or make more missions to Minmus and Mun with three Kerbals and more. Or should I upgrade my Tracking Station, so I can see unknown objects? Thank you!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T03:32:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 03:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainApollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T03:37:47Z","Content":"Duna is a natural next step. \n\nSending bigger craft to Minmus and the Mun can be great practice for that.
