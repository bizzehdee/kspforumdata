Are you putting anything between them, like separators? If so, don\u0027t. The fuel will be drawn from the upper tank first. Just in case, you do attach an engine directly under the (lower) tank, without separators too. I\u0027m also not aware of a stack limit, except for the size of the VAB. But stack too much and it may be too massive for the engine to move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are attaching tanks radially, that\u0027s not stacking and I don\u0027t think fuel will flow laterally. For that you\u0027ll need fuel pipes and you connect to the source tank first and the receiving tank to complete the connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you still have problems, a photo would help.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-09T19:14:06Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2013 07:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dispatcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling error.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T19:10:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you sure it\u0027s not draining from both tanks? In theory, fuel should be drained from all tanks that an engine has access to (EDIT: And like Dispatcher said, generally from top to bottom). Do you have any other parts between the fuel tanks in question, like structural panels or girders? Not all of those can crossfeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, a few additional details about what\u0027s going on might help us make a more accurate diagnosis, as well as a screenshot of the craft in question.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lanternman","CreatedById":84976,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T19:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks both, its a vertical stack I was going for, nothing in between the tanks to get in the way. No screen shot I\u0027m afraid as I went back to the drawing board and over wrote the save with a new design just stacking x-200\u0027s.
