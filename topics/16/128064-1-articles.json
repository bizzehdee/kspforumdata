another way of getting something, usually something\u00A0rather small or a handful of Kerbals, to and/or from orbit.\u00A0 By the time I have the airplane parts to make even a marginal spaceplane, I already have the rocket parts to carry much bigger, more useful payloads to other planets, and they make so much money on contracts and milestones that they\u00A0turn huge profits even if no part of\u00A0them every returns.\u00A0 This remains the case at every higher tech level from there on.\u00A0 So I\u0027ve never found an economic justification for Kerbin-based SSTOs.\u00A0 Sure,\u00A0they might save you some money, but it\u0027s an insignificant\u00A0amount\u00A0when taken in the context of your\u00A0contract income by that point in the game, especially when factored against the player
