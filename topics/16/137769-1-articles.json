THIS (^^^) is the answer I got that has served me very, very well. Set the Pe right at 50-51\u00A0km and point your nose straight up at the zenith - yes, a 90\u00BA AOA for as long as you can hold it. You will slow down fairly quickly in the upper atmosphere, well before you get to the thick, dangerous stuff below 40km and heatsplode.

I played it just yesterday.\u00A0You have to dock with a nearby tanker, refuel and get home. I played it last night. Make a direct return to a Pe of 50km, stay nose up all the way through. I required one or two aerobraking passes, but it works. If you fully fuel from the tanker, you\u0027ll also have enough fuel to cruise back to KSC on turbojets if you miss your entry and come in too short or too long.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T00:08:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may want to relook at this one in 1.1.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs per the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/developerarticles.html/kerbal-space-program-patch-111-is-now-live-r190\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EPatch Notes\u003C/a\u003E:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022 style=\u0022font-family:monospace, monospace;font-size:14px;clear:both;white-space:pre-wrap;padding:15px;border-width:0px 0px 0px 4px;border-left-style:solid;border-left-color:rgb(224,224,224);color:rgb(39,42,52);font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;word-spacing:0px;background:rgb(250,250,250);\u0022\u003E\n\n* Tweak skin\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;internal conduction, slightly increase internal max temps of Mk1 cockpits.\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s still an issue, then feedback will always be good to see in the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebug tracker\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T02:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked at this a fair bit.

I leave my spacedock topped up with RCS. \u00A0For me that means 377.5 units of RCS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) When I am west of the impact crater on Kerbin, I burn retrograde until my Pe = 50km. \u00A0(I\u0027m still dialing in my burn location, I usually end up east of the runway. \u00A0I would like to undershoot than overshoot, but my shuttle is maneuverable enough while gliding that I can usually muscle it back over to land and not get my crew wet. \u00A0Or dead.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.)
