assists is to remember that gravity assists are just substitutes for some or all of a conventional burn. \u00A0Therefore, you need to set your course so that you pass through a point analogous to where you\u0027d do a conventional burn for the desired effect in the absence of having gravity to help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think #3 is more correctly stated as follows: \u00A0To get a braking effect, pass the assisting body on the side facing its parent body. \u00A0To get an accelerating effect, pass the assisting body on the side away from its\u00A0parent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also restate #4 as follows: \u00A0The size of the assist you get in either direction depends on 3\u00A0main factors:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe mass of the assisting body. \u00A0The greater the mass, the greater the effect.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe altitude of your Pe at the assisting body. \u00A0The lower your Pe, the greater the effect.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe angle between your ship\u0027s path\u00A0and the assisting body\u0027s orbit. \u00A0The\u00A0closer your ship\u0027s path\u00A0is to being tangential to the assisting body\u0027s orbit, the greater the effect in terms of scalar speed change and the less change in your vector direction. \u00A0OTOH, the closer your ship\u0027s path is to being perpendicular to the assisting body\u0027s orbit, the less scalar speed change and the greater the vector direction change.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also add a new rule #4.1 as follows: \u00A0For braking assists off moons\u00A0intended to aid in capturing around the main planet from interplanetary transfer orbits the significance of the braking depends not only on the above factors but also on the distance of the moon from the main planet. \u00A0Using Mun to help return to Kerbin, or using Tylo or Laythe to help capture into Jool orbit can significantly reduce the burn needed to capture at the parent. \u00A0However, in OPM,\u00A0Slate, despite being pretty much the same as Tylo, is too far from Sarnus to be of any real help. \u00A0Because your Sarnus Pe after passing Slate is so high, you end up burning just as much fuel to capture at Sarnus as if you\u0027d just burned at the lowest safe Sarnus Pe to begin with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy experience with gravity assists in KSP is pretty much limited to interplanetary capture assists as noted above, plus using Eve to help get to Moho on the cheap. \u00A0I have only ever used an acceleration assist to achieve Kerbol-escape velocity. \u00A0This is because the KSP solar system is so small that it\u0027s pretty easy to carry enough fuel to go wherever you want without having to rely on gravity assists, and this also avoids the complexity of trying to figure out when the planets align for a Voyager-style series of assists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T18:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

It\u0027s retrograde, sure, but that doesn\u0027t actually make any real difference. I suspect this (estimating what is braking and what isn\u0027t) is a point where previous discussions on these forums have induced \u0022rules of thumb\u0022 which, unlike tomf\u0027s ones, are not quite right. People talk about passing on the night/day side and whatnot but they are generally gross approximations which are only valid in a very narrow set of circumstances. I make my own gross approximations all the time and they rarely stand up to scrutiny.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe article given by FullMetalMachinist is really quite excellent, and the 3x3 grid gif itself is great: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/charts-diagrams/20130925_Fig2-assist-gallery.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/charts-diagrams/20130925_Fig2-assist-gallery.gif\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 On that gif there is only a 90\u00B0 turn about the minor body (not the 115\u00B0 described by tomf) so the situation we\u0027re talking about is similar to an incoming angle of \u0022h\u0022 and outgoing angle of \u0022f\u0022 - clearly a boost from the major body\u0027s point of view in any event.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI certainly wouldn\u0027t use my nick for the SOI-effect - I\u0027m certainly not the only one to have deduced it\u0027s existence. However if tomf can give the formula I asked for above, it can certainly be quantified: you just need to work out the velocity of a craft descending towards Kerbin from a 70km/53000km orbit at the edge of the Mun\u0027s SOI (12,000km \u002B 2,400km or so), then what the velocity should have been at the altitude of the Mun itself (12,000km) if it hadn\u0027t entered the Mun\u0027s SOI, and the difference is the \u0022potential\u0022 velocity that has been lost due to entering the SOI from a higher altitude and exiting at a lower one. In the given example, I would suspect it isn\u0027t all that much, and certainly not enough to counter the over-542m/s boost that a such a large change in trajectory would give the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-24T14:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI Hadn\u0027t taken the Plusk effect into account previously so I have just added it to my spreadsheet, you enter the Mun\u0027s SOI at a kerbin height of 144Mm and leave at 120Mm and the difference is negligible. the change\u0027s in velocity at SOI boundaries are entirely predictable and taken into account.

body other than the one you\u0027re gravity-surfing on. \u00A0KSP doesn\u0027t work that way. \u00A0Every time you change SOI, the frame of reference changes to the body owning the SOI. \u00A0This changes both the magnitude and direction of the ship\u0027s velocity, often quite significantly and in defiance of all logic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA simple example: \u00A0a normal transfer to Mun to capture into a prograde orbit where you cross Mun\u0027s orbit slightly before the encounter. \u00A0On the map view just prior to the encounter, while you\u0027re in Kerbin\u0027s SOI, you\u0027re moving at a few\u00A0thousand m/s and heading in a prograde orbital direction with Mun behind and inside of you. \u00A0Keep the map focused on your ship and oriented so you can see both Kerbin and Mun. \u00A0Then boom, you cross into Mun\u0027s SOI. \u00A0Your ship, Mun, and Kerbin don\u0027t move. \u00A0However, your ship changes direction by about 135^ to be heading back at Mun, and its speed\u00A0now is only\u00A0few hundred m/s. \u00A0Now, you might argue that this is just a display thing and that somewhere, the game is keeping track of the ship\u0027s position and velocity based on some fixed, universal coordinate system, so all this really makes no significant difference. \u00A0But how solid is that assumption?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider\u00A0the classic \u0022Joolian Snooker\u0022 problem\u00A0of trying to transfer from Laythe to Vall as efficiently as you can,\u00A0so you leave Laythe tangential to its orbit and meet\u00A0Vall on the opposite side of Jool from where you left Laythe. \u00A0So you do this burn in Laythe\u0027s SOI and achieve Laythe escape velocity in the same direction Laythe is moving. \u00A0While within Laythe\u0027s SOI, you are moving considerably faster than Laythe so leave it behind, eventually exiting its SOI and entering Jool\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow logically, because you\u0027ve left Laythe\u0027s SOI and are moving faster than it, you just\u00A0go on about your business. \u00A0And in fact the map view reflects this, showing clear sailing all the way to Vall. \u00A0But you\u0027re now in Jool\u0027s SOI and must play by its rules. \u00A0From Jool\u0027s POV, you are now moving only slightly faster than Laythe, and as you climb out towards Vall you\u0027re slowing down. \u00A0It doesn\u0027t take long for your speed relative to Jool to drop below Laythe\u0027s, which means Laythe is now catching up with you from behind. \u00A0And because you\u0027re on an efficient, low-angle transfer trajectory, you\u0027re not moving outwards from Laythe\u0027s orbit very fast. \u00A0Thus, by the time Laythe catches up with you, you haven\u0027t moved far enough outwards to be out of reach of its SOI. \u00A0The result: \u00A0suddenly, without any warning on the map view or even from KAC if you have that, you\u0027re back in Laythe\u0027s SOI. \u00A0And you\u0027re heading in the opposite direction, back at Laythe, usually on a collision course, and with a very high velocity relative to Laythe. \u00A0Hope you had a quicksave from before you burned, so you can redo the burn for a less-efficient transfer going outwards faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGranted, this is something of an extreme example, but it shows that the game\u0027s left hand doesn\u0027t know what it\u0027s right hand is doing. \u00A0The part of the game you interact with as a player is telling you all is well and playing by logical rules. \u00A0However,\u00A0the part of the game that actually matters, the one actually controls the position and velocity of your ship, is playing by its own bizarre set of rules. \u00A0The bottom line is that the map view lies to you, there doesn\u0027t seem to be any universal coordinate system in use by what actually moves your ship, and you can\u0027t make exact calculations, or even very tight estimates, across SOI boundaries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, there are real orbital mechanics, which the map view tries hard to show you, and there are KSP orbital mechanics, which is what really happens. \u00A0For conventional burns not using gravity assists, the results are very similar---otherwise, KSP wouldn\u0027t be a viable product. \u00A0But the whole SOI thing contains a major flaw somewhere, the effects of which are exacerbated in certain situations to produce wildly divergent results from what you expect to happen from the map view. \u00A0It seems to me that trying to do radical gravity assists is one of these situations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-24T14:52:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca

you\u0027re gravity-surfing on. \u00A0KSP doesn\u0027t work that way. \u00A0Every time you change SOI, the frame of reference changes to the body owning the SOI. \u00A0This changes both the magnitude and direction of the ship\u0027s velocity, often quite significantly and in defiance of all logic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA simple example: \u00A0a normal transfer to Mun to capture into a prograde orbit where you cross Mun\u0027s orbit slightly before the encounter. \u00A0On the map view just prior to the encounter, while you\u0027re in Kerbin\u0027s SOI, you\u0027re moving at a few\u00A0thousand m/s and heading in a prograde orbital direction with Mun behind and inside of you. \u00A0Keep the map focused on your ship and oriented so you can see both Kerbin and Mun. \u00A0Then boom, you cross into Mun\u0027s SOI. \u00A0Your ship, Mun, and Kerbin don\u0027t move. \u00A0However, your ship changes direction by about 135^ to be heading back at Mun, and its speed\u00A0now is only\u00A0few hundred m/s. \u00A0Now, you might argue that this is just a display thing and that somewhere, the game is keeping track of the ship\u0027s position and velocity based on some fixed, universal coordinate system, so all this really makes no significant difference. \u00A0But how solid is that assumption?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider\u00A0the classic \u0022Joolian Snooker\u0022 problem\u00A0of trying to transfer from Laythe to Vall as efficiently as you can,\u00A0so you leave Laythe tangential to its orbit and meet\u00A0Vall on the opposite side of Jool from where you left Laythe. \u00A0So you do this burn in Laythe\u0027s SOI and achieve Laythe escape velocity in the same direction Laythe is moving. \u00A0While within Laythe\u0027s SOI, you are moving considerably faster than Laythe so leave it behind, eventually exiting its SOI and entering Jool\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow logically, because you\u0027ve left Laythe\u0027s SOI and are moving faster than it, you just\u00A0go on about your business. \u00A0And in fact the map view reflects this, showing clear sailing all the way to Vall. \u00A0But you\u0027re now in Jool\u0027s SOI and must play by its rules. \u00A0From Jool\u0027s POV, you are now moving only slightly faster than Laythe, and as you climb out towards Vall you\u0027re slowing down. \u00A0It doesn\u0027t take long for your speed relative to Jool to drop below Laythe\u0027s, which means Laythe is now catching up with you from behind. \u00A0And because you\u0027re on an efficient, low-angle transfer trajectory, you\u0027re not moving outwards from Laythe\u0027s orbit very fast. \u00A0Thus, by the time Laythe catches up with you, you haven\u0027t moved far enough outwards to be out of reach of its SOI. \u00A0The result: \u00A0suddenly, without any warning on the map view or even from KAC if you have that, you\u0027re back in Laythe\u0027s SOI. \u00A0And you\u0027re heading in the opposite direction, back at Laythe, usually on a collision course, and with a very high velocity relative to Laythe. \u00A0Hope you had a quicksave from before you burned, so you can redo the burn for a less-efficient transfer going outwards faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGranted, this is something of an extreme example, but it shows that the game\u0027s left hand doesn\u0027t know what it\u0027s right hand is doing. \u00A0The part of the game you interact with as a player is telling you all is well and playing by logical rules. \u00A0However,\u00A0the part of the game that actually matters, the one actually controls the position and velocity of your ship, is playing by its own bizarre set of rules. \u00A0The bottom line is that the map view lies to you, there doesn\u0027t seem to be any universal coordinate system in use by what actually moves your ship, and you can\u0027t make exact calculations, or even very tight estimates, across SOI boundaries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, there are real orbital mechanics, which the map view tries hard to show you, and there are KSP orbital mechanics, which is what really happens. \u00A0For conventional burns not using gravity assists, the results are very similar---otherwise, KSP wouldn\u0027t be a viable product. \u00A0But the whole SOI thing contains a major flaw somewhere, the effects of which are exacerbated in certain situations to produce wildly divergent results from what you expect to happen from the map view. \u00A0It seems to me that trying to do radical gravity assists is one of these situations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was going to snip some of that to save space, but there\u0027s actually nothing to cut out since it\u0027s all good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApart from \u0022This changes both the magnitude and direction of the ship\u0027s velocity, often quite significantly and in defiance of all logic.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think the whole thing about orbital mechanics is that it defies logic because it defies intuitive logic until you\u0027ve had enough time to think about it. It\u0027s one of the great things about the game: it forces the player to get to grips with notions that a number of respected physicists and engineers had a great deal of problem with before they were demonstrated to be true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I think people have different ways of dealing with orbital interactions that start off by seeming \u0022against all logic\u0022. My \u0022Aha!\u0022 moment came when I realised I wasn\u0027t looking at moons and planets as being moving points, but vast moving spheres representing their SOI. That\u0027s where your Laythe-to-Vall problem starts looking very obvious: you are leaving a vast sphere from the middle, then slowing down as you climb towards the top of that sphere. Slow down faster than the gradient of that virtual mountain coming up on you (imagine you\u0027re in a plane taking off in a crosswind, with a huge hill on the downwind side that you need to climb over before you get blown into it... it sorta does that for me) and you get caught badly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, the map lies to you.
