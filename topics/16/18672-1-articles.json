Makes space navigation easier, and making satellites look more awesome. Comes with struts blocks/beams to make megastructures too. Don\u0027t forget the Down Under Aerospace Parts Pack, which has a lot of neat stuff to get rockets into orbit, and comes with a return shuttle (WARNING: Not meant for atmospheric flight!). 2 of the 2m fuel tanks can send smaller ships into orbit. There\u0027s also the Cart mod I use, which let\u0027s you drive mini-cars, fun for exploration purposes. Don\u0027t forget the Sunbeam Laser, as it is great for clearing whatever junk you have lying around, in space or on a planet. If you don\u0027t want to clear the junk with lasers you can always make them explode with the TNT Pack mod, which allows you to attach C4 and TNT to blow up remotely or automatically.
