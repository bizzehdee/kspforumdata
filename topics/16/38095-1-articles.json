The thing likes to pitch over at about 50 meters after takeoff during testing. That\u0027s with ASAS/SAS on. Without it gets up to about 500 meters then slowly starts to list. But if I try to correct it the controls are all backwards and it immediately rolls over. CoM/CoT are perfect. I control it from the cranes pod and it still rolls. Now with the rover detached the crane works fine. So idk if the rover torque is somehow interfering? Because even though im controlling another pod I can still move the rover wheels. any tips?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/576743484498702468/80841BE03C8E6AF50D3031FDAB289772C99FE958/\u0022 alt=\u002280841BE03C8E6AF50D3031FDAB289772C99FE958\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-23T17:50:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2013 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T02:14:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour CoT is over your CoM, so all the gimbals on the engines are having reverse action and the game does not take account for those situations.

Your ship has almost no control authority from gimbals. Since we cant change thrust of each engine individually (as it is done IRL for such cases) the only other way to get control power without changing the design and dimensions of the craft, would be to angle engines inwards. It won\u0027t push the CoT shown in VAB down but the intersection of lines perpendicular to thrust vector of each engine (that the gimbal moments depend on) will go down (possibly below whole craft) increasing gimbal torques. It can also allow having CoM below CoT and without reversed controls).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-23T01:02:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2013 01:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nao\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T01:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you get your engines a bit further out (those M55 radials seem like total overkill for the load your skycrane is dropping) and then use shift-WASDQE to angle them out 1 or 2 clicks (5 or 10 degrees) it was really stable (on my mockup anyway, couldn\u0027t guess exact construction though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NGbESpM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NGbESpM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt ran out of fuel pretty quick on Kerbin, but I\u0027m not sure where you\u0027re trying to land this (surface-to-surface, from space, to atmosphere planetoid etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6IqZIgH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226IqZIgH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeemed fine though.
