Once you have your node good enough that you have an SoI intercept on the target planet, click on that target planet and choose \u0022Focus View.\u0022 The map view will center there, and by zooming in you can see your path past the planet. Then just rotate the camera view around until your maneuver node is on-screen, and you can nudge it to get the target Pe where you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond: you can fine-tune a node by mousing over one of the grab handles and scrolling the mouse wheel up and down instead of clicking on the node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird: you don\u0027t have to get it perfect on your initial burn out of Kerbin. Just get it reasonably close, and then when you\u0027re, say, still 50 days out, make your correction burn then.
