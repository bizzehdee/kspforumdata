Rather than launch this relay all at once, I\u0027ve decided to launch them one-by-one. My planned relay consists of six satellites in a keostationary orbit: three for the main communications relay with one satellite between each of the three main ones to act as a back up to maintain coverage as the satellites drift in their orbits -- I\u0027m trying to get them right at 35,786 kilometers (I\u0027m playing with Real Solar System installed) by using MechJeb to get the periapsis and apoapsis exactly right, but I know there will be some errors, thus, I\u0027ve decided to add in some redundancy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, is there a method to set up my launches so that each of my satellites ends up in the correct geostationary location? I just tried what seemed to be the most intuitive method (launching each of the rockets just under four hours apart, so each one would be launched one-sixth of a Kerbin sidereal day apart), but that didn\u0027t seem to work. Satellites one and three seemed to end up in a kerbostationary orbit at the exact same location, as did satellites two and four (each group of two satellites ended up in a section of kerbostationary orbit that definitely was not one-sixth or one-third apart from the other group). So, it appears that the most intuitive method doesn\u0027t work. Is there any set period of time to offset each of my launches so that the satellites *will* end up in kerbostationary orbits 60 degrees away from each other?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-09T06:31:24Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2014 06:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Exosphere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T06:08:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs apposed to timing, I used a different method to get all my proper spaced satellites.
