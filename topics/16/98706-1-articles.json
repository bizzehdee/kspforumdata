As such, you COULD use the Klaw to grab a rover and drop it once you reach destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, unlike docking port, I don\u0027t think it is possible \u0022grab\u0022 onto something in VAB, so it will be tricky to get something into orbit that way.

This forum is very helpful. I had been trying to use a small de-coupler to carry the rover. Problem was on the Mun, it would decouple but the rover was getting stuck on the lander. Not sure what was going on. I tried using docking ports but couldn\u0027t get one to attach to the rover. Didn\u0027t know I only needed to use one if there was no return trip planned. Will give this a try later today.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
