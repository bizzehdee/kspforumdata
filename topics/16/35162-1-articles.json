Here\u0027s my problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve downloaded a few SSTOs and a few strictly aircraft vehicles to try to figure out what\u0027s needed to make a functional plane. I think I\u0027ve gotten the gist of it but all of my own planes have a problem that few downloaded planes have: my planes drift off during take-off, run off the runway and usually crash or lose a few part in the grass. My planes are made with symmetry so they should be weighted correctly. I\u0027ve tried moving the wheels around, push them back or forward, put them further or closer to the center of mass. All it does is change how pronounced the drift is but there\u0027s still a drift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn some planes, I can fix the problem by toggling ASAS as I\u0027m taking off but then the plane has trouble getting off the runway in a controllable manner because ASAS keeps the nose down. Once I turn the ASAS off, the plane is going way too fast for a nice take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something I\u0027m missing here? Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeff Bird","CreatedById":59988,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T17:23:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdding some struts helped with this same problem. Looks like heck.

I also suggest using the avionics package as that allows for input from your keyboard while having the S.A.S. on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darion","CreatedById":28598,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T16:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis tends to be a problem when you don\u0027t have quite enough lift at the speed you are traveling. the craft tries to lift off, but can\u0027t and gets pulled to the side instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry adding more lift surfaces and moving the rear wheels slightly behind the center of lift. also try to keep the rear wheel base wide, it wont change your problem much, but it prevents tipping over while taking off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDarion\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
