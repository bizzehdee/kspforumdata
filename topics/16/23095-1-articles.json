I figure my next step is to make a manned, round trip expedition to Duna. I\u0027ve tested a lander on Kerbin that can make a parachuted decent, land, take off, achieve orbit, and escape kerbins sphere of influence, and since Duna\u0027s atmosphere is thinner, I believe it will have no trouble coming home. The problem is, my existing launcher and interplanetary stage designed for small rovers just won\u0027t cut it with the extra weight. If you guys could give me tips and examples of good round trip Duna mission vehicles, I would greatly appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hound392","CreatedById":58762,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T14:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not yet played the game but i\u0027ve watched various let\u0027s plays and tutorials(by this i mean 100\u002B) i would suggest that you use jet engines as boosters(they can be used) which will very effectively with a minuscule amount of fuel get you up to about 13000 ft without using any main fuel, After this you could swap to Liquid fuel boosters(stage all boosters in asparagus staging to enhance effectiveness to max) Once you are then out of the atmosphere and in orbit you could use the fuel you have(give yourself a decent amount and aspargus stage all your fuel tanks to your PRIMARY engine in the centre) then you can break free of the orbit of kerbin and use all the fuel you didn\u0027t need to use getting into orbit to get yourself to Duna. and then just have a Normal Lander probe/manned vehichle. Also if your running out of space in the VAB you can detatch sections and put them to the side and build the required parts and then re-attatch the other parts and although it will go through the ground of the VAB it will automatically fix itself on the LaunchPad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope it helped.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThePsuedoMonkey","CreatedById":58589,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T17:36:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think a good way to drop some weight is to make your Duna touchdown vehicle a glider, which could also help out your Duna liftoff stage. If you want to go that route, then check out the FireSpitter mod too since it adds lots of aircraft parts. The gravity of Duna is about 1/3 of Kerbin, so I think 2500 deltaV should be a decent target for its liftoff stage. Your final transfer stage will probably be easiest to design around if it\u0027s ion-based, but Duna\u0027s atmosphere is thin enough that an LV-N isn\u0027t useless and some of the tiny radial rockomax thrusters would pair well with that since they have a great TWR. Using moons to slingshot is a great way to conserve fuel too, and both planets have a decent-sized one to use for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T00:11:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWorking on a round-trip manned Duna mission myself at the moment. I\u0027d suggest docking; stick a docking port on your lander and boost a corresponding unmanned transfer module into orbit to rendezvous with it. You should still be able to use the same boosters you\u0027ve got if you don\u0027t try to lift it all into orbit all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould love to see a pic of your lander; I have yet to build one that will achieve Kerbin orbit all on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T01:53:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA return trip from Duna is the lowest delta-v interplanetary mission you can do; it\u0027s a great place to start. The biggest challenge for most KSP players is getting the idea that minimal designs are almost always best, and that\u0027s the case here. If you\u0027ve built a ship that can get to Duna, you\u0027ve almost surely got one that can get back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings to keep in mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Every kilo you can shave off of upper stages winds up saving 7-10 times more mass from the stage below (and that total mass saved saves another 7-10 times as much from lower stages and so on.) So keep your return stage as minimal as humanly possible if you\u0027re having trouble getting your vehicle into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re reasonably good at launches and getting from place to place in the solar system, then you can get from Duna\u0027s surface to Kerbin\u0027s with a vehicle that masses 4 tons. (Command Pod Mk1 - parachute - ASAS module - FL-T400 fuel tank - LV-909 engine - ladder - LT-2 landing struts x 3. Go with LT-1 legs if you are good with landings, but the difference is small for the additional ruggedness that LT-2 gives.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd an interplanetary transfer stage to this by attaching a pair of FL-T400 fuel tanks on radial decouplers with fuel lines. Done cleanly, you\u0027d have ~1500m/s to get to Duna, ~900 m/s for slowing down at Duna (to assist your parachute and keep it from ripping off), ~1300 m/s to get back into orbit around Duna, and ~1300 m/s to get back to Kerbin. There is slop in all of this, and if you aerobrake properly at Duna, you could move the 900 m/s to any other part of the deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal mass for a vehicle to get from LKO to Duna\u0027s surface and back - 8.6 tons. I\u0027m reasonably sure that you can get that into orbit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (This could definitely be shaved down further, for all of the minimalists who are thinking, \u0022Oh yeah, well I did it in 4 tons!\u0022 This is a reasonable design with a fair amount of excess delta-v.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: If you want to add some wiggle room to the mission, change the fuel tank for the return vehicle to an FL-T800. That will add a couple of tons to the vehicle, but it also gives you another 600 m/s to play with. If you do this, you could also use an X200-8 fuel tank, which will give the same fuel load with a broader base, but it will look weird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Good staging adds small but significant amounts of delta-v to virtually any design. If you aren\u0027t using asparagus staging, you should seriously consider doing so. Some people don\u0027t like the look and refuse to do it, but it\u0027s impossible to beat in the current version of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Because Duna\u0027s atmosphere is thin, you want to try to land at the lowest altitude possible to maximize drag on your landing. Even with that, your landing can be pretty hairy. Be sure to add struts from your command module to the parachute, because it\u0027s going to deploy when you\u0027re going 400 m/s or faster, most likely. Also add struts from the command module to the ASAS and between the fuel tank and ASAS, because they really like to break at that point. I like the large, dark brown feature that crosses the equator for a landing site. It\u0027s flat and at the datum altitude, so landings are relatively easy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Duna\u0027s atmosphere is so thin that your launch profile will be closer to launching from a vacuum planet than from Kerbin. You can start turning immediately, and go completely horizontal by the time you get to 5-10km. This will save you a substantial amount of delta-v from gravity drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI forgot to mention that you will want to set up your parachute to activate via an action group. You can deploy it the first time using staging, but the second time, once you\u0027ve repacked it at Duna, can\u0027t be done in staging, so you need the action group or you\u0027re going to make a hole in the ground on your return (though a powered landing on returning to Kerbin is a real possibility, believe it or not.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA some more: Another possibility is switching to an LV-N engine for the lander. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a great choice here, however, since it will require you to build out the landing legs and add an additional ladder, plus the engine itself is much more massive than the LV-909. Swapping the engines out and making necessary changes to the landing gear and such got me something like 1000 m/s extra delta-v but it requires about 3 tons more mass and looks clunky. For a longer range trip, like a Moho or Dres return vehicle, it would be a much more viable option.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-21T02:08:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2013 02:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jason Patterson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESubtraction is not my friend.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T06:55:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with Jason; asparagus staging really helps out when launching heavy stages. I tend to use one massive rocket for all my heavy lifting needs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe size of your vehicle all depends on how many Kerbal you want to send to the Red Planet, as the three-man cockpit weighs four times as much as the basic one-man capsule. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your interplanetary transfer stage, use the nuclear engines, as those have amazing efficiency that will get you to Dina with fuel to spare. My favorite strategy is to make a transfer stage from one of the large grey tanks and surround it with nuclear rockets. It probably has too much delta-v for a trip to Duna though, you may want to downsize that design a bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a good delta-v guide, check out this site: ksp.olex.biz It is a great guide for calculating when you\u0027ll need to burn and how much delta-v you\u0027ll need to expend to get there (and back). In order to find out how much delta-v your rocket actually has, I suggest downloading the Kerbal Engineer (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kerbal-engineer-redux-v0-5/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kerbal-engineer-redux-v0-5/\u003C/a\u003E ) It has all the information windows of Mechjeb, minus the sour reputation! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to remain mod-free, then try scaling up your rover interplanetary rocket: add more engines and fuel tanks. You could also add a docking port, so that your lander could detach when you arrive in Duna orbit, then reconnect after they\u0027ve performed their mission. This allows for much smaller lander designs, and I find it feels a lot cooler \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
