I am obsessed with building space planes but I suck at it so I have another problem. I was building an SSTA with ISRU and stuff. Awesome thrust to weight, good amount of fuel, vertical engines. Just one problem though... I was test-flying it to orbit and I found a slight flaw. At 20km when you have to nose up to 30-40 degrees and fire up nukes, I nosed up and tried to hold it but it kept nosing up. In previous questions, I\u0027ve been too lazy to make an imgur album.
