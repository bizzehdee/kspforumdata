My cargo SSTOs all use a set of custom canards, usually a set of delta wings with control surfaces out in the front of the plane, and since the wing parts all go replaced I\u0027ve been noticing some weird behavior from the new control surfaces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo demonstrate what I mean I have the following images:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture 1. is of a demonstrator with a small delta wing and a control surface both in front of and behind the center of mass. Once loaded onto the runway I pitch up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vvDASeml.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vvDASeml.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture 2. is basically identical, except I\u0027ve replaced the delta wing and control surface in front of the COM with a Standard Cannard, an \u0022old\u0022 part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sw0aBGSl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sw0aBGSl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll notice that in Picture 1. the wing parts in front of the COM exhibit the exact opposite behavior of the parts in the same position in Picture 2. Pitching up causes the new control surfaces to pitch \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Edown\u003C/span\u003E when in front of the COM. What\u0027s more is that I\u0027m 100% sure that the old control surfaces didn\u0027t use to act this way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not asking for the old control surfaces back, but I hope this wasn\u0027t intentional and simply a bug that wasn\u0027t caught pre-update. My entire fleet is grounded until this can be sorted out, so if either SQUAD changes this or if someone else has a workaround it would be much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T19:19:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s working as intended for me... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T19:21:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YhcVxxa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YhcVxxa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ijDcXFC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ijDcXFC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T19:28:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour craft will rotate about its CoM, so yes, the new surfaces are still pitching the way they need to turn your craft where you want.
