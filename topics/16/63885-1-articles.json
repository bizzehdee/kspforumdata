I\u0027m trying to map both RCS and camera view to my hat switch using the trigger button to switch from RCS to camera movement. I set up the button1 to use #joystick 2 configuration which maps up down left right to my hat basically camera movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways thing is going fine, except that the game still registers the RCS binding so now both the camera moves and RCS thrusts at the same time....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
