SO FAR, I\u0027ve tried to create a single launch rocket with both the TLI booster, lander and CM all as payload, but didn\u0027t want to create a 3 stage rocket to do so. I was VERY close to creating a 2 stage LF rocket to carry payload to the Mun, but was short delta v. One option was to use boosters to help push the rocket up, but opted not to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then decided to launch with 2 seperate rockets, one with the CM on one of my SSTO rockets. And the other payloads on a 2 stage rocket (including delta v to circularize AND TLI). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes everyone think I should do it in ONE rocket launch ala Saturn V OR should I do 2 launches...? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm also struggling to find the best delta v loadout for a lunar mission. I have a delta v map to tell me how much I need, but I usually leave extra fuel to screw around with. How much did each stage on apollo have? Did the LM really have 4500 m/s delta v to land and takeoff?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-29T22:10:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still pretty new to RSS/RO so you may take my advice with a pinch of salt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027ve found it the easiest to just copy the Saturn V approach. That is: 1st stage: kerolox to lift off the ground, 2nd stage hydrolox to get most of the acceleration needed for orbit, third stage TLI. It is absolutely essential to save as much as you can on the weight of your CSM and LM, even small savings there translate into massive savings on first stage weight and thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TeeGee","CreatedById":82434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-29T22:34:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with you 100%, but I am trying to improve on what NASA has done with their Saturn V rockets.

As you say, the F1s can seriously push (and they aren\u0027t throttleable). If you\u0027re trying to 2-stage it, by the time your huge first stage depletes it will have some mental TwR going on. That puts a lot of strain on your stack, and might make controls difficult to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eii. Hydrolox is much more efficient than kerolox, and second stage engines are much lighter than the F1s. You only really need the massive pushing power for as long as it takes to get into a position where a hydrolox stage is able to take over, any more seems a bit like using a hammer to crack a nut, and you\u0027re carrying a lot of weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eiii. Doing it on a huge second stage runs into the same TwR issue, hence the division of a Saturn V into a second stage with five J2s and a third stage with only one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eiv. The lighter your craft becomes, the more critical \u0027dead weight\u0027 becomes. Since your upper stage doesn\u0027t need a TwR beyond about 1, any engine pushing you beyond that essentially becomes dead weight and will be unnecessarily reducing your total dV (for that stage, and for any stages before it). Clearly adding an extra stage is also adding weight, so there will be some critical point at which it becomes worthwhile. I\u0027m sure someone more numerically minded than me has already done the maths - I haven\u0027t, but my second stages usually cut out with a final TwR of about 2.5-3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps a bit!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TeeGee","CreatedById":82434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T11:30:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo u think that when I reach max twr with my f1, my stacks could crumple?
