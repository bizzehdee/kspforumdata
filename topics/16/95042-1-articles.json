This will usually put me into a sub-orbital trajectory with an apoapsis of about 10-15 km. I then circularize the orbit at apoapsis. Once in orbit I preform my \u0022transKerbin injection\u0022 burn at an ejection angle of about 135-140 degrees.

For instance, it is typically stated that it takes 4550 m/s to reach Kerbin orbit, which is based on vacuum ISP. The loss resulting from the reduction of ISP due to atmospheric pressure is about 150 m/s. In other words, it takes about 4400 m/s to reach orbit if you perform the computation using the actual instantaneous ISP integrated over the ascent. I find that if you use the average of sea level and vacuum ISP for the lower stage, and vacuum ISP for the upper stage, you\u0027ll get a pretty good estimate of what the actual \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV will be.
