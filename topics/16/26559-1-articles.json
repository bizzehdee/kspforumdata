It goes faster above 5km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts: Mk2 fuse, 3 ram air intakes, 2 aerospike engines, 2 rocket fuel tanks, 1 turbojet engine, 1 flt400 fuel tank, 3 landing gear, 2 delta wings, 1 avr8 winglet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConnect them in the configuration observed in the video. You will want to position the wings and Jet motors in such a way that your center of lift is slightly behind your center of gravity for maximum stability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*note* I chose to save weight and not use SAS. You may easily add one in between the ram air intake and the fuselage if you want an easier time of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstructions:Take off with the left and right ram air intakes closed on jet engine. Gain altitude to 10k as fast as you can, IE straight up. At 10k level off and gain max speed, climb steady to 15k, open ram intakes, make shallow ascent for maximum speed. Your goal is 21,000m 1380mp/s at which point you will engage the aerospikes to\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BB\u00C2\u00BF insert into 130KM orbit with 1/4 fuel left.
