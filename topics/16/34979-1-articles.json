However, the next issue was weight and balance. When using rockets, it is better at first to line smaller tanks up either or horizontally or vertically, directly parallel to one another and close to the CG in order to keep the weight shift to a minimum as fuel burns off, otherwise you will find yourself either too nose heavy or tail heavy during the last leap from atmosphere to space or during reentry. It sounds like you might be having the issue of the CG moving too far aft, thus making your ship impossible to control once fuel is spent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I got the balancing and the intakes down, the rest was just tuning. Also, keep in mind that for me I did nothing special between jet engine shutdown and rocket burn, just one right into the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, one more thing, for me I realized that I had to shut the jet engines down before leaving atmo.
