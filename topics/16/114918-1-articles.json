I will have to see.\n\nThe plane parts are suited for the LV-N well, because they carry pure liquid fuel. The LV-Ns used to get better numbers because they used to use fuel and oxidizer, which is denser, and because fuel consumption is not directly proportional to volume, the Delta-V is greater because you\u0027re using the same amount of fuel mass per second, but packed into a smaller space. The newer LV-N uses just liquid fuel, and as such must use more units per second because of it\u0027s density being constant, and the overall fuel mass being less.\n\nEDIT: Let\u0027s just use some numbers.\n\nOld LV-N:\n\n1 Rockomax X200 has 1600 total units of fuel, weighing a total 8 tons.

Your fuel mass fraction has gone down, plus the LV-Ns are quite heavy (3t each) which also reduces mass fraction.

LVT-45 is 1.5t while LV-N is 3t. That means more dry mass fraction, and that in order means using LV-N for short range flights makes little sense - you will get more dV out of a classic engine in a light, short-range craft simply thanks to a lower dry mass fraction. It\u0027s good for interplanetary flights, for tugs that fly a lot so and fro between refuellings, it makes sense in SSTO because it uses the same LF as the jets (although bridging the 1100-2300m/s gap of orbital speed before sinking back into the atmosphere is more than a little tricky), but if you\u0027re making a transfer stage to bring a small lander to Mun, you\u0027re really better off with \u0022classic\u0022 engines.\n\nAnd yeah, using them with standard fuel tanks after removing all oxidizer really kills all benefits - the dry mass fraction gets so high the ISp ceases to matter.\n\nAs for atmospheric use... at 10,000m it has already some 700 ISp and most of its vacuum thrust."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T08:15:28Z","Content":"But also remember if you use the same tank for your comparison, you don\u0027t have the same fuel mass between LV-N and others to begin with (because you consciously removed oxidizer for nukes), makes the comparison unfair or even invalid."},{"CreatedByName":"Edax","CreatedById":147162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T17:52:37Z","Content":"The advantage of the LV-N with spaceplanes with a LF only design, is that when you reenter Kerbal, you don\u0027t have to deal with dead-weight oxidizer, all of the remaining fuel can be used to safely put you back at KSC.

To compare dV per fuel mass, you need 2.22 times the tank capacity! At that point, you are eating a huge dry mass penalty.\n\nA X200-8 has the equivalent fuel mass to 800 LF units. Ergo an orange tank is analogous to 16 Mk1 LF fuselage modules.\n\nSince the needed Mk1 tank buff. My go to nuke solution is a NEVA, 2 Mk1 tanks, and a cheap nosecone. This configuration is atheistically pleasing, easy to install, and has acceptable performance (800 fuel unit, a fairly minimal dry ratio, and good unit TWR). 800 units a nuke should be plenty for any single burn, so increased range can just come from backup tanks and fuel transfer.\n\nFor mass considerations, nukes beak even at about 1000 units of fuel a nuke. For fuel economy considerations, I don\u0027t know the nuke break even point. I only know that it has a lower break even point. Maybe I\u0027ll extrapolate the formulas and report back.\n\nFollow up:\n\nI derive fuel mass as a function of dV to be:\n\nm=f/(g(f/w)(1/(e^(dV/g\\*Isp)-1)\u002B1))\n\nm: fuel mass required for delta-v\n\nf: engine thrust\n\ng: force of gravity (9.81 m/s^2)\n\n(f/w): start TWR\n\ndV: delta-v\n\nIsp: engine Isp\n\nAssuming tank mass is 1/8 fuel mass. The payload mass is not present because of the use of desired TWR.\n\nSimply plug in appropriate values for engine thrust, Isp, and desired start TWR and it becomes clear that nukes are practically always the most fuel efficient liquid fuel engine. Their mass never outweighs their Isp in useful scenarios. Wish I would have followed my intuition there.\n\nEdit:\n\nThere seems to be an error in my equation. It is logarithmic not exponential. I will try to find the error. Any thoughts would be appreciated.\n\nFollow-up 2:\n\nAn earlier step is verified to have the expected exponential behavior. Apparently my error lies in substituting TWR equation solved for engine mass.\n\nm[f]=(m[p]\u002Bm[e])/(1/(e^(dV/g\\*Isp)-1)-m[t])\n\nm: mass of fuel (f), payload (p), engines (e), and tanks (t)\n\ng: force of gravity (9.81 m/s^2)\n\ndV: delta-v\n\nIsp: engine Isp\n\nAssume tank mass is 1/8 fuel mass. Just pick a payload and near equivalent thrust engine arrays and you see that nukes are still more fuel efficient for almost all positive dV choices.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T00:06:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 12:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"}]}
