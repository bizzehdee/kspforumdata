A lot of those are churnable until you find ones that are in the ranges you can do (IE: no 100-300 m/s parachute tests at 20k, thanks...) and just build them in as extra cash into actual missions.

Then just leave the pod in orbit and transmit crew report, complete mission, take mission, go back to pod, transmit crew report, complete mission... repeat until upgrades can be afforded. On hard difficulty at around $18000 and 15 science each report, I made enough money to unlock tracking station 2, launchpad 2, and MC 2.
