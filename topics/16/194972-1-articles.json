However, there are hundreds of them, so the odds that the same one will come back are low. Every time you visit a new CB\u00A0or gain a significant amount of rep, that opens up more World\u0027s Firsts as being \u0022valid\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-23T07:34:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can only have one World First contract at any given time. While you have accepted one, or even while one is offered to you that you have not accepted, you will not receive another. So if you wish to fish for a specific one, you\u0027ll have to finish your current one, and/or repeatedly reject/let expire those currently offered to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou must also still be eligible to receive the contract. If, for example, you went and put something into orbit of Eve, then you would no longer be eligible for the Eve Flyby contract. If a piece of interstellar debris accidentlly gets an Eve encounter without you noticing, you will also no longer be eligible for the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
