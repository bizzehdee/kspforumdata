I assume this is due to conduction from the more resilient airframe parts seeing direct heating. I also see a similar effect during reentry and NEVA burns.\n\nIs there a good method to keep the sensitive components cool? Failing that, is there a good way to insulate them from heating so I can fly closer to the airframe tolerance without losing instruments?"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T23:39:29Z","Content":"You either can fly at 25k\u002B or use a very pointy fairing at the tip of the plane which will make it really hard for your plane to heat up if you are going for a small design."},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T08:47:57Z","Content":"The way i\u0027ve tried to deal with it was by adding small cubic struts as heatsinks. Not sure how well you can see it in the screenshot [click for full size], but there\u0027s 6 cubic and an octo structural piece in the bay and their purpose is just to draw heat away from the probe core and radiate it away. Science equipment and cores especially are poo at radiating heat so eventually it seems a lot of heat end ups dumped into them. The heat is distributed evenly but other parts are better at radiating heat, so add more such small, fiddly parts at little cost. In the bay ofc, you don\u0027t need drag, even if you\u0027re not fuel-critical, increasing drag just to have more ...erm, radiation would possibly accumulate more heat due to air compression/friction.\n\n[![gnLFn52m.png](http://i.imgur.com/gnLFn52m.png)](http://i.imgur.com/gnLFn52.png)\n\nThis isn\u0027t a sciency plane, but i have no decent screens of that one. It has all sciency bits in the bay except Jrs and the gravioli detector. It gets hot enough eventually that i have to land just to cool off, or fly at night.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T08:51:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 08:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by georgTF**"}]}
