I worked for a very long time in 1.04 to get the mechs as stable as possible so that it was possible to aim BD armory weapons. But now, in 1.05, this mech \u00A0(and perhaps others) has a weird asymmetrical instability. You can see a comparison between 1.04 and 1.05 in the gfy below. Note\u00A0how, when the right foot is planted down, the reticle jumps vertically upwards.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe geometry of the mech is perfectly symmetrical, and it is running a perfectly symmetrical set of co-ordinates for the IR servos. I have already spent several passes trying to figure this out, which is why the mech is stripped down to the bare essentials. I simply have no idea why this would be happening. It could be a difference in infernal robotics, it could be something in KOS, it could be something about underlying KSP itself. For whatever reason, when the right foot lands the hips are jerked into a brief pitch up movement.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m fishing for ideas here, I have totally run out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autoSizeIframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgfycat.com%2FImaginativeSadErmine\u0026amp;key=ImaginativeSadErmine\u0022 style=\u0022height:550px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T17:05:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I have never made a walking machine and haven\u0027t messed with IR in a long time (and it\u0027s changed a lot since then). \u00A0However, I see your problem..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reticle jumps up on the right foot because the central box pitches upwards and back down quickly\u00A0at that point in the stride. \u00A0At that instant, the left foot is also still on the ground. \u00A0So you seem to have an extra step in the servo cycle that\u0027s causing it to do a little pelvic thrust. \u00A0The issue seems to be with the hip joints, as the knees and ankles don\u0027t look to be moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
