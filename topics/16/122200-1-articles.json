The only way I can think of is just getting into orbit around Minmus and then doing a big long expensive burn to change my inclination alot, but thats not very good, no?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can also think of trying to get lucky and capture Minmus while in a polar orbit of Kerbin, but you would need to be EXTREMELY precise and lucky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?

Just click on one to open it. Mousewheel over a direction indicator (pro/retro-grade, (anti)normal, radial-in/out). The easiest way to do it is to set-up your transfer manoeuvre as normal, just so you get an intercept with the target. Then double-click the target to shift focus to it (the node will close).
