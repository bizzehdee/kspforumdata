In order to adjust those wheels when you\u0027re attaching them, find the spot you want to put them then hold the shift key and hit the QWEASD buttons to make small adjustments to their orientation. You can tweak the direction that they attach until they are properly aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T07:47:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI discovered something that might help to alleviate swerving problems: have \u0027trolley\u0027 gear instead of \u0027tripod\u0027, like the early B-52s. This somehow seems to make things a bit more stable. All you have to do is attach them further up the side of the fuselage and press q and e to rotate.
