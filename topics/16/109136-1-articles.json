I really dont like to farm science but if my only solution is to do another mission to the mun or build a rover and farm science near the KSC Ill do it.\n\nHelp me save Jeb and his s\\*\\*\\* tons of scientific data.\n\nAlbum (3 Screens \u002B1 bonus:P) [https://imgur.com/a/0pZp2](https://imgur.com/a/0pZp2)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T02:06:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 02:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RafaMonteiro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T00:56:43Z","Content":"You\u0027re not stuck - every time you pass through the atmosphere, your apoapsis will drop a moderate amount and your periapsis will drop a little, and as your orbit drops you\u0027ll spend more of each orbit deeper in the atmosphere.\n\nIn addition, what you can do each time you leave the atmosphere is get out and push. Just work out which side of the rocket is pointing forwards, then send Jeb out on EVA to that side of the rocket, and slowly push on that side of the rocket until you\u0027re down to around 1 unit of jetpack fuel, then get back in to replenish your supply and go out and do it again."},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T00:56:50Z","Content":"If your periapsis is 42km you should have no problems just time-warping until just **before** you hit the atmosphere (70km).

I\u0027ve tested crafts with an apoapsis just inside kerbins soi to a periapsis of 35km and was able to deorbit in that half of an orbit, burning through the atmosphere at 3km/s for 2/3s of the planet was pretty exciting as well"},{"CreatedByName":"everything-is-nominal","CreatedById":141339,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T01:21:23Z","Content":"Well, you have to solutions actually, the first as stated above to time warp before going in the atmosphere and wait for the atmosphere to slow you down until you make a complete deorbit, this might take a few orbit to be made, but it\u0027s ok.\n\nThe second thing is the \u0022get out and push\u0022 method, simply point your vessel on retrograde, that way, the back of your spacecraft is pointing prograde, then get a kerbal on EVA and just make him push you spacecraft until the periaps is low enough to allow a reentry. \n\nBut in both case, you don\u0027t need any rescue mission, just ask jeb to use his \u0022secret technique\u0022.\n\nP.S : if you do the \u0022get out and push\u0022, do not forget to do it when your vessel as reached apoaps (more efficient) and do not use all the EVA monopropellant, otherwise you will get in trouble and you don\u0027t want this..."},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T01:26:04Z","Content":"Pushing an exhausted ship home using a Kerbal on EVA is a KSP tradition.

For what i recall, my math told me i had to do it 4 or 5 times before leaving Mun orbit and another few time to get a reentry...\n\nBut, i got for some reason distrated and found myself out of mono while on EVA... I then proceeded to go turn on the \u0022infinite fuel\u0022 on the the debug menu... turns out the game didn\u0027t want me to cheat on this one... \n\nSo i had to set up a rescue mission for a kerbal, in orbit around mun with a very high eccentric orbit. DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET THE VESSEL TO MATCH WITH THE KERBAL ??? More over, i didn\u0027t at that time unlock the RCS, so i had to improvise a way to gently approach the kerbal with the vessel and then get it to at least grab the vessel... took me at least half an hour to make it... i then proceeded to make a rendez vous with the first vessel because i didn\u0027t want to leave the science behind ! ^^"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T02:55:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks everyone for the answers.\n\u003E At first I tried to wait for my orbit to drop but after several orbits i couldnt see any changes so I thought it wasnt working.\n\u003E \n\u003E After you guys say I should wait.. well it worked!

At high time warp you can be fairly deep into atmosphere before the game drops you out warp by itself. 40km isn\u0027t too bad for a periapsis. When I return from Minmus my first braking pass is usually at around 38km and that will get my apoapsis down to about 5-6000km."}]}
