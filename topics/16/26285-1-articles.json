If from that point you are going to pass south of the target\u0027s orbit, turn 90 degress to the north and burn, and you will see the path of your orbit rise to match that of the target. If you are going to pass south, turn north and burn. However, if you are already within just a few meters, all you need to do is make sure you are in target mode, point your nose at the target-retrograde marker, and burn until your velocity reading is zero. This will kill ALL of your motion relative to the target, including any deviation due to planes, leaving you on essentially identical orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bainbridge","CreatedById":53347,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T19:53:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your reply Vanamonde, I\u0027ll give it a go now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS can you please explain the green orbit ring which appears once I\u0027m locked on target?

The descending node is where you will cross to south of the target orbit and the ascending node is where you will cross to the north of the other orbit. They are the places I was talking about: the most efficient time to match planes, because you ARE on the same plane at that moment. The green circle itself is just the target orbit highlighted to make it easier to see. And by the way, your peri- and apo- markers are still there when this display comes up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bainbridge","CreatedById":53347,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T20:36:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent thanks, 1km and closing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T21:50:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bainbridge\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bainbridge\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have got to within a few metres but due to the orbits not being exactly on the same plane I\u0027m unable to dock.\u003Cp\u003EPlease can someone help?
