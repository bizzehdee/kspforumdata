When you run an experiment there, you \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eobtain\u003C/span\u003E some of the points from this total amount. Crew and EVA reports always obtain the full total amount regardless of whether you transmit or return them, so can only be done once per location. All other experiments require multiple runs in the same location to get all the available points. Because you get less data with transmitting them, you need fewer runs if you return the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much less does transmitting get? Well, each experiment differs in the fraction of points you lose for transmitting compared to returning. But there are 2 real killers on top of this. In the absence of a Mobile Lab, you can only transmit the same experiment from the same location 1 time per mission. And even if you keep going back to the same place and transmitting the same experiment over and over, you will never get more than 40% of the total points available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMobile Labs change this by 1) allowing same experiment to be transmitted multiple times per mission from the same location, and 2) adding 15% to the value of each transmission. That is, if you\u0027d only get 20% of the returned value without the ML, you\u0027d get 35% of the returned value with it. And this buff does allow you to exceed the base 40% cap to the extent the buff will put you over it, but thereafter you can\u0027t transmit that experiment anymore even with the ML.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reusable instruments and surface samples typically need 2 returned runs to obtain all the available points for them in a given location, but the 1st run will get like 80-90% of the total available so you can get by with only doing them once. Goos and Materials need 4 returned runs to get all the points, although the 4th time is only like the last 5% or so and might not be worth the trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this, I build landers with 1 capsule (for crew reports, EVA reports, and surface sample), 1 each of all reusable instruments, and 4 each Goos and Materials. If I return this ship, I get all the available points for the crew and EVA reports, all available points for Goo and Materials, and 80-90% of the available points for the surface sample and reusable instruments. Thus, there\u0027s no need to ever go to that location again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where having a Mobile Lab comes in handy. If you have a lander as described above, a Mobile Lab, and a sufficient pile of fuel, you can clean out an entire planet\u0027s pool of points in all its locations in 1 trip. Lander goes to Location A and comes back. Data goes in Mobile Lab, Mobile Lab rearms the Goos and Materials, lander refuels, and goes to Location B.

It does \u0022empty\u0022 the data from that experiment. What Kasuha is saying is that if you run the experiment and transmit, you have to run it again before recovery or it will be blank. In that case, you would still get the transmit science, but nothing during recovery. . . Whenever you transmit OR collect samples (via EVA), the experiment module itself becomes blank. (Kasuha was also responding specifically about goo and sci jr, which must be cleaned to be used again.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you transmit, you are rewarded the science immediately.

I have not yet found a way in KSP to perform an experiment that ever prevents you from doing that same experiment again. Sure, you might need another module (for goo and jr), but you can perform an unlimited number of goo missions (or any experiment) and transmit/recover however you wish. You do not have to go back to the first goo module and \u0022collect\u0022 it, and if you do it will be \u0022empty\u0022 of science anyway. But you can send a second goo, perform, and recover to get the rest of the science. Transmitting can only get a certain amount of the science available. It does NOT mean the rest of the science points are forever lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are concerned about \u0022losing\u0022 science, perhaps just try it in game. Make a copy of your save game first if you want.
