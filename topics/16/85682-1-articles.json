Got home, plugged it in and started binding keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrial and error, no luck. For example; the joystick has a small lever for thrust control, but whether I turned it up or down, thrust goes up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I wasn\u0027t even able to play. Every time I rolled a plane to runaway, all the control surfaces (small wings etc.) disappeared. If I hit the \u0022next stage\u0022 button, everything went dark, couple times it even froze. In other words the game crashed. Problem was solved when I removed all joystick bindings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Question: Could someone with more experience post a quick tutorial how to use joystick with the game.
