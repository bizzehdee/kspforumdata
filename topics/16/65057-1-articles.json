As others have said, TWR is most important from takeoff from surface. Once you\u0027re in orbit, don\u0027t divide by the surface gravity. What you\u0027re left with is your maximum acceleration capability if you perform the calculation of Thrust / Mass. For example, for a transfer stage with a mass of 10 using one LV-N engine, you\u0027re getting 60 thrust / 10 tons = 6 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E of acceleration (every second your velocity goes up by 6 m/s when you\u0027re at full throttle). This can give you a good idea of how long it will take you to do a burn. For example, escaping Low Kerbin Orbit takes 950 delta-V, so it\u0027s going to take a little less than 950/6 = 158 seconds = about two and a half minutes to do the burn. Of course, as you burn fuel, your rocket gets lighter and your Thrust/Mass gets higher, making the burn shorter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer the tangent about gravity, centrifugal force, and orbiting, the confusing thing about gravity is that it\u0027s not a real force. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: wall of text incoming\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEinstein has shown that gravity is space-time curvature. This means gravity is not a force, but a virtual force. This is not a trivial thing to explain as it is counter-intuitive to most people, but let me try here real quick. Let\u0027s start with an intuitive example about force. If a playground bully were to push you from behind, it\u0027s clear which direction the force is coming from and which way you accelerate (forward). The force comes from behind you and pushes you forward, and you end up falling forward. Okay, next example: If you get in your car and accelerate hard, you feel force pushing on your back. To be clear, there is no force pushing you backwards into your seat, rather there is a forces pushing you \u003Cem\u003Eforward\u003C/em\u003E from your back. The car seat pushes you forward just like the bully was pushing you forward. If you left a pair of sunglasses on the dashboard while you floored the gas pedal, you\u0027d see your sunglasses fly towards the back of the car, but did anything push the sunglasses back? Nope. The car moved forward while the glasses stayed still. Once hitting the car seat, it too gets pushed forward and appears to come to a rest (relative to you) but it is now feeling the same forward acceleration you are. \u003Cem\u003ESTOP! If you don\u0027t quite get the above, then you won\u0027t get the next paragraph!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to tackle gravity. You get out of your car, find a nice grassy meadow to lie down in, and lie on your back. Hm, you feel the exact same force on your back that you felt when you were accelerating in your car. Gravity is not actually pushing you DOWN into the ground (if it were, you would feel pressure on your front, like if the playground bully pushed you downward into the ground). What\u0027s actually happening is \u003Cem\u003Espace itself\u003C/em\u003E is flowing towards the center of the Earth. You don\u0027t actually feel space flowing (it\u0027s like floating in a river) but the ground is pushing you UP through that flowing space. Just like the car was pushing you forward, the ground is pushing you \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E, and \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E is the actual force you feel. If you throw your sunglasses into the air, it would appear that gravity is pulling it back down to the ground, but just as in the car example where it slid off the dash, it\u0027s not actually experiencing any forces! When it hits the ground, however, it starts accelerating upwards along with you and appears to come to a rest (relative to you) but it is now feeling the same upwards acceleration you are. Being on the ground on Earth is like being in a car that is perpetually accelerating UP!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact... in a microgravity environment, for example when you\u0027re in orbit, being in a rocket that is accelerating at 9.8 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E gives you the same behavior as standing on the ground on Earth. If the rocket were wide enough, you could play tennis-- the players on the court, the ball, the net, everything would behave the same as on Earth as long as the rocket continues accelerating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOookay, next lesson. Centrifugal force. It is not a real force. Centri\u003Cstrong\u003Epetal\u003C/strong\u003E force, however, is a real force. Back to the car example: You are going 60mph and you make a right turn around a bend in the highway. The sunglasses on the dash \u0022get flung to the left\u0022 side of the car, and your body gets pressed against the left door. In which direction is the force accelerating everything? Hint: It\u0027s actually NOT to the left. It\u0027s to the right! The car moved to the right while the stuff inside of it wanted to go straight ahead. The left side of the car catches up to the inside contents and exerts a force to the RIGHT to keep everything inside the vehicle. Centripetal force is that force of the driver side door (assuming not in the UK) pushing everything to the right. It is a true force and always points \u003Cem\u003Etowards the center\u003C/em\u003E point of the rotation. Even though it looks like stuff is getting thrown to the left, there is no actual force pushing it to the left -- instead the car is going to the right and the stuff is initially going straight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u0027s talk about orbit. When you\u0027re in orbit, you do not feel any acceleration (a fancy way of saying you are \u0022weightless\u0022). What\u0027s truly happening is you are traveling through space-time curvature. You are traveling in a \u0022straight line\u0022 as far as forces are concerned, but that line just happens to be warped around the planet because of the space curvature. There is no centripetal force, either, because you aren\u0027t technically turning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T07:58:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOops, I forgot to talk about virtual forces and tie it back to TWR. Hehehe. Here we go!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember back in the meadow when you threw your sunglasses into the air, and I said, \u0022gravity isn\u0027t pulling the sunglasses down\u0022? Well, it isn\u0027t - there is no force pulling the sunglasses down (other than air drag which we will ignore right now). But it sure LOOKS like the sunglasses are being pulled down, at least relative to where you are. Enter \u0022virtual forces\u0022. These are things that make it look like stuff is being moved around you even though it is you moving around it. Virtual forces \u0022act\u0022 in the opposite direction of the actual force that something ELSE is experiencing in relation to it. In other words, you are accelerating up towards the sunglasses, and you are the one experiencing force. The sunglasses are not experiencing forces, but it looks like gravity is \u0022pulling it\u0022 towards you, so we call that \u0022downwards force\u0022 a virtual force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in the car around a right-hand highway bend example, when the sunglasses appear to be flung to the left, that is the virtual force (centrifugal force) \u0022acting\u0022 on the sunglasses to the left. But again, what\u0027s really happening is the car is accelerating to the right towards the sunglasses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to tie this to thrust to weight ratio. When your rocket has not yet ignited its engines and it\u0027s sitting on the launchpad, it is in fact being accelerated upwards at 9.8 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E (remember because gravity = space flowing downwards but the ground pushes you up). If you want to get further away from the ground, you\u0027re going to have to accelerate at more than 9.8 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. So let\u0027s say you go exactly 1.5 times that, or 14.7 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. You are now actually experiencing 14.7 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E of acceleration (or 1.5g). How fast are you accelerating relative to the ground? Well, the ground is accelerating upwards too, but at only 9.8 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. Relative to the ground, you are accelerating at 14.7 - 9.8 = 4.9 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. This is \u0022gravity drag\u0022 but the name is so misleading. It much more analogous to two drag cars racing each other. They are both accelerating, but one car is accelerating faster and starts to pull ahead. The rate at which the faster car pulls ahead is the difference between their acceleration rates, and if you want to express that in terms of percentage better acceleration, you get \u0022TWR\u0022!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T08:10:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether gravity is or isn\u0027t a real force is actually irrelevant.

But still, there is an action (gravity pulling on you) and equal and opposite reaction (ground pushing against your feet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn inertial frames of reference, inertia is not considered a force because it does not cause any changes in position or motion of objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn non-inertial frames of reference (such as inside of a car turning to the left), though, inertia is not so inert and it makes objects move. From the point of view of such frame of reference, inertia acts as a force and gets various names according to what it is causing. Such as centrifugal force. Yes, it is not a real force for someone who only considers inertial reference frames valid. But for many purposes, non-inertial reference frames are not only valid, they may be even beneficial. And treating inertia as a force in such reference frames is essential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an excellent description of gravity in Newtonian terms and I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s incorrect. In Newtonian physics, objects can\u0027t accelerate towards one another without a force acting on them. In this case, you are describing gravity as accelerating all parts of the object at once such that a mass spring wouldn\u0027t measure any force being exerted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in the theory of gravitation in general relativity, as described by Einstein, the force you describe becomes fictitious.

I was just trying to answer Geschosskopf\u0027s question about centrifugal force and the force of gravity, and how it works when in orbit. If you want to truly understand it, you have to realize they are not real forces counteracting each other - they are virtual. Nothing is actually pushing or pulling the craft towards or away from the barycenter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the purposes of KSP, I\u0027m perfectly happy with someone saying that they accelerate towards periapsis and decelerate towards apoapsis with respect to the central body due to the force of gravity. I had simply detected that the conversation had switched from \u0022how does this game work\u0022 to \u0022what\u0027s the theory behind this concept of centrifugal force?\u0022.
