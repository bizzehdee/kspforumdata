Burning the wrong way is not smart, espesialy then close to other crafts or in low orbit.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWorst on small high twr probes who is most practical to launch with other ships.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnybody have any tips here, outside of launching stack upside down or seperate and dock in orbit\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T22:55:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t quite visualize the problem that you are talking about.
