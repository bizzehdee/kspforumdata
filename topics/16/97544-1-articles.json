Class A rocks are really light as a rule - no more than about 2.5 tonnes, tops - so the little five-part probe design he suggests is very sound. I might recommend using an LV-N if you\u0027ve got access to that level of technology (one of the rare cases where you\u0027ll wind up with more thrust AND more delta-V), but the 909 does a fair enough job on its own. You might have to use OX-STATs and batts in place of the PB-NUK; that\u0027s fine.
