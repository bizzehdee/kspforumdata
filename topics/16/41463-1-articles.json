If the game has saved to the persistance file after you quickloaded, then no there\u0027s nothing to do. If it hasn\u0027t saved, that is as soon as you realize your mistake, force close your game (alt\u002BF4 or task manager) and you might be able to get back to your persistance file without the quickload saving over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish people would just learn to make backups and not quicksave/load willynilly. That, and use the revert flight option, that\u0027s what it\u0027s there for.

People assume they\u0027ll be able to recover that autosave. IMO, the game should never inform you that it\u0027s autosaving, because it\u0027s only used if your game crashes or you exit abnormally. (And on another topic, one of the top ten rules of game UI design is that game exit should be always be an Escape key \u002B single mouse-click away. In KSP you have to Escape, go to Space Center, click the exit to main menu button, click the exit game button, then answer yes to an \u0022Are you sure?\u0022 prompt.

Are you sure?\u0022 You could disable the quickload warning in the options. ALSO, I\u0027d suggest that maybe quicksaves not persist between game sessions.

The way it works now wouldn\u0027t be so bad except that the Space Center scene takes several seconds to load, as does the main menu, so the whole process advertises its clunkiness. I actually usually play windowed, so the close window X is my most direct exit route, but it makes me cringe to exit the game that way: is my game state saved? does the game release memory and other resources gracefully? is it possible to corrupt save/craft/setting files?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd another suggestion (NB: I love KSP -- perhaps the greatest game ever; criticism is meant to be constructive). Escape menus are usually system related: exit, settings, save management, etc. They \u0022escape\u0022 from the game play. The Space Center button is out of place there.
