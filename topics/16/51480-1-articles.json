By burning prograde you are adding the most energy to the orbit but you are raising both apoapsis and periapsis. But such maneuver is very hard to execute in a way which leads to circular orbit - in most cases you end up either on suborbital trajectory or start raising apoapsis above all limits. In such cases you need to apply corrections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to raise just periapsis and you are not at apoapsis yet, you need to burn slightly below the prograde marker. If you are behind apoapsis, you do it by burning slightly above the prograde marker. To raise apoapsis, burn above prograde when ascending. You don\u0027t need to raise apoapsis when descending.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have already raised your apoapsis to sufficient height, place a maneuver at the AP marker and pull the prograde handle till you get a circular orbit. Then you can start burning half the time estimated to burn before you reach the maneuver node and by burning at the maneuver marker you will be raising just the periapsis. If you manage to execute the whole burn you should get an orbit sufficiently similar to what you planned by the maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and regarding the question why it takes so long - in map view, move the cursor to look at Kerbin from above and zoom out. You\u0027ll be able to see the whole ellipse of your trajectory.

Then you burn along the horizon and instead of simply raising your periapsis (which is what a horizon burn should do when you are at apoapsis) You are saying it becomes a highly elliptical orbit with periapsis still below atmosphere...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a high T/W ratio couldn\u0027t cause this unless you weren\u0027t burning horizontally. But having a low T/W ratio might if you ended up far beyond apoapsis while still trying to burn along the horizon to reach orbital velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest two possible solutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. After 30,000 meters in elevation begin burning horizontally while you maintain a heading due east. (If you have a very low T/W ratio this will help you build orbital speed so that your burn at apoapsis will require less time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. About 30s before apoapsis turn horizontally and keep apoapsis 30 seconds ahead of you by adjusting the throttle. If it is get to be more than 60s away then throttle back so you can catch up to it. If it gets closer than 30 seconds throttle up to keep it in front of you. If you accidentally get past apoapsis then pitch upward to 45 degrees and set engines to maximum until it gets back in front of you. (This works for almost any craft, but if you have too low of a T/W ratio you won\u0027t be able to keep apoapsis in front of you and will fall back to kerbin. But at least it would identify a problem... low T/W ratio. If that is the problem then you can either add more thrust or do more of number 1 to try to add orbital velocity sooner).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, make sure you have been keeping your nose along the horizon.

Best to use a Maneuver (at the Apoapsis) to plan the burn, then see how long the burn will take. If you find, after starting up the rocket, that the burn will take more than about 2 minutes, your rocket engine is too weak (or you have too much extra mass).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever you are at a node (periapsis or apoapsis) any thrust you apply only effects the opposite node. In other words, if you thrust at the periapsis, it will never raise your periapsis - only the apoapsis will be changed. And vice-versa: thrusting at the apoapsis only changes your periapsis. The further you are from either node, the smaller (and weirder) the change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a point, even at the apoapsis, that it will \u0022flip\u0022 and become the periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck out this video to see if it gives you any hints:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hu-CHBYpbMA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s another good one, although the topic covers many different things.

Burn straight up to 10k; this part you have down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Turn to course 090 at 45 degrees elevation; again, this is something you\u0027re already doing, which is good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Assuming you\u0027re playing stock, you\u0027ll occasionally need to switch over to map mode while your launch is ongoing. That\u0027s fine; spend as little time there as necessary and switch back to staging mode when ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) You want to stay at 45 degrees elevation until your time to apoapsis gets to be about 35 seconds or so. Once that\u0027s reached, turn to follow the prograde marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Continue to follow the prograde marker unless your time to apoapsis falls below 30 seconds. If it does, return to 45 degrees elevation for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Once your time to apoapsis reaches one minute, steer along the horizon - zero elevation on course 090. You\u0027re still coasting upwards so your apoapsis is fine; what you\u0027re doing now is applying more thrust to start raising your periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Continue to watch your altitude and your projected apoapsis altitude. If you reach your desired apoapsis altitude and you\u0027re still below 50k in the atmosphere, continue burning for a little bit, about another 10-15k or so. Then kill your burn. You\u0027ll lose some altitude due to atmospheric drag; this compensates for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Once you\u0027re above 70k, set up a maneuver node at apoapsis.
