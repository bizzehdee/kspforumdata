The problem is the chutes on it don\u0027t seem to want to redeploy, when I right-click on them I just get the min-pressure and deployment sliders but no \u0022deploy chute\u0022 option. There are no action groups for the chutes but I intended to manually deploy them all before hitting atmo. I have checked, and this problem is unique to this one rover, the lander which came with it can manually deploy its chutes after repacking. I checked the persistence file, and the only difference between the chutes on the different craft was that the rover had \u0022Staged = True\u0022 and the lander had \u0022Staged = False\u0022. I tried going through the file, manually changing all the chutes from Staged = True to False and then saving, but when I checked in the game nothing had changed and the persistence had reverted my changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anybody help me out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the persistence file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/gsmsmnaidgo93ji/persistent.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/gsmsmnaidgo93ji/persistent.sfs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(It\u0027s the craft called \u0022Ice Dentist\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-11T19:31:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2014 07:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SofusRud\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T16:50:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConfirm that you repacked the chutes on the rover too?
