With that exact network you have, if each sat had a Comm 32 on it, THAT would cover ALL of Kerbin SOI halfway out to Mun (about 6.2Mm). With dishes, craft need to be within the cones to connect. In other words, a craft must maneauver into the cone, or you have to orient the craft the dish is on specifically, to point at your active vessel. You can see in your image, the overlap of the cones (meaning constant comms to any craft) is limited to LKO.

Essentially by doing that it allows me to have a sattelite that\u0027s always connected to one of the geosync\u0027d sats but also allows almost constant connection with anything anywhere in the rest of the solar system. So with what I\u0027m doing in the Duna system, the only time I lose connection is either when Kerbin or Duna blocks the connection (which typically isn\u0027t an issue as I have a sat constellation going on Duna as well as a backup sat in Kerbin orbit that\u0027s nearly always on the opposite side of my main polar sat) or when the sun does, which I haven\u0027t actually run into yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I\u0027ve noticed is that the only reliable way to keep a connection is to keep direct connections going, with dishes on both my target and my Kerbin sats pointed at each other.
