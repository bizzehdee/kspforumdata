In the axis mapping under settings in KSP it used to show an axis (2.0 for Y axis and 2.1 for X axis on G940 joystick), and I was able to click accept but in game nothing happened. Now it wont even show an axis when I attempt to map, and I didnt change anything. So I downloaded PPjoy and created a virtual joystick, and verified in windows 10 under the \u0022Set up USB Game Controllers\u0022 window that PPJoy was in fact reporting the axes correctly. Still nothing in Kerbal. I am currently running the 1.1 beta, and I\u0027m at a loss... Any help here would be appreciated from anyone who got a HOTAS/Joystick working with Kerbal. And FYI I\u0027ve been googling and searching the forums for 3 days and tried a multitude of solutions (deleting settings.cfg etc) with no luck. Just looking for someone who had issues with the axis not showing up under mapping to explain how they set their joystick up. Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Worldsprayer","CreatedById":163641,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T18:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the same problem. \u00A0I am running a G940 and saitek pedals, and KSP senses and names the pedals just fine in the settings file, and the settings menu SEES the inputs, if you move the axis while assigning it changes and assigns the axis but it doesn\u0027t save it somehow. \u00A0It SEES the joystick, just doesn\u0027t use it. \u00A0The fact that it\u0027s not pulling in the joystick name is interesting and might be a cause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
