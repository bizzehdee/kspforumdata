This is the first time I\u0027ve done a mission of this kind, so I went all out and took off.\n\nHowever, once I reached the asteroid I came to realize that something was missing. All mission requirements were met, except for one. \u0022Build the facility into a newly discovered class E asteroid\u0022.\n\nI managed (and this part I\u0027m quite proud of) to build an unmanned claw capable of docking with the station, and then claw the station onto the asteroid.\n\nAnd voil\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1! I now satisfied the last requirement! But wait... !\n\nFor some unknown reason, one of the requirements that were satisfied before, have now been undone.. Have a look..\n\n![ksp_plz2.png](http://s12.postimg.org/j0tnqkz4t/ksp_plz2.png)\n\nI\u0027ve tried disconnecting the second part of the claw (white tank \u002B engine facing camera), thus leaving one open docking port. But no luck..\n\nAny hints or similar experiences?\n\nRegards,\n\nJonathan"},{"CreatedByName":"DoToH","CreatedById":68428,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T17:46:56Z","Content":"I think this is related to the way the game handles docking.

Perhaps that has a saying. \n\nIf you undock, does the building criteria then go green, or are you still in the grey?\n\nIf so, you could undock everything, then dock to the claw while controlling the station, then dock everything to the asteroid. \n\nOr dock to the station while controlling the claw, then dock to the asteroid. \n\nGood luck"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T09:09:20Z","Content":"no need to classify anything as a station for the requirements.
