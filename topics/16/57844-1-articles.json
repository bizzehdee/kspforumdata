Is the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro good? What about buying an Xbox controller and setting that up instead?

Joysticks are at the top of their form when used as flight sim controllers. X-Plane is a well known flight sim which runs on multiple platforms, including Mac OSX. In fact, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.x-plane.com/desktop/mac/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eits even developed primarily on Macs.\u003C/a\u003E This might indicate that the developers are confident that joysticks are available which are compatible with Macs; otherwise their game sales would probably be a little lackluster, at least on the Mac platform, which they support. Here\u0027s a video which does two things. First, it makes it clear that modern USB joysticks are Mac compatible. Then it goes into more specifics with X-Plane and other sims. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5YIEcAZNL4Y?start=32\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might expect that since these joysticks work for X-Plane and other sims, that they should work for KSP. Other forum members have made it clear that they use joysticks, so that\u0027s not an issue. From all the above, you should expect that whatever modern USB joystick you choose will work with your Mac while playing KSP. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfmoon","CreatedById":98955,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T13:07:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi There,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use a Saitek X52 Pro on my iMac for KSP and I\u0027m very happy with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally got it to play IL2 and X3 because it has a lot of functionality\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also has 3 modes so that you can assign different functions to a button depending on the selected mode \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(not to mention you can also create shift buttons ... multiplying the number of functions you can assign to buttons by at least 6)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownside is that the joystick is officially only supported on a Win platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, by using a program such as Controllermate, you can get all the buttons and shift functions working (takes some programming time of course ...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly thing not working under OS X is the MFD, but that\u0027s hardly noticeable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T14:38:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just got a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro for Christmas! It works great, and I think it will be compatible because it seems like it was just plug-in-and-play.
