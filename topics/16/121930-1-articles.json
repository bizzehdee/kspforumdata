Until now I\u0027ve been using a small agile plane that I\u0027ve fitted with parachutes to collect science data; I\u0027d just fly to the spot, slow down and pull the chutes. This has worked well for nearby biomes, but the badlands are roughly 800\u002Bkm away from KSC. So I was hoping some of you smart folk could help me get the science out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see my options are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a plane - My current plane can travel about 300m/s. 0.3*60 = 18Km/min. 800/18 = 44min travel time \u002B deviation and cruising altitude would increase this. This would be slow and boring, even with time acceleration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a rocket - get into orbit, then deorbit over the badlands. This looks super hard and my manual flight skills suck. At this stage I don\u0027t have maneuver nodes, so it would be a lot of guess work. Also, drag from the atmosphere on re-entry would likely send me off course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a rocket and (somehow) use my remote tech flight computer to chart a suborbital trajectory to land at or near my destination. I like this idea but I\u0027m stuck. There must be a way to calculate the Delta V required, pitch and heading. Is there a way to figure this out? Can it be done? Is there any good mods for calculating this kind of flight path? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T08:30:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I would build a faster plane.
