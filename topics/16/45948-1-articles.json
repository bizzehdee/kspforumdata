So the idea half works, except the .craft files have two different rotation values; rot and attRot and to top it off both of these values have four values. These values do not correspond to the usual angle measurements used when you weld parts by normal means. The cool thing is that all of the components are in the correct relative positions and if a work-around can be found for the angle conversion it will take about one quarter of the time for me to make new welded parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any idea how to translate these values into normal degree rotations?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second question is this, I have a large plate made up of many smaller plates and would like to be able to \u0022snap\u0022 parts to the center of each plate. Is it possible to keep individual nodes on the plates as though it were a normal assembly of parts? Do I lose that option through hubris in my attempts to play \u0022part God\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBob","CreatedById":82205,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T17:32:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, so the original questions still stand. Just figured I\u0027d brush of some basic trigonometry that I haven\u0027t used in a decade. The part looks great so far. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vsRuh7E.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/vsRuh7E.jpg\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I\u0027d like to do is add some nodes to either side of the bay so you could link them horizontal as well as vertical. I\u0027m fairly sure I understand the node system as far as x,y,z and on/off (1/0) by looking at things like the multihub connector. I cannot seem to get a node placed though. Code is as follows, anyone got a second to take a look at this and see if I\u0027m making a crazy error?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://tny.cz/671cdafb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://tny.cz/671cdafb\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
