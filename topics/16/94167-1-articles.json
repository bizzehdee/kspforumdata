The \u0022Mirror\u0022 symmetry mode was the one I wanted, but when I went to put wheels on the back and middle of the plane, the symmetry mode would change to \u0022Radid\u0022 (Or at least that is what I think it said...) which was not working for me. So I am wondering if their is a way to manually change this symmetry mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(If anyone would like a picture, I could put one up here)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-22T23:14:30Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2014 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ZtheCdr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T22:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe button is \u0022R\u0022, also the symmetry modes are \u0022Mirror\u0022 (old SPH style) and \u0022Radial\u0022 (old VAB style)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lirg03","CreatedById":133053,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T23:13:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefault button is R to switch between mirror and radial symmetry mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, to my experience so far, that some part placement may force you into using one symmetry mode but not the other. For example, if you attach a wing piece to the fuselage (using mirror symmetry), then another wing piece at the end of the previous wing (still using mirror symmetry), then it seems anything you want to attach on the top or bottom of the second wing piece won\u0027t work with mirror symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZtheCdr","CreatedById":128427,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T23:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022armagheddonsgw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022armagheddonsgw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe button is \u0022R\u0022, also the symmetry modes are \u0022Mirror\u0022 (old SPH style) and \u0022Radial\u0022 (old VAB style)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhhhhh yes. That makes perfect sense. Being that you attach stuff radially while in the VAB because you are building vertically. makes sense. Anyways, thanks. Your input will help me a lot!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
