I have successfully docked multiple rovers before, with no problem, it only seems to have occurred today. I\u0027ll try a new save file next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother interesting feature - docking, undocking, then crashing the two rovers into each other seems to cancel all gravity for them (picture added to gallery).
