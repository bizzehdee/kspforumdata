But since that file is lost. I\u0027ll have to focus on my Bumper style sounding rocket instead. The problem I\u0027m having is that the wings keep getting destroyed by aerodynamic stresses and I feel like trying to give them more mass-strenght multiplier wont do much. The picture below has the bumper inspired craft that I wanted to use. If the problem is the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, then Idk how to lower it at the moment. I am using the RD-100 engine for this craft\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/892622709115211796/1105314214102450216/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-09T13:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsince you problems specifically pertain a mod, you may have more chances finding help in the specific mod thread, rather than in general questions.

Use small solid rockets and/or small control surfaces to spin up\u00A0at launch and leave the fins completely vertical so the spin doesn\u2019t get too extreme at higher speeds.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDon\u2019t spin at all, you probably don\u2019t need it on a rocket that size and you\u2019d be better off with a guided rocket instead.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMake\u00A0the fins bigger. Those small fins won\u2019t produce enough force to correct the drift from prograde before they fail from aero forces, larger fins might do the job. Look at the real Bumper/V-2 for guidance.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u2019s what I did in my most recent RP-1 game:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022W8AvbPl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://I.imgur.com/W8AvbPl.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe camera is inside that stripy bit in the middle with the avionics above it; the top tank is jettisoned after engine shutdown and both camera and avionics are recovered together, though it would work just as well with the camera and avionics at the top, I only put them in the middle to save on tooling a nosecone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u2019t actually need the fins as it\u2019s fully guided and the A-4 (and RD-100 and possibly the American V-2 as well) provide enough control for this sort of design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
