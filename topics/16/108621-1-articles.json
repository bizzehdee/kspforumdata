As every engine in the game requires some sort of non-light fuel, one must stop to refuel their craft eventually.\n\nHowever, in practice this may be possible. If a craft carried drills and mining equipment which was all solar-powered, it could potentially travel forever, as long as it made use of planets, moons, and asteroids along its way to refuel."},{"CreatedByName":"vicwarrior","CreatedById":120410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T18:43:50Z","Content":"The closer you are going to get is using ion thrusters, but they still consume small amounts of xenon, which means you can\u0027t have infinite deltaV , but they are still pretty damn efficient nonentheless."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T18:48:09Z","Content":"Solar sails are an even worse propulsion system then ion engines right now.

You\u0027ll be having to use very meticulous maneuvers to use gravity assists in order to get places where you cant go because you cant thrust toward the sun with a solar sail."},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:10:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Solar sails are an even worse propulsion system then ion engines right now.

For example, Dawn thrusters produce about 90 mN each (they are fired one at a time). Dawn carries 10kW of solar panels."},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:12:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s got to be a solar sail mod somewhere\n\nInterstellar has a solar sail."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:20:22Z","Content":"Ah i can understand why my post was confusing. I was talking about the ingame ion engine which is overpowered yet still talking about real life solar sails at the same time. Well they both are bad for manned ships in real life unless someone perfects cryosleep. It is always possible to give the game an op solar sail that doesn\u0027t really take as much space and mass as it would in real life and create more thrust."}]}
