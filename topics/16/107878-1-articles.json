However I\u0027m not able to figure this one out by myself.\n\nWould someone be able to tell me the number?\n\nOh, and is there a way for me to figure this out by myself, without flying there first?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nMarkus\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T19:03:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 07:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MarkusF**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T16:17:24Z","Content":"The [Vis-Viva equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation) is what you\u0027re looking for. \n\nIt gives orbital speed in 350km circular orbit as 2790m/s. If we aim for a 50km periapsis (not sure if this is good for Eve in the new aero), the speed at apoapsis is 2546m/s. So the delta-V required is about 244m/s."},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusF","CreatedById":142152,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:03:04Z","Content":"Thanks a lot, that really helps me :-)\n\nTook me a minute to figure out what the semi-major axis is, but now I got it."},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:05:45Z","Content":"What the heck are you guys talkin about?
