I am certainly no expert on interplanetary maneuvers, but I can hold my own using the launch window planer, precision nodes etc. and get to my target without burning more than a few extra tanker loads of fuel. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I am struggeling on how to get from... say Kerbin orbit to a Gilly orbit.
