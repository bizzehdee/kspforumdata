I\u0027ve been trying to decide whether to use them or not. The SSTO in question is for crew rotations at the Laythe colony. Laythe doesn\u0027t have a runway so the plane needs good short-field performance.

NOTE: the spaceplane needs some radial tankage anyway because it\u0027s twin-RAPIER and I need the rear of the fuselage for the transfer tug\u0027s docking port.

Anyway, the plane is incapable of going supersonic in level flight, so I climb to 16km, dive at -15^ to about 12km, level at 10km, then away I go. Seems horribly inefficient.

I will only add radial tanks when more engine is needed, and I would not use precious rear cross-section area for non-engine parts like docking ports if at all avoidable. I haven\u0027t seen your design, is it feasible to mount the docking port for the tug in the nose?\n\nKeeping it short is less of a benefit than it might seem. If you are concerned about tailstrikes when landing you can just add another pair of gear near the rear that are only used when landing, retract them manually before takeoff for pivoting.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have finally managed to build a shuttle-winged Laythe SSTO that works.

Any thoughts for improvement?\n\nRAPIERs can be tricky that way, sometimes you need to do odd things to get them into the sweet spot of their thrust curves. Nothing wrong with descending a bit to build up speed to get them going; I\u0027ve tried some designs that require it for the initial climb (otherwise the thrust falloff with increasing altitude would kill the ascent). Still, I think you\u0027d be better served with less wing/drag. You might find that not only does it accelerate better, but it also consumes less fuel during the initial ascent due to the lower drag.\n\nDisclaimer: Take all the above with a grain of salt, I am far from a plane expert compared to some others around here.
