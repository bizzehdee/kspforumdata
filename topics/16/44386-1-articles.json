I have a payload consisting of 3 modules: a lander and 2 Hitchhiker cans. All 3 modules have Sr. docking ports on both ends. I originally built them with the lander on top and the 2 cans below, then the whole ascent stage below that. This flies but wobbles a lot so to make it safer, I wanted to change the order so the cans were on top, then the lander, then the ascent stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I grabbed the separator for the ascent stage and set that aside. No problem. Then I pulled off the bottom can module and went to put it on top of the lander. Big problem. The can module now only has 1 attachment node, on its top end, so refuses to connect with the top of the lander, even though the can\u0027s bottom was just attached to the ascent stage a minute ago. I suppose I could flip the can module end for end but I\u0027d rather not because it\u0027s got a probe core in it that I don\u0027t want to confuse as to which way is up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you solve that problem?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T17:54:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can trick the editor into providing an attach node wherever you want using the method shown:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Put an OKTO2 below the bottom can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make the OKTO2 the new root.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Remove the can module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Put the rest back onto the OKTO2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make any part the new root, then remove the OKTO2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Put the removed can module on top.
