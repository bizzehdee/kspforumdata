I was playing 0.19 for a while, and found (and tweaked) a VAB craft I liked a lot. Unfortunately, I had mechjeb on it, and it won\u0027t open properly now that I\u0027ve upgraded to 0.22. I\u0027ve got mechjeb installed on 0.22, but it indicates that a part is missing. I can\u0027t find a copy of 0.19 to download anywhere. Any suggestions on how to transfer this craft over?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T00:12:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could try removing Mechjeb from the craft file, but that could have some really bad results...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
