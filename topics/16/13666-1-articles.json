Downloaded, got it started, and for the love of God I can\\\u0027t see any in-game tutorials. I can turn \u0027Show VAB Tutorial\u0027 and \u0027Show Flight Tutorial\u0027 on/off but nothing seems to happen. I could try to figure this game on my own, but anything more complex than |Command Module-Fuel-Engine| is quickly starting to go nose down and crashing. I have no idea how to make the rocket go more or less straight up, because steering with WSAD only makes things worse. Am I retarded or missing something obvious here? Can\\\u0027t find people or topics on this forum with similar problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-04T23:36:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe tutorials should have been shown when you first started the game.
