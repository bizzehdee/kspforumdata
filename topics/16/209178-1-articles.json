The issue is I don\u0027t have a tier 3 tracking station to actually track and identify unknown objects so I am not entirely sure if this contract is possible. Also, for other contracts such as the ones that ask you to find asteroids threatening Kerbin, do I need to identify those as well? If anyone knows, I would appreciate if you could clear this up for me.
