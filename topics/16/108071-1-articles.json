Try going to the Mun ingame. Once you have your intercept, if you do nothing at all, you will enter the SoI, fly through it, escape it again and return to Kerbin. The only way to prevent this is running your engines somewhere inside the Mun\u0027s SoI. The best point to do this is at the periapsis, and that periapsis should be as low as possible.\n\nSo those 80 m/s are what you need to burn at a low Mun periapsis after coming out of a typical Hohmann transfer in order to stop escaping the Mun again. This amount will result in a highly elliptical orbit, with the apoapsis just short of escaping. The dV map will then have a second figure for \u0022Mun orbit\u0022 or \u0022Mun circularization\u0022 or some other term like that (whatever the author wants to call it), which describes the dV cost necessary to turn that highly elliptical orbit into a low circular orbit around the Mun.\n\nOther maps may simply sum this dV cost into something else for simplicity.
