Red lines represent drag. Blue and yellow lift (yellow from control surfaces).\n\nF11 toggles a thermal display which makes every part glow depending on it temperature. It\u0027s a bit scary at first as it all looks red hot, but don\u0027t panic it\u0027s normal.\n\nF10 toggles little temperature gauges that appear when parts are starting to get a bit too warm.\n\nAll these are quite handy, but can be a bit obtrusive, but they are easy to toggle on and off."}]}
