I\u0027m looking for it to be somewhat similar to Scott Manley\u0027s reusable launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, are there any design tips you could give me?

He also uses a mainsail which first draws its fuel from the 8 tall narrow tanks the jet engines are attached to before it uses the fuel in the jumbo 64 orange tank. That design works... But what kind of payload do you want to bring to orbit? If you just want to copy his it looks like he can bring up around 20 tonnes per flight (give or take a little) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA similar sized ssto with different engines can bring up 40 tonnes, but it requires different piloting skills and patience to refine it to be reliable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to be slightly more specific with your request if you want a more specific response. The best tip I can give you if you want the most dV is to use turbojets and at LEAST 4 intakes per engine. The fewer intakes you can fit on the lower your final dV will be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to use more than 10 intakes per engine whenever I can, because those engines are so amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-09T02:27:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2013 02:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by HoY\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T05:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry about the vagueness, I had limited time to type.
