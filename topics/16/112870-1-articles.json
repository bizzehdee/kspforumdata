Any ideas?\n\n#1 is easy. Just go to the tracking center, arrange the map so your focused on Kerbin at the level of the equator, and warp ahead until KSC is under the orbit. This will at most be a matter of a few hours of gametime.\n\n#2 is just the same thing on a bigger scale, with some fraction of a Kerbin year passing instead of a Kerbin day. However, if you can\u0027t afford to waste all that time watching the planets go around in the tracking center, there\u0027s an alternative. Launch the probe and escape from Kerbin\u0027s SOI just barely, so your ship is flying in loose formation with Kerbin. Then set a maneuver node when it comes into line with the target orbit, and create a node alarm for that with Kerbal Alarm Clock. Then you can go about your other business and do the inclination burn when it eventually comes up."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T22:21:26Z","Content":"I did use warp. For #1, I tried a couple of times and 90% of the time I just warp too fast and usually I didn\u0027t get there until after 3 days or so. Really annoying. That\u0027s why I\u0027m thinking of just putting a geostationary probe - at least this is doing something for real rather than fighting against warps.\n\nFor #2, actually you\u0027re right. I thought about it before, and worried that the probe has to be at least SoI-radius far away from Kerbin, and it may introduce nontrivial errors. But I just calculated and it\u0027s actually much less than I thought.\n\nIn that case, I\u0027ll probably just shoot two probes for the two purposes. Thanks for your idea!"}]}
