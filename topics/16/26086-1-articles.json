Before hitting Duna\u0027s atmosphere I usually make sure I\u0027ve shaved my speed down to under 700m/s with engines and then just leave them on very low thrust maintaining this kind of velocity. When parachutes kick in the force isn\u0027t going to be quite so rough. The high altitude parachutes are also your friend here... they drag for a good long time before opening, and can shave a lot off your speed before they even put much of a force on your ship. By having both high and low altitude parachutes you split the deceleration into two parts as well, rather than have everything open at once and shave off huge speed instantly, ripping you apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will probably find that although parachutes save massive amounts of fuel, they won\u0027t be enough to land delicate loads slowly enough on Duna (I find they usually leave me 12-20m/s) so be ready for a quick final burst of your engines before touch down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T08:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFormula you need is the first one on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pgu_FRlXJ8g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E will give you the formula and how to calculate rho in ksp,\u003Cp\u003EI was doing this exact thing last night.
