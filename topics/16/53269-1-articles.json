It didn\u0027t. It ended up circling the sun, and I was wondering if it would ever come back to Kerbin if I let it sit. Its orbit brings it within approximately 38,947,006 km of each other (the shuttle and Kerbin). If I leave it alone after a while, will it come back, or are they stuck up there forever? (I\u0027m also out of fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen answering this, if you could please explain how you know this, and how I can do the calculations myself.

Even if it did bring you back into Kerbins SOI (Sphere of Influince) I seriously doubt your periapsis (Closest Approach to a planetary body) is going to be low enough to cause you to aerobrake (Use the atmosphere to slow you down) enough so that you are in a degrading orbit (An orbit that given enough revolutions will result in a re-entry)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ahnialator6","CreatedById":93217,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T05:09:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible that it would slingshot me to another body?

The only chance (and a slim one at that) I see would be if you had some sort of propulsion like RCS to lower your periapsis within atmo when you come back around to Kerbin\u0027s SoI, but I honestly wouldn\u0027t count on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, there\u0027s no life support modeled in the game, so you can probably leave the crew up there safely while you figure out what you might need to pull off a successful rescue mission. Rendezvousing two craft in solar orbit is going to be a real challenge, but I\u0027d give it better odds than blindly trusting orbital mechanics to get you out of this situation somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T07:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you wish rescue, there are two options to partake. First is the legit rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn extra planetary rescue is entirely a finesse mission typically leapfrogging and controlled maneuvers until you can match. You want to plan for two parts. One, a stage with fuel for the outer planetary portion and then one entirely for getting back. The getting back is also your abort in case cannot catch vessel to rescue from. Just get close enough to Eva.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeapfrogging consists of small maneuvers and orbit changes to slowly work yourself closer. If ahead of target, slightly increase orbit so you can intercept. Reverse if behind. Just watch orbit path until you tweak enough for non map flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second way is a bit of cheating to refuel your craft but I will only post said info if asked since some people would rather not have the temptation of file modding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T15:05:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a similar dilemma, and built a rescue craft.

I got some good answers, so you may want to read the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/58074-Suggestions-on-getting-a-close-intercept-in-heliocentric-orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethread.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother cheaty way to do it would be to point your capsule where you want it to go, and EVA out and literally push in that direction. Go back in when you\u0027re pack fuel gets low for the refuel, rinse and repeat. It\u0027s definitely an exploit, but at least it requires more skill than using infinite fuel or changing the files.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
