I built a small lander with landing legs, fuel tanks, a liquid engine and RCS thrusters and am trying to learn to hover at the spaceport (like landing on the VAB roof). I understand hovering on the Mun is easier, but getting a new lander there after each crash simply takes too ling \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find hovering _very_ difficult, so I wonder if anyone has good tips on making it easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, it is quite overwhelming to just keep track of the position, speed and acceleration at the same time. The spacecraft is at the center of the window, the vertical speed is displayed at the very top, and the current acceleration at the very bottom. The digital speed indicator near the navball is useless, because it displays only the total speed, not the vertical (or horizontal) speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it\u0027s counter-intuitive to steer the lander with W/A/S/D keys, because the horizontal axis is not aligned with the view angle. E.g when controlling an astronaut with a jetpack, \u0027W\u0027 always accelerates away from the viewpoint, and \u0027S\u0027 accelerates towards the viewpoint. But it is not the case with spacecraft. I ended up adding an extra RCS thruster on one side of the spacecraft simply to visually mark its orientation, so when I turn it so that the thruster faces the viewpoint, the \u0027W\u0027 key accelerates away from me. I wish I could paint one side of the lander red and the other side white, so that I could always easily tell which direction the lander is facing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also difficult to arrest the horizontal movement. I can of course accelerate upwards for a few seconds, and when the lander begins descending again, put the SAS into the prograde orientation and fire the engine until the speed becomes zero. But due to the \u0022jump\u0022 necessary, this makes precise targeting impossible. Also, if I put SAS into the prograde orientation too soon (before the lander starts descending), the lander tips over and crashes, because the SAS is unable to rotate it back upright quickly enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best method I could find is to put the SAS into radial orientation (this eliminates any horizontal acceleration), carefully control the horizontal speed by tipping the lander with W/A/S/D keys for a second or so, and spend the most of my attention maintaining the vertical speed of 0. But it\u0027s still not easy at all \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any tips/tricks on how to make hovering easier?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I am now amazed that Apollo astronauts only crashed 3 LLRVs during training \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-19T02:51:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2015 02:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by uncle_jew\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T21:50:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s much easier to make a controlled descent and land than to make a static hover - in fact without pilot aid mods I don\u0027t think a truly static hover is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a rocket-style lander (i.e. not a VTOL plane), it\u0027s best to find your retrograde marker on the navball and thrust towards it until your speed approaches zero. In the full game you can set the SAS to track the retrograde marker which makes this much easier. Of course, if you\u0027re actually ascending, your retrograde direction will be downwards, so it\u0027s important to keep your spatial awareness and not thrust unnecessarily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, landing a lander on the Mun is very, VERY much easier than flying a VTOL craft of any kind on Kerbin, since all you need to do is control your speed and aim backwards, gravity\u0027s lower, and there\u0027s no aero drag to tip you over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually hovering at a fixed altitude probably can be done with autopilot mods, but in full-manual mode I generally try to keep the plane moving slowly in the direction I want it to rather than trying to stop and ending up moving in the wrong direction.
