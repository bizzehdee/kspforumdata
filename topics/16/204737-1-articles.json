This is even worse for other type of needs (for \u0022structural parts\u0022, I often need to jump between the \u0022structural\u0022 category and the \u0022aero\u0022, if maybe the needed shape could be a more classic \u0022tube\u0022 put in the former, than a \u0022conical shape\u0022 that could be a nosecone in \u0022aero\u0022)\u003Cbr\u003E\nSometime, using the \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Janitor\u0027s Closet\u0022\u003C/em\u003E mod and some in game filtering, I\u0027m able to shrink the mess, but nothing is alike having perfectly, split, custom categories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunally, these categories, once made, are shared between all my saved games, so it\u0027s a one time effort...\u003Cbr\u003E\n... mostly...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe problem and the \u0022help\u0022 needed:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... untill, for testing purpose, I find myself in the need to set up different installations of the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I would like to find them and, someway, export them to a different game installation, to not have to redo all my customization from the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here my question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs rougly knowingt how KSP works, when \u0022saving\u0022 something, these \u0022customized categories\u0022 should be stored somewhere very likely as a .cfg file (I see various mods using those to add their own \u0022stock custom categories\u0022 that way).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey are probably not in the \u0022save\u0022 persistent file, because I already know that my categories are \u0022cross-saves\u0022 compatible, but I VERY FAILED to find them anywhere else in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone help me, pointing where I should look ???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advances. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:grin:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/grin.png\u0022 title=\u0022:grin:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-08T11:11:18Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2021 11:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Araym\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
