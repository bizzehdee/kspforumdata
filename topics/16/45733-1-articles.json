The way you build your craft makes fuel flow to the engines in the bottom. Basically, the current tree structure of the editor makes it so that all those boosters below are considered in the same stack as the orange tank above, reason why it drains the fuel from there. You can either rebuild your craft and attach the tanks directly to the decouplers, or disable the fuel flow in the big orange tank manually before lifting off.

It\u0027s a matter of attachment nodes. Basically, by placing your trusses this way, you \u0022extend\u0022 the stack. Then the radial connector also extends the stack down to the boosters below. If you would\u0027ve attached the trusses radially (by that I mean the green attachment node pointing up, not towards the decoupler), this wouldn\u0027t be happening. For the game to consider something as a new stack, it needs to be attached radially. If you connect things by their heads where there is a node, you create a fuel flow weirdness like this. The easiest if you want to keep your design would be to cut fuel flow in the top orange tank as I said, but changing your design shouldn\u0027t be too hard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zcar.300","CreatedById":78684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T22:24:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh OK.
