And then another couple years later, you arrive in Eeloo\u0027s SoI and perform another course correction because floating point errors accumulated over time and ruined your desired periapsis once more... PreciseNode is good for the comfort of editing maneuver nodes in a different, more detailed way, but it can\u0027t fix the inherent imprecision in the game itself, or that of its human users. The result is often no different from a haphazardly hand-calibrated node coupled with a mid-course correction of 2-3 m/s worth of dV.

Therefore, if you want your target to be at the apsis of your transfer orbit at the same time as you arrive there, you need to figure out where the target must be at the time you are leaving. You must \u0022rewind\u0022 its position starting from the transfer apsis (the desired intercept point) by x amount of time. Conveniently we also know y, which is the time it takes the target to make one full orbit. By simply dividing x/y, you get a fraction which is equal to the fraction of the orbit that the target planet moves while you are in transit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuper simple example: your target planet has an orbital period of 4 years, and you have a projected travel time of 1 year. Calculate: 1/4 = 0.25, which means that the target planet completes one quarter of its orbit while you are in transit. That means your transfer window, i.e. the ideal point of departure, is when the target planet is one quarter of its orbit away from reaching the desired intercept point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow comes the part where inner planets orbit quicker than Kerbin which orbits quicker than outer planets:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you\u0027re going to an inner planet and the target is \u003Cem\u003Ecloser to\u003C/em\u003E the intercept than you need it to be, you missed your transfer window and you need to wait for \u003Cem\u003Eyour target\u003C/em\u003E to come around the sun again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you\u0027re going to an inner planet and the target is \u003Cem\u003Efurther away from\u003C/em\u003E the intercept than you need it to be, the next transfer window is coming up soon because your target planet is \u0022closing in\u0022 on the desired intercept point, relatively speaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- But if you\u0027re going to an outer planet, the situation is reversed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--- If the target is \u003Cem\u003Ecloser to\u003C/em\u003E the intercept than you need it to be, the next transfer window is coming up soon because the target planet is \u0022receding away\u0022 from the desired intercept, relatively speaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--- If the target is \u003Cem\u003Efurther away from\u003C/em\u003E the intercept than you need it to be, you missed your transfer window and you need to wait for \u003Cem\u003EKerbin\u003C/em\u003E to go around the sun once more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously this doesn\u0027t take into acount things like inclined and eccentric orbits, but it should give a rough estimate of where the transfer window is. At least with this method, you know that you don\u0027t even need to bother trying to get an Eve transfer while Eve is ahead relative to Kerbin (what people mean when they talk about \u0022phase angles\u0022). Unless of course you want to spend a lot of extra time or a lot of extra dV... generally even both. If Eve was in roughly the right place, though, you could get an intercept realtively easily, experiment with the transfer node and decide for yourself if leaving now, or waiting a little, or leaving even sooner next time would be beneficial to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
