I always played stock, or with a few mod parts at most. Now i have my eye put in various game changing mods (Alternis, Planet Factory come off the top of my head), but i dont want to mess up my existing stock saves. So what i\u0027d like to do is making another independent install and mod it heavily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible at all?
