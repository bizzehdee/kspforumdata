You want an angle of about 5 - 10 degrees off of your landing zone so you\u0027re basically going to come in straight down on the LZ. I\u0027ve landed things within 4km of each other doing this, mainly that far on purpose due to the terrain not being flat enough. Alternatively you can overshoot the LZ a little more, then when you\u0027re over the LZ and are going less than 400m/s, decelerate with the landing engines so you come in straight down. Make sure your lander has enough power to preform an atmospheric maneuver tho, otherwise I\u0027d go with my first suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI landed on the little island in the middle of the huge crater along the equator of Eve surrounded by ocean using my method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/902138687519506357/1FAF0D3ADA334C96762A3635EBD2843F3D93CDD1/\u0022 alt=\u00221FAF0D3ADA334C96762A3635EBD2843F3D93CDD1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my decent trajectory, first try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/902138687521628835/E40EDE87F0C0168732C668DC8E7235656F2C8EEB/\u0022 alt=\u0022E40EDE87F0C0168732C668DC8E7235656F2C8EEB\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/902138687521641048/B5776D45FCC20C1787188B2CF090428E4F076C25/\u0022 alt=\u0022B5776D45FCC20C1787188B2CF090428E4F076C25\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanded within 2.2km of my first Eve landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/902138687521645968/5D5D0C5AECF25FD1D6A277E68A8CC7A05A1C6DCA/\u0022 alt=\u00225D5D0C5AECF25FD1D6A277E68A8CC7A05A1C6DCA\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-09T00:20:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2013 12:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 700NitroXpress\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T23:28:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I need some accuracy with landing in atmosphere, I quicksave and retry till I succeed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T00:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible to do with stock, though tedious.
