I designed a craft with ridiculously long small diameter boosters. So I thought, \u0022Why not asparagus them and save the length?\u0022.\n\nSo I split each booster into eighths (they were very long ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)) and set up the fuel pipes and staging. After several failed launch attempts (\u003Cplug\u003Eusing TriggerAu\u0027s excellent \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60227-1-0-x-KSP-Alternate-Resource-Panel-v2-7-2-0-(June-29)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlternate Resource Panel\u003C/a\u003E for debugging\u003C/plug\u003E). The two fuel lines connecting the two engine stages are the only pipes installed without symmetry.\n\nMy debugging could be wrong. I could have a mis-placed fuel-line. I can\u0027t see why one works and one doesn\u0027t. Links to craft below.\n\nThis one behaves as [expected](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9sS0rJyD8HvWnlySWdmMUZNQzg/view?usp=sharing).\n\nThis one [doesn\u0027t](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9sS0rJyD8Hvd2dpczFpT2djcVE/view?usp=sharing).\n\nI had to re-arrange the staging a bit between the two. One is four stage, the other eight. I did this purely by re-staging the decouplers, didn\u0027t touch the existing fuel-lines. The original had a payload, which I removed. I use a few mods (KER, RT2 - I removed the antenna, the above mentioned ARP, no others that I think will interfere).\n\nCould any rocket boffins help stop me going crazy, please? I could just replace the whole shebang with 2 large-diameter boosters, but where\u0027s the Kerbal in that?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T10:58:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 10:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Minimalist**\n  \nProblem solved"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T22:07:49Z","Content":"You don\u0027t need fuel-lines between the upper/lower tanks in each stack.\n\nMore importantly the lines from each stack to the centre are wrong, only the last-jettisoned stage (2 stacks) should have those, the rest just feed via their neighbours.\n\nHmmm, looking at it a bit more; you\u0027ve used symmetry-4 to position the decouplers. You can\u0027t do that, then try to treat them as symmetry-2 (or, if you can, it\u0027ll be a lot of hassle).
