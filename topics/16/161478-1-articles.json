They are color coded by contract, and the tooltip shows the name of the agency with the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter you accept the contract, when you go to launch an airplane to do the contract, you can hit M to go into map mode. When you are in map mode, you will see the navigation markers again. If you click on a navigation marker, you will get a button that says \u0022Activate Navigation\u0022. Clicking that will put a marker on your navball that points straight at the waypoint. If the waypoint is on the other side of the planet, you may not be able to see the marker initially, until you get partway to your destination. The marker will often be far enough away that it\u0027s below the horizon -- just fly toward the horizon in the correct direction, and you will get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-03T03:07:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2017 03:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mean_Gene","CreatedById":178424,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-04T01:26:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for the help, greatly appreciated!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
