That once you have the node before than you should see that part come up. \n\nMy observations are if you accept and complete the contract (Swivel or Terrier) and never acquire the node then the contract is stalled in rising to the top of the pool.\n\nThe \u0022Terrier\u0022 and \u0022Swivel\u0022 contracts do return and only after acquiring the node to which they belong.\n\n@5thHorseman\n\nThanks.
