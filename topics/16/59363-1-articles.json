I have 0.23, and haven\u0027t attempted a rendezvous since 0.21 (which I was able to do successfully). Now though, I can bring two objects into alignment at about 0.1 m/s relative speed (approximately, as my nav ball is very glitchy anymore and won\u0027t give exact readouts, it keeps jumping between numbers and coordinates). I can bring my two ports to near enough touch, not exactly but I can remember from past rendezvous that the magnetic assist is quite generous, but now the objects simply collide into each other without connecting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommon troubleshooting that I\u0027ve covered:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-SAS turned OFF.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Both ports are matching make and size\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Both are assembled the right way\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/7V9us1Z\u0022 alt=\u00227V9us1Z\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/OfVf3Gd\u0022 alt=\u0022OfVf3Gd\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApologies for the annoyance of covering such old ground, but any help would be appreciated!
