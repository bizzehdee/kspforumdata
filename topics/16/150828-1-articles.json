My understanding is that there is a precision switch making it impossible to align an orbit period to high accuracy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone know of a good formation with extremely high coverage that requires minimal upkeep?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI considered highly eccentric orbits, but those still come with bunching and that still results in blackouts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am currently considering a 5 satilite constellation. One satilite (likely a polar scan and science sat) will act as an alignment timer for a Draim tetrahedron. While sensitive to bunching, a Draim tetrahedron at least uses elliptical orbits and it\u0027s high altitude makes period adjustment easier. Fewer satilites means fewer manuvers to recalibrate. The timing sat allows me to mitigate the disadvantage of measuring relative mean anomalies of 90\u00B0 by instead aligning to time to apsis to different timer orbits. Finally, blind spots are preceded by loss of a network link allowing clear signaling of when calibration is required. The only disadvantage I see to this solution is the lack of low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E delivery.
