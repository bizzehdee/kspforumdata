In order to do science with a probe/satellite it must have one of the science thingies installed (that\u0027s the technical term). Any of the attachable science experiments (graviloi, goo, etc) can be done with a probe as long as they are on your craft and the probe has power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you have two choices for the science. Transmit it back to Kerbin (if you have an antenna and power) or recover the science module to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you transmit, there is a percentage cap to how much of the science points you can gain (the percent varies by the experiment type).

The more of the planet is painted, the more science you get when you transmit the data back (and SCANsat sensors don\u0027t have a penalty for transmitting data).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Interstellar has a new lab part that can be told to run experiments while in orbit.

Everywhere else you\u0027re only getting one result for in space high, and another for in space low. Thus a satellite that sticks around is only better for science than a one-off flyby around those three bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen in terms of specific experiments:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA Reports, and Surface Samples require a Kerbal, so are moot for unmanned satellites. Circling Kerbin, the Mun, or Minmus with a manned ship taking and transmitting EVA reports on the other hand is a great way to get science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe barometer, seismometer, and Sensor Nosecone are of no use in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mystery Goo and Science Jr (aka Materials Bay) are single-use unless you have a science lab (the big one) with 2 kerbals in it to clean up the experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew Reports, surprisingly, do NOT require a Kerbal. You need a manned command pod but that pod doesn\u0027t have to be occupied, though if it\u0027s empty you will need a separate probe core to control your ship. However, they aren\u0027t biome-sensitive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thermometer is not biome-sensitive in space either, you can only get a single result when you\u0027re close enough to the celestial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat leaves the gravimeter. Its results are biome-sensitive both low and high over the celestial, and even with the transmission penalty it\u0027s still capable of sending back a nice chunk of science. IMHO it\u0027s the only experiment that can make a satellite useful in terms of science gathering. Unfortunately, it\u0027s the last science instrument to be unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, a gravimetry satellite taking and transmitting readings from high and low orbit over all biomes would bring you 144 science from Kerbin, 720 from the Mun, or 576 from Minmus.
