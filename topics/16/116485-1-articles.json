Unfortunately, the basic aviation tech doesn\u0027t include any LF-only tanks.\n\nIn that case, be sure you\u0027re draining out the oxidizer in the SPH. While you\u0027re at it, do the same for the monoprop in the cockpit; this plane isn\u0027t going to space, it needs neither.\n\nIf you\u0027ve happened to unlock the AV-R8 winglet (available with Flight Control, a 45-point tier tech), those make for great horizontal stabiliators in low-tech. They make for good canards even after you\u0027ve got some better parts unlocked. The Delta-Deluxe is a pretty reasonable piece for a low-tech fin/rudder, though.\n\nHow are you for gears? I\u0027d turn the brakes on the rear gears up if you can.\n\nEDIT: You might not want your CoM and CoL to be right next to one another. If you\u0027re into mods, I\u0027d suggest one called RCS Build Aid. Among its many useful features is a \u0022dry center of mass\u0022 marker that shows you where your CoM will be when the craft runs out of gas. For planes, it\u0027s a handy way of being able to tell if your CoM is going to go aft of the CoL at some point during the flight. In stock, you could just drain all the tanks completely and use that position to set your CoL - but that gets tedious once your planes start getting bigger, and you have to remember to put the fuel back if you want the plane to run at all...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T16:13:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 04:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T15:50:05Z","Content":"I\u0027m not great at aircraft but this flies real nice and the wings are in the proper place...\n\n![lbdl1GW.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lbdl1GW.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T16:17:00Z","Content":"Grab those horizontal tails with the rotation tool and point them down a click (non-angle-snap mode).

What happens is the lift center *of the main wing* is placed behind the CoM, and the resulting moment is canceled out by downforce (on tailplanes) or upforce (on canards). The result is the overall lift vector is exacly over the CoM with no net moment, or \u0022trim.\u0022 It\u0027s just REALLY hard to zero the moment using the tools we have in KSP.

You can be off a tiny bit without any detriment to performance).\n\n![screenshot14_1.png](http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e216/Max_Payne_0001/screenshot14_1.png)\n\nSide view: In this view, the CG (yellow) and CL (blue) are very close together, with the CL slightly behind the CG. This promotes stability since the CL is behind the CG, but close enough that the plane will lift off easily and fly fairly neutral. If the CL is ahead of the CG, the plane will pitch up uncontrollably since the CL want to try to flip behind the CG.\n\n![screenshot15_1.png](http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e216/Max_Payne_0001/screenshot15_1.png)\n\nHope this helps. For the most part, as long as your CL is slightly behind your CG you\u0027ll be okay. The CL can be slightly higher and behind the CG to promote stability, or slightly below and behind the CG to enhance cornering and maneuverability.\n\nIf the CL and CG are exactly in the same space, your plane will fly fine, but any over correction in your piloting will cause the plane to lose control. Any imbalances in thrust from multiple engines will cause the plane to lose control very quickly. Also if the plane\u0027s CG shifts due to fuel being burnt it *could* become unstable in flight. I would compromise and keep the CL slightly behind the CG. Your plane will be a little slower to change direction, but much easier to handle in the long run.\n\nAlso keep the rear landing gear slightly behind the CG and CL. The easier the plane can pitch up on the runway for takeoffs, the easier the plane will take off at a lower speed. Be cautious since the plane can pitch up easier, it could smack the engines down on the runway and you\u0027ll lose them. Adjust the position for flying style and taste.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T16:51:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 04:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GDJ**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T16:55:34Z","Content":"CoL can be quite a bit behind CoM - if you drain your fuel you get a different position of CoM so aim for CoL at a location where it always stays at least a little bit behind CoM.
