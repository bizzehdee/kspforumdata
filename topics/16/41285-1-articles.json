You have to be sure to aim the decoupler towards the command pod (so that it separates with the rest of the abort tower if you don\u0027t need it and want to jettison it) and give a little bit of an angle (5 degrees) to each Seperatron away from the adapter. You then set up an action group that fires off all twelve Seperatrons at once and includes the decoupler that\u0027s holding the command pod to the rest of the stack (not the one that\u0027s holding the abort tower to the command pod). Push the button and off it goes.
