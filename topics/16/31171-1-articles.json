The simple fix without inflating the part count is just to shed weight to mitigate the sway effect and use separate launches. But if his computer can handle the extra parts then strutting should fix it as long as he doesn\u0027t do an overly-steep gravity turn lower in the atmosphere where drag becomes an issue. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T13:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@S\u00C3\u00A1\u00C2\u00B4\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C3\u2030\u00C2\u00AA\u00C3\u2030\u00C2\u00B4\u00C3\u00A1\u00C2\u00B4\u00E2\u20AC\u00BA\u00C3\u2030\u00C2\u00AA\u00C3\u0160\u00C5\u00B8\u00C3\u0160\u00C5\u00B8\u00C3\u00A1\u00C2\u00B4\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C3\u00A1\u00C2\u00B4\u00E2\u20AC\u00BA\u00C3\u00A1\u00C2\u00B4\u00C2\u00C3\u0160\u00E2\u201A\u00AC Ah ok agree 100%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore OT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing i\u0027ve started using recently to improve rigidity is to connect *every* part in the central stack to its (stack) neighbor. Mostly with only one short strut. It doesn\u0027t provide that much rigidity but blocks any bigger bends on parts that that are prone to it like the small 2m fuel tanks, 2m decouplers or hitchhiker modules. So even under big loads the payload doesn\u0027t move too much and it returns to original position much faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso about adding struts to asparagus stages, it can work if you: 1)make sure the asparagus stage itself is firmly attached to central tank so even when there is only two boosters left it doens\u0027t wobble. 4 struts are usually enough ex:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E   O     \u0026lt; asparagus boosters\u003Cbr\u003E  | |    \u0026lt;-struts\u003Cbr\u003E   @     \u0026lt;-central stage\u003Cbr\u003E  | |  \u003Cbr\u003E   O     \u0026lt; asparagus boosters\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen use two struts per booster (in the same way) to connect to the payload.
