Picked up a \u0022Rescue a Kerbal in Orbit Around the Moon\u0022 contract. Flew to where he was, got close, switched to the Kerbal to be rescued, EVA\u0027d him to my ship where I have an empty 4-kerbal passenger module. I was able to get the to-be-rescued Kerbal to grab onto my ship but I can\u0027t for the life of me figure out how to get him to board it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never get the \u0022B to board\u0022 message. (Nor, does pressing it work.) I can only grab onto the ship and let go. I\u0027ve transferred my pilot out of the command capsule and into the passenger module in the hopes that the needs-to-be-rescued-Kerbal could board the capsule but that doesn\u0027t work either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone have any idea what I\u0027m doing wrong? And/or how to get this guy in the ship?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to be clear: there are a lot of questions in the forum about how to take control of the Kerbal where the answer is use: use the the bracket hotkeys. Just wanted to be clear that this is not my issue. i can take control of him just fine using the brackets. I still can\u0027t get him to do anything but grab hold of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-13T06:04:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2017 06:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by mscottveach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-13T14:01:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat seems odd. Just to be clear what should be happening is when you are in front of the hatch you should be being prompted to press f to grab the ladder.

When you are grabbed onto the ship, there may be a ladder that leads all the way to the command capsule -- so you may just be able to use W or S to climb along the ladder all the way to the hatch. But the first thing to do is just to look over the command capsule and visually find the hatch. If you wave your mouse in front of it, a tooltip will appear that says \u0022Crew Hatch\u0022. Once you spot it, let go again, turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E again, gently fly up to the crew hatch, and then grab on again.
