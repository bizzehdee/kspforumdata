The one thing I have found with them is avoid attempting to circularize low. At low altitudes, you get substantially less change of apoapsis/periapsis per dV.

It would be quite capable of going out to Eeloo, where solar panels are less effective. As a rule of thumb, a single ion engine consumes ~14.5 power and a single gigantor produces 18 at kerbin. It only takes one gigantor per engine as far out as Duna. Past that, you\u0027ll want a gigantor and another panel and maybe as many as 2 gigantors per engine if you feel like going out to Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: something I have taken to doing is placing my ion probes in really high orbits.
