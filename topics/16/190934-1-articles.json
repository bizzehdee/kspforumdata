The latter should be easy enough to check: are all the wheels running? In the same direction? But from the way the wheels sunk into the surface I believe that the orientation of the wheels is indeed the problem: I think the game doesn\u0027t really realize that the wheels are (supposed to be) in contact with the surface. Thus the \u0022sinking in\u0022 and if they aren\u0027t in contact with the surface then they also don\u0027t push your rover around when they turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had similar problems with the landing wheels on some of my spaceplanes on Gilly. Where the game insisted that I was in immediate danger of crashing and thus didn\u0027t allow time warp or vessel switching, because it didn\u0027t register that the landing gear was already on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-10T21:13:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think AHHans has it right. You might be under the impression that wheels in KSP are circular, so it doesn\u0027t matter which part of the wheel touches the ground. This is incorrect. Wheels have a very definite \u0022orientation\u0022, and if the \u0022wrong\u0022 part of the wheel is touching the ground, you may easily get stuck. The suspension of the wheel is supposed to be vertical, and above the wheel. The suspension on your wheels is obviously horizontal in your screenshot. Therefore, I wouldn\u0027t really expect your wheels to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, there is the matter of the orientation of your control point. When you open the menu of one of the parts on your rover, and click \u0022control from here\u0022, that part needs to be pointing in the \u0022forward\u0022 direction. You can tell this orientation at a glance by looking at the navball. The center of the navball is the direction the rover considers to be \u0022forward\u0022. Your navball is aimed at the sky. This is very likely to mess up the control algorithms for the wheels. If your wheels spin in opposite directions when you push the W key, then your rover will not go anywhere. The control point can change in flight, and there are usually several parts on a craft that can serve as a control point -- which I think includes the command seats. So if you click on a command seat and select \u0022control from here\u0022, then I think your rover may work better.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fierce Wolf","CreatedById":200019,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-13T13:24:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sure hope you test your rovers on Kerbin before launching it off world!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
