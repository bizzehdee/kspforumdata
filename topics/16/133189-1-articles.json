Flies like a breeze, and it functions as a proper SSTO. I parked it in a circular orbit at an altitude of 100 km. I did a de-orbit burn and then things started to go south. In short, I burned like a crisp. The question, how should I de-orbit to avoid this? My mk1 cockpit exploded due to overheating at 35 km (speed= 2070 km/h).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T17:00:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are going too fast. You need to slow down before you hit the thick, lower atmosphere. First, your initial trajectory needs to be shallow. Lower your periapsis to ~40km, the friction will do the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s more important, is to not face prograde during the descent. To bleed the most speed, you must present your widest profile to the airflow as soon as you reach the air (70km). Imagine throwing an umbrella closed vs. open. A forward facing aircraft is like the closed one. Pitching up to 90\u00B0 is overkill in most cases, 30-40\u00B0 should be enough. You can even trim the desired landing spot by holding a specific angle of attack (AoA).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIllustration:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dZnZXTr.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dZnZXTr.png\u0022 width=\u0022937\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s possible that you can\u0027t pitch up. The most common reason for that is the CoM shifting behind the CoL while the tanks run dry, messing up your aerodynamic properties. There\u0027s not much you can do in this case besides redesigning, unless you have well placed control surfaces. In this case, you can try landing backwards. Sounds silly, but it\u0027s totally possible. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022^_^\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 title=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-29T17:06:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/29/2016 05:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ForScience6686","CreatedById":144187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T17:26:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI prefer the steep trajectory with a very high aoa. \u00A0Higher drag up high and as the aero forces bring your nose down it will transfer vertical speed r to horizontal speed. \u00A0This has worked finefor my small ssto, may not be as good in heavier craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Puddle Jumper","CreatedById":153758,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T22:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, thanks.

leading edges\u00A0of your vehicle. \u00A0 However, by deploying landing gear, opening cargo bays etc. to increase drag, these items can do some of the thermal -\u0026gt; kinetic energy conversion too. \u00A0This has the practical effect of shortening the re-entry duration, which can help peak temperatures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as a practical matter, \u00A0even my Mark 1 cockpit spaceplanes have no issues re-entering on Kerbin, because my designs have lots of wing area and don\u0027t drop into the soup till going pretty slow. \u00A0 I like to make patchwork quilts of Big-S delta wings and keep all my fuel there - fuselages are for cargo, systems and kerbals only. \u00A0 \u00A0 I also prefer inline cockpits with a few things ahead of them in the vehicle stack, that way they\u0027re not the first thing to blow up if you do get it wrong and not the first to smack the ground if you prang the landing. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the belt-and-braces approach, \u00A0put 1.25m heat shield with a little ablator right behind the nose cone of your aircraft. \u00A0The nose cone will be first to pop, exposing the heat shield, which will then blanket the cockpit and stop it heating any further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of placing the landing site accurately, i\u0027ll admit it\u0027s tricky. \u00A0I normally aim for a 35km periapsis in the middle of the desert in the continent west of the space centre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I\u0027m undershooting, bear in mind that \u00A0the best\u00A0lift-drag ratio at hypersonic speeds is at 5 degrees angle of attack. \u00A0You will actually glide furthest and travel furthest from your initial re-entry point at this angle. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Above 5 deg, drag rises faster than lift so the distance downrange will be less the more you pitch up. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you\u0027re undershooting and not in danger of blowing up, try lowering the nose bit closer to the \u0022best glide\u0022 angle.\u00A0\u00A0If overshooting, pull back to a near stalled condition and make more drag. \u00A0 \u00A0 I know it sounds kind of backwards, and for the first couple of seconds pitching down will make altitude drop faster as height is converted to speed, but pretty soon the trajectory line will show your landing point moving further away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for pulling back on the stick to correct an overshoot, \u00A0I actually think that\u0027s easier on the plane than making S turns. \u00A0You\u0027re using lift to Up rather than sideways, so will stay higher and cooler longer, \u00A0and you might welcome the buffer if you start having thermal issues. \u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, assuming your craft is like mine and doesn\u0027t come particularly close to melting on a normal re-entry, \u00A0i\u0027ll start o\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T01:14:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I\u0027m not an SSTO master, I\u0027ve built a few of them and landed(or at least reentered successfully). \u00A0I do an AoA of 20 degrees at an PE of 40-35 km from the start and usually start skipping up around 50-45km where I\u0027ll either lower my AoA to -20 or 5 till I start coming back down. \u00A0I\u0027m nearing 20km around the ocean or the desert and will usually have to turn on my engines at the minimum to make it over the mountains.
