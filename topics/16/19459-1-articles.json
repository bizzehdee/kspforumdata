This was my first ever attempt (and success) at making it into Mun\u0027s north pole. Now the problem. My ship was designed to be able to make it to Mun and Minmus without any problems, but I never even thought about giving it enough delta-v for a polar landing. I have about 600L left of fuel on my ascent stage and I don\u0027t know if that is enough to make it back to Kerbin.

The right time in this instance is at apoapsis of your Kerbin-descent trajectory, because any change you make there is magnified by the length of the descent. You can easily change the altitude of your periapsis by whole kilometers, and remember that if you get it below about 40,000m, it will only take a few aerobraking passes to de-orbit the ship. If you can get the periapsis down to about 20,000m, you probably won\u0027t come out of atmo again.
