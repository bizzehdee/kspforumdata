Mechjeb tells me I have to get an equatorial orbit in order to get home. This can\u0027t possibly be true, right? How hard is getting back to kerbin from a polar orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The delta-v required to change from polar to equatorial is MASSIVE (according to Mechjeb). Is this right? What\u0027s the most effecient way to change your orbital plane (I dont have the fuel to do what mechjeb thinks is the best way)? It seems like MJ wants to kill all the vertical momentum, then burn horizontally. Couldn\u0027t I slowly make micro burns to change my orbit and save a ton of fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Traches","CreatedById":79229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T17:39:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have a couple of options--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn prograde until you have an elliptical orbit and do your plane change at apoapse, which will cost less than the overall plane change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse a couple gravity assists from Ike to change planes (but I don\u0027t think Ike\u0027s gravity is strong enough for this to be a good option)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, time accelerate until your orbit lines up with duna\u0027s orbit around the sun, and leave duna in the retrograde direction like you normally would. Plan your ejection burn to push your periapse down to kerbin\u0027s orbit, to where you get the white approach markers. Time accelerate down to the white marker, place a maneuver node, and play with the pro and retrograde markers to try and get an intercept. If you\u0027re too far away, wait a year and try again till it works. The important thing is that you do your burns where your orbit intersects kerbin\u0027s-- so you\u0027ll always pass through that point, and you\u0027re adjusting how long it takes you to get there in order to meet up with the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T17:40:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo correct the inclination, set Ike as your target, than at the ascending/descending node, (whichever is closer) make a maneuver node to correct the inclination about half, than make another at the other AN/DN to fix it the rest of the way, your relative inclination should be 0.

Put your orbital path right next to its equator as low as you need and you should get a free plane change. It may not be perfect but you\u0027ll save tons of delta-V on your way out (fine-tune your plane change after the Ike encounter before you\u0027ve left Duna SOI). Of course, that also depends on how well you set up the transfer node because you\u0027ll probably also be using Ike to sling you out of Duna\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T18:26:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis might not be the best answer for you, but if you goal is just to return to Kerbin (a parachute landing, no fancy orbit) then a direct burn from polar orbit should be entirely possible without losing much delta-v. You just need to plan it manually without mechjeb (mechjeb has a specific program for figuring out how to reach a goal and it will try altering everything else to fit that program instead of improvising - you can see this when it uses tons of monopropellent to dock).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrop down a maneuver node, pull the prograde side out until it reads about 1500m/s, then zoom out to see Kerbin and set it as your target. Now move the node around until it shows you moving into a lower sun orbit instead of a higher one. Push or pull the prograde handle until you have a close encounter with kerbin (little grey arrows appear), then try fine tuning, first with the prograde handle and then with the inclination handle. You may need to move the node a bit too. Alternate between the two until you have a proper encounter. At that point you do the burn and wait until you are outside Duna\u0027s SOI. Now plot a much smaller maneuver node (or even just use RCS translation with trial and error) to lower the PE of your Kerbin encounter below 20km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T19:28:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a polar orbit last time I visited Duna (during the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/aeEWF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EConstipation XI mission\u003C/a\u003E).
