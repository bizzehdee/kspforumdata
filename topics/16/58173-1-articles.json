Now jebbediah is stuck on the Mun ! I want to rescue him but also rescue the goo and materials that are on the other ship. is there a way to send an unmanned ship and transfer some energy? i dont have any docking parts unlocked yet though : / and i only have a one man pod i can send so there would be no place to put jebbediah in?! help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T21:47:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJeb can collect the science from the individual experiments on EVA, then store it in the pod of the rescue ship. There\u0027s no way to revive the dead pod in stock KSP, unless it has a docking port or solar panel. The KAS mod would allow an ad-hoc connection to transfer some power across.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"buzzles","CreatedById":59943,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T21:51:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESadly, without docking equipment you\u0027re stuffed on the transfer of energy front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as to get Jeb and the Science back, that\u0027s now actually doable thanks to the latest patch as you can transfer science results between ships when EVA\u0027ing. Just get Jeb outside and right click on the part. Move to a new capsule and it\u0027s happy days once again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your problem of only having a one kerbal capsule, it\u0027s not a problem: start a new rocket with a \u003Cstrong\u003Eprobe core\u003C/strong\u003E as the first part, and then add a capsule underneath. You can launch with an empty capsule as long as you\u0027ve got a probe part for control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Stayputnik can be your fourth science unlock (Flight Control is the section), and handily to get there you have to unlock radial parachutes, so taking up the top of the capsule with the probe core isn\u0027t a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit: Derp, yes.
