Rather than transmitting the collected data, I planned on storing my accumulated science in a single return pod, which, when my research is complete, would be decoupled and flown back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that didn\u0027t make sense:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Station - one science lab in low orbit around Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Landers (2x) - contain all science parts, fly from surface to station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Return craft - one pod, holding all science after processed by labs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first mission came back, with exposed Goo containers and Material Bays. I \u0022processed\u0022 the Material Bays for the boosted science, then moved the science via EVA to the return pod. Now however, my material bay is locked - i.e. right clicking on it does nothing, gives no tooltips, etc. The pod looks exposed. Did I do something wrong? I think I may have done something in the wrong order. Fortunately, I have the second lander which hasn\u0027t deployed at all yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did this exact sequence with the thermometers and other parts I have researched, with no problems (then again, I didn\u0027t really expect any with those).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know where I goofed.
