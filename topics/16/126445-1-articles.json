The mission is to follow it through Kerbin re-entry to observe an asteroid\u0026#39;s re-entry characteristics. However, I was expecting to be able to get some science from it, and I cannot. The probes 3 experiments (Temp/Bar/Grav) are only reading Kerbin-sphere data.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know asteroids do not have an SOI, however I was expecting to get Some science.
