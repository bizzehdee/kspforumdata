To cut down on costs I was wondering if I were to dock a fuel ship it could refuel and go on.

If you\u0027re just doing the \u0027land on mun\u0027/\u0027land on minimus\u0027 contracts, it doesn\u0027t matter (so yes, you can use the refueling ship).\n\nAlso, even if it is for a station/base/sat contract, if both ships are launched after the contract is accepted it will still work."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T01:26:44Z","Content":"You can do a lander/refueler setup and have it work just fine for contracts. It\u0027s also a really good idea if you want to harvest a celestial body of all its potential science. The only time the game really checks for \u0022new vessel\u0022 is when a vessel is launched; after that, any vessel you have is flagged as already existing even if it\u0027s the child of an older vessel."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T01:41:25Z","Content":"Be a bit careful, I docked my Mun base with an old science station in orbit, this removed the \u0022new ship\u0022 flag from my base."},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T02:46:18Z","Content":"^Interesting...
