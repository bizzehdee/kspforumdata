On a rocket powered VTOL you burn fuel so fast that your balance changes a lot if your fuel tanks are off center. On a jet powered VTOL it takes longer, but then the throttle lag from the engine spool up makes them very hard to fly without using mods for vertical rate control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you played with the stock VTOL to get some design ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T19:51:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough you\u0027ve gotten plenty of suggestions and marked this thread as answered, here\u0027s a couple more things to consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use multiple engines, angle them out from vertical.

If you pitch forward 5 degrees the front engine is pointing straight down and providing maximum lift. The rear engine is angled back 10 degrees and providing less lift, but some forward thrust. (which was your reason for pitching forward in the first place)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to get more stability is to put the engines above the center of mass. To do this you need a mod that allows you to reverse your engine gimbals.
