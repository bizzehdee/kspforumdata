I just bought Kerbal today. My brother and I have literally been up until 5am playing it, making ramshackle, wobbly pieces of rubbish that barely fly. Anyway, my question is: to activate or deactivate an engine, you have to zoom right up to your plane or rocket and press \\\u0027deactivate\\\u0027. Is there a mod to bind this to a key? Or just some easier way? It\\\u0027s quite tricky when you\\\u0027re in the thick of things to have to fiddle about zooming in.
