But I\u0027d add one thing - force the game to keep your velocity in surface mode for landing. Nothing worse than finishing a successful mission and crashing because you thought you\u0027re still going at 200 m/s.\n\nEDIT: You can also use the fact that half of Kerbin is always illuminated to estimate the position of KSC in map mode based on continents you can see. This became my favorite way of doing it, because I always forget to mark KSC with a flag or a probe.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T10:55:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 10:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deutherius**"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T11:03:44Z","Content":"There\u0027s also [NavUtilities](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85353) if you\u0027re into mods."},{"CreatedByName":"Vashts","CreatedById":125630,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T15:09:51Z","Content":"i parked a rover near the tracking station and used rename to mark it as a base. probably the smartest thing ive done in that career."},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T16:00:40Z","Content":"I always put a flag at the west end of the runway.

When you\u0027re waiting in orbit, you can\u0027t timewarp very fast, so I switch to my KSC probe (which can timewarp all the way to the max speed since it\u0027s on the surface) to target the planet and fine tune the phase angle for the transfer window before switching to my interplanetary craft to set up a burn."},{"CreatedByName":"RW-1","CreatedById":107278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T23:44:55Z","Content":"Darn, I just kinda knew it\u0027s location on the continent, and knowing that continent\u0027s relativity to the others was never a problem for me.\n\nFor reentries from either prograde or retrograde orbits, you don\u0027t have to know where KSC is, just your deorbit burn points for what you\u0027re doing, and you\u0027ll get there, and those are not over KSC.
