Launches in other directions will fall somewhere in between. All of the numbers should be in meters, meters/second, or meters/second\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 as appropriate. (That\u0027s the way they are listed in Wiki as well.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Eve, this works out to 11,434 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1 54.6m/s. If you ask people who have done ascent from sea level, they would tell you 11,500m/s, so this is a very good estimate. Of course, you can get to orbit with as little as 8,500m/s if you start from a tall mountain, and that\u0027s what people usually end up doing. (You can use the same exact formula, substituting v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E for appropriate altitude. For highest point on Eve, 6,450m above sea level, v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E is 92.6m/s, so you get 8,476 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1 54.6m/s. You can compute v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E for any height using v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E = v\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E exp(h/(2H)), where v\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E is terminal velocity for sea level, and h is the starting height.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs another point of comparison, for Kerbin, the formula gives 4,265 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1 174.5m/s, and again, this is very close to an absolute minimum you need to establish orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T02:29:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice, K\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E.

So the altitude obeys a differential equation, h\u0027(t) = v\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E exp(h(t)/(2H)). This DE can be solved to obtain h(t) = - 2H ln((2H-v\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003Et)/(2H)). In other words, ascent \u0022to infinity\u0022 takes finite time equal to t = 2H/v\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E. Naturally, this is only true if your TWR diverges to infinity, but even if TWR remains near the optimal value of 2, time to exit atmo is going to be only slightly longer. In vacuum, TWR of 2 gives you acceleration of 2g. So corresponding delta-V is 2gt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this underestimates fuel needed for vertical climb, but it also doesn\u0027t take into account gravity turn. The fact that two compensate is purely empirical at this point, but it might actually be related to how optimal gravity turn should be performed. I\u0027m still working on optimizing the turn, so I can\u0027t say anything for sure yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all in all, very simple formula that is pretty rough but works reasonably well for all of the current planets. The fun part was actually proving that terminal velocity climb is optimal even when atmosphere gets thinner with altitude. I did not honestly expect that outcome. I know everyone has been using this as a rule of thumb, but as far as I know, it\u0027s based on derivation for constant density.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. I do plan to make a larger write-up on everything I learned about effects of atmosphere on launches, landings, and aerobraking, but I still have a few loose ends. Hopefully, I\u0027ll get them sorted soon enough, and it will probably be a link to a PDF in the Science Lab section when it\u0027s done.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-03T04:31:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2013 04:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ninzoris","CreatedById":63506,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T19:53:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is perfect, thank you everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beanspoon","CreatedById":57830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T20:12:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuestion solved, can\u0027t delete.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-28T21:16:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2014 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Beanspoon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beanspoon","CreatedById":57830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T21:15:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease ignore post.
