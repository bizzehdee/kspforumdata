While moving around, the kerbal will pop up to normal height and back down, sometimes even getting the prompt to climb over. It\u0027s not just visual, it slows the Kerbal down and makes it jerk around a bit. For some reason it\u0027s made my rover stand on two wheels and not come down, while bouncing around a bit every once in a while. Anyone seen anything like this?\n\nI do have the following mods installed:\n\nEditor Extensions\n\nKerbal Engineer\n\nHyperEdit\n\nMechJeb\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I cannot recall having this happen to EVAers, but there have been plenty of times when my landing gear somewhat sinks through the ground, necessitating a very gentle landing. I don\u0027t consider this a glitch, I just think of the surface as being very sandy ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAlso, good luck getting that kerbal back to Kerbin, stuck or not ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
