The CoM and CoL are in the right places, there should be enough lift (1 lift rating per 10 tons?) and 4 whiplashes should proved plenty of thrust. But it doesn\u0027t want to pull up until the end of the runway, and when it does it immediately spins out and promptly rips itself apart.

In order for the nose to rise the tail needs to be pushed down. When you push down directly above or too close to the rear landing gear the tail will not drop and the nose will not rise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMove the tail further back and compensate the CoL shift with canards near the nose.
