I tend to design my rockets using the same general approach since I\u0027ve found something that works. My designs seem to work fine with the 1.25m rockets but when I get into the bigger rockets I really have trouble.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I like to launch is to accelerate directly upward to about 100m/s with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on and then do a 5-10 degree eastward pitchover. I then turn the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off and allow gravity to pull me through my gravity turn, adjusting throttle to keep my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E ~1.5. Once I hit about 35,000m I turn the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E back on and pitch over to full horizontal acceleration.\u00A0On some of my 1.25m rockets this works beautifully allows me to fly a smooth gravity turn all the way to 80-100,000 meters altitude and puts me in a nice 0 degree inclination orbit. On my bigger rockets I have problems with persistent yaw and sometimes roll during the portion of the gravity turn when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAttached is an example design I\u0027ve been having trouble with. Basically it starts to yaw at about 10,000m and puts me into a highly inclined orbit unless I leave \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on and fight it all the way to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve confirmed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECOT\u003C/abbr\u003E is midline and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is ahead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E. I\u0027ve tried more fins, less fins, fins\u00A0with and without control surfaces with no apparent affect (though I did notice that when I had control surfaces they seemed to be fighting the engine\u0027s thrust vectoring and it steered better without control surfaces). I\u0027ve tried every conceivable symmetry of fins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first I was having trouble with the rocket \u00A0pointing straight up in flight (basically partway up around 10k meters it swings like a pendulum and starts flying straight up). I\u0027ve never figured out the cause exactly of this problem conceptually but I encounter it commonly with my rocket designs. It seems some how to be like the reverse of flipping. Adding fairings to complex payloads seems to solve it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I was having trouble with the rocket flipping so I changed the fuel prioritization to burn the posterior tanks first followed by the anterior tanks and this was solved.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNonetheless the northward yaw persists and I can\u0027t think of anything else to try to fix it other than scrapping my design. I don\u0027t mind starting over but this seems to come up again and again and I\u0027d really love to understand what is happening here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Iu1xYtPPfIlHRASg4W_OQLw6RDyM7SWo/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScreenshot\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n**Update**\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks all for the many responses. I have done some more extensive testing with very little success so I figured I\u0027d report the results of some experiments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Tried resetting trim. Trim was already zero\u0027d (flying with keyboard not joystick so no dice). Tried trimming out the yaw. Too finicky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Tried removing the side booster\u00A0fins. Tried more fins, bigger fins, w/ and w/o control surfaces. Nothing consistently made a difference. Enough fins would make it fly straight but then it couldn\u0027t be steered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) Adjusted the fairing to cover the knuckle in the fuselage. This got rid of the vertical stability issues (flipping, penduluming) but didn\u0027t fix the yaw/roll problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) Got rid of the asymmetrical fuel lines. This did reduce the torque on the stages.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.) Carefully removed one part at a time to try to figure out where the S0 and S4 torque in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E is coming from. Guess what, it is coming from the engines themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.) Tried gimble locking the bobcat and steering with control surfaces. Steers better in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E but no change to the problems when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7.) Switched to a skipper (in spite of the size mismatch) thinking maybe it was the bobcat. Slight improvement? Not enough to matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8.) Tried stabilizing the side boosters with different configurations of struts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrent thought: could there be inherent torque from the engines and my rocket is just too short thus doesn\u0027t have enough\u00A0of a lever for my fins to counteract the torque? Tried switching to a skipper and adding two additional of the tall 1.875m fuel tanks. And it\u0027s...better. Still yaws to the north and rolls a bit but it can fly all the way to 35km when I reengage my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E while only accumulating a few degrees of inclination. Of course it is way more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E than I need for this payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/13s0ELQVfiSHueNxNCpfNLgXbam36WZen/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECurrent\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdded query - the reason the original was so short is that the bobcat doesn\u0027t have enough thrust to lift more central fuel tanks since it still has a full fuel loadout after the side boosters drop because of the asparagus staging. Is it just not viable as a core stage engine with asparagus staging?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n**Final Update**\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee my reply to OHara below.

This one flies pretty darn straight all things considered.

You and others were right, the side booster fins were causing a significant problem. I couldn\u0027t tell before because it was just one problem among many but as the design got more refined and I solved other problems this became apparent. Basically what I think is happening is that because the rocket is symmetrical in only one dimension rather than two, even the slightest roll induced by connections wiggling or slight aberrations in my initial\u00A0pitchover maneuver is then exaggerated by the aerodynamic forces on the side booster fins since the rocket is no longer exactly aligned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESolution:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERemoved side booster fins.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake Homes:\u00A0Side booster fins = bad.\u00A0Large side boosters = sub-optimal (especially low in atmo without two dimensional symmetry).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.)

A word about fins. I ran many, many, many experiments with different configurations of fins. Basically more fins can somewhat stabilize an otherwise unstable rocket (usually draggy payload, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E toward the rear, or short rocket). However, they come at a cost, not just of weight and $$, but also the more fins you have the more straight the rocket wants to fly which reduces your control authority. The more ways you try to add the control authority back the more places there are for something to induce asymmetrical flight. Similar to the issue with the side fins, once the rocket had fewer issues, the difference of moving them just half a fin length to the rear to overhang the engine was noticeable in flight. When appropriately symmetrical, aerodynamic control surfaces do seem to serve better for my initial pitchover than engine gimbal or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake homes: Fins are a goldilocks problem, you want them to be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ejust right\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESolution:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Four symmetrical delta winglets in the center stage positioned as far to the rear as possible. 45 degrees off from the cardinal directions simply due to the presence of the side boosters in the cardinal directions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) Bobcat does seem to have more asymmetry than the other engines. This doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t serve well, just that my combination of a tenuously stable rocket and my stubborn insistence on not using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E during the initial gravity turn made it not a good fit for this particular rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESolution: Changed to skipper for this rocket, added fuel to the center stage.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you everyone for your insights.
