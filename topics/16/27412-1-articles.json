The effect essentially states that the faster your rocket is moving (i.e. the lower your orbit is) the less delta-v you\u0027ll need to expend to get the same result.

To illustrate this, let\u0027s make up numbers: let\u0027s say it costs 1000 m/s to boost from LKO. If you do that, you\u0027ve expended 1 km/s of your fuel supply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you boost up into a higher orbit, let\u0027s say the delta-v required is 600 m/s, plus the 500 m/s required to boost up into that orbit, which gives us a total of 1.1 km/s burned out of your fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally, I would suggest burning from a lower orbit, so that you can conserve fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can refuel at the higher orbit. Thus, you can essentially replace the 500 m/s you lost getting up there, and then the trip to Duna will only require 600 m/s, so you\u0027ll arrive at Duna with only 600 m/s burned out of your fuel tanks, or a 400 m/s gain over if you had just burned from LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDisclaimer: \u003C/strong\u003EAny numbers in this post are entirely made up, do not take them as real values or even rough estimations.

The difference in delta-V for interplanetary transfers from high orbit vs low orbit is noticeable, but not enormous. The general rule is if you\u0027re going from Kerbin\u0027s surface to a parking orbit to an interplanetary transfer without any docking then that parking orbit should be as low as possible for best efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you already have fuel or a station or something in a high orbit, go ahead and dock there. Just keep in mind there\u0027s no reason currently in KSP for putting a station up high. In reality the atmosphere doesn\u0027t end abruptly, so higher orbits for permanent stations makes sense.

The gist of it is: to minimize overall fuel expenditure (including getting the fuel for your refueling depot into orbit) you should have your station as low as safely possible. To maximize the amount of fuel left in your tanks when you leave Kerbin, you should refuel as high as possible (this is easiest to do at the Mun or Minmus), then dive down to 70 km at just the right time and give a small burn to escape Kerbin. I can\u0027t seem to find the thread in any caches, but if you want to look for it, look for \u0022where should I put my station, I do the math so you don\u0027t have to\u0022, something like that, and my name and you might find it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T06:03:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tend to just attach a drop tank with enough fuel to do that big burn out of kerbins SOI, then drop it as soon as its empty.
