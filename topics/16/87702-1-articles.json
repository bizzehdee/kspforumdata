Am I fooling myself into thinking that the camera worked better in the past before there were \u0022top\u0022 and \u0022bottom\u0022 limits as to how far you can orbit the camera around your craft?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to remember being able to use the mouse to look at my craft from any angle I could possibly imagine, with the camera focused at the control pod of the craft, and this worked very well for me. In the current version though, the camera focuses on the centre of mass and has limits on rotation, which I find weird and uncomfortable. Worse yet, I think kerbals on EVA used to face (camera) forward, which was handy for flying around in space, and now they seem to stay normal to the planet surface, which doesn\u0027t help at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some setting that can give me the old camera behaviour (if I actually remember it right) or a mod that would?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T02:07:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry hitting \u0027v\u0027.

V changes the up/down of your camera angle. When it stays relative to the planet, you have it set to free camera mode. Orbital makes it treat north and south as up and down. Auto switches between those two when you achieve orbit or go suborbital.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T02:27:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo get the Kerbal to face away from the camera (Regardless of camera setting) hit the space bar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
