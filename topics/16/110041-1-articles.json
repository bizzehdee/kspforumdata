This is something I personally did wrong a lot in the beginning. In my mind, going interplanetary was this huge step, and naturally, I thought it would require a huge rocket. But this is not so.\n\nThe rocket equation says that a rocket with 8 tons of fuel and 2 tons of dry mass flies *exactly as far* as a rocket with 800 tons of fuel and 200 tons of dry mass. And as Wanderfound says, Duna requires only about 20% more fuel than the Mun. So you can easily do simple Duna flyby/orbiting missions on all 1.25m parts. In fact, people have done single-launch, Duna landing and return missions on all 1.25m parts before.\n\nOf course, nobody expects amazing feats of rocketry from a beginner, and I too tend to load up my interplanetary missions with instruments and utilities like a passenger train in india is loaded with passengers so I only need to fly one mission ever, but it\u0027s still always a good idea to be on the lookout for situations where you can do the same thing with less mass, less bulk, less size, fewer launches. The dry mass of your mission defines the amount of fuel (and therefore the size of the rocket) that will be required; the more dry mass you can cut out, the smaller your ship will be."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T07:58:00Z","Content":"Another little advice: it is possible to get to Duna with 1k dV, however, on your first trip (and probably no idea about transfer windows), rather count with 2-3k dV. And maybe 1.5k for the return trip.\n\nMy first trips to Duna were horrendously ineffective, the mission needed a rescue which also needed a rescue but it could reuse some parts that I left in orbit, so 3 flights to get there and to bring everyone home again.\n\nTo your engine questions:\n\ngo with an orange tank and a poodle, that should get a small lander to duna and hopefully also back.\n\nGood luck with the mission!"},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:11:04Z","Content":"I\u0027m also an interplanetary noob, but here\u0027s what I did: I started with an orbiter probe, just to get practice for interplanetary transfers. It was just a core, SAS, Power stuff, a bunch of jet fuel, and a nuke. I had two core jet fuel tanks, and 4 jettison-able tanks, and I made it to Duna without even having to get rid of one. Now, since it also has a docking port, it\u0027s sitting in Duna orbit as a refueler. What I would suggest is an Apollo mission, but if you don\u0027t have much practice like me, then send your CSM equivalent(return stage, basically) but with more fuel. Get that in Duna orbit, then send your lander module seperately so you don\u0027t have as much to push with one little nuke(I forgot to say, for me, nukes are the way to go). Then you don\u0027t have to worry about having enough Delta-V in one launch to get there and back, and it simplifies orbital lift stages. What I did, is, I\u0027m planning a rover landing now, and so I got my transfer stage, and rover, descent stage, etc. and bundled it all up in a fairing, and said, \u0022Ok, this is what I need to get into LKO.\u0022 and it made it a lot simpler with guesswork of whether I had enough Delta-V, and it turns out I have more than enough!"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:39:07Z","Content":"Another hint: the Duna journey was wonderfully described by trevize1138 on [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/36jlgp/interplanetary_for_beginners_if_youve_got_a_mun/).\n\nHas some nice \u0022rule of the thumb\u0022 hints for interplanetary transfers."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:56:21Z","Content":"1. You will need a plan and a dV map (like [this](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png), for example). A thorough plan about what you are going to do. For example:\n\na. Transfer from LKO to Duna\u0027s SOI (1100 m/s) - I leave some margin for errors\n\nb. Decide - full powered circularization on LDO (650 m/s) or Aerocapture (ideally 0-100 m/s) but incidents can happen.\n\nc. Ike gravity braking assist (rather difficult)\n\nd. Decide - land or not (landing can be unpowered on parachutes you only need a few m/s for deorbit) and taking off back will cost you ~1100 m/s of dV\n\ne. Visit Ike? (Duna - Ike transfer 580 m/s)\n\nf. Land on Ike? ( Land 390 m/s Take off 390 m/s total 780 m/s)\n\ng. Transfer back to Kerbin ~1100 m/s\n\nf. Circularize on LKO (aerocapture?) or go straight to landing (reentry at 3\u002B km/s)?\n\nNow, sum this all: 1100 \u002B 650 \u002B 100 \u002B 1100 \u002B 580 \u002B 780 \u002B 1100 = 5410 m/s dV (make it 5700-5800 m/s).\n\nNow, grab a Kerbal engineer and make a craft.\n\nDecide about whether you will make a dockable lander or land the whole craft. Both methods have its pros and cons. Your lander should be able to withstand reentry on Duna (and back on Kerbin) and have enough dV for landing assist if necessary (Duna\u0027s atmosphere is very thin so the parachutes might not kill enough speed as you descend) and taking off. The same for Ike (watch the TWR - it should be \u003E1 for taking off from the relative body). Your transfer craft should have enough dV to do 2 interplanetary burns and maneuvering around in the Duna system (transfer from Duna to Ike and back if necessary \u002B possible corrections, plane changes, circularizations etc).\n\nFinally, when you finished with your craft, the rest is easy - build a lifter to get it to LKO and launch.\n\nIf you have a detailed and thorough plan you\u0027re 80% done."},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T15:21:45Z","Content":"And if docking is easy for you: should the whole thing be to heavy to lauch, empty every tank and refill them in orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"p14082003","CreatedById":130955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T17:54:02Z","Content":"Thanks to you all!

Consider sending a probe first before attempting a Kerbal mission.\n\nLike Mun, straight land and return missions are possible. Also, you should have enough tech unlocked by this time to send probes to do the mission before committing to a Kerbal one.\n\nBetter is to send a small fleet of ships. Have one designated for landing and returning to orbit from Duna. Have a second ship that orbits and collects crew and science from the landers. The Landers could then be left as orbiting satellites. A third could be used to land on Ike and intercept the return ship. It wouldn\u0027t have to be manned as an EVA could be used to recover the data. Leave probes behind in orbit or on the surface. Take advantage of aerobraking to save fuel for entering orbit and landing. Use Slingshot maneuvering to get an Ike intercept and orbit.\n\nAnd, as always, while ships are on their way to Duna, you could always be doing contracts, more exploration of Mun and Minmus, and send one way probes to Eve and the Jool system.\n\nWith Mods, things can become much easier. With the Hooligan Lab mod, landing and return from Eve is possible without the need to build a massive lander.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T21:18:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 09:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron**"},{"CreatedByName":"p14082003","CreatedById":130955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T00:11:31Z","Content":"Changing to answered as soon as I make to Duna. alredy have the ship. 4200 dv for transfer stage. i will post a picture soon."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T08:35:13Z","Content":"The first time I went to Duna I sent 2 distinct missions with nearly the same payload mass. \n\nThe first one was a lander for Ike (able to do 1 hop) and the second one was a lander for Duna (no hop).
