If you want to refuel interplanetary ships via kethane, do it at Minmus instead because you burn much less fuel getting the kethane into orbit. But personally, I don\u0027t think all this is worth the trouble. And pillaging all the Mun biomes for their science is best done from a space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut role-playing is fun. You could, for example, set up a main spaceport/base camp on an equatorial kethane field and have numerous other bases scattered about, like at several anomalies (either space tourism or doing imaginary Science!). Then you\u0027d need little hoppers to shuttle Kerbals around between these bases, which you\u0027d refuel either at the base camp or at the remote locations, depending on kethane distribution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T13:24:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually there is, Psykikk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a rover with Materials Bays and Goo Canisters that drives from Biome to Biome and that has the data processed in the Mun-Base which than sends the data back or puts it in a Return-Vehicle to Kerbin \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T13:49:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone did the math and for refuelling purposes, refuelling orbiting Minmus and burning from there is a more efficient way than getting to Eve and Duna. Burning from Minmus orbit to LKO then onwards is more efficient for getting to planets further away, thanks to the increased Oberth effect (takes about 200m/s to burn for LKO, but you\u0027re travelling at about 3km/s by the time you get there, as compared to 2.2km/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut along with that, setting up camp on the Mun and everything is less efficient than all of that.
