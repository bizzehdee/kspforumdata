The latter acts as a multiplier on the former, and the result is science points gained. However, \u0022value\u0022 tends towards 0 with increasing amounts of science points generated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s imagine a hypothetical experiment worth 100 science points if you return it, and worth 20% of that if you transmit it. The transmission is 50 Mits in size, and if you return it once, you \u0022get all the science\u0022 and subsequent returns or transmissions do not give you any extra (there are experiments ingame that you can repeat for extra science even if you got the full amount the first time, but this is not one of them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50 Mits \u0022data\u0022 * some \u0022value\u0022 * 100% \u0022yield\u0022 for returning = 100 science ----\u0026gt; \u0022value\u0022 is 2, for 50 * 2 * 1 = 100. This is what you get for returning the experiment intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, let\u0027s assume that you transmit it instead. You now calculate 50 * 2 * 0.2 = 20 science. And \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E you reset and return it (or you have a second copy that you return).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens is that because you already transmitted some data and got some science, the returned experiment isn\u0027t worth as much anymore. There\u0027s less new stuff for your scientists to learn that they didn\u0027t know about already. In game terms, the \u0022value\u0022 goes down. After your transmission, you can still return the full experiment, but your science yield will be merely: 50 * 1.6 * 1 = 80. The return multiplier is still 100%, but the value multiplier decreased from 2 to 1.6 because it was already partially completed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can easily be seen if you don\u0027t have the experiment just once, but for example five times. And you transmit all of them instead of returning it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EFirst transmission:  50 * 2      * 0.2 = 20, for a total of 20 out of 100 completed\u003Cbr\u003ESecond transmission: 50 * 1.6    * 0.2 = 16, for a total of 36 out of 100 completed\u003Cbr\u003EThird transmission:  50 * 1.28   * 0.2 = 12.8, for a total of 48.8 out of 100 completed\u003Cbr\u003EFourth transmission: 50 * 1.024  * 0.2 = 10.24, for a total of 59.04 of 100 compelted\u003Cbr\u003EFifth transmission:  50 * 0.8192 * 0.2 = 8.192, for a total of 67.232 of 100 completed\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T08:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys.

For repeatable instruments (such as gravimeter) you can measure, transmit, measure again and return the instrument to get the rest of science points. For non-repeatable you can either use lab to clean the instrument for another use or get there again and deliver. Sometimes even delivery does not grant you 100% science though. In such cases it is good idea to take several instruments. Or several command pods to store different copies of the same measurement in them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
