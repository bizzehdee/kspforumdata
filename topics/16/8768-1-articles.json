Ideally, you want your rocket to be parallel to the ground when you exit the atmosphere (around 70000m). However, you want to get out of the thickest part of the atmosphere as fast as possible, so you should go straight up at the beginning of the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are some rule of thumb instructions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Straight up full throttle to 13-15000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Start tipping over approx 20\u00C2\u00B0 East (to the right), because this offers you an extra boost due to the rotation of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- At around 25-30000m, tip over 45\u00C2\u00B0 until 50000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- At 68000m, aim for 90\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Look at the map.
