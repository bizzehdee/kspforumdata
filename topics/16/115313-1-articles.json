I\u0027ve got two recommendations that have helped me immensely in pre-planning for all missions:\n\n1) Know how much Delta-V your craft has. Unfortunately, the stock game doesn\u0027t provide this information. Fortunately, there are a couple of mods that *do* provide this critical information. My preference is [Kerbal Engineer Redux](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230). Download and install.\n\n2) Know how much Delta-V your craft *needs*. [This chart](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96985-1-0-4-WAC-s-Delta-V-Map-continued-OPM-now-included-%28July-4th-2015%29) is what I use for that. I generally take the figures from that chart, figure out the amount of Delta-V I\u0027m going to need in order to get where I\u0027m going, and then increase it by 10% because I\u0027m not an expert pilot by any stretch and assume I\u0027m going to waste some fuel, especially getting into orbit around Kerbin. Don\u0027t forget to also account for Delta-V you\u0027re going to need to get back to Kerbin! (If, in fact, you\u0027re coming back to Kerbin...)\n\nArming yourself with that information should go a long way towards helping solve your \u0022get where you\u0027re going\u0022 problems.\n\nOf course, once you get to the Mun, you still need to land on it intact. Getting used to how the craft needs to be oriented for this can be tricky, so I recommend at least your first landing including a Pilot (if you\u0027re in career mode, at least a 1-Star Pilot), or a probe core that has the \u0022Hold Prograde/Retrograde\u0022 ability. Turning on SAS and Hold Retrograde for the landing helps a *ton*.\n\nLastly, Scott Manley has an excellent\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEkUeJRCh083UT-Lq5ZIKI75\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n series on Youtube. Highly recommended viewing. It helped me get used to KSP again after a very long hiatus, and he does a great job of explaining both concepts and their applications."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T19:54:09Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!\n\nCan you be a bit more descriptive? A picture of your rocket, and/or a description of your piloting strategy, would be helpful (as well as a more specific description of what you mean by \u0022can\u0027t make it\u0022-- i.e. \u0022can\u0027t figure out how to intercept the Mun\u0022, or \u0022get to Mun orbit OK, but run out of fuel while landing\u0022, or whatever).\n\nBroadly speaking, if you\u0027re having trouble accomplishing some goal, it will be one of two things (or perhaps both):\n\n1. an issue with ship design\n\n2. an issue with piloting\n\n...first order of business is to identify which of these is the problem. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"PnDB","CreatedById":134433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T21:54:16Z","Content":"Are you having difficulty landing in general, or just on Mun? If you\u0027re having difficulty landing on Mun and you\u0027ve not landed anywhere else, you might want to practice landing on Minmus. The lower gravity is much more forgiving of errors, giving you more time to understand what types of maneuvers are needed to get on the ground in one piece."},{"CreatedByName":"Neywiny","CreatedById":65808,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T23:16:50Z","Content":"keep in mind the chart for deltaV needed, [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png/600px-KerbinDeltaVMap.png](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png/600px-KerbinDeltaVMap.png), which accounting for user error means you should have over 8k deltaV easy, more skillful players can get there in much less. Honestly I went to the moon on my first go with 3k to get into orbit, 800 to transfer, and a few hundred to land. keeping that in mind, you need a decent amount of deltaV to get there, generally I wait to go the the mun until I get 2.5m parts, or at least the capability to launch such a huge rocket.\n\nPS, this post has been answered to varying degrees by people, so whoever an mark the post as answered, please reconsider it\u0027s status.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T23:21:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Neywiny**"}]}
