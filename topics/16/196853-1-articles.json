I then pitch up and climb at about 20 degrees activating my rocket engines when my whiplash thrust drops below 150 KN and then close the intakes and shutdown around flameout.

Don\u0027t think about it as \u0022getting your apoapsis up to 70km\u0022, think about it as \u0022getting your horizontal velocity up to orbital speeds.\u0022 The most efficient space plane designs will reach orbital velocity well inside the atmosphere. You have wings so use them, let them handle the altitude by creating lift and let your engines focus on your horizontal velocity. In other words, keep your pitch low. You should never be above 10\u00B0 after reaching 15km, preferably below 5\u00B0 but this will require some wing angle of incidence.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most glaring problem with your design is the engine mass. Your plane\u0027s total mass is 27t, and you have 9.6t dedicated to engines. That\u0027s over 1/3rd of your total mass, not even rockets need that much thrust. You could either get rid of engines or carry a lot more fuel and still have plenty of thrust to get to orbit. You\u0027d benefit greatly from some wing incidence, this will allow the plane to have a lower pitch (less drag) but still create enough lift to stay airborne. You also have a lot of extra drag with the solar panels and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E blocks, and the non-inline version of the cockpit is more prone to over heating which requires a less efficient ascent profile. Flawed as it is though, it should still be able to reach orbit if flown correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight profile should look more like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nclimb past 12km and drop pitch below 5\u00B0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\naccelerate up to at least 1400m/s, preferably closer to 1500m/s as you very slowly (no more than 50m/s vertical speed) climb up to around 18km\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nas you approach 1400m/s and your acceleration slows, start the Nervs\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nmaintain a slow, steady climb as you continue to accelerate; as long as you have more thrust than drag you will reach orbit\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nthis is all much easier with trim (alt\u002Bq,w,e,s) than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, unless you have wing incidence, then it\u0027s even easier to just lock surface prograde all the way to orbit\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want a lot more tips like this and more indepth stuff, check out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/mKVI_jewCAc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E tutorial\u003C/a\u003E.
