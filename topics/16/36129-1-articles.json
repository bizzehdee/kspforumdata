Any way I can get a large craft up there to move this roughly 200\u002B ton piece of SCIENCE!, into a safer orbit? I need a good parking orbit that\u0027s over 200 km, yet low enough that its still relatively easy to dock with. Its current ALT is a circular ( ish... APo and PEo are off by about a klick or so) orbit at 198 km. I had it set at first at 200 km, but I tend to Ram/dock, or dock at highish speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYours- ZeeDesertFox\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T17:46:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t knock it out of orbit from that altitude.

In order to accidentally de-orbit the station you\u0027d have to drop below that altitude, so that drag started pulling it down. Even then, at that height the drag is extremely minimal (consider that most real-world orbits are constantly in such conditions). In order for it to be a major problem you\u0027d have to drop below...say 50,000 or so.
