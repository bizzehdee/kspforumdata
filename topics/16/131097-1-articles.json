If your fairing is any significant size compared to your rocket (which it would be in the OP example), that means that you either have to add huge fins at the back to ensure aerodynamic stability, or you are very, very careful to keep to within a degree or two of prograde (literally a degree or two - that 5\u00B0 angle corresponding to the edge of the prograde circle is generally far too far off when at the 16-25 km stage).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, it\u0027s true for all rockets that you need to keep prograde or lose efficiency. The issue with fairings is simply that they make designing a stable rocket virtually impossible.
