Not to mention the \u0027fuel crossfeed capable\u0027 parts are erratic about when they\u0027ll crossfeed and when they won\u0027t, in my experience anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re right about the Converter just being an engine that runs in reverse: It\u0027s set to produce no thrust and to burn negative fuel. In game-engine terms, this means it\u0027s *pulling* negative amounts of fuel from the tanks the fuel flow logic can reach. This results in fuel being ADDED to those tanks, because you\u0027re subtracting a negative (yay math). It also means that the game treats it as if fuel were flowing TO the converter FROM the tank instead of vice versa, so yes, the fuel lines need to point AT the converter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can actually test it by replacing the converter with a normal engine, and doing a static burn test(Use launch clamps, and don\u0027t release them). Any tanks that engine pulls fuel from, the fuel from a converter in that position will reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing a lot of people miss, though: Xenon and Monopropellant are \u0027universally routed\u0027 (there\u0027s no flow logic, it can go everywhere automatically)... and so is Kethane. Your Kethane tanks don\u0027t need to be anywhere *near* your converters. As long as the Kethane tanks are on the same craft as the converters, the converters will be able to get the Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
