I have tons of fuel too like 150 units. So I can burn for quite awhile to do anything I want. I want to try and land and then take off again since it is a Satellite type craft and no Kerbals.

Yes, there are some bugs, but they don\u0027t seem random to me. The main thermal problem I\u0027ve noticed is that cubic and octagonal struts like to overheat and explode for no reason, but if I avoid those parts, I\u0027ve never seen any unexplained thermal explosions since 1.0.4, and that\u0027s with a lot of hours. Certainly I\u0027ve never seen any problems with fuel tanks or Terriers. So if the OP is having a frequent, easily reproducible problem, then there\u0027s likely some specific thing about his game that\u0027s triggering the bug.
