The reason the probes drift is due to how orbital mechanics work at their lowest level. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your goal is to light your station without having the lighting probes docked you would have to have an autopilot hold their position relative to the station...which I\u0027m not sure is possible in kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was just reading about a mod called TTNeverUnload and if it lets(an aspect of the mod that I am unsure of) simultaneous control of multiple craft then you could attempt to have mechjeb running on the probes and keep them in place. I honestly don\u0027t know exactly how you would do it but that may be your best bet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need to ask though why create separate craft to light your station? Instead of having a 7 part lighting probe wouldn\u0027t it just be more cpu efficient to just put lights on the station itself? Most of the lag created by monstrous creations is the amount of physics calculations needed to be done on every part in the area. More parts generally means more lag. I think you may be over complicating a simple solution. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again though I may be misunderstanding..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope I helped!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoup\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T22:34:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is only one theoretically possible way to set up two objects to orbit a body so they stay in constant distance and relative position from each other (in KSP physics). They must be on exactly the same orbit, one a bit ahead of the other. But there\u0027s no way you could do anything like that, over long time spans they will deviate due to minute differences in speed and position. So the only reliable way to light your station is by something that\u0027s part of it. You can for instance build some light poles from modular girder segments with docking port at one end and lights at the other end and dock them with your station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeaving two things in a very close orbit and position is dangerous. When you use time warp, the two objects may by chance overlap each other and when you switch to them and decrease the time warp to x1 they will explode.

Not even theoretically possible. IF, and this is a big if, you mention to set up orbits in a perfect way so that your lighting probes will indeed light the space station, you will have the challenge that spin is not a variable when on rails. And if your probes are not spinning.... They\u0027ll continue to point in one direction, so while your probe might be pointing *toward* your station at one point in orbit, it will seem to be pointing *the other way* half an orbit later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, they need to be in *exactly* the same orbit, just a few seconds ahead or behind. So you\u0027ll have light on a single axis, coming from two opposite directions. Any photographer can tell you it won\u0027t look too good. From the side of that axis? Well now you\u0027re on a higher (or lower) altitude so your probe will drift away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd all that is based on the assumption that you have perfectly matching orbits. Try getting a perfectly circular orbit in the first place (ignore the AP/PE markers racing around like crazy) and you\u0027ll notice that it\u0027s pretty impressive to get them lined up within 500m of each other.
