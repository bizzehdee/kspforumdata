In most situations it is more beneficial to run all your engines at max thrust:\u003Cbr\u003E\n-at launch, you want to minimize the amount of time that you are hovering or not-yet-in-orbit...those contribute to gravity drag.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-at landing(i.e\u00A0Mun) because hovering or \u0022slowly coming to a stop\u0022 costs more fuel\u003Cbr\u003E\n-burn/eject to Jool, because you only have a few minutes of burn time near Kerbin(the Oberth effect\u0027s advantages decay as you get away from a gravity well)\u003Cbr\u003E\n*Note, this disregards mixed Isp engine setups(burning only your nukes might get you further than even though it takes longer...because nukes are super efficient)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nActivate all possible engines simultaneously. Exceptions to this is:\u003Cbr\u003E\n-high isp vacuum engines(poodle, terriers, nuke) have very poor efficiency in low atmosphere, they waste lots of fuel to provide very little thrust below 10km altitude at Kerbin\u003Cbr\u003E\n-when using jet engines, you want to get as much power from them before switching to rocket engines\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you have to down throttle your main engine to less than 80%, your engine is too big. Remember, every ton of extra weight is less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E, and an engine running at 80% is already being 20% dead weight.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnless of course if you are role-playing a real-life space launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-28T08:58:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTest it. \u00A0First launch with only SRBs in first stage, \u00A0main engine secound stage.
