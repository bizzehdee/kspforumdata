I consider this a bug due to the fact that the \u0022overlap\u0022 is often the result of KSP itself rather than an intentional part of the design. If you try making a strut reinforcement along the outer edge of two parts, the strut becomes a \u0022clipped\u0022 object inside the part rather than running along the outer edge. If you attach a fuel cylinder radially to the outside of another it\u0027s often slightly clipped into the first part and you can\u0027t do anything to change this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the one hand, using time warp to stop rotation is a cheat, but on the other hand when the game applies phantom bogus forces to the vessel that aren\u0027t really there and can\u0027t be stopped, the game is sort of cheating against you in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not cheating if the game cheated first and your \u0022cheat\u0022 is just a case of trying to find a workaround to get around the game\u0027s cheating. I feel the same way about using the debug console to escape from stuck situations in Bethesda games which are notorious for having bugs that prevent finishing the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
