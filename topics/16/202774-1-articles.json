I also have a Drilling Lander. I user\\ the lander to harvest ore on Gilly. I then get into orbit and dock with the\u00A0Station. At that point I can transfer the ore\u00A0 from holding tanks on the Lander to holding tanks on the Station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then used a Convert-o-tron 250 on the station to\u00A0produce fuel. When I produced Monopropellant if filled the tanks on both the Lander and Station. I then switched over to [\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELf\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002BOx] and ran until I ran out of Ore. The process put fuel in tanks on both the Lander and Station. I.E. cross\u00A0feeds worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of my tanks were full so I wanted to top of the Lander\u00A0tanks to make another run. At that point I was able to Click on and Pin one of the tanks on the Station and the Click and Pin\u00A0one of the tanks on the Lander. I got the In/Out buttons on both of the tanks and I hit IN on the lander tank and the fuel filled the Lander Tank from the Station Tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far no problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut idiot me had failed to \u0022shutdown\u0022 the Lander engine and I accidently hit the Shift key which fired up the Lander engine. That put the whole\u00A0station start spinning and screwed with orbit. The lucky thing was that I had a save from right after docking and loaded the save, shut down the engine and then I repeated the fuel production I listed above. The issue is\u00A0that now I cannot move fuel from the tanks on the Station from the Lander or back in\u00A0the\u00A0other direction.\u00A0 If I open multiple tanks on the Station OR the Lander I can transfer fuel. If I open the Tanks on one I get the In/Out buttons but if I open a tank on the other part the IN/OUT\u00A0\u00A0buttons disappear. When I produced the monopropellant the second time it again filled both the Station and Lander Tanks. Also producing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELf\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002BOx also put fuel in tanks in both the Lander and Station (none of the tanks were filled completely).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is possible that did not get fuel transferred the first time as I thought I did. I got a little excited when I accidently started the engine and I loaded the save without taking good look at what I had.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have exited the game and reloaded but no change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDouble checked the cross feed settings on all parts between the tanks and all are enabled (also fuel moved to ALL tanks when I converted the ore)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll tanks have a flow priority of (-10) but I have played with the priority and nothing changed/\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did activate\u00A0the engines on both the\u00A0Lander and Station - No change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a Hot key Combo that can screw with the Fuel transfer?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat on earth am I doing wrong - any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jbdenney","CreatedById":201835,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-30T07:34:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk - I found the issue - DUH!
