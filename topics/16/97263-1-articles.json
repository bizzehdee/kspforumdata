Very large ships require very expensive, large diameter liquid rocket launch stages which are expensive and difficult to recover properly.

One RT-10 trashcan costing 325, a decoupler for 200, a solid upper stage for 220 (from RLA Stockalike, but it probably would work with a second RT-10 too), another decoupler for 200.
