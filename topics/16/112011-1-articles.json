My original plan was to have a small lander that travels between Bop\u0027s surface and a larger ship that holds all the ore, and collect ore in several mining sessions."},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T01:14:22Z","Content":"I believe you can do it in multiple sessions. There\u0027s a marker that pops up when you\u0027ve collected 25, 50, and 75% of the necessary ore so it\u0027s tracked at least. I haven\u0027t tested it though."}]}
