But have been struggling with money problems lately.\n\nMy science center requires me to make 3 million, but i can see no other way of making this much atm other than grinding the same mission over and over. \n\nI want to play it legit, so no money cheats or file editing to make stuff cheaper. I turned on the Perks to turn reputation into money to get a little bit extra. But wonder how to proceed.\n\nAnyone has good solid tips on how to make this much, can i complete the same mission over and over from the same satelite for example? \n\nScience is no problem, but money is keeping me from proceeding much further than i currently am\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n-Yuri"},{"CreatedByName":"el_coyoto","CreatedById":49292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T10:18:34Z","Content":"First of all, welcome to the forums Yuriznikov!\n\nI usually kinda \u0022cheat\u0022 the system, and do as you suggest : leaving a sat (equipped with a reusable science instrument, like a thermometer) in orbit of as many bodies as possible, then accept those \u0022gather science from around ...\u0022 contracts and reap the rewards.\n\nYou don\u0027t need to send a new probe to complete these contracts, which lets earn some easy money.\n\nThe same works for these \u0022plant a flag on ...\u0022 contracts : you can leave a poor lonely Kerbal on each body on flag planting duty.\n\nYou can also look for contract asking you to test parts on Kerbin (you can do it on the launchpad) or splashed down (stick a SRB under to part to be tested and head west to the sea), but these won\u0027t really help you reach 3 millions. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nIn late career, I make A LOT of money with the contracts asking you to put a science station in orbit or land a base somewhere. By building small and tight, I can usually earn ~100 000 funds from these.\n\nYou can also \u0022piggyback\u0022 contracts : if you have a contract asking you to drop a base on the Mun and plant a flag, accept both of them and complete them in one mission. You will pay for one launch, but will receive two rewards.\n\nAlso, I found that turning reputation into money didn\u0027t work so well, but I may be mistaken (tried in my career when I had unlocked the tech tree and wasn\u0027t impressed with the result).\n\nGood luck getting those sweet, sweet funds!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T10:21:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 10:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by el\\_coyoto**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T11:04:45Z","Content":"Hi Yuriznikov, the space center buildings can indeed be very expensive. The game as you see it right now is just a short time before its full release, but still a beta. Not everything is tuned properly yet.\n\nOne of the things that are not tuned properly are the administration strategies. The largest part of them is completely worthless, while a select few are game-breaking overpowered. There is not even a proper conversion ratio between the currencies - each strategy just randomly makes up some numbers. They\u0027re probably all just placeholders. Because of that, even though I know you want to play stock, I suggest adding one simple mod: [Sane Strategies](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96230-0-90-Sane-Strategies-0-42-1-Dec-18). It\u0027s just a simple set of config files that makes the administration strategies make sense. Each currency converts into one of the others at fixed rates that are shared across all strategies equally.\n\nWhile that\u0027s unlikely to fix your money problem, it\u0027ll at least ensure you\u0027re getting a fair deal no matter which strategy you like running with. Then it might even be worth to convert science into funds, too - after all, you\u0027re trying to upgrade the science facility, and until you do, accumulating more science is not going to get you anywhere. And there is a lot of science in this game. You can in fact complete the entire tech tree without going to any of the other planets, even if you never gain any science from contracts. There is absolutely no chance you can run out of science, so convert away!\n\nTo earn more money from contracts, el\\_coyoto has the basic tips down: try accepting contracts that go to the same places and complete them together. Try to improve your rocket construction, so that you can achieve the same missions with cheaper, smaller rockets. In my last playthrough, I made most of my cash with satellite launch missions using rockets that cost less than 3000 funds on the pad. And that\u0027s with satellites that actually had capabilities (I was using a mod that involves setting up commsats). For stock, you can probably get away with less still.\n\nExcept for one thing:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The same works for these \u0022plant a flag on ...\u0022 contracts : you can leave a poor lonely Kerbal on each body on flag planting duty.\n\nThis doesn\u0027t work. The game will not generate any new flag planting contracts for bodies with Kerbals on them, or in vessels landed on them. (Or that might be patched in with the next version... I forget. But it\u0027s definitely a thing that\u0027s happening or has already happened. Just don\u0027t get into the habit of distributing Kerbals everywhere.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T11:07:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 11:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"el_coyoto","CreatedById":49292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T11:14:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This doesn\u0027t work.

This is not the same as the \u0022piggyback\u0022 contracts that El Coyoto mentioned, but a bit more devious:\n\n- Combining a surface base contract with a space station contract. Make sure your contraption meets *both* requirements. Then for instance, your contractual Mun base can *first* fulfill a \u0022put a space station in Kerbin orbit\u0022 contract, before you send it of to Mun\n- Combining multiple \u0022put a satellite in a specific orbit\u0022 contract. Again, check at the launch pad that you fulfill all requirements (some contracts require a goo container or materials bay), determine a wise order (increasing semi-major axis and/or inclination for instance, watch out for retrograde orbit contracts)\n\nAlso, and you may already know this, read your contracts carefully: space station and surface base contracts only require *space* for x Kerbals. You don\u0027t have to put them actually on board.

There\u0027s testing 25 parts in a single mission. That\u0027s absolutely fine. And then there\u0027s delivering a satellite in a certain orbit, and *then* moving that satellite to a different orbit to cash in on that contract. Same thing with recycling the same craft to cash in on a mission to orbit a station around Kerbin, then around Mun, and then land it as surface base on Mun.\n\nTo use the Fedex analogy: they\u0027d deliver a laptop to the front door of your house. Then they pick it up, (after succesfully delivering it and getting paid for it) and deliver the same laptop at *my* house. Would you be happy with that? Would you consider that cheating by Fedex? I would. \n\nYou\u0027d have to assume that someone wants a space station of surface base and do things with it; not that they\u0027re paying you to see if you\u0027re able to put it there and then don\u0027t care that you pick it up. The missions where you have to put something in orbit should have a mechanism in place (removing the craft from the game, specially marked parts, whatever) to prevent this from happening and it doesn\u0027t.
