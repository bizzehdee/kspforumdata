I\u0027ve been playing Career Mode and have been to the Mun and Minmus and gathered almost all Science there (few spots not visited). Placed satalites in orbit and saved some Kerbals along the way. \n\nSo my question is: What do I do now to get the most efficienty out of my game. Do I build a spacestation? Or do I visit Duna and its moon Ike, if so do I send a satalite first to gather all the science from outer space with scans or just a manned mission?\n\nThanks in advance for your answer.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T16:55:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 04:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Delta\\_scientist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T15:14:42Z","Content":"Attempt an eve impactor probe/lander probe (you do not want to land kerbals here)\n\nOr put a rover on gilly and attempt to circumnavigate it"},{"CreatedByName":"Delta_scientist","CreatedById":145713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T15:23:06Z","Content":"So you say I should go to Eve (and/or Gilly) before attempting to go to Duna?"},{"CreatedByName":"Enkiel","CreatedById":145063,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T15:24:26Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty much at that point as well.\n\nObvious goal from the quests (errr, mission) seems to go to Duna, or start building station. I think either are a fine challenge, and by that point, you should definately have all the research you need to complete both."},{"CreatedByName":"RandomRyan","CreatedById":142844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T15:28:28Z","Content":"do the station first. if you wanna spacecraft that can go interplanetary,ya need to refuel.\n\nchoose Duna or Ike or Eve (WARNING: landing on Eve is a one way trip. gravity there make it impossible to leave)\n\ni prefer to go to gilly and Eve.do Low and High orbit science stuff to get more science.(dont transmit it(if you want less science in your bucket))\n\noh yeah gilly. Low n\u0027 High orbit science and land.(use RCS cause the gravity is so low there)\n\nFun fact about gilly.

Neither is doing things in a logical order.

If you can send a kerballed flight to the Mun or Minmus, you should be able to build something with enough delta-V to get to Duna or Eve.\n\nBuilding a space station means mastering rendezvous and docking which are good skills to have for planning more elaborate missions!"},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T16:18:50Z","Content":"If you have not completed the tech tree in total, I might suggest sending up an orbital station with an MPL, and a ground research station each on the surface of Mun and Minmus. Filling each with data should be relatively simple - the orbital station can collect from LKO, HKO, then high munar orbit. On Mun or Minmus, data from a single biome is more than enough to fill the data stores. After that, transferring to another system will net you a rather large chunk of science in the background.\n\nAlso, setting up a large orbital base around Minmus with supporting ground mining operations can be helpful. Due to the low gravity, it\u0027s a choice spot for assembling and fueling large interplanetary ventures. The cost savings from sending up only partially fueled vessels adds up fairly quickly. Also, good practice for setting up similar operations on Gilly, Ike, and beyond."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T19:01:29Z","Content":"You can get an awful lot of science from: \n\nA probe that just peeks out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI and comes right back, recovering science \u0022high above the sun.\u0022 \n\nOr dropping parachuted probes to transmit science from the surfaces of Eve and Duna. The nice thing about these missions is that the atmosphere and chutes do the braking for you, eliminating the need for expending much dV at the destination."}]}
