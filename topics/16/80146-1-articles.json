I\u0027ve attached the struts in different places, removed them from the tops of the boosters, I\u0027ve attached nose cones to the boosters, I\u0027ve tried different boosters.

For some reason, they eject with a rotational impulse, like they apply the ejection force from the bottom, just a moment before disconnecting from the top, or something like that. Strut placement sometimes helps, but not always. I haven\u0027t seen it with the TT-70s as much, but it looks like you are. I\u0027ve usually just used sepratrons to overpower it and fling them away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have a clear understanding of why this happens in some of these cases, and just haven\u0027t taken the time to experiment with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do change the decoupler type, you\u0027ll probably want the smallest ones, the TT-38K models, not the hydraulics, since in my experience the hydraulics exhibit this problem the worst.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and if you add sepratrons, be sure to angle them so the exhaust doesn\u0027t fire right into the fuel tanks.
