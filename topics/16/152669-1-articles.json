I\u0027ll explain:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m in career mode. I have R\u0026amp;D as far as \u0022advanced rocketry\u0022. I took on a contract - showing up in the Mission Control\u00A0archives as completed - to \u0022Haul RE-15 \u0022Skipper\u0022 into orbit of Kerbin. I did this. I did however, recover the craft forgetting to take a crew report. No biggie except I got no science for the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I have an active\u00A0contract to \u0022test 48-7S \u0022Spark\u0022 liquid fuel engine in flight\u0022. Inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E currently, in my \u0022engines\u0022 panel, this 48-7S Spark is shown, but in a green-shaded box. If I try to use it, it tells me \u0022contains untested experimental parts\u0022 and won\u0027t let me to launch. However - and here\u0027s the weird bit - despite having completed an earlier contract with the \u0022Skipper\u0022 engine, this engine no longer appears anywhere, and is not available. Furthermore, it is now a part of \u0022Heavy Rocketry\u0022 inside R\u0026amp;D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is so confusing! I\u0027ve completed a contract with an engine that I now no longer have, and have accepted a contract to test an engine, and which is available to select, but I am not allowed out of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-27T19:14:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure why you can\u0027t test the spark - are you trying to fit it to the skipper powered rocket?\u00A0 If so that is why you are having a problem.\u00A0 The game lets you test parts above your current tech level.\u00A0 This part will be available to you until you actually test it.\u00A0 Once you have tested it it reverts back to it\u0027s tech node and won\u0027t be available until you unlock the node or get another test part contract.\u00A0 Hope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxL_1023","CreatedById":152317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-27T19:14:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese part test contracts often involve a part from a node one tech level more advanced that what you have researched. When you accept it, you are allowed to use the part until you complete the contract. Basically, you got an \u0022experimental\u0022 version. When you complete the contract, you lose that part until you research it normally.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should be allowed to use the spark if you have accepted a contract to test it - the green box means that it is experimental.
