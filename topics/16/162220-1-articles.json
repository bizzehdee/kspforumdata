The problem is I can only get a Jool encounter by using an assist that would send me crashing to the ground on Kerbin, and any correction burn costs too much Delta V. How would I fix this and send my kerbals too Jool without using all my fuel for a correction burn?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-17T21:39:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSet your last Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to 70km, and then do a small pure-retrograde burn right at the Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E.
