The problem with rolling and pitching up is that unless you put your wings straight vertical you will start to climb.

For a coordinated descending turn, you would simply roll to the desired bank, use pitch for the sink rate, and just a hair of rudder to keep the nose pointed with the velocity vector. The plane will change direction on it\u0027s own. Trying to use the rudder to control the climb rate will induce crabbing/ slipping, which makes for a sloppy turn, excessive drag, and weird roll response.\n\nUnless you\u0027re doing aerobatic maneuvers, active rudders really aren\u0027t necessary in KSP (especially the ridiculously overpowered ones available).\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T13:35:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 01:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T15:29:12Z","Content":"I always use Control Surfaces, but maybe adding an inline reaction wheel could help.
