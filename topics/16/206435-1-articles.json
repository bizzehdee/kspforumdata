I know the button for this is supposed to be the \u0060 button but this one is not working, though, I am on linux, so it might be different. Either way, I remember rebinding the key for it to something that is easyer to remember and worked on an older install, so I am assuming there is a setting to do that. But I can\u0027t find this under the \u0022input\u0022 settings, I kinda expected it to be under \u0022vessel\u0022, and I checked like, every other input settings menu but I can\u0027t find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo.. where is the option? does it have a different name?
