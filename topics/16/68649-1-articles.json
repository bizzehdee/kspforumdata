Getting within a few Km leaves enough distance for the orbits of the two crafts to be different enough, and orbital mechanics then bring to increase distance again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would start with a good rendezvous. First, making sure the two orbits are in the same plane (inclination difference = 0), then changing altitude of the peri/apoapsis of the maneuvering ship so to match the altitude of the other ship at the same location, and in the end finely changing the other apside altitude so to achieve the closest possible distance at intercept. It is quite possible (without any help from mods) to achieve minimum intercept distance of 200-300 metres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen approaching the intercept point, I prepare to match speed with the target, therefore orient the ship towards the relative speed minus marker (Navball set on Target mode). It may help to set a node at the intercept point so to burn in the direction needed to have the two orbits match, so the blue marker of the node is giving the correct orientation and Delta-V required much sooner than the relative speed marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the intercept point, cancel almost entirely the speed difference (burn towards the relative speed marker until the relative speed goes close to 0). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce stable in the same orbit (relative speed 0), point towards the target and close at a slow speed. Once close enough (around 200 mt.) you can target the docking port, and then you need to bring your ship on the axis coming out of that port. The target ship must not rotate. There are different styles for approaching the axis to the docking port, one is to rotate your ship parallel to the axis and use only traslation to move towards the axis, another is to move the ship to a point along that axis, stop it there and then rotate it towards the docking port. In both cases, you should now be at some distance from the docking port, aligned with its axis and pointing the port. The navball (in Target mode) provides relative speed markers and you need to bring them aligned with the purple marker (target), translation mode is essential now. Close slowly, keeping relative speed aligned with the target (while your ship must remain on the axis). Apply retroburn just enough to have a very slow speed at contact (0.1 - 0.2 mt/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: it is useful to me to change the camera to \u0022chase\u0022 mode and align it with the ship, while docking.

Since then when I try it with \u0022real\u0022 craft with fuel sloshing everywhere, solar panels at all angles, Kerbals wiggling about etc, it\u0027s been much harder. I\u0027d agree with the suggestion to try using special \u0022practice craft\u0022.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t have perfect RCS alignment then add in reaction wheels. This will counter balance any rotational forces that result in lopsided RCS placement. The most obvious example is station building using a tug. So, a decent amount of reaction wheels are good to have when you are learning to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T02:31:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Extreme fast rendezvous and docking (100% Stock) \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zhy18eKcvys?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T11:00:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirine\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirine\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Extreme fast rendezvous and docking (100% Stock) \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can improve this docking by having a high apoapsis on your first craft. Your second will catchup within minutes and you can match the target orbit by burning between prograde and radial out. Also, when you are slowing down, push your target retrograde into the target anti-direction. It\u0027s more efficient and faster than trying to match orbital velocities before you are inside RCS range. If you are trying adjust your approach direction without changing your approach speed then burn halfway between target retrograde and target pro-direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you follow these techniques you can get a dock after about 1/4 the 1/3 the orbit. Or, about 30min after first lift-off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
