But imagine the situation where the orbiter\u0027s engines are parallel to the SRBs and not pitched - in this situation, the TWR of the orbiter alone is very high, and the ET/SRB assembly very low, because the SRBs are bearing their own fuel mass plus the mass of the ET. The effect of launching like this would be for the whole assembly to rapidly pitch down (from the orbiter\u0027s orientation) and crash. So, the orbiter\u0027s thrust vector is angled off parallel, toward the CoM, until the vertical thrust contribution of both sides is balanced, resulting in launch without rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you watch a video of a shuttle take-off, you\u0027ll notice that it\u0027s movement at launch \u003Cem\u003Eisn\u0027t vertical\u003C/em\u003E.

This is because of a slight imbalance of horizontal thrust \u0027y axis\u0027 thrust caused by the angle of the orbiter ascent engines. However, acceleration in this direction is slight compared with vertical acceleration, its resisted by aerodynamic forces (lift AND drag), and since the shuttle rolls 90 degrees shortly after launch and then makes a dorsal-down gravity turn, this is insignificant. It\u0027s also \u003Cem\u003Enecessary\u003C/em\u003E to avoid the staging of the SRBs causing an immediate tumble, since net velocity has to be just right at this point to transition to the orbiter engines alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you know what\u0027s going on on something like the A-10 Warthog that looks as if the centre of thrust is above the centre of mass?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know for sure, but if I had to guess I\u0027d say the reverse situation.

But imagine the situation where the orbiter\u0027s engines are parallel to the SRBs and not pitched - in this situation, the TWR of the orbiter alone is very high, and the ET/SRB assembly very low, because the SRBs are bearing their own fuel mass plus the mass of the ET. The effect of launching like this would be for the whole assembly to rapidly pitch down (from the orbiter\u0027s orientation) and crash. So, the orbiter\u0027s thrust vector is angled off parallel, toward the CoM, until the vertical thrust contribution of both sides is balanced, resulting in launch without rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you watch a video of a shuttle take-off, you\u0027ll notice that it\u0027s movement at launch \u003Cem\u003Eisn\u0027t vertical\u003C/em\u003E. The whole craft actually moves \u003Cem\u003Elaterally\u003C/em\u003E in a ventral direction for some time. This is because of a slight imbalance of horizontal thrust \u0027y axis\u0027 thrust caused by the angle of the orbiter ascent engines. However, acceleration in this direction is slight compared with vertical acceleration, its resisted by aerodynamic forces (lift AND drag), and since the shuttle rolls 90 degrees shortly after launch and then makes a dorsal-down gravity turn, this is insignificant. It\u0027s also \u003Cem\u003Enecessary\u003C/em\u003E to avoid the staging of the SRBs causing an immediate tumble, since net velocity has to be just right at this point to transition to the orbiter engines alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realise now, in my previous post, I was being an idiot and talking nonsense about vectors and moments, the solution\u0027s actually a lot simpler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key thing I think I wasn\u0027t taking into account, was that the fuel tank/booster assembly is MUCH heavier than the shuttle itself (I\u0027ve just looked it up, and I make it about 17x heavier). Which means that the thrust of the boosters is much closer to the centre of mass (the fulcrum), which means that even though the shuttle\u0027s engines are weaker than the boosters combined (I think?), they\u0027re probably orders of magnitude further away from the centre of mass, meaning the turning moment will be that much stronger. I\u0027d just assumed that the booster engines were a lot stronger and that the centre of mass was closer to the mid point, and such that the tendency would be to flip over backwards, in which case angling the engines in that way would be totally counterproductive. But actually the problem is the opposite - that the shuttle engines are giving it a tendency to tip over forwards, in which case the tilt makes perfect sense. I think this also is just a way of rephrasing what you\u0027ve said, though. And yeah, the ventral movement would make sense\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, your eyes shouldn\u0027t glaze over when you see the word \u0027moments\u0027 - it\u0027s actually a really simple concept (if I\u0027m remembering my high school physics right): it\u0027s basically just a way of calculating how much something\u0027s going to rotate - and it\u0027s done by multiplying the force applied (I.e. how hard you\u0027re pushing down on the lever) by the distance the force is applied from the centre of mass (i.e. how long your crowbar is). And if you\u0027ve got something that\u0027s having different forces try to rotate it in opposite directions (like the space shuttle with it\u0027s two sources of thrust), you can just calculate the moment produced by each of them, and if one\u0027s bigger it tells you what direction it\u0027s going to turn in, and how fast it\u0027ll accelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was just pointlessly overcomplicating it and confusing myself when I started trying to talk about vectors though.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-27T03:47:45Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2015 03:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by baldamundo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"surge","CreatedById":136150,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T03:08:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehmm, maybe not. you know there are several buttons to display centre of mass, thrust and lift, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeft bottom in assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s nothing wrong with you talking about moments.
