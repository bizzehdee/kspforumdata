My landing stage had too small of a fuel tank (an FL-T200, with an LV-909), considering that I had tons of science gear aboard. The landing used up about 1/3 of my fuel, and I considered myself screwed. After giving the ship the name \u0022Mun Base A\u0022, I started using it to complete contracts (flag and Science). As I did not want to transmit all my science, I eventually quicksaved, and took off in the general direction of Kerbin. (I landed in the Farside Crater). I reverted to quicksave several times to get an optimally fuel-efficient ascent profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is where I goofed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a not-so-optimal launch, I wanted to revert to quicksave to try again. But no! My brain decides that pressing Quicksave right now was a good idea. I realize my error and attempt to revert to quicksave ASAP. After loading up my botched launch mid-flight, I settled for \u0022attempting to escape the Mun and getting into a Kerbin orbit\u0022 . I burned for escape, and when the map showed my Kerbin orbit, I set up a maneuver node to lower my periapsis into the atmosphere. From here on I timewarped, happily watching the node coundown tick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first indication of trouble came when I slowed down timewarp to grab some \u0022high above Kerbin\u0022 science. When I tried to resume my previous rate of warp, the game told me I cannot warp faster than \u0027x\u0027 while below \u0027x\u0027 meters. (I didn\u0027t remember the exact values). Woah, so I am THIS close to Kerbin already? I looked at Kerbin in the distance. Nope. I went into Map View, and was shocked. My ship was in a high parabolic tragectory over the Mun and about to crash. I went into \u0022Emergency Landing Mode\u0022 in an attempt to save Bill and some science. But alas, the ship crashed, and ~300 science was lost.

If you\u0027re in orbit around the central body and your orbit does not cross the orbit of a moon or planet also orbiting the central body, then the map will not show you any encounters, even though you might have some. So like both you an Mun are orbiting Kerbin. When you burn to leave Mun, you must have done so in such a way that once you escaped, the Ap for your orbit around Kerbin must have been inside Mun\u0027s orbit. Thus, your orbit and Mun\u0027s didn\u0027t cross, so the game won\u0027t show you any Mun encounters ahead of time, but will give them to you if they happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
