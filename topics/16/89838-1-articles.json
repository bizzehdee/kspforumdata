That\u0027s probably fine if you thought you were at, say, 1000m. But if you\u0027re coming down on a plateau at 4500m you\u0027re probably going too fast to benefit from a 400m warning unless you have a huge TWA or you\u0027re being particularly profligate with fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I started using KER I would check radar altimeter in IVA until the meter started moving (3000m).

What you do there is get you a rover and stick a lander can on it, one that the Kerbal can climb in and out of easily enough. Drive to the east (ocean) end of the runway, go off the end and get off of the raised area. Plant a flag. Get the Kerbal back in. Drive off the other (land-ward) end of the runway and get off of the raised area. Plant a flag. Drive inland another kilometer. Plant a flag. Drive another four kilometers inland. Plant a flag. Drive another five kilometers inland. Plant a flag. Plant flags at five kilometer intervals for as long as you like. If you label each flag with the distance to the end of the runway (i.e. 0 km, 1 km, 5 km, 10 km, 15 km, etc.), you can use the whole system as an ILS - the flags themselves will help you with alignment, while the names of the flags will give you your glide slope (take the distance \u003Cstrong\u003Eto\u003C/strong\u003E the flag plus the distance \u003Cstrong\u003Eindicated by\u003C/strong\u003E the flag, times 100 meters, plus 100 meters - and that\u0027s about where you want your altimeter. For example, if you\u0027re 10.4 kilometers to the fifteen kilometer flag, you want your altimeter to read 2,640 m ((10.4\u002B15)*100)\u002B100 = 2640). If you\u0027re higher than that by 100 meters or so, you\u0027re too high; lower than that, you\u0027re too low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf flags don\u0027t work for you, you can also use an automated rover with drop probes.
