I\u0027ve looked around a bunch of places, but I cannot find out where anything tells me the lift rating of my craft, or the component wings of its construction. I\u0027ve tried right clicking the wings for additional info (nothing), right clicking them after construction (allows me to change wing strength/mass, but no showing of lift rating), I\u0027ve looked in my FAR and KER menus and can\u0027t seem to locate anything...so, can anyone help me out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent mod list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Joint Reinforcement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 Aerospace (with Firespitter 0.90 compatibility fix)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking Port Alignment\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-14T13:45:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2015 01:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kmacku\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EQuestion answered!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T04:17:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lift rating\u0022, as an actual part-by-part statistic, is only relevant in stock aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll want to learn to use the FAR aerodynamic analysis tools; that\u0027s beyond me, so try reading up on the FAR thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kmacku","CreatedById":134528,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T13:44:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DeMatt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DeMatt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022Lift rating\u0022, as an actual part-by-part statistic, is only relevant in stock aerodynamics.\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll want to learn to use the FAR aerodynamic analysis tools; that\u0027s beyond me, so try reading up on the FAR thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, thank you.

In general, Delta Wings and Wing Connector A/Bs both have a lift rating of 2. You want your total lift rating (the sum of the lift ratings of all lift-generating parts) to equal or exceed the mass of your craft (for example, a pair of delta wings is sufficient for a 4-tonne craft; a pair of wing connectors with delta wings attached to the end is sufficient for an 8-tonne craft and so on and so forth).
