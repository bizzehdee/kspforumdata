All logic tells me that this shouldn\u0027t be happening, or well.. it should, but not remotely at the rate that it is. Here\u0027s the issue:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m using Kerbal Health as a \u0022life support\u0022 type of mod. Even with the power drains cut in half in the .cfg\u0027s it\u0027s still utterly insane and I should probably cut them down to more like 1/10th. My station is currently powered by six mod solar panels from BDB that are similar to the large stock ones, but smaller and slightly weaker. I rotate my station to point the panels at the sun at 100% exposure. As I orbit Kerbin I expect that my panels will stay at that same exposure, as my ship should not rotate in its orbit - there is no force acting on it making it rotate. Eventually, after enough time passes Kerbin will move far enough in it\u0027s orbit that I\u0027ll slowly need to adjust my orientation, but that should only require something like half to three quarters of a degree a day.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m finding though is that when I time warp I stay around 100% exposure, then drop behind Kerbin.. and when I come back to the day side I\u0027m only at ~80%.. go back around to night, and on day side I\u0027m at 50%.. then 20%.. With each \u0022sunrise\u0022 I\u0027ve somehow rotated ~20-30 degrees for no apparent reason, causing my solar panels to fail to recharge my batteries I go back to the night side, causing my life support systems to fail.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, am I right in assuming that this is not supposed to happen? Thankfully the simple solution of just putting more batteries and panels facing in the other two directions as well takes care of the issue.. but this uber-fast complete 360 rotation in a day thing is breaking the part of my brain that thinks about physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-15T10:05:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I don\u0027t know what causes it or how to fix it, there may be a potential workaround for you if your station uses solar panels that can rotate on their mounts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote the direction your station is rotating in, then position it so that the axis is the same as that of your solar panels.

The problem is not rotation, it is the complete lack thereof.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring timewarp ALL rotation is halted in ANY frame of reference. You can clearly see this as you look at your station while it is orbiting around Kerbin. It always faces the same way.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut what you\u0027re forgetting is that Kerbin is also rotating around the sun. Every day Kerbin progresses a few degrees in its own orbit and your station \u0027inherits\u0027 this movement. As a result the sun is in a slightly different position every day. Over time this will be enough to rotate your solar panels out of alignment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolution: As \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002298962\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Streetwind\u003C/a\u003E suggested, place rotating solar panels on the Z axis in order for them to track the sun.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-15T10:50:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58254-tex_nl/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002258254\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58254-tex_nl/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Tex_NL\u003C/a\u003E I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it. if you read his post carefully, you\u0027ll see he reports rotation of \u0026gt;20 degrees for a single Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-15T17:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I know that over long periods of time I should slowly drift out of alignment as Kerbin orbits. It should only be something like 360/ (days in a kerbal year) degrees per day though. Since Kerbin takes well over 400 days (450 something maybe?) I should be seeing less than a degree per day of alignment loss. Instead I\u0027m seeing 20\u002B degrees every time I go around Kerbin. It seems the problem gets worse the higher the timewarp gets too, if I keep it at a lower time warp I only see a couple degrees per orbit. That\u0027s still an order of magnitude more rotation than I should see though, as an orbit only takes less than an hour (1/6 of a day, so I should see (360/(days in kerbal year))/6) at my altitude.\u00A0If I use the higher time warps granted by the Better Time Warp mod (which lets you warp faster near bodies) it gets absolutely insane.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI like that solution though Streetwind.
