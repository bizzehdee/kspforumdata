Then, once the struts all break, you just toss that decoupler.\n\nBut it\u0027s better - if you can - to strut from the throwaway stuff to your ship like FancyMouse suggests."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T06:19:09Z","Content":"Another (highly useful) option is to get Kerbal Inventory System and Kerbal Attachment System. Not only can you manually remove struts from a ship once no longer needed AND put them on a sip headed back to Kerbin for reuse, but KAS comes with some struts you can add in flight to lash a composite spacecraft together."},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T06:24:28Z","Content":"I have mobs of mods, but I THINK it\u0027s stock that an EVAing engineer can \u0022scrap\u0022 any part that doesnt have a child part.

I had an engineer on board and I quickly tried to use her to remove struts and couldnt get it to work....I dont know if I\u0027m doing it wrong or if its not an option.\n\nSo far I\u0027ve been playing on stock KSP (I\u0027m new to the game and figure I\u0027ll get what I can out of the vanilla version), but I\u0027m about ready to start with some mods (already had a couple Eve and Duna Missions, about to send a craft to Bop so feel I\u0027ve gone far enough with stock), so I\u0027ll keep KIS/KAS and Infernal robotics in mind."}]}
