If you\u0027re a few degrees out (e.g. Woomera or some of the other US launch sites) then you can probably launch east then do a dogleg to fix the inclination, but otherwise your options are either a) launch to the inclination of your launch site\u0027s latitude and with the same LAN as the Moon and do your transfer burn at the relative ascending/descending node, or b) launch into a polar orbit and do the transfer burn when the Moon is in the right position; in both cases you\u0027ll get two windows of a few hours where the transfer is straightforward per month, so timing matters a lot more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re struggling to launch to orbit consistently, you should use MechJeb\u0027s Primer Vector Guidance mode in ascent guidance.
