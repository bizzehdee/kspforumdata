Swapping out large tanks and heavy engines on docking ports means they won\u0027t have any struts to connect them to each other. That means low structural integrity and a TON of wobble when burning.

Don\u0027t forget you can attach engines on the core as well, behind the payload - so every number of engines, from 1 to 35 (5x7) is possible without clipping (needs the arms a bit longer than pocket I-beams).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS/IR are handy with designs like this too, by the way. Mine has fuel-lines from the \u0027core\u0027 to the out-riggers but that makes it tricky to use with drop-tanks. You can put as many as you like in the centre, of course, but that makes for some very long payloads. Using 2-riggers with lines IN to the core and the other 2 OUT to the riggers means you can have 2 engine stacks and 2 fuel stacks, without disturbing the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIR is great for unfolding things from inside fairings, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: My fuel and engine modules tend to be \u0027smart\u0027 too - here is the last of a set of twin-nukes docking with the tractor pictured above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Gslp9Md\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Gslp9Mdl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Gslp9Mdl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-17T20:58:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2014 08:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T22:13:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pecan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pecan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh yes - \u003Cem\u003Esomeone\u003C/em\u003E even gave me an array of 7 LV-Ns in a large adapter ^^.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe careful, I have it on fairly good authority that the array in question has a nasty exhaust leak and a tendency to explode.

It might be cheaper to launch it in a less modular configuration, to save on probe cores, docking ports and RCS systems. I\u0027ve been working on a Jool-5 entry that has a single stage, reusable mothership that carries its payload near the center of mass, but I\u0027m not sure whether it will be cheaper to save some fuel by dropping tanks and docking new ones upon return to Kerbin. After all, the new tanks will have to be launched anyway to get the propellant up there in the first place...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the mothership with the Jool-5 mission package.

A lot of modular components are about to get tested on an E asteroid capture and a planned Eve mission. If those are successful, then we\u0027ll move onto using a refined version \u0022cross spar\u0022 section to mount larger engine pods.

Overall, though, I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027ll need to use that configuration since my missions tend to be substantially leaner than a lot of designs I see here, so I try to keep mass down and launch smaller rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T23:32:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThinking about the modular designs that Pecan and LethalDose have shared, it might be a good idea to have a \u0022parking\u0022 station for storing modules awaiting retasking in LKO.
