Even as an avid mechjeb user, I think you shouldn\u0027t be doing that kind of stuff at first. Watch tutorials, experiment, explore, do stuff on your own. Doing things on your own at first is one hell of an experience, and understanding how to get to the Mun on your own will help you a lot when you want to rendezvous with a station or another planetary body. My suggestion? Just do it yourself until you know what mechjeb is doing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to the Mun is pretty simple anyway. Just place a maneuver node on your orbit (equatorial and circular) and drag the prograde marker until it reaches the Mun\u0027s orbit. Then simply drag the node itself along your orbit until you intercept the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also go old school and start burning as soon as you see the Mun on the horizon.

Once in the Muns SOI, under maneuver planner change your periapsis to something like 20km 0s from now. Then under maneuver planner circularize orbit at the next periapsis. Once in orbit around the Mun under Landing Guidance, select pick target on map, and after selecting click Land at Target. You will want to pick a spot at least 1/2 an orbit ahead of your current position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf already in orbit around the Mun just do the above starting at Landing Guidance\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T15:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, for a bit more detail on ye olde low-tech way to do it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Get into a circular equatorial orbit of Kerbin. 70km is the minimum altitude, but it doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re at 100km or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Point the ship prograde and wait for Munrise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* When you see the Mun, start burning at full throttle and keep doing it until you get a Mun encounter (visible in the map screen).

There\u0027s no atmosphere to worry about, but keep your periapsis above 8km unless you feel like orbiting into the side of a mountain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Descend and land.

One thing which wasn\u0027t well-explained is that, by default, MechJeb will transfer you straight at the target, which is useful for rendezvous, but not useful for lunar injection, because your target orbit will send you plummeting straight for the center of the Mun. You will need to edit the maneuver node: a low-velocity, later burn will get you an efficient cis-lunar insertion, while an earlier, more powerful burn will get you a trans-lunar insertion. A special case of trans-lunar insertion is the free-return trajectory, which will send you on a figure-8 around the Mun and back into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere; the first Apollo missions did this, so that if the Service Module\u0027s engine didn\u0027t ignite, it would simply return to Earth. It also makes a wonderfully efficient lunar flyby trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of whether or not you use Mechjeb to set up the initial transfer, I would still recommend playing with the maneuver node to see what effects various modifications to the burn have on your trajectory, and try to figure out why those happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Antuas","CreatedById":129343,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T20:44:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I\u0027ve encounter a new problem.
