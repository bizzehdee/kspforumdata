They can be a bit fiddly to use. The main thing to know is that it really matters what the root part is, since that\u0027s the only point at which the subassembly can be attached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo let\u0027s say you\u0027ve built a rocket body that you want to be able to use as a standard booster for various payloads. What you do is, make sure that the part at the very top summit of the rocket (likely a fuel tank or decoupler) is the root part. You can use the re-root tool to make it so, if it\u0027s not already. Then you can drag it to the subassembly tab to save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T14:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen is the shift-click supported?
