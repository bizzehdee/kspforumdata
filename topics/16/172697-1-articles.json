They both performed equally well, and it had it\u0027s advantages and disadvantages. The single fuselage was very aerodynamic, and cut through the soup pretty well. I used a four-stage design to dump mass as often as possible and take advantage of higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E engines as the air got thinner. The disadvantage of it is that it\u0027s a single stack; so it starts to get very tall. You need a good truss system under it to land it safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe multi-stack design was short and squat, and therefore easy to land. You can put as many engines as you want and dump them in any manner you see fit. The biggest drawback is that it has more surface area and is not as aerodynamic as a single-fuselage, so doesn\u0027t cut through the atmosphere quite as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth designs can work and are a lot of fun. If you\u0027re in the testing and design phase, you might wanna try both. As always, much will depend on your payload. How many Kerbals, if you have a service module, making a direct ascent return or refueling in Eve orbit; all the usual stuff. No matter what, the feeling of accomplishment when you\u0027re successful is unmatched by anything else in the stock game.
