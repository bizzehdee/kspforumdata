Getting to space doesn\u0027t take much more than that. Two things in addition you need to keep in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to get as fast and as high as possible with only using jet-engines (or the air-breathing mode of the rapier). That\u0027s with shock-cones is about 1200 m/s on like 18000 meters. Too few boosters and you won\u0027t reach that, too many and you\u0027ll burn up. One possible ascent profile that works for a balanced configuration is to pitch up enough to constantly climb but not accelerate above ~320 m/s until you reach 8-9000 meters. Than you can level the flight (adjust Angle of Attack, AoA to 5-10\u00B0) to gain speed. Once you stop accelerating, fire the rocket engine(s), and pitch up carefully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second thing to keep in mind (in addition what\u0027s in the above post) is that when you burn all the fuel, the CoM will shift - most likely back, as that\u0027s where one generally likes to put engines. You need to build the plane so that the CoM doesn\u0027t move when switching full and empty tanks in the VAB. Or if it moves, it shouldn\u0027t crawl behind the CoL, or you\u0027ll have trouble in re-entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also helps to give the wings a tiny bit of incidence once you finished the balancing.

frustrating road of spaceplanes, you need to know what you\u0027re getting into. \u00A0The main thing is, spaceplanes are a huge timesink to design, test, redesign, test, tweak, and then ultimately use. \u00A0The bigger (and thus more useful)\u00A0the spaceplane, the more difficult all this is. \u00A0And for all this effort, pretty much all you get is an alternative, slower method of getting stuff to orbit. \u00A0Now, spaceplanes are cool as a general concept and look spiffy, but understand this is what you\u0027re in for. \u00A0Some folks totally groove on this and do nothing else. \u00A0Others get so frustrated that they give up before getting to orbit once. \u00A0Most folks are somewhere in between, and have a few small-medium spaceplanes they use once in a while on special occasions or for a change of pace, but primarily fly rockets. \u00A0It all depends on where your attraction to the coolness factor becomes outweighed by your frustration and the time consumed with it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, ye have been warned. \u00A0Now, on with the show.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as general rules go, start with your desired payload as its mass pretty much determines everything else. \u00A0Keep it small to start with as smaller is easier, but have something more than just 1 joy-riding Kerbal. \u00A0After all, you want something that\u0027s actually useful after all the effort. \u00A0Besides, 1-seaters are so light that you really don\u0027t learn much about the various design compromises while building them, so you waste most of your effort.\u00A0 So use a Mk2 cockpit and for payload either a small Mk2 cargo bay and a tiny probe, or (for a bit more challenge) a passenger module and an airlock. \u00A0That way, you\u0027ll end up with either a probe launcher or a station crew rotation/tourism\u00A0vehicle, both of which have some practical value. \u00A0Anyway, you build the rest of the spaceplane around this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, the main thing to understand is that\u00A0spaceplanes are all about fuel consumption. \u00A0You design them around the necessary fuel starting with landing and then working backwards through de-orbiting, doing whatever the job is in orbit like docking with something, then getting to orbit, and finally the takeoff and initial climb. \u00A0All but the takeoff and initial climb\u00A0require\u00A0rockets (and RCS if you want to dock) so as an initial step, you build the payload and put enough rocket engine and fuel aboard it to give the necessary dV for all the rocket-needing parts of the flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how much rocket fuel do you need? \u00A0Well, jet engines are hardwired to konk out at about 23-24km altitude. \u00A0At that altitude, a small-but-still-useful spaceplane of this size will probably be moving about 1200-1300m/s when this happens. \u00A0Because orbital velocity is about 2500m/s, this means you need about 1500m/s on the rockets just to make up the difference, plus some more because you\u0027ll lose some to drag and gravity before you clear the atmosphere. \u00A0So call that about 1800-2000m/s (you can decrease this a bit as you get better at flying the things) to get to orbit. \u00A0Then, if you\u0027re going to dock with something that\u0027s not too high above Kerbin, you\u0027ll need about 200m/s more. \u00A0If you refuel at the station, then that\u0027s all you need. \u00A0De-orbiting to a safe descent profile will cost about 200m/s as well. \u00A0So, a probe-launcher would need about 2000-2200m/s dV on the rocket, a non-refueling station bus would need 2200-2400m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe actual amount of fuel (as in units in tanks) as opposed to how much energy (dV) you get out of it depends on rocket engine you use. \u00A0There are a number of options there but for a spaceplane of this size, you don\u0027t need anything huge. \u00A0Look for something with a good atmospheric Isp that will give you a TWR of about\u00A01.0 at the minimum (you can get by with less but that\u0027s a good place to start). \u00A0Also, you\u0027ll need some mod like Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb to give you a reading on how much dV you have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, so that\u0027s the rocket part. \u00A0Now you need the jet part and the wings. \u00A0If you use the RAPIER engine for the rocket part, then you already have the jet engines aboard. \u00A0Jet engines don\u0027t need nearly as much fuel as the rockets because their Isp is huge. \u00A01 smallish tank per engine will certainly do you, and you want to burn nearly all of it on ascent so you don\u0027t add any more weight (and thus lower the dV) that the rocket has to get to orbit. \u00A0You really don\u0027t need much if any jet fuel to land, just glide down. \u00A0In any case, again try starting with a TWR of say\u00A01.5\u00A0with full tanks (again, you can get by with less with a bit of practice). \u00A0The more thrust you have, the less wing you need and vice versa, however. \u00A0The jets also need some air intakes but not many. \u00A0At present, jet engines just run out of thrust before they run out of air. \u00A0And that\u0027s pretty much it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will usually find that, unless your spaceplane is severely underpowered or excessively draggy, you won\u0027t have many problems getting to 23km and 1300m/s or so. \u00A0It\u0027s getting to orbit at all after that, not to mention still\u00A0having\u00A0enough rocket fuel left over to do something useful and de-orbit later, that causes the most problems. \u00A0A lot of this is learning to fly the correct ascent profile---do this wrong and even a design that really can do its intended job won\u0027t make it to orbit. \u00A0But that\u0027s a subject for another lesson. \u00A0And then, assuming all this goes well, you have to survive reentry, which again is learning how to fly the proper trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few final tips that will make your life a lot easier:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDisable the gimbal on the jet engines. \u00A0Leaving it on causes more problems than it solves\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor rudders, use vertically oriented control surfaces attached to the wingtips. \u00A0This prevents the rudders from creating unwanted roll.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLimit all control surfaces to 1 or 2 axes. \u00A0Rudders should only be in yaw, canards should only be in pitch. \u00A0Elevons can do both pitch and roll, or you can have separate ailerons and rear elevators.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCreate an action group that toggles the jet and rocket engines (or switches modes of the RAPIER), and also toggles the air intakes open and closed. \u00A0That way, you can do all these things on all the parts at once with a single touch of a button.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse RCS Build Aid from the get-go to make sure your spaceplane\u0027s CoM doesn\u0027t change much if at all as fuel burns. \u00A0This minimizes trim changes throughout the flight. \u00A0Once you\u0027ve got all the other parts aboard, then use it again to balance your RCS thrusters (assuming you need to dock).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T13:28:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually,
