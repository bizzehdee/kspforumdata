Transmitting results always results in a fairly steep penalty, unless it is a crew report. I believe this is to heavily encourage either multiple transmissions, multiple repeat tests, or returning the unit itself back to Kerbin safely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T20:14:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDifferent experiments have different transmit percentages. This is to represent the difference between, say, getting a Duna rock back to kerbin for analysis, and sending pictures of a Duna rock so the scientists can look at them. That said, if you transmit enough, you will eventually get all the science points that experiment can return, though it takes a lot of transmission to get all the science from an experiment with 20% transmission efficiency, almost 50 transmissions IIRC. The exact figures are somewhere on the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T20:25:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no best spot.
