It would make sense to have a simple lander with power, a drill an ore tank and enough fuel to achieve orbit and rendezvous with your IRSU in orbit and convert the fuel there. \n\nAm i correct?"},{"CreatedByName":"aleis","CreatedById":62823,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T20:34:39Z","Content":"Since ore and fuel are essentially equal in volume it doesn\u0027t matter where you convert it in terms of dv, as long as your not flying the refinery up and down. \n\nOn that note many people find it easier to dock in space than try precise landings."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T20:36:20Z","Content":"Theoretically, yes. However, some people will use the IRSU to fuel their lander, because the logistics are easier that way. If your IRSU is in orbit, you have to give the lander enough fuel to land, return to orbit, and dock. Having the IRSU also makes it so that you can have smaller fuel tanks on the lander, since you can create fuel on the spot.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T20:40:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 08:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reddeyfish**"},{"CreatedByName":"Monthar","CreatedById":117764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T20:39:18Z","Content":"All you have to do is land near the refinery and have a ground vehicle that can transport the fuel between the refinery and ship that needs fuel. The Kerbal Attachment System mod helps with this. With a fuel truck you don\u0027t even need to be close enough for KAS\u0027s fuel lines to reach."},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T21:04:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Since ore and fuel are essentially equal in volume it doesn\u0027t matter where you convert it in terms of dv, as long as your not flying the refinery up and down. \n\u003E On that note many people find it easier to dock in space than try precise landings.\n\nNot Volume, but Mass ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nOn that note, that seems like an oversite?
