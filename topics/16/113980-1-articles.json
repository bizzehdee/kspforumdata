Got my Munar Landers (rovers) landing, and observing the shadow was very helpful in estimating how far to the ground.\n\nThen I unlocked more parts, began getting my designs more complex and the game began lagging. I cranked graphics way down, and it\u0027s better, but now the shadows appear only a meter or two above the surface. I want the rest of gfx parameters down but the shadow to show up way, way early - which parameter changes that?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T10:36:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Trexation","CreatedById":146846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T13:31:02Z","Content":"When I turned \u0022Shadow Cascades\u0022 up to 64 I could see the shadow at around 600m above the surface of the moon.
