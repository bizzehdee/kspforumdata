The reason is that due to different gravity your rover\u0027s ground clearance is actually different between worlds. On Kerbin a rover might be of a certain height, but then you test and confirm a standing craft can dock with this rover on Kerbin and you fly it to the Mun you will end up realising that the same rover sits higher on Mun since its suspension is not as pressed down compared to conditions on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ve seen people do instead is having the base all sitting on large landing legs with docking ports at same height - this is relative easy to test on Kerbin as landing legs are not affected by gravity. Then for moving around they have a very flat rover with a docking port facing up that can drive under the base module and dock with it once the module retracts it\u0027s landing legs and sit itself on the rover. The rover then drives the module around on the surface, place it where it needs to go and the module extends its legs again and lift both itself and the rover off the ground. The rover can then undock itself, drop down onto the ground and drive off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T15:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was just posting about this in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/27668-Tricks-hints-and-important-lessons/page2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eanother thread\u003C/a\u003E, but in short, test everything on Kerbin.

I\u0027m making a more successful attempt with the base parts on wheels connecting with docking ports strategy. I would recommend coming up with a consistent way of making your base parts so that they all have the same, well..., base. I\u0027m using parts from the Kosmos space station mod with rover wheels attached and, with the help of the sub-assembly saver, I can use that same assembly (truss, wheels, docking port, 4-way) on all my base parts. I imagine something similar could be created with stock parts as well. To ensure the thing actually docks I did two things. One was to let the first part of the base free-wheel to the lowest local point with the hope that it will be a fairly flat place and second I placed 4 of the Place-Anywhere RCS thrusters around the docking port of the bit of the base that was going to \u0022dock\u0022. Once I had manoeuvred the second part into place it was just a case of giving a few bursts of RCS for the ports to lock. I\u0027m also trying to make sure my base parts have a similar mass so they will sit similarly on the rover wheels.

The magnetic attraction will be able to over come very small vertical misalignments when you bump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the rover I used for base construction:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://105.imagebam.com/download/zNrugESwB8hT1r_7MJNWlQ/25688/256876907/screenshot73.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot73.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the result:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://103.imagebam.com/download/svngRtP0ACK6_u5m-reuJQ/25709/257086330/screenshot124.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot124.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
