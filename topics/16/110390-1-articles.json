Launch, docked to nuclear tug, fly to Mun, land, mine, suborbital jump, KAS connect to main Mun base for resource refuel, launch and dock with tug, on to Minmus and another landing. \n\nSuddenly then reloading the game the bay want to blow up, reloading the game does not solve this. \n\nContent is some TAC life support equipment, 1.25 meter and an 1.25 meter probe on top, 4 RTG, an KAS wich and an mechjeb module on the tac stack. Nothing touches the bay walls or roof. \n\nThe TAC stack weight 8 ton so the weight might be an issue, however my minmus base who was next to this has the same in its bay except the RTG was replaced with 4x 150 liter monoprop tanks. \n\nI thought the problem was that the bay was open, then I closed it it stopped shaking, however I was also playing with unbreakable joints, in orbit the bay can be open. \n\n[![Pt2NWEP.png](http://i.imgur.com/Pt2NWEP.png)](http://imgur.com/Pt2NWEP)\n\nPretty standard design, the heatshields are for Jool aerobraking, tug has lots of probes on it so can not enter engine first.\n\nIn short is it any solutions except not using it? Looks like its impossible to test for problems, the 3 stacks are well strutted together."},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T17:52:55Z","Content":"Hmm. My only problems with the service bay have come when I\u0027ve stuck objects close to the doors - inside or out of the bay. Hard to see the service bay layout in your picture - but it seems like there\u0027s one object on the right side that might be the culprit?"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T18:12:44Z","Content":"Nothing touches doors, I checked that in VAB. \n\nHowever more weirdness from kraken.\n\n[![1LXvi7n.png](http://i.imgur.com/1LXvi7n.png)](http://imgur.com/1LXvi7n)\n\nFirst an explosion. \n\n[![5odDwy0.png](http://i.imgur.com/5odDwy0.png)](http://imgur.com/5odDwy0)\n\nit was an docking port.\n\n[![tPzRh5C.png](http://i.imgur.com/tPzRh5C.png)](http://imgur.com/tPzRh5C)\n\nThe 1.25 meter docking port on the back of this droptank has suddenly become an seperator. \n\nYes it makes lots of sense. \n\nThis is an repeat of an previous situation, in an earlier game it hit the hitchhiker module on the rear stack and destroyed it. In that game I had not docked the base too the large tug."}]}
