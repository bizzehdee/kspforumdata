You really want to start with the 1-man lander can, add some droppable tanks, and go from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, since you managed to get the heavy lander all the way to the Mun anyway, you must be doing something right. And if you insist on using it, you can do but you really need to have the stage before it get you to the Mun. You could feasibly use the heavy lander to circularise in LMO, land and return to orbit again, but only just.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to use stock craft, however, use the Kerbal X instead. It is vastly overpowered but it has more than enough delta-v to get up to orbit, to the Mun and land. You might not be able to get back to Kerbin though - a really inefficient launch and landing could feasibly leave you a bit short of fuel. Basically, you should be well more than halfway through your burn to the Mun before you switch to the final stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2) Transfer from Low Kerbin Orbit (LKO) to Low Munar Orbit (LMO):\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou definitely don\u0027t want to hit the Mun straight from LKO. The way most people do it is select the Mun as target, then rotate the camera so that the Mun is just peeking over the eastern (prograde) horizon on Kerbin, and drop a maneuvre node at the first point on your orbit on a line between the camera and the Mun. When you draw that node out to Mun orbit, it should give a reasonable encounter. Definition of a \u0022good encounter\u0022 is that your Ap (with respect to Kerbin) should be just short of or at the Mun\u0027s own orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you can\u0027t see your Ap once you have an encounter, then that means that you need to zoom out a little and look from above, to check that you\u0027re not overshooting. If you don\u0027t get an encounter now, don\u0027t try and make Ap any higher but rather drag the node around until you hit the Mun. Keep your burn at an absolute minimum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as you have got an encounter, stay zoomed out so you can see everything and drag that node back and forth along the orbit some more. What you want to see is an intercept where the Munar \u0022Pe\u0022 is just behind (i.e to the right, looking from Kerbin) the shadowy Mun image (which is the Mun\u0027s position when you reach that periapsis). Your path afterwards should shoot off to the left. Ideally, you\u0027d want that Pe to be somewhere around 20-40km, but you\u0027ll probably need to add a bit more prograde to your burn to get that. Your final burn should be in the 850 m/s range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow burn. Warp to the encounter (but warp slowly, about 100x max, when actually crossing the boundary to avoid errors), and as soon as you\u0027re in the Mun\u0027s SOI plot a circularising maneuvre. That should cost you about 250 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3) Landing on the Mun:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever you want to do it, the most efficient landing profile is always the shallowest, but it is also hard to be safe while coming in shallow. You basically want to burn on the dark side of the Mun to bring your Pe down so that it just grazes the surface in the sunlight. At this point you have two options, neither of which is absolutely optimal for fuel but each of which gives you some room for error (but not the same kind of error):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 1: constant altitude burn (reduces the risk of running vertically into the ground, generally due to insufficient thrust): plot a node that brings Pe down until the line is broken by something on the surface, then back up a bit to give yourself about 2000m extra room. Burn that node. Just before you get to Pe, start burning retrograde and watch your climb/dive rate at the top of the screen. As you reach Pe it should be level and may show a slight rate of climb until you slow down, then it will start to fall significantly. You basically want to keep it at a gentle dive as you kill your speed. On your main view, check that you don\u0027t seem to be making a controlled flight into terrain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 2: suicide burn (reduces the risk of running sideways into something): plot the same node as before, but as soon as the line is broken by something on the surface, drop Pe a bit more (edit: actually quite a lot more, to be sure of avoiding terrain) so that you have a clear line running into the ground. Then at that exact point, plot a second node and drag the retrograde marker until it \u0022reverses\u0022 itself. Basically that means a dead stop. Burn the first node (the one that brings the Pe down to the surface) and delete it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour second node should now give you the burn time you need to come to a dead stop, and the time until you get there. Drag that node back up your path for either (a) if living dangerously, 3/4 of that burn time, or (b) if wanting to be safe, slightly more than that burn time. Now, press F5. Rather than actually following the burn marker, simply point retrograde (using SAS retrograde if you have it) and burn at the instant you reach the node. If you chose option (a) you should come to a dead stop a handful of metres above the surface. If you chose option (b), you should be several hundred metres higher. If you hit the ground anyway, press and hold F9 and start burning a little earlier next time...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhatever option you choose, keep in mind that the surface is NOT perfectly synched with the orbit lines. Your orbit may look to lie above the surface, but it might not be the case in reality. If you have a very high TWR (like the Kerbal X has) you can limit the danger of hitting the ground unexpectedly by giving a significantly steeper incoming angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EFinal phase of landing\u003C/u\u003E: The final stage is hard for beginners. You basically want to follow the retrograde marker up until it is at the zenith. Remember that burning towards retrograde will always \u0022push\u0022 the marker around on the NavBall, so if it drifts off the zenith, aim to the other side to bring it back. \u0022Retrograde hold\u0022 on SAS is a great help here, meaning you can concentrate on your speed instead.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou want to land at a fairly low speed. 3-4 m/s is ideal. 7 m/s is a hard-ish landing. 10 m/s can break things.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, you don\u0027t want to fall from 1000m at 5 m/s - it will guzzle fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn daylight, you can see how far you are off the ground by your ship\u0027s shadow. As long as the shadow is tiny and far off, let yourself fall. Watch your velocity, and as the speed rises do a couple of short burns to check how quickly you can slow down. As the shadow gets bigger and closer, prepare to slow more. Try to leave off the throttle until as late as you dare. Again, F5/F9 may be your friend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you need to pick your landing site visually (to avoid slopes) you need to be able to control the ship as it appears on the screen. For this purpose, I always roll the ship so that the brown area forms a crescent at the \u003Cu\u003Etop\u003C/u\u003E of the navball. In this position, with the camera (normal auto setting) following above and behind the ship, left and right work as expected, and climb/dive are reversed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

In the original Super-Heavy Lander, it was needed for the huge number of very effective RCS boosters. In yours, you\u0027ve got Vernors doing a lot of the work.

fuel.\u00A0 The main thing is:\u00A0 do your braking horizontally at low altitude where possible, and don\u0027t spend lots of time \u0022hovering\u0022 (or descending super slowly, which amounts to the same thing)-- that eats up lots of

nozzles) are very effective, and are implying that the \u0022Vernors\u0022 are less so.\u00A0 In the design screen, it says the Vernors have thrust power of \u002212\u0022, and the quad has \u00221\u0022, is there something I am missing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, sorry I wasn\u0027t as clear as I meant to be. And you\u0027re not missing anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I meant about the Vernors doing most of the \u0022work\u0022 is that they all fire together, but the Vernors will provide most of the thrust while the RCS boosters will help with rotation by being higher up. Since the Vernors are providing a lot of control thrust, you shouldn\u0027t need to fire RCS much. The monoprop-fuelled RCS boosters will therefore help for stability, but won\u0027t actually be on for long. Therefore they won\u0027t need much monoprop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe original super-heavy lander, on the other hand, is peppered with those single RCS nozzles (each with a power of 2, compared to 1 for each direction for the 4-way boosters). This was what I meant by the original\u0027s \u0022very effective\u0022 RCS: it has a ton of nozzles (at least 4 for each direction, I think), spaced out around the centre of mass of the ship whichever way you look at it. Its RCS system is therefore very effective despite the substantial mass of the lander. I certainly never put that much RCS control on my builds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giygus","CreatedById":159017,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T16:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, so after failing at even getting my redesigned setup into orbit in my free time on Saturday, I decided to give Vanamonde\u0027s guide a shot.\u00A0 Worked pretty well, so kudos on a well thought out guide.\u00A0 I almost ran out of fuel on the return trip, but still made it back safe with a bit to spare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill try and take what I can learn from the launch vessel and return ship and see what I can do with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least I am learning from my mistakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222431719\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133004\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456542670\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/27/2016 at 10:11 PM, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/116376-how-to-get-to-the-moons-with-an-example-sandbox-rocket-that-can-do-it/\u0022\u003EI made an illustrated guide with example ship you can download. \u003C/a\u003EIt might be helpful.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir_Robert","CreatedById":158111,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T20:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222433610\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133004\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456676795\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022159017\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Giygus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Giygus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, so after failing at even getting my redesigned setup into orbit in my free time on Saturday, I decided to give Vanamonde\u0027s guide a shot.\u00A0 Worked pretty well, so kudos on a well thought out guide.\u00A0 I almost ran out of fuel on the return trip, but still made it back safe with a bit to spare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill try and take what I can learn from the launch vessel and return ship and see what I can do with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAt least I am learning from my mistakes.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the spirit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for getting back: I\u0027m not sure if you know or if you were just very low on fuel when trying, but it\u0027s actually extremely cheap to return from the Mun (and Minmus).
