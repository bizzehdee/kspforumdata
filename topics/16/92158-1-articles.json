For example, The SpaceY R5:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith H2 and O2, it can lift itself plus a cyrogenic procedural tank with ~1.9ML of H2 and ~650kL of O2.

For that extra minute of burn time, do I lose a lot of delta-V to counteract gravity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the real Saturn V used a Kerosene/O2 first stage.

This is not very important for first stages: whereas upper stages have to be made as light as possible to reduce mass further down the chain, the first stage can be as heavy as it wants, so long as it gets the same payload to the same place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2: LH2 tanks are \u003Cem\u003Eenormous\u003C/em\u003E due to LH2\u0027s low density. This poses structural/aerodynamic problems. Using RP-1 on the first stage lets you shrink the volume quite a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3: Many LH2/LOX engines are tweaked for upper-stage performance, having high specific impulse, but poor sea-level performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4: LH2/LOX is expensive. Probably mostly due to giant fuel tanks, as propellant itself is usually very cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou usually use LH2/LOX for upper ascent stages for three reasons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1: That wonderful, wonderful 450s Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2: That wonderful, wonderful 450s Isp. It bore repeating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3: A lighter upper stage means a lighter lower stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: There\u0027s also the \u0022long-duration mission\u0022 case. Liquid hydrogen and oxygen are both cryogenic propellants, and are subject to boiling off. LH2 boils off so rapidly that it\u0027s really not useful past a quick Mun mission without active refrigeration, and RP-1/LOX will probably have issues for anything outside Kerbin\u0027s SoI. This is where the storable, often hypergolic propellants like Aerozine50/NTO and MMH/NTO come into play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT #2: To more directly address your specific problem: you\u0027re cramming way, way too much into a single stage. Typical first stages are probably going to range from 3-4 km/s of delta-V: the examples you have suffer mightily from diminishing returns. The more frequently you stage, the more frequently you dump off empty fuel tanks and unnecessary engine mass. For ascent, there\u0027s also the benefit that your TWR needs go down as you get further through ascent. The primary reason not to stage is that you need mass for staging equipment and your new set of engines: plus, in stock KSP, decouplers are ridiculously expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-07T04:01:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2014 04:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"westamastaflash","CreatedById":110546,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T04:35:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo more directly address your specific problem: you\u0027re cramming way, way too much into a single stage.

Those aren\u0027t real rockets, mine tend to follow what you said there, with about 3-4km/s of delta-v in the first stage. I was just trying to find a way to compare engines with the two fuel types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been messing with this some more. Once I get into trying to launch 50t, 100t, 150t payloads, the LH2 tanks definitely get *huge*. Cost definitely becomes a factor for the huge payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the stockalike configs, LH2/LOX at sea level still has a better ISP and *the same* thrust as RP-1/LOX. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main advantage seems, as you said, reduced tank size and cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with the stockalike configs, the engines seem to be under-thrusted, as a 3.75/42m tank (like the falcon 9) can\u0027t even lift off with the KW Griffon XX\u0027s configuration for RP-1/LOX.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess that\u0027s OK given that 6.4x kerbin is smaller and easier to launch from..\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-07T04:38:20Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2014 04:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by westamastaflash\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T05:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStarman4308 answered this ably, but I want to add a bit of real life context.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider the Saturn IB launch vehicle. Kerolox first stage, S-IVB (hydrolox) upper stage. About 450 tons for the S-IB stage with 8 H-1b engines, 120 for the S-IVB stage with a single J-2. And yet the upper stage cost 50% more than the much heavier, eight-engined, 8x-the-thrust lower stage. And that\u0027s the J-2, which was not a high-performance hydrolox engine (well, high-performance in that they got an impressive TWR out of it, but it\u0027s still a gas-generator engine). You look at something like the SSME, with its 363/451s Isp (due to a chamber pressure of over 200 atmospheres!) and that thing cost a bloody fortune.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, of course, hydrolox is dangerous to work with. The reason you get good performance out of it is that it burns hot and fast, so gnu help you if the stage cooks off.
