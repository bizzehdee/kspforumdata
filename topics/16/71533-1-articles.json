I\u0027ve read many such questions and I think I understand what needs to be done in order to make a proper gravity turn. For some reason, I am unable to make my current rocket fly in a stable manner. The center of lift is far below the center of mass. I use fins in the back and procedural fairings for the payload. I adjusted the TWR to different values ranging from 1.1 to 2.0, and I start my gravity turn (5 degrees) over once I hit about 100m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is that as soon as I launch my rocket, it starts leaning in a certain direction (not the 90 degree direction). To correct it (even with fine controls) I try and steer it the other way; inevitably the rocket overshoots, which starts a death wobble. I tried using SAS, no SAS, extra reaction wheels, balancing the payload (it seems balanced when I check the center of mass in the VAB), fins or no fins..nothing seems to work in the way people are saying a gravity turn using FAR should work. The rocket requires constant adjustments in flight, which only increase the wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think I should do? Is there something I am missing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T08:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found that the lighter your rockets are, the more straight up you need to go with FAR before starting any gravity turn. This way there will be less atmosphere inducing drag on the vessel so that it would tip over. Once you are high enough in the atmosphere, you can lean over quite far and not lose control. Oh, and I don\u0027t usually use any control surfaces because I don\u0027t need them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T08:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout a picture of the rocket (including payload) there\u0027s not much we can do to help you. What it sounds like is happening is that you\u0027ve got some imbalance starting (perhaps the rocket is flexing or fuel isn\u0027t draining symmetrically) and that\u0027s messing things up. If it\u0027s going off course as soon as you launch (right after it goes off the pad when velocity is very low) then it\u0027s not FAR, since aerodynamic forces will be very small compared to thrust and gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vigelius","CreatedById":109045,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T13:21:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESound familiar?:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the standard advice says rockets fly best if they are weighted like a dart - shift the CoM as high as possible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the rocket lifts off ok, but then makes a concerted effort to arc over towards the ground, in a random direction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- masses of SAS can bully a small rocket into obedience, but big ones start bending.

Fins at the back won\u0027t help because it\u0027s like holding a big bendy stick with a lump on top, from the bottom end - hold on as tight as you like, it still won\u0027t go where you point it. Usually I find it actually helps to drop the CoM back down again - it only needs to be a little above the CoL to be stable. Failing that, a few control surfaces above the CoM might help but starts to smell of over-engineering.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linkxsc","CreatedById":67350,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T16:37:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds to me like a bit of a wobbling problem.

If you guys think this is the case, how can I be sure that the payload is truly balanced? Sometimes it is a bit hard to tell with the VAB CoM indicator.

And trying to use an RCS tank to balance it is a bad idea, it\u0027ll always be off by a bit. The trick when balancing payloads is to remove anything from the payload that is definitely balanced, including symmetry-attached parts and anything that isn\u0027t needed to keep the parts that need balancing together. Then balance that, then add all the other parts back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust double up on the Goo.
