You could use chutes to land on Duna for almost nothing, but that will probably balance out\u00A0when launching a fully loaded fuel shuttle back to orbit. Wings could also be utilized on Duna (if done right), but that would have to be planned for in the design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIke would be your best bet. I\u0027ve had a refueling base there for a long time. I don\u0027t use it much anymore, but it worked great when I did. Ike is so easy to encounter (and just as easy to escape back to Duna), that it works about as well for operations in Duna\u0027s orbit as its own.

This is for when you want a station around Duna, for refuel mission from and to Duna. The best is a mining outpost on Duna, with a little tug transfering the fuel between the outpost and the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also land the mining outpost without the little tug on Duna, so your missions to Duna could refuel at Duna itself without having to dock to the station, however, your mission will be limited to one spot on Duna this way.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe math behind this:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe delta-v required after capture at the Duna system to landing on Ike -\u0026gt; orbit Duna = 250m/s\u00A0-\u0026gt; capture \u002B circulation on\u00A0Ike = 210 m/s -\u0026gt; land on Ike = 390m/s\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0total cost = 850m/s (for the ore module)\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe delta-v required after capture at the Duna system to circulation of Duna really depends, without a heatshield, it would be 230\u002B360=590m/s, however, with aerobraking you can reduce those to 100m/s or less.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe delta-v required for a landed tug on Ike to the spacestation -\u0026gt; orbit Ike = 390m/s -\u0026gt;\u00A0escape Ike = 210m/s -\u0026gt; match orbit with spacestation \u002B/- 360m/s\u00A0 \u00A0 total cost of 960m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe delta-V cost of a retour from Ike to the station is 1920m/s. While getting to orbit on Duna costs 1450 m/s, landing can be done with shutes a a very little amoumt of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHowever: because the lander tug is much lighter on his descent than on is ascent, the fuel cost to Ike is much less. Because only half of it\u0027s journey, it\u0027s on his max weight.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo you also might consider a outpost on Ike, when your tug is really light, it\u0027s profitable for sure, it get\u0027s trickier when your tug is quitte heavy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI once builded 2 different stations with 2 tug and a mining outpost.
