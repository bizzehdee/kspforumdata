What I\u0027m trying to do is get this up into space and docked with as much fuel in the center tanks as possible. I\u0027m told the key is this asparagus staging, which I don\u0027t totally understand. I followed a tutorial video and it looked something like my picture. When I launch this though, only one of my Number 1 tanks runs out of fuel really quickly, and that sets the whole thing off balance, and she flips. As far as I can tell, my fuel lines are going the right way, albeit a little sloppily. Any advice? I numbered them as to which decouplers will fire as a pair when that tank runs dry. I\u0027d really appreciate some help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iGClsex.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iGClsex.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-28T06:10:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2014 06:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DaveKermin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T05:25:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to watch the direction of your fuel lines; fuel flows from where you place the start of the line to the end.
