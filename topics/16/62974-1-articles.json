You will see the fuel in both tanks listed at this point as well as buttons that say OUT / IN.

There\u0027s a post around here that deals with all his mods, but many of them increase the complexity of KSP a considerable amount (life support, deadly reentry, etc). Don\u0027t worry too much about all those at this point. ONce you get really comfortable with stock KSP, then you can start adding mods. And only add one at a time and learn it before adding a second. You\u0027ll notice in some of Scott\u0027s videos he mentions mods conflicting with each other or breaking his saves or crafts. It happens less and less frequently, but it still can happen. You just want to ensure you know which mod does what and which one added a game-breaking conflict so it is easily removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!
