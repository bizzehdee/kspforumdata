My vessel has aerodynamic control surfaces that it uses to glide to the target and then rotate for aiming the rocket down. When it\u0027s turned backwards however the control surfaces dont adapt but try to steer the vessel the wrong way which results in coupled rotation and spin when using KOS. I noticed the same issue without KOS when under human control. I don\u0027t remember it was like this before. Is there any way I can work around this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-24T16:23:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSetting the control surface authority to -100% will reverse them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo clue if that\u0027s going to help you with your particular problem though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-24T19:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep, \u2212100% control surface authority works great when you are flying backwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, if the boosters are\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0going engine-first while KOS is steering them, you could flip the probe-cores in those boosters to face the engine, thus defining engine-first as \u0027forwards\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RagnarDa","CreatedById":83860,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-25T11:46:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I tried flipping the probe but the issue still persisted. Thanks for the tip about the authority, but this cant as far as I can tell not be trigger via action group or similar hence not from KOS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Tried turning the probe core again and now it works! Thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit2: No it just works for human player.
