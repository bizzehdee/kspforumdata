Even if I set the fuel to only drain from the rear tanks, the center of mass shifts toward the back and the plan becomes unstable, eventually nosing up and flipping out of control. I moved the wings back significantly and it was much more stable as a result. I also replaced the ASAS with avionics (because I\u0027m not a great pilot and avionics is basically piloting for dummies.) I only had time to give it one good go to get into orbit, and I came up about 500 m/s short. I suspect that if you cut some jet fuel mass and/or added another pair of intakes you could get it into orbit. If I have a chance I\u0027ll try again tonight to see if I can make orbit only by moving the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-26T18:38:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2013 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jason Patterson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T18:04:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Good:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Decent stability. I had to transfer fuel from the rear jet tanks to front tanks in flight to make sure it keeps flying stable, but there were no catastrophic control problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The aircraft was able to land after a failed attempt to reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Bill survived. He asked me to thank you personally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Bad:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You generally want to have two intakes per jet engine. Consider using a structural bi-coupler in the front to have two intakes where you have one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Too much jet fuel and too little rocket fuel. One jet tank per engine is all you need. The best way to fix this is to leave one jet fuel tank where you have two sandwitched between two FL-T200 tanks. It will give you the same overall length and trade the weight of jet fuel for rocket fuel you need to make orbit, while keeping the entire thing way more balanced. You will need extra fuel lines to connect these. I\u0027d just feed them to central tank. That will result in them getting drained before your drop tanks, but it\u0027s better than loss of stability you\u0027ll get from any other configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ugly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrop tanks. I have nothing against them in principle, but this particular configuration shifts CoM up until they are dropped. As craft uses up jet fuel, that becomes more significant. At 16k and 600m/s I had to do a lot of fighting with controls. If you must use drop tanks, make sure they are in-line with the rest of the craft. In this case, I\u0027d shift them to wing-tips. You might need to add struts to make sure they stay put there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T04:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill coming up short getting to orbit. I suspect that losing a couple of tons of jet fuel would do the job, and certainly if you add another pair of intakes and drop jet fuel. I was topping out at around 850-900 m/s near 18km altitude before starting the rocket. It\u0027s almost surely possible to go significantly higher and faster by throttling down and burning off most of the jet fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
