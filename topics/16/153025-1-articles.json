That\u0027s a subject that I\u0027ve rarely talked about, and one that deserves a lot of consideration. The main thing in order to not blow up is to shed your energy \u003Cem\u003Eslowly.\u003C/em\u003E Brake too fast, and the thermal load will blow you up. So, how do you go about it, exactly? Well, the trick is to do it in the high atmosphere, where the air is thin and the drag is low. That also means, of course, that it takes a long time, so plan accordingly. I use trajectories to more or less plan things, but I put the initial impact point on the continent west of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, because I am going to go much farther than if I went \u0027ballistic\u0027 (I.E: prograde all the time).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, actually you don\u0027t need this at all, because if your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is any good at maneuvering you have a \u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E amount of control about how you fall. Stay prograde, and you will fall in exactly the same way a capsule does, but if you put a bit of an attack angle, you can fall much slower, or use a negative \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E and actually fall \u003Cem\u003Efaster.\u003C/em\u003E The main thing to take form this is, you can control your vertical speed, so you should keep an eye on it. That and altitude are the two only things you have to work with, and they actually sit next to each other on the top of your screen. So brace yourself, because I am going to start reciting numbers that are, of course, very specific to a kerbin reentry. Things start getting draggy below 50kms, so doing anything above that is usually a waste of time, just stay prograde. But things don\u0027t start getting seriously hot until about 35-40kms (at orbital speed), so that\u0027s the altitude you want to start your braking at. As soon as you get close to 40kms, increase \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cem\u003Eat least\u003C/em\u003E as much as necessary to arrest your vertical speed and go more or less horizontal-ish, and you will start shedding speed without increasing your temperature, and in fact your temperature will start to go down. Once you go below ~1,000m/s, it\u0027s safe to pitch down and plunge into the lower atmosphere without burning up. Too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, notice that I said \u0027increase \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eat least\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E as much as...\u0022. That \u0027at least\u0027 is very important, because in it lies the trick to not only fall safely, but with a lot of precision, so you can nail \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E every time and really milk those SSTOs with 100% recovery. See, with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E you not only control the rate of descent, you also control your \u003Cem\u003Edrag\u003C/em\u003E. Go horizontal with the least \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E required, and you will glide more than half the planet before running out of energy and falling to the lower atmosphere, where drag won\u0027t let you go very far. But if you increase \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E above ~30\u00BA, you will not actually go up, but instead stall the whole wing, reduce lift, and greatly increase drag. Think of it as turning you whole wing into one giant, heat-resistant airbrake (which is why I don\u0027t use airbrakes). You need enough control authority to do high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E maneuvers, but with them you can almost stop on a dime (or at least a continent), and control where you want to fall exactly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo three distinct phases: first, fall prograde until you are approaching 40kms and stuff starts to get hot. Then you pull up, not-quite-leveling the flight (I like to keep vertical speed at about 100m/s, but that\u0027s me) and start shedding energy slowly, while you cruise around kerbin as stupendous speeds. If you feel that you are going to overshoot, you pull up sharply to 45\u00BA or more, and start increasing drag, and if you are actually going up and worried about it, you can pull \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E hard, and negate your vertical speed very quickly. Two or three of those pullup maneuvers should get you to the east mountains of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E with about ~900m/s and ~20kms of altitude, and from there it\u0027s basically a straight line to the runway, the lower atmosphere will brake you to subsonic speed by the time you get close to the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRune.
