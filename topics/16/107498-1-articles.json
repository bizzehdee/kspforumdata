Especially the smaller versions. I\u0027m undertaking the voyage of creating a v1.03 SSTO spacecraft capable of launching a Jumbo tank with docking port with a mainsail attached to LKO.\n\nEverything goes fine up until I reach 800-1100m/s between 15-20km altitude. The problems occurs pretty varied in between those speed and altitude ranges as I tested proper flight profiles.\n\nWhat happens is that the pitch elevons (attached to steel beams as seen in the picture below) just fall of. Including the Yaw control surface which is directly attached to the tail connector. Both the yaw and the steel beams with the elevons attached are strutted. Both at the base and at the tip.\n\nI don\u0027t think the problem is caused by structural stress. Because the plane is pretty balanced. Meaning it maintains AoA without control input at the specified speeds and altitudes. So during a few of the tests I didn\u0027t even hit a button and then suddenly they just fell of the aircraft.\n\nEven although I don\u0027t know for sure, but does the new heating simulation induce heat from the engines on parts positioned in the wake of the engine exhaust?\n\nIf so then it explains why the pitch elevons on the tail fail.\n\nBut it doesn\u0027t explain why the Yaw control surface also falls off. It isn\u0027t positioned in the wake of any engine exhaust. \n\nMore notably they always fail at exactly the same time. Which I find very very odd.\n\nYet it might have something to do with heat anyway, maybe not related to the engines perse.\n\nHowever it still puzzles me why only those specific control surfaces fail at exactly the same moment and not other parts due to heating damage.\n\nOne final note is that when I spoke of the failing pitch elevons on the tail, I exactly mean those on the tail.\n\nThe Elevon on the wingtips next to the outer rapier engines does not fail.\n\nAnyway, here is the picture.\n\n![sIZVaG1.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/sIZVaG1.jpg?1)"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T20:00:09Z","Content":"Possible simple solution:\n\nTry turning on the heat and aerodynamics overlays (F11 and F12 respectively in 1.0.2). Any parts highlighted in a bright yellow are on the verge of overheating. Is there a sudden increase in drag (i.e. do the red lines suddenly get longer) when the wings disappear?\n\nIs there anything odd in the flight info screen (F3) or in the debug log?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporized Steel","CreatedById":108520,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T21:20:40Z","Content":"Didn\u0027t knew about those usefull info overlays.\n\nIt definetely answered my question. The pitch elevons were indicated as bright yellow prior to failure. As for the yaw I cannot understand why it also fails. In the heat readout overlay it just shows red. But I think it\u0027s somehow related to the pitch elevon failure. I\u0027ll just use more on the wingtips and remove the tail elevons completely and see if that solves the problem.\n\nThanks for the usefull information."}]}
