But there is no limit to the number of reports you can store in a manned pod. Just do an EVA, go over to where the report is being stored (e.g. in the mystery goo or in the research lab), right click, grab the reports, and then get into which ever pod you want to store them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crown","CreatedById":18262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T09:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if an EVA-ed Kerbal can pick single pieces of science reports.

But the usual way to transfer science reports is to EVA a Kerbal, move him to the part that has the reports in it, right.click the part, and select \u0022Take data\u0022.
