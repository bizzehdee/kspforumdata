Xbox you can\u0027t add mods and so i have to calculate delta v\u00A0my own i also find android app for that too but some reason delta v count doesn\u0027t match up? Number\u00A0is\u00A0usually couple of hundred m/s more of\u00A0actual speed of\u00A0rocket (sometimes even more)!\u00A0So why is this is it gravity or\u00A0air pressure what effects this even vaccuum calculation is little wrong! How much this effect if i built a rocket and want to go mun and numbers are wrong hunreds or even thousands i calculate like smarter people say ln(m1/m2)\u00D7Isp\u00D79.18=delta v!

I use 20,000 as a rule of thumb that I break and set to 25,000 to give me the ballpark number I need.

This would only be applicable when already in orbit and then doing a maneuver (you can try this out by calculating \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for a small craft, then attaching it wit a decoupler to a large booster stage to get it into orbit with all the fuel still there and then detach and perform a maneuver with the calculated amount of delta-v.

In atmospheres, there\u0027s both drag and changes to your rocket\u0027s Isp. Rockets operating in air have lower Isps, sometimes very significantly, than ones working in a vacuum. This means that the actual deltaV it provides during atmospheric flight depends on the flight path, and so it is not exactly calculable. Likewise, the amount of that deltaV you lose to drag also depends on your flight path, as well as your rocket\u0027s streamlining and size; it\u0027s not possible to exactly calculate in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Vertical velocity will, in typical ascents, be lost to gravity for the vast majority of the flight path. That\u0027s why guides to getting to orbit recommend turning sideways as early as possible; only drag can remove horizontal velocity and drag has much less impact than Kerbin\u0027s gravity does. Even once in orbit, vertical thrusting is typically much more inefficient than lateral thrusting for changing your rocket\u0027s energy (i.e. what deltaV ultimately represents). How much you lose to gravity depends on your flight path and can\u0027t be exactly calculated in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, for both of these, you can get some approximate estimates with practice. In general, in a \u0027typical\u0027 Kerbin ascent, gravity losses are on the order of 800m/s and drag losses around 200m/s; they can be much higher or lower depending on the rocket characteristics, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. If you\u0027re running multiple kinds of rockets at the same time, you need to use an averaged Isp; the KSP wiki has the formulas here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Specific_impulse\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Specific_impulse\u003C/a\u003E. In effect what you do is thrust-weight the Isps, so for example if you have 2x solids burning at 250sec Isp at 200kN and 1x liquid burning at 280sec Isp for 200kN, you\u0027d have an average Isp of (400kN/600kN * 250sec) \u002B (200kN/600kN * 280sec) = 260sec.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-05T01:19:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2016 01:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by foamyesque\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceman83","CreatedById":167241,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-04T22:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the answers!!!
