I have very little experience with this kind of contract. I only took the one with the whole joolian system. And when I took that one I had my scansat probe scanning the last moon of Jool so it was an instant completion. So am I correct to guess the order doesn t matter at all?\n\nThen would it be a problem if I dock the vessel several times to different refueling stations around the system? Would it lose its status as a single vessel doing the challenge?\n\nCan I modify the vessel in the middle of the challenge? For example, my first thought was to use xenon. Do the celestial bodies from moho to kerbin. Once around kerbin I would do some eva work on it to add more solar panels and maybe that radioisotope thingy. Would modifying the vessel mid course be a problem? Or as long as the probe core makes it to the end it doesn t matter if I modify the rest? If so it s not risky to dock that probe to another mission for any transfer?\n\nFinally it doesnt display a deadline but it doesn t display the usual \u0027Never expires\u0027 message so should I worry about a deadline that doesn t display properly?\n\nAnd finally any tips/ suggestion is more than welcome. If you did the challenge already I d like to see how you did it, your design, maybe a log of the total amount of DeltaV spent. Any help is welcome. Thanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T15:05:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 03:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nookos**"},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T10:25:28Z","Content":"O.O\n\nwow! i mean...

I think around 800-1000 m/s at least when so far from the sun.

That s the information I was looking for. \n\nBut I got impatient and launched a vessel to do it without docking, refueling or eva work on it mid-course. I would have definitely done it with the spark engine instead of the dawn one if I knew. I really don t like to watch a burn for 10min.\n\nAnd I\u0027m done\n\n![KSP_UltimateChallengeDone.jpg](http://lacroixdidier.com/temp/KSP_UltimateChallengeDone.jpg)\n\nFor those interested. It took the probe 17\u002B years to tour the kerbolar system. It had 19716m/s on the launchpad and it finished in elliptical orbit around kerbin with 5412m/s. So 14304m/s spent. Good to point to the fact I m not good at those interplanetary transfer. I really messed up Jool-Eeloo transfer. So I m pretty sure it\u0027s doable in a much more efficient way. \n\nAlso I kept the vessel in orbit once done. And the game gave me the same mission right after I was done. So I basically just had to do a tiny burn to put my periapsis under 70k again and got rewarded a second time. Woop woop I m rich ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) but disappointed to learn it s impossible to reach a reputation of 100% ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) I thought that was the ultimate goal of the game.\n\nAnyway thanks for the help and this is answered."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T15:17:56Z","Content":"Bravo ! \n\nAnd thx for the feedback"}]}
