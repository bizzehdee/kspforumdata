As long as you stay within 2.3km physics distance MechJeb will remain active, at least SmartASS will. But I don\u0027t think the current version continues to execute maneuvers in this case. I\u0027d need to doublecheck that though... The moment your current vessel goes out of physics distance, the ship is packaged and turned into a dummy mass on a stable, never changing orbit - until it bumps into something, that is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am quite definite that you can send a multiple-ship mission to a planet in the same launch window because I have done it myself, though -- my mission to Duna, by happenstance, consisted of the prepared lander-transfer ship, the airship that wasn\u0027t finished in time for a place to be designed for it on that ship, and a tanker just in case I messed up on fuel. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E All three went out with about 4 hours difference as I switched between them and executed their burns, and all three made it at times spread out by about a week.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T22:21:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, the \u0027later\u0027 you send your ship, the earlier it will arrive and vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you send a ship one hour before the window, and one hour after, the second one will arrive hours or days before the other!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tokay Gris","CreatedById":58301,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T23:33:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm.... maybe I should takle it like this and still make it easier:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could get the fleet of ships (minimum two to Jool, more like thriee or more and the two to Duna) outside Kerbins sphere of influence and into Kerbols.
