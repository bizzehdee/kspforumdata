After a mission out to the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, I feel confident enough with my deign to enter the SOI of either Minmus or the Mun and conduct science above their surface. My question is, does either moon offer more science than the other? Would the Mun be easier due to it\u0027s larger SOI, or would Minmus be easier due to its ease to escape back to Kerbin from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T21:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEasy answered ... Mun offers much more science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus only has one Biome, whereas on Mun every major crater is its own Biome (and there are more Biomes in between)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Retread","CreatedById":89946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T21:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this is your first landing, Minmus might be easier - everything happens much slower in the lower gravity. On the other hand, instead of landing on your first attempt, try some orbital missions first. Orbital return missions to the Mun and Minmus have plenty of science potential without landing, if you\u0027ve never been out of Kerbin SOI before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleItaly","CreatedById":69633,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T21:22:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI plan on doing orbital first yeah. Even though the EVA packs would be good, I\u0027d feel bad sending them out there without a ladder to get back in after landing. Hopefully orbital operations will give me enough science to unlock the first tier of ladders\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T21:26:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe science modifier values for the relative locations of each celestial body are available on the wiki at:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science#Celestial_body_multipliers\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science#Celestial_body_multipliers\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe button to make that a pretty link isn\u0027t working on my interface, and I\u0027m not in the mood to look up html code for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it looks like Minmus experiments are a little bit more valuable than M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar experiments.
