This ensures that as you deplete your fuel, the ship\u0027s center of gravity does not shift, and therefore its handlign will not be thrown off. For a cylindrical ship for example, try to place a single fuel tank at the center with an RCS tank on either side, and pick an engine that counterbalances the weight of your command pod and other accessories at the other end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) don\u0027t use 4-way RCS thruster blocks for translation.

Place small girder blocks around the center of gravity and use them to mount more RCS ports facing to the front and rear, so you have forward/back translation.

While I\u0027m not docking anything more massive than 44-ish tons (yet) I\u0027ve found that one set of four over the CoM is not only sufficient, but uses less RCS fuel, which means your ships are lighter, which means they requires less thrust to launch, and so on. The trick is to balance your ship. Put the CoM indicator right over your center of fuel, in other words, put the same amount of mass in front of your fuel tank as you do behind. This way, as you use fuel your CoM doesn\u0027t change and your RCS thrusters remain balanced.

ASAS wobbling your ship with RCS on (also mechjeb does it too) happens because one of two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) your ship is way too wobbly, and you\u0027re controlling it from near one end, so the navball flails when the ship wobbles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) your RCS thruster placement is uneven around the ship\u0027s center of gravity, and mechjeb/ASAS is oversteering. This issue is compounded by ship wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, if you correct the second problem, the effect will be dramatically reduced. By having linear RCS thrusters placed in perfect balance around the ship, your translation maneuvers won\u0027t cause the ship to turn or wobble, which in turn won\u0027t cause the ASAS to kick into overdrive to try and correct it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem in balancing RCS thrusters is that as your fuel depletes, the center of gravity will shift away from the fuel tank and toward the overall center of gravity of the rest of the ship, which means permanently placed RCS thrusters can\u0027t be in the right place all of the time if you\u0027re using them at different levels of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexcept they can: if you design your ship so that the center of gravity of the fuel tank, and the overall center of gravity of the rest of the ship is in the same place, no matter how your fuel changes, you\u0027ll always have your RCS thrusters spot-on and wobble-free.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatBum","CreatedById":57405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T07:53:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou generally need two sets of 4 four-way thruster blocks. this should have at least 4 thrusters fire during any given attitude/translation adjustment.
