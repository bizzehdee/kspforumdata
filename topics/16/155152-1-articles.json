The behavior you describe may be entirely normal depending on the craft and its situation. Above the atmosphere, control inputs use either \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E or control gyros to change the attitude of the craft and your inputs should allow you to point in any direction. In the atmosphere, however, control inputs probably use control surfaces (elevator, rudder, aileron, etc.).\u00A0 Depending on the size, placement, and deflection of the control surfaces, your craft may be more or less responsive to inputs. Remember that the craft is (hopefully) designed to remain pointed in its direction of travel with no control inputs applied.\u00A0 This is the quality of aerodynamic stability.\u00A0 Usually, control surface deflections will allow your craft to point away from the direction of travel a few (5 - 20) degrees. Rudder will allow you to point left or right while elevator will allow up and down pointing.\u00A0 In the atmosphere, this attitude change should allow you to climb, descend, or turn.\u00A0 If a design is very stable, it won\u0027t be very maneuverable and vice versa.\u00A0 If you want to increase maneuverability, you might try increasing the size or deflection of your control surfaces or moving the center of mass closer to the center of lift. Using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E can affect maneuverability, so I usually refine my aircraft design without using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this has been helpful. I\u0027m sure other members can add to the discussion.\u00A0 Happy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-18T03:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sounds normal if your control is coming from control surfaces. It\u0027s not necessarily about what direction you\u0027re pointing, but what your angle of attack or sideslip angle is (fancy way of saying \u0022how far your nose is from the prograde marker\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on the design of your plane, as you increase \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, one of two things will happen:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe self-stabilizing moment will increase and your control surfaces will become less effective, until they cancel out and you can no longer increase \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E. This sounds like what is happening.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYour plane will flip out. If you\u0027re not sure what I mean by this, then\u00A0it isn\u0027t happening.
