I tried it on kerbin and as soon as any power was applied it flipped, I tried it on the mun anyway and the same problem occurs. I figured it was just a naff design, but i\u0027m trying the NASA asteroid missions and the spacecraft happens to be a \u0022Puller\u0022 and every time the power goes above 10% its flips out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T17:42:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey shouldn\u0027t be unstable, just not as efficient. It\u0027s more likely you have a balance issue in there somewhere. Pulling ships need to have perfect symmetry, not just in parts but fuel content too! Equal weight on either side of the craft and equal thrust on either side of the craft. Also the thrust vector needs to be the same, so if your using radial engines, make sure you didn\u0027t angle one more than the other (of course symmetry mode fixes that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossibilities include mis-aligned engines, misplaced fuel lines (one tank is draining faster than the other, causing a mass issue), and also obstruction of one or more of the engines (items placed below an engine that would fall in it\u0027s exaust cause the engine to produce no thrust)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPulling designs are less fuel efficient than pushing but are necessary for segmented craft that have been docked together as docking ports tend to be flexible and bounce around when pushed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-22T17:48:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2014 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T17:59:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELock the gimbals of engines in puller designs. The engines aren\u0027t smart enough to realize they should vector thrust in the opposite direction when placed ahead of the center of mass, so their vectoring causes the ship to become less directionally stable rather than more. Use reaction wheels to control attitude in such designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlshain, why would puller engines be less fuel efficient?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Derpist","CreatedById":93934,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T19:36:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the quick replies, the landing engines were the radial nacelles, there were 4 symetrically placed, I didn\u0027t think about locking the gimbaling, I\u0027ll try that.

And attach at least a couple of the big SAS units to the engines. This will allow you to direct the engines independently of the fuel tanks and the asteroid, and keep the asteroid on track pretty easily.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Derpist","CreatedById":93934,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T23:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETurns out that locking the gimbal, rectifies the problem thanks guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T03:05:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eswitch off your gimbals, ksp doesn\u0027t know to reverse the direction of gimballing on engines placed in front of the cg.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T07:50:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Derpist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Derpist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI cannot believe i hadnt thought of locking the gimbal, ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot your fault, the gimbals should work correctly when the engine is in front of the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T09:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason that it flipped on kerbal might be becuase of the top heavy drag.
