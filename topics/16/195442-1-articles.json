I can launch into polar orbit without problems from Woomerang, rendezvous and dock with the asteroid. I get into Kerbin orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApoapsis is several thousand km out, periapsis is around 34km. After 4 aerobraking orbits it looks like the rock is going to stay in the atmosphere and land.

I have attached about 20 drogue shoots and 20 normal ones. I don\u0027t have mining units because I have just enough delta v for everything technically.

This removes a lot of its mass, while leaving its shape unchanged.

I managed to land that beast. I could get it into Kerbin orbit with periapsis at 45km and apoapsis at several thousand. I did about 40 aerobraking orbits trying to lower apoapsis to 2000km and just managed to get the periapsis back to 72km on the last drop of fuel. It was the most painful thing to do in Ksp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you recommended I sent a mining rig and I had to mine that thing silly.

One is enough because ***you can jettison the ore from the holding tanks***. They don\u0027t tell you that anywhere. So it\u0027s really about learning as you go. It took about an hour or so to take 90t from the asteroid so luckily that didn\u0027t take for ever.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor some reason I don\u0027t trust asteroids when it comes to fuel transfer from one docked ship to another.
