I made a rocket with a srb for the first stage. It shakes a lot until stage separation and then after that if the second stage liquid fuel engine doesn\u0027t activate immediately, the rocket fails. I was wondering if there was a fix for this. It has cost me a couple of missions, since I play with no reverts and 30 days between launches.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-12T04:03:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2015 04:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Voyager275\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaezan","CreatedById":108274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T20:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESRB\u0027s do shake a lot.

A picture of the rocket would also help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can only guess that you probably don\u0027t tweak down the thrust of the SRB and launch with a relatively high TWR (\u0026gt;2), stage when you are moving faster than Mach 1 at less than 10km and your second stage flips because that stage will suddenly have a lower CoM and no control authority because the second stage engine isn\u0027t running.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T20:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs your staging correct?
