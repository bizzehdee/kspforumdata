The issue is not reentry but flight stability. Cargo spaceplanes that are probe controlled with no cockpit is particularly prone to this.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe actual name for this problem in real life is \u0022CGCP mismatch\u0022. CG stands for center of gravity which is the same as CoM in our SPH. CP is center of pressure which is approximately the same as CoL in SPH, it\u0027s the point where all the drag forces on different parts of the aircraft sum up to.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCG needs to be in front of CP for the aircraft to be dynamically stable. Problem is in a spaceplane with engines at the back and very little weight at the front (ie fuel tanks empty, no cockpit) the CG is very far back.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCP and CoL is complicated because they are constantly changing as the airflow around your aircraft changes. The CoL indicator in the SPH is calculated assuming airflow coming straight ahead, which is not a bad assuming for most airplanes. However as soon as you introduce some AoA the drag on the fuselage generate will change and there\u0027s no rule of thumb how it will change since it depends on the shape of the fuselage. Just like how rockets don\u0027t handle sudden large AoA change very well and tend to flip if you do that, if you have a very long, light weight fuselage in front of the CoM and your plane goes slightly sideways against the wind that fuselage suddenly introduce a huge amount of drag that\u0027s no longer aligned with the CoM and the plane will want to flip.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe solution is as \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125662\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0022\u003E@Snark\u003C/a\u003E says: move your CoM forward. Besides shifting as much heavy stuff to the front of the plane as possible one other solution is use the same strategy that Skylon\u0027s design used to counter CGCP mismatch - put the engines at the middle of the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MagicFireCaster","CreatedById":149926,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T00:08:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey!\u00A0I\u00A0won\u0027t cover all of the explanations that were already done, but maybe i can give you a quick solution to your problem, since probably your problem is issues with your center of mass/lift, i would recommend you to try (if your ssto desing\u00A0lets you do it) to move all or most your fuel resources near\u00A0the nose of your plane, since all that weight in the back of your plane is making it inestable probably sending it\u00A0to the front of your craft will help\u00A0partially or totally with your stability issue after reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T00:36:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222351546\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129413\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452125332\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022149926\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MagicFireCaster\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 minutes ago, MagicFireCaster said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey!\u00A0I\u00A0won\u0027t cover all of the explanations that were already done, but maybe i can give you a quick solution to your problem, since probably your problem is issues with your center of mass/lift, i would recommend you to try (if your ssto desing\u00A0lets you do it) to move all or most your fuel resources near\u00A0the nose of your plane, since all that weight in the back of your plane is making it inestable probably sending it\u00A0to the front of your craft will help\u00A0partially or totally with your stability issue after reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, that\u0027s the exact opposite of what he needs to do, and the reason he\u0027s having a problem is that he\u0027s already doing that.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is that a spaceplane needs to be well-balanced (with a forward CoM) in order to stable in flight.\u00A0 There are different ways you can accomplish this.\u00A0 One way is what you suggest, which is \u0022move fuel resources up front\u0022.\u00A0 Yes, that will balance the plane... \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewhen there\u0027s a full load of fuel\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E.\u00A0 But if you\u0027re relying on the weight of that fuel for your balance, then as soon as the fuel is gone, your stability goes to heck.\u00A0 That\u0027s the problem that the OP is having.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the way to deal with this is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPut your fuel resources in the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emiddle\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of the plane.\u00A0 Ideally, you want your \u0022center of wet mass\u0022 (i.e. the CoM of all your fuel) to be in the same place as your \u0022center of dry mass\u0022 (i.e. the CoM of your plane when it has empty tanks).\u00A0 That way, the CoM of your overall plane \u003Cem\u003Edoesn\u0027t move\u003C/em\u003E when you drain the fuel.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThen, to achieve balance, move heavy things forwards.\u00A0 If there\u0027s a heavy cockpit, put it as far forwards as possible.\u00A0 If you have heavy engines on the back of the plane, move them up (e.g. towards the middle of the plane).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MagicFireCaster","CreatedById":149926,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T01:12:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs i get it, he is stuck on orbit trying to land his plane, so if he has fuel left that is the only advice i can give to him, since you and the others already told him the core problem is the desing of his ssto.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T03:59:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI appreciate the explanation, but I should\u0027ve said I\u0027m aware of some CoM stuff and I\u00A0doubt it\u0027s CoM problem in this particular situation.
