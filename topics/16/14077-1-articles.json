I have spent over five hours working on the thing, and I \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E can\\\u0027t get it into orbit. Frankly, it\\\u0027s starting to kill my interest in the game, and I don\\\u0027t want that to happen, so I decided to bring it to the experts here on the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m using both NovaPunch and MechJeb for the shuttle, as it looks rather silly for the shuttle to bolted to the minuscule stock fuel tanks. I\\\u0027ve made a slight alteration to the config files that anyone who downloads the craft files needs to take note of. Specifically, I\\\u0027ve made two parts (NP_3m Decoupler and NP_miniDecoupler) to have fuelCrossFeed = True.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem is stability. Up until about 30-50 km into the ascent, everything is kosher; it\\\u0027s wobbly, it deviates from vertical no matter how hard you push it to stay vertical, and it takes on inclination like nobody\\\u0027s business, but it gets there nonetheless. Then it starts to tip. It does this because of the decreasing mass of the main fuel tank due to the fuel being exhausted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose I should go into a little history of the development of the shuttle. This might be a little long, and I apologize, but I think it\\\u0027s a bit important. The first design flipped on its side as soon as it took off, nose-diving into the ground after about 20 seconds; the shuttle was \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E too heavy. So I added a counterbalance to the other side in the form of a modified AR202 MechJeb with a mass of 50. That worked... for a while. I eventually became frustrated enough that I removed the counterweight and added liquid engines to the orbiter to counter its weight, which is how the current design is. It was still tipping, however, so I added a decoupler to the large engine attached to the fuel tank, and it started tipping the other way, so I added liquid radial boosters to try and counterbalance. The radial boosters either didn\\\u0027t do enough or did too much, so I decided to ditch the main fuel tank when it started tipping and just use the orbiter engines to get to orbit. Everything up until now is my Shuttle 2.craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I added two fuel tanks in place of some engines that I originally meant to deorbit the shuttle, along with fuel lines to pipe the fuel to the orbiter\\\u0027s engines. However, the fuel logic decided that the orbiter\\\u0027s engines would draw from these fuel tanks before the main one at the beginning of the mission, leaving me with no fuel once I separated the main tank. So I disabled them at the beginning of the mission... which permanently disabled the fuel lines \u0026gt;\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Frustrated to no end, I closed KSP and came here to ask for help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve attached a few screenshots and the Shuttle 1.craft (which is my latest work on the thing) and the earlier Shuttle 2.craft.

If so, you need to make the center of Gravity in the space between the large tank and the Shuttle Plane part. (I\\\u0027m on my iPhone so I can\\\u0027t download it yet, or see the pics) The easiest way to do this is make the Tank and the Shuttle even in weight. This is probably hard to acheive, so if you add a weight on the other side of the shuttle, and make it be de-staged at the same time as the tank. For example; if your tank weighs 100 units (once again, just an example) and your Shuttle weighs 75 units, create a weight of 25 units. Sorry if this isn\\\u0027t your question, but I hope I helped one of your problems. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ModernArc","CreatedById":32152,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-13T01:25:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it is tilting the way the Shuttle is, then I know this isn\\\u0027t realistic, but I would put a SRB on the Shuttle itself.

This was a challenge to build a space shuttle that looked and acted like it\\\u0027s real-life counterpart; to do as you\\\u0027re suggesting would defeat the entire purpose of me building it in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m no slouch at physics; I\\\u0027m getting my baccalaureate in physics a week from today, and I\\\u0027m headed off for my Master\\\u0027s and eventually Doctorate in the field. I had surmised that the problem was a shifting center of gravity - I\\\u0027m trying to correct for this shift, either by liquid booster placed around the assembly or just getting rid of the entire fuel tank at the problem point. It\\\u0027s obviously possible to get it working - the space shuttle launched perfectly 134 out of 135 times in real life (135 out of 136 if you count \u003Cem\u003EBuran\u003C/em\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is thus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt launch, the orbiter and the fuel tank stack are rather evenly balanced in weight. As the main fuel tank empties and the SRBs are jettisoned, however, the decreasing mass of the fuel tank stack (and no corresponding mass decrease on the orbiter) causes the engine underneath the fuel tank to tip the formerly vertical assembly over towards the orbiter, essentially turning the orbiter upside-down. To compensate, I jettison the primary engine, but this only causes the assembly to flip the \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E way - the orbiter is now the only source of thrust, after all. This \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E be good, as it gets the orbiter right-side up, which would allow me to achieve orbit... if the damn thing didn\\\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ekeep\u003C/em\u003E tipping until I\\\u0027m doing rolls at a frightening rate, eventually tearing the entire ship apart if I leave the thrust up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if I jettisoned the main tank at this point (it still has 1/3 of its fuel left, but oh well) and used the side tanks to control my orbiter\\\u0027s engines, I could make orbit at this point, but as I stated in my first post, these tanks drain first. Thus, I disable them... which wouldn\\\u0027t be a problem if it \u003Cem\u003Edidn\\\u0027t permanently disable the fuel lines connecting it to the orbiter\u003C/em\u003E, causing me to have \u003Cem\u003Eno\u003C/em\u003E fuel after I jettison the main tank. More succinctly, if I don\\\u0027t disable the tanks, they drain and I have no fuel, and if I \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E disable them, the fuel lines won\\\u0027t work and I have no fuel. Damned if I do, damned if I don\\\u0027t.
