IE, reinsertion into Kerbin orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA free return is where the gravity from one body causes you to sling back into the influence of the body you came from. IE, you use the Mun to sling yourself back into Kerbin Orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, what you would do is wait until your periapsis and then burn prograde until you get a Kerbin encounter, in essence doing the same maneuver you used to go to the Mun in the first place. Thats the basics of it. Without precisely controlling where and in what direction you burn you\u0027ll likely wind up with an ending Kerbin periapsis that is gigantic and will possibly require a lot of tuning to change into an orbit that will allow you to return to Kerbin. You can check this once you get the Kerbin Encounter, as you\u0027ll get an orbital path show up around Kerbin. This path is what your orbit will look like once you leave the Mun\u0027s influence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis however can be fixed most efficiently while on the way to your Kerbin encounter point. After getting the encounter, simply make a maneuver node somewhere along your path and play with it to change your periapsis, inclination, etc etc to wherever you need or want it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-27T00:09:48Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2014 12:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by G\u0026#39;th\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T01:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the answers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T18:19:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to return to Kerbin with a single burn, the best way to do it is to burn prograde when you are on the \u0022kerbin\u0022 side of the mun, about 25-30 degrees before the point in your orbit where you are closest to kerbin. This is assuming you\u0027re orbiting eastward in a circular orbit. You should leave the mun pointing away from the mun\u0027s orbit and you should be able to set your Pe wherever you want it (20-25km is a good target if you want to return and land). From minimus, do the same thing but instead burn pretty much at the closest point instead of before it (since minimus has less gravity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you want to do a true free-return trajectory, you have to encounter the mun and pass in front of it. Do this by aiming ahead of where you normally would on your transfer orbit, maybe have an angle of 110 degrees between you and the mun when you do your transfer burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-27T18:24:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2014 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbimbibble\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T22:50:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ideal return trajectory to an aerobraking landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/x7EEqHn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022x7EEqHn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
