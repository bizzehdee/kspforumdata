When this happens, adding engines doesn\u0027t add any more thrust, just mass and drag. You\u0027re limited by intake area in that critical regime a lot more than pure thrust rating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Likewise, having too little thrust means that you\u0027re hard- pressed to overcome your drag as you attempt to slog through the 25-32km \u0022wall\u0022. Not that big a deal so long as you have enough wing area, but because your fuel efficiency is down in that part of the flight... it will cost you fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is why we have come up with an efficient balance through empirical testing and experience that says we want one turbojet for every 10-15 tonnes of spaceplane and at least .018m^2 intake area per engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lift has a similar balance problem. Too much wing means that you never get into the most efficient angle of attack during your climbout (23*) which means you\u0027re carrying more mass and drag than you could, which means more fuel wasted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Too little wing, OTOH, means you may not be able to climb over the wall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So we set a rule-of-thumb balance of 1.0 lift coefficient per tonne of spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T16:14:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Slashy said. So for your eight tonne aircraft, you\u0027ll want to use one Turbojet as your main engine and a combination of wing parts that add up to a lift rating of \u0022eight\u0022. Delta Wings and Wing Connector A/B are \u0022two\u0022 each, so you\u0027d want four total of those parts. Some of the wing parts actually result in better \u0022lift per tonne\u0022 than others (the Deltas and Wing Connectors are actually really lousy in that regard); for example the old-style Swept Wings are actually really decent wing parts, they\u0027re just hard to stick control surfaces onto.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
