Spend several orbits raising your apoapsis (get it to 2-5 thousands km), then make the escape burn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) have periapsis of the elliptic orbit a bit before the theoretical ejection burn position - you\u0027ll initially get escape trajectory that\u0027s much closer to parabola. (I\u0027d say about 20 degrees between major axis of your elliptic orbit and the plotted ejection vector is good). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) during late phase of the ejection (and the burn for Jool transfer might last up to until halfway to the Mun) watch your ejection vector - try getting it as close to initially plotted as possible. When your interplanetary trajectory starts approaching the desired, recalculate the rest of the burn (last couple hundreds m/s) to ensure you\u0027ll not miss the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) When approaching target, check your circularization burn time before entering the SOI - it might be necessary to reduce the relative velocity just after or even slightly before entering the SOI (even with my Moho craft I usually start the injection about halfway between edge of SOI and periapsis, but you have to be sure you have enough time to make the orbit closed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) you don\u0027t have to circularize in 1 go, just make the closed orbit.

Some of these will be repeats.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E1.) even on a manned mission, you need electricity. If you run out, there\u0027s no way to steer your vehicle. You may end up with kerbals orbiting between Mun and Kerbin with no way to get home but plenty of fuel left.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E2.) On moons: fly around. Those EVA jetpacks the kerbals have are amazing pieces of technology.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E3.) Back up your save folder, especially after significant progress or achievements. This game can crash and corrupt your career in the process. It\u0027s happened to me twice. Also, it\u0027s possible to repair your saved game by modifying the save file in a text editor. For me, it was a vessel that I had to delete from the save file which restored the career to working order. If it helps, both times it was a probe on an interplanetary transfer. I rarely let unmanned vessels travel without being monitored anymore, especially if they\u0027re important to me.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E4.) Nuclear engines and ion engines are awesome if you have a dual monitor setup. Start an interplanetary burn and then watch a Scott Manley video or the Apollo landings on Youtube while you wait. Burns can take a long time.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E5.) Test everything - especially your landers and rovers. Testing can be fun. Read about the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs. Each mission tested maneuvers and vehicles that would be used in later missions. A few things I\u0027ve had repeated problems with: make sure lander legs extend low enough below the engine(s). Make sure you bring enough fuel for descent, ascent, and rendezvous/return to Kerbin. Put lights on your lander for night landings. Rovers should be low and wide and heavy, and they need electricity. Lastly, don\u0027t forget antennas on unmanned missions. Science is useless if it can\u0027t be transmitted home.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E6.) Orbital rendezvous is easy, and docking isn\u0027t that hard. Don\u0027t be intimidated by them. If you\u0027ve succeeded at a Mun shot already, then watch a few tutorials, get a solid understanding of your navball, then go for it.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E7.) You don\u0027t need to bring science experiments home. Kerbals can remove the science and carry it with them. Just return the kerbal home.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E8.) Don\u0027t waste your time matching thrust/Isp/burn time of real rockets in KSP. Your rockets won\u0027t work. I know. I tried to build the Saturn V. It barely made it into orbit. Allow real rockets to inspire you, but don\u0027t try to replicate them exactly.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E9.) During interplanetary transfers, mid-course corrections are your friend. You only need a fraction of the fuel if you adjust your course early. Often the deltaV requirements are so low you can just make corrections using RCS fuel. If your target has an atmosphere, adjust so that you can aerobrake in the atmosphere. You\u0027ll need a fraction of the fuel you would to slow down and achieve orbit otherwise. It\u0027s more time consuming than time warping to the planet, but it\u0027ll save you fuel and reduce the size of rocket you need to launch. In career mode it means interplanetary mission on low-tech engines.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E10.) I recently discovered that parachutes are somewhat optional when landing on Eve. Expect the bottom of the landing craft to be obliterated, though.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E11.) Cheap autopilot for the gamer who wants to play stock: a keyboard with \u0022cruise control\u0022. Often a feature of gaming keyboards. I\u0027ve had kerbals walk kilometers across the Mun while I spend time with the wife.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
