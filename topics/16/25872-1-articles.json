There\u0027s not a lot of extra dV in this craft for fixing orbital alignment, so it\u0027s fairly critical that you approach and leave Duna without needing a lot of plane change. That said, there\u0027s plenty of slack for a human pilot. You certainly don\u0027t need to be perfect in order to have enough fuel to get back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFast forward until your return window, and plot a course from Duna orbit back to a Kerbin intercept. Sometime around here you\u0027ll likely want to jettison the \u0022top\u0022 fuel tank. I turn off the engine and spin the craft to toss it well away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom here, it\u0027s just a matter of making sure your orbital planes align and that you get a reasonably efficient Hohmann transfer. I cleaned up my Kerbin approach shortly before entering Kerbin\u0027s SoI (and then touched it up again just after entering). I returned to Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere with the two smallest fuel tanks (just above the 909\u0027s) almost completely full. If you\u0027re fancy, this should be enough to aerobrake and establish an equatorial orbit, allowing you to pick a suitable landing site. Personally, I just plowed into the atmosphere and trusted that the Kerbals wherever I should happen to land would be friendly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last note, you\u0027ll either want to make a custom action group for the radially mounted parachutes, or manually click and deploy them as you\u0027re approaching Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere (but before you\u0027re very far into it), as the same chutes are used again for landing at Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/49fGC8Cs.png\u0022 alt=\u002249fGC8Cs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-09T23:46:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2013 11:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Anglave\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chrisd857","CreatedById":57291,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T02:36:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere was my first manned trip to Duna which returned to Kerbin: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/fX4rr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlbum\u003C/a\u003E.
