I mean, sure, that happens sometimes with big ships with RCS, but this was a lot more jumping than usual, to the extent that it sometimes won\u0027t let me time warp with ASAS turned on, apparently counting me as \u0022under acceleration\u0022. The plane does have RCS, but I hardly ever turn it on, so I\u0027m thinking the only culprit could be all those big control surfaces I put all over the rear end of the plane, which aren\u0027t supposed to work in vacuums but apparently are to a lesser degree in my game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else have this too?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure wish there were a way to lock and unlock control surfaces with action groups... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-12T18:19:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2013 06:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by GreeningGalaxy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lucidLemon","CreatedById":33691,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T06:07:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EControl fins have do absolutely nothing without an atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like you just have long noodley plane.
