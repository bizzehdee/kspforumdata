src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless of why you\u0027re building the base, LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION.\u00A0 So you have to do a good job on recon to find the best place.\u00A0 It must be reasonably flat or you\u0027ll have all sorts of problems.\u00A0 If the base is mining/refining resources, it obviously needs to be on a good concentration of those resources.\u00A0 And if space-going ships are going to be coming and going on a regular basis, you want the base as close to the equator as possible, so the ships don\u0027t waste fuel with inclination changes (although this isn\u0027t a big deal on low-gravity worlds).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, there are 3 main physical challenges to building a base.\u00A0 Various mods either help or hinder these things, so choose carefully.\u00A0 These challenges, and ways to deal with them, are as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ELanding multiple modules in the same place\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0 This is MUCH easier on an airless world and is just doing like any other lander.\u00A0 If you\u0027re an experienced pilot, you can do this yourself.\u00A0 Otherwise, use MechJeb\u0027s landing AI.\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E needs a target to land on and you don\u0027t want it landing on your previous base modules, so it\u0027s a good idea to plant a flag where you want the next module to come down.\u00A0 If the world has an\u00A0atmosphere, accurately landing with chutes very difficult so the modules will need the ability to drive possibly several km to the base--be sure they have that ability.\u00A0 If the atmosphere is thick enough to fly it (and has very little land, such as Laythe), it might be better to build the modules as gliders or airplanes and fly them to the site.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EPositioning the modules near each other\u003C/u\u003E:\u00A0 This basically means all your modules need wheels and a degree of land-worthiness based on their expected travel distance after landing.\u00A0 Several base part mods nowadays have special wheels designed to fit the modules, and these have built-in decouplers and self-destruct.\u00A0 These typically work great over short distances and on flat terrain after very accurate landings on airless worlds.\u00A0 However, if you need to drive several km through Duna\u0027s dune fields, you\u0027ll probably need to go with large rover wheels (mod or stock).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EConnecting the modules together\u003C/u\u003E:\u00A0 The difficulty of this can range from high to zero depending on mods.\u00A0 High difficulty is using docking ports (IOW, stock).\u00A0 This is because slight unevenness in the terrain and the flex of the wheel suspensions can keep the ports from aligning.\u00A0 I strongly recommend AGAINST doing this.\u00A0 You can use the Klaw instead of docking ports, but that looks ugly and causes Kraken problems.\u00A0 A better solution is to just park the modules near each other and then link them with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E pipes.\u00A0 However, this also causes Kraken problems.\u00A0 The best solution is to use a mod that allows resource transfer between separate, disconnected modules in close proximity, such as Pathfinder or MKS.\u00A0 With these, all you have to do is park the modules close enough together then turn on the resource-sharing function.\u00A0 Thus, no worries about docking and your base isn\u0027t so tempting to the Kraken.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main hassles of base-building are as follows.\u00A0 You can reduce or eliminate some of these by design choices and mod selection, but expect to have to deal with these to some extent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EThe Kraken\u003C/u\u003E:\u00A0 If you physically connect\u00A0 your base modules, either directly or with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, eventually the Kraken will attack.\u00A0 Thus, as mentioned above, I recommend mods that allow resource transfer between disconnected modules.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EWheels and Lander Leg Issues\u003C/u\u003E:\u00A0 Despite continuous efforts to resolve various problems, these parts still have various Kraken-inducing and Kerbal-killing features.\u00A0 Do not trust them.\u00A0 It\u0027s therefore best to NOT have either type of part on your modules, at least once the modules are positioned.\u00A0 You want your base modules sitting on the ground, not supported by wheels or legs.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ERepetition:\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0 You\u0027ll be doing the same thing over and over again as you add to the base.\u00A0 Once you\u0027ve added a few modules, this becomes old hat and thus quite boring, no longer challenging.\u00A0 But you have to keep on keeping on anyway.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ETime Suckage\u003C/u\u003E:\u00A0 Remember, a base (or station), no matter how cool it is, is simply overhead.\u00A0 It\u0027s there to support OTHER operations.\u00A0 Problem is, the more complex you make the base, the more time you have to spend juggling its various components to keep it all running correctly, and the less time you have to go fly the rockets the base builds, or whatever.\u00A0 Thus, if you run life support and/or want to build rockets on other planets, I STRONGLY recommend using the absolute simplest mods for those functions available.\u00A0 Or even do without life support and just roleplay having it.\u00A0 Otherwise, you\u0027ll never actually get to do the main operations you built the base to support.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an example of doing a base with Pathfinder and it\u0027s magic ability to share resources between disconnected modules:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca

A list of some of the more annoying Kraken antics include:\u00A0 bases hopping into the air and falling back to explode, stations twisting and shaking themselves apart, ships being flung thousands of light years away from Kerbin or sucked into the infinite void of nothingness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbals can\u0027t help but see these effects as the acts of some evil god or demon,

fear it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, all players eventually have the Kraken destroy something.\u00A0 The Kraken especially likes big, complex assemblies, especially if these are

title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen it comes to bases and stations, the Kraken seems mostly to derive from small forces being applied upon physics load.\u00A0 There often seems to be a slight difference from where 1 part of the game thinks a part should be and where another part of the game actually puts it.\u00A0 This causes slight misalignments in the various joints of the craft, so when physical forces suddenly start being applied, these joints try to snap back into proper alignment.\u00A0 This causes the parts of the assembly to move relative to each other, which causes stretching in other joints due to the inertia of the parts, and these other joints\u00A0then try to snap back into alignment, which in turn affects all other joints.\u00A0 Usually, all this \u0022wake-up stretching\u0022 is too small and over too fast for the player to notice and life goes on.\u00A0 But sometimes it creates an harmonic oscillation in the structure.\u00A0 If you\u0027re lucky, this sits at an equilibrium point so the whole structure shakes continuously but no real harm done.\u00A0At other times, however, the oscillations are self-reinforcing, causing the amplitude eventually to exceed the flex tolerance of 1 or more joints, and the assembly tears itself apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are several things you can do to minimize your exposure to this sort of Kraken (there are many types of Kraken).\u00A0 First, use Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, which takes the flex out of permanent joint (like between fuel tanks in a stack) nearly removes flex in decouplers, and reduces flex in docking ports.\u00A0 You can also reduce the number of joints, either by using bigger points or even resorting to Ubizor Welding to turn multiple parts in to 1 part (although this is something of a pain to do).\u00A0 You should also minimize the number of docking joints, which are inherently the most stretchy of all types of joints.\u00A0 For the docking joints you can\u0027t avoid, the bigger the port, the more rigid the joint, so try to use only the largest size.\u00A0 Also, keep the connected modules the same diameter as the ports.\u00A0 Connecting large-diameter parts with small-diameter ports overloads the ports and increases oscillations.\u00A0 You can also reduce overall flex in assemblies with struts.\u00A0 Use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to attach struts between modules after you\u0027ve docked them, especially if the ports are smaller than the modules or docked ships.\u00A0 And try to minimize the length and mass of stuff on the far side of a docking port.\u00A0 IOW, don\u0027t make long chains of docked modules---grow the station radially instead of linearly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBases are more prone to physics load Kraken attacks than stations, due to topography.\u00A0 Away from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, the only perfectly flat surfaces in the game are the \u0022Flats\u0022 of Minmus.\u00A0 Everywhere else, the ground always has slight undulations across very\u00A0short distances.\u00A0 Every time you load physics, the base gets placed in a very slightly different location relative to the ground than it was before.\u00A0 Thus, some of its parts might be placed clipping slightly into the ground, and physics immediately causes them to jump back up onto the surface.\u00A0 Also, modules might now be on opposite sides of a crest or valley in the small-scale terrain undulations, so the joints between them now have to bend in different directions.\u00A0 And the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E of some parts might now be over the crest of a small undulation, so the part now wants to tip parallel to a different slope and perhaps start sliding downhill.\u00A0 Thus, there are more ways external forces can stretch joints, in more directions, and these external forces are constant (because gravity is constantly applied) instead of transient like when a station loads.\u00A0 As a result, the base can be subjected to more and stronger forces for longer time in more directions, and thus can be destroyed more frequently than a station.\u00A0 And having flexible connections between the base and the ground (such as having it sitting on wheels or lander legs) makes things worse because these parts can contribute to increasingly large oscillations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to make a base as Kraken-resistant as possible, use a mod that allows resource flow between disconnected modules.\u00A0 That allows you to make the base out of small modules that themselves are highly Kraken-resistant due to having few parts and joints.\u00A0 And have all modules resting on the ground, not on wheels or lander legs.\u00A0 And whatever you do, DO NOT anchor the modules to the ground.\u00A0 That\u0027s really asking for trouble because the anchor won\u0027t move but the rest of the module will, so you get some nasty stretching and snapping.\u00A0 If the modules aren\u0027t anchored, over time as you repeatedly load physics on the base, the individual modules will gradually move and/or rotate very slightly due to the terrain irregularities, but they won\u0027t move more than a few feet over several years.\u00A0 Because they\u0027re not physically connected to each other, this movement has zero effect on the base\u0027s functionality, instead providing a stark illustration of the stresses and strains that would have built up in the base and likely destroyed it long ago had you connected it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe downside of this method of building a base is a lack of aesthetics.\u00A0 Your base will look like a shanty town, especially as the modules move and rotate relative to each other over time.\u00A0 But such a base will last for many years, whereas better looking connected bases will be Kraken fodder in short order.\u00A0 Personally, I\u0027d rather have longevity than looks, so I consider this a small price to pay.\u00A0 Plus, it\u0027s MUCH easier to build a disconnected base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-18T00:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot
