If the two planes aren\u0027t perfectly aligned, they meet along a single line. Where that line crosses one of the orbits are the ascending node and descending node. \u003Cp\u003EThe ascending node is where the path of an object in one orbit crosses the other orbit in a more-northerly-than-not direction, i.e. it\u0027s going up, ascending. The descending node is on the opposite side where it crosses southerly. (North here is a vague direction implied by the planes of all the bodies in the system and the direction they orbit.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe importance of the AN and DN is that they\u0027re the places you can change the plane of one orbit to align it with the other orbit. Manuever from anywhere else and you can\u0027t get the planes to match. So at the AN, you want to burn down, southerly, towards the 180 on the navball; at the DN you want to burn up, northerly, towards 0 on the navball. Once you get the relative inclination down below about 0.1 degree, the orbits are basically in the same plane; perfectionists will want to get it to 0 degrees (or, as KSP sometimes reports, to NaN). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t mean the orbits are the same size, or the same eccentricity, or that the bodies in the orbits are in the right phase for a rendezvous -- just that they\u0027re orbiting in the same plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wikipedia page (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_node\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_node\u003C/a\u003E) assumes that you\u0027re talking about one orbiting body and treating the equatorial plane of the Earth (or whatever) as the other plane, but the principle is similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you - thank you! I had tripped on the phrases ascending and descending as referring to whether the craft was in the process of \u0027lowering it\u0027s altitude\u0027 rather than \u0027lowering it\u0027s latitude\u0027. This helps. So burn at those points in order to get the two orbits in the same plane. Got it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
