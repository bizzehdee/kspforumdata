Long burn times will produce a lot of cosine losses and so will waste a significant amount of fuel, so splitting your burn into several shorter ones can save you some delta-V.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are other things to consider too, like planetary atmospheres (or even surfaces) that can get in the way if you do a long burn- the first part of the burn will be pointing \u201Cdown\u201D towards the surface and so will reduce your periapsis to a potentially hazardous level- and if you\u2019re using mods that involve engine reliability or limited engine ignitions (e.g. Kerbalism or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E) then you need to balance the longer, less efficient burn against the risk of engine failure and/or a hard limit on how many burns you can do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-26T20:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224069010\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221640365561\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201493\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022miklkit\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/24/2021 at 7:06 PM, miklkit said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Now I know to get into a solar orbit first.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t do this (unless you really want to, I\u0027m not going to stop you \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know it seems simpler at first (that is exactly what I did on my first Duna mission) and it is possible, but needs lots of fuel.

planned?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5% cosine losses would be the dividing line that I know.\u00A0 There\u0027s no physical threshold or change of state for this; it\u0027s a matter of convention, like the unwritten rule of thumb that says that launch stages should have a burn time of\u00A0 about two minutes each, or that a launch thrust-to-weight ratio of 1.3-1.7 is ideal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are cosine losses, you ask?\u00A0 I\u0027m assuming that you know that the best time to thrust for an escape burn is at the periapsis.\u00A0 There are a lot of reasons for this, but two of the factors involved in making an efficient escape burn are that it\u0027s better to adjust the apoapsis (because it\u0027s the part of the orbit that is closest to escaping in the first place), and that it\u0027s better to thrust prograde or retrograde to change the shape of your orbit (normal and radial do change the shape, but they primarily shift the orbit\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eorientation\u003C/em\u003E, which a prograde burn does not).\u00A0 The periapsis is the one point on the orbit where both of these factors work together at maximum potential effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCosine losses, then, are the inefficiencies that you get from burning anywhere\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebut\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0at the periapsis.\u00A0 That\u0027s a generalisation, but it captures the idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor an easier-to-understand example, let\u0027s imagine that you have a rocket with two engines side-by-side.\u00A0 Ideally, both engines point straight back:\u00A0 you want the rocket to go forward, all of the available thrust is pushing you in that direction, and there is no loss.\u00A0 Now, let\u0027s rotate the engines so that they both point outward somewhat in a V, like a lot of cartoon rocket ships do.\u00A0 The combined thrust vector still points out the back, but it\u0027s smaller because some thrust goes out to the sides (and is counterbalanced by the side-thrust of the other engine).\u00A0 That side-thrust is useless, the propellant wasted, and is an example of cosine losses.\u00A0 In the extreme case, we rotate the engines by 90\u00B0 to point directly sideways, which results in a full cancellation of thrust and the rocket going nowhere.\u00A0 That would be 100% cosine losses.\u00A0 This example has a caveat:\u00A0 you don\u0027t need two opposed engines to have cosine losses, because any thrust that is not in the direction that you want to go is lost thrust.\u00A0 One engine pointed sideways gives 100% cosine losses, and one\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Erocket\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0pointed sideways gives 100% cosine losses, too.\u00A0 This means that thrusting normal when you want to thrust prograde is also an example of 100% cosine losses, even though in such a case, your rocket does go somewhere.\u00A0 Thus, thrusting in a direction that is not prograde at the periapsis, even though it does something, and though that something may be \u003Cem\u003Emostly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0what you want it to do, is not 100% ideal.\u00A0 Since it isn\u0027t possible to have a 100% ideal burn, cosine losses can also be said to represent the unavoidable difference between the ideal and reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou calculate cosine losses by taking the angle of interest (engine deflection in the previous example, and angle difference from periapsis in the orbital one) and taking the cosine of that angle.\u00A0 The difference between that cosine and 1 is the fraction of the burn lost (so cos 90\u00B0 = 0, and 1 - 0 = 1, therefore 100% of the burn is lost when you thrust sideways).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, some cosine losses are inevitable.\u00A0 The only burn that is perfectly efficient is instantaneous, which of course does not happen in reality.\u00A0 This is where burn time becomes important, especially for low-thrust rockets:\u00A0 you want the burn times to be long enough to actually do something with the orbit, but not so long that you\u0027re wasting the thrust on something that you\u0027ll need to correct later.\u00A0 5% cosine losses correspond to a window of a little under 13\u00B0 on either side of the periapsis (and around two minutes in low Kerbin orbit)\u00A0 Depending on what you\u0027re trying to do (and how tight your propellant reserve margin is), you can adjust that limit up or down.\u00A0 I prefer something a lot tighter (I try not to go over 6\u00B0\u00A0unless I can\u0027t avoid it), but I\u0027m willing to split a long burn up into more parts to make that happen.\u00A0 You may want a margin of 20\u00B0 or more, but you should know that the loss goes up\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Erapidly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0when you deviate from the periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as \u003Cem\u003Eplanning\u003C/em\u003E a split-burn, that\u0027s a little more complicated, but the key is that you usually want your last burn to do the work of setting up your interplanetary transfer.\u00A0 This means that your next-to-last burn (and the others if you need more than two burns) works to set up your escape, and your very last burn must occur at the same time as you would have burned if you were doing it all in one big push.\u00A0 It\u0027s tricky in KSP to start with a later burn and work backwards (KSP is set up for planning multiple burns in succession going \u003Cem\u003Eforwards\u003C/em\u003E in time, instead), but it can be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what to do:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nNote the transfer window time and location on the orbit.\u00A0 Also get the delta-V for the burn, and note your orbital altitude (the altitude is important; don\u0027t forget it).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSet up a burn that is somewhat less than an escape burn.\u00A0 For a circular orbit, the delta-V needed to escape is a constant for a given orbital altitude.\u00A0 Let\u0027s say that you\u0027re in a 100 km orbit of Kerbin:\u00A0 to escape requires 3,176.5 m/s.\u00A0 You\u0027re already going at 2,246.1 m/s just being in orbit, so the escape\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eburn\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0requires 930.4 m/s.\u00A0 For the sake of easy numbers, let\u0027s go with a 900 m/s burn (to set up an orbit that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealmost\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0escapes--and if that\u0027s too long of a burn, then yes, you can divide it into 3 burns of 300 m/s, or 9 burns of 100 m/s, or, if you\u0027re a dedicated masochist, 900 burns of 1 m/s).\u00A0 Note the amount of time that it takes to complete one orbit (you can do this from the map view).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhatever the orbital period is for that orbit, you simply go back that amount of time from the transfer manoeuvre and set up the burn.\u00A0 It likely won\u0027t be exact:\u00A0 you need the final manoeuvre node to coincide with your periapsis, so to make that work, you\u0027ll need room for corrections and adjustments.\u00A0 On the other hand, a close orbit of Kerbin takes about half an hour, so it\u0027s not like you\u0027re going to miss your window.\u00A0 Remember to take the 900 m/s off of the final burn.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022

(\u003Cem\u003Etypical\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Edefined as:\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EI used the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/#/Kerbin/100/Duna/100/false/optimal/false/1/1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ealexmoon\u003C/a\u003E tool and took the first one it offered\u003C/em\u003E) costs 1,030 m/s of delta-V.\u00A0 930 of that is spent just in escaping Kerbin\u0027s gravity.\u00A0 That does not mean that only the last 100 m/s can be said as being for\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Egoing to Duna\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 That is exactly the wrong way to look at it:\u00A0 the transfer burn needs to be considered as a whole rather than as a sum of independently-movable parts.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EAll\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eof it is used in going to Duna, and \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of it is spent in getting away from Kerbin to do so.\u00A0 The truth of this is seen in the execution:\u00A0 if you don\u0027t complete the burn, then you don\u0027t get the encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can split a burn in two and do it in two distinct steps, provided that you don\u0027t change location (that being, in this case, the periapsis of your ejection/transfer orbit).\u00A0 You cannot split it into two pieces, do one in low Kerbin orbit and the second in solar orbit, and expect the burns to add the same way.\u00A0 The reasons for this take a while to explain but the short version is that the energy of the orbit is distributed differently, which for you means that the energy available to exploit for the transfer is also different.\u00A0 \u00A0The same kind of thing applies to launching from the surface of Kerbin:\u00A0 at or near the equator, you save a few hundred m/s by launching to the east because the surface of the planet is rotating in that direction.\u00A0 If you launch from the north pole (putting aside for the moment that there is no \u003Cem\u003Eeast\u003C/em\u003E), it doesn\u0027t matter your direction because there, the surface of the planet is only rotating in place.\u00A0 Kerbin\u0027s rotation didn\u0027t change; you just put your rocket somewhere where you couldn\u0027t take advantage of it.\u00A0 Thus it is with your choice of interplanetary burn:\u00A0 you end up wasting a lot of the second one by burning somewhere other than at the periapsis.\u00A0 It\u0027s not cosine loss,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eper se\u003C/em\u003E, but it\u0027s a similar sort of problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miklkit","CreatedById":201493,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-31T06:46:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\u00A0\u00A0 I understand the principles but do
