What are they for (other then refuelling), and how to refuel them. See as they are mainly are for refuelling when it does eventually run out how do I refuel it? Without mods preferably. Do I just send up a ship with a ton of fuel to refuel it or is there another way?

Sometimes you end up with a little extra fuel left in a stage. If my lifter stage still has fuel, I dock with my Kerbin station and offload the extra fuel, drop the stage and carry on. Same with returning from the Mun or Minmus. Anything with more fuel than is needed will dock with a station to offload the extra fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes a bit of extra time, but you get to practice your rendezvous and docking, and the fuel slowly adds up.
