Luckily, my skills have progressed since then, and i am currently doing my first try at an Rendez-Vous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i have the second ship in close orbit to the other one (difference of 10km in Orbit height), and set the first ship as target.

In which direction should I burn, and how can i speed up my craft along its orbit, so it reaches the first ship?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have read the tutorial on the wiki, but i am a bit lost still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould any veteran help this little noob out?

So, if your target is ahead of you, you need to be in a lower orbit to catch up. Likewise, if your target is behind you, you need to switch to a higher orbit so it can catch up to you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t have to lower or raise both sides of your orbit, just one side, then watch the closest point of approach markers. If you are getting 50km closer each orbit and your target is 300km away at the approach, you\u0027ll rendezvous in six orbits. You can adjust your orbit higher or lower to speed that up or delay the rendezvous (waiting for daylight at the rendezvous point, maybe).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get to the point where you\u0027re passing within a few kilometers of the target, make sure your NavBall is in Target Mode and point at the yellow retrograde mark (which now shows your motion in respect to the target). Burn the engines until it shows zero m/sec. This matches your orbits closely enough that you won\u0027t zoom past and fly away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, point directly at the target and thrust a little bit to start drifting toward it. Don\u0027t build up too much speed. If you start to drift off course (and you will, starting from several kilometers away), you can steer back toward the target with RCS or by turning 90 degrees to use the main engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get within 100m or so, point retrograde to zero your relative velocity again.

That means if I\u0027m rendezvousing with a ship in orbit about another body, I make sure to make my capture higher or lower. If the other vessel is already in Kerbin orbit, I\u0027ll try to stay as low as I can. With a wide difference in orbits, you spend more dV to rendezvous, but you get a window every orbit or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfer windows occur when one vessel will pass the other within that orbit. As soon as that magical transfer orbit begins, you have about half an orbit to find a solution. All you have to do is create a maneuver node with prograde or retrograde dV that will push either your AP or PE to the exact height of the other orbit. By sliding the node forward and backwards in time, you can find the precise location to do your transfer burn. If your target\u0027s orbit is circular, you can set the prograde dV once and leave it as you look for a solution. If the target\u0027s orbit is more eccentric, you\u0027ll have to fiddle a bit more, but it\u0027s not hard at all to get a rendezvous that\u0027s within half of a km, as long as your orbits are co-planar. Set another node to match speed and you\u0027re gonna be close enough to ignore orbital mechanics!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb 2.0 is far too useful for this. If you customize an info window, you can see closest approach distance and time to closest approach at a glance. This makes it super easy to know when you\u0027ve got a transfer window, since MechJeb only looks at a single orbit. If the time to closest approach equals orbital period, you don\u0027t have a window this orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hapaxLegomina","CreatedById":57082,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T16:43:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Augustulus91\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Augustulus91\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have tried, and now my seperation at the next point is 7km , at the next it will be bigger, because i will have surpassed the first station. \u003Cp\u003EI tried retrograde burning (at the pink triangle) , first my velocity to \u0022target\u0022 drops at 110 km/s, but after that it increases again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn some way, i can never really catch it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick on velocity until you\u0027ve selected Target.

Surface is measuring your rV from the surface of whichever body you are in orbit around, Orbit is measuring, well, your orbit. The best way to see this is action is to toggle between the two immediately before and after you launch your ship. While you are on the pad your surface rV is 0m/s (you aren\u0027t moving relative to the surface), but because you are moving with Kerbin you already have a certain amount of orbital velocity (I can\u0027t remember the value offhand). Immediately after launch if you toggle between the two you\u0027ll see that the Surface prograde marker is straight up (the direction that will best increase your rV), while your Orbit prograde marker is off to the east (the direction that will best increase your orbital dV).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that I\u0027ve simplified this somewhat (rocket scientists please forgive me), but I don\u0027t think overly so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: A little more clarification. The surface rV seems to be measured from the point on the surface directly underneath your ship, so while a rocket\u0027s prograde marker is likely to read close to straight up, that\u0027s not the only possible direction.
