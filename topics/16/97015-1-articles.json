I think - until you are at LEAST comfortable getting a rocket to Mun and back - you play around in science mode. Not sandbox, because it\u0027s too easy to drown in the choices. Not career, because it\u0027s too hard to even get into orbit ever unless you play very well for a total beginner.

Not just docking and undocking ships? That would explain why I\u0027ve never seen it.
