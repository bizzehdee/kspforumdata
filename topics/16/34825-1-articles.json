Latitudes are fairly obvious; 90 degrees north is at the very top, and 0 is on the equator, but what are the longitudes measured from on the Mun. Here on earth we have the Geenwich meridian at 0 degrees, and everything is measured from there but I have no idea for the Mun, or for Kerbin either. Anyone know?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s.
