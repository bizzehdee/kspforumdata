It works for ships so no reason it wouldn\u0027t work for subassemblies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept it doesn\u0027t. They don\u0027t show up in the game. Anybody happen to know why and how to make it work?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found a workaround, put them in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E filer and then plop them in as subassemblies in the game.

I\u0027d not unlocked a part they all had and apparently that hides them.
