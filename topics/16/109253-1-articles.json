You want to steer this thing very gently and few degrees at a time. Basically, if you don\u0027t have fins the only way to steer your rocket is the engine gimbal which is usually not enough. You can enhance your steering authority by adding RCSs, reaction wheels or aerodynamic control surfaces (fins). What happens is as you start steering your rocket it has too much momentum to immediately change its heading so it continues flying upwards but this time the aerodynamic pressure on the top of your rocket forces it downward which results in increasing the \u0027angle of attack\u0027 which in turn exposes more area to the airflow. It snowballs after that.\n\nTo avoid that you should have something that will oppose the increasing aerodynamic pressure on the side of your rocket. As I said it can be RCS, reaction wheels or fins. The heavier your rocket the more steering authority you should have in order not to flip. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that TWR greater than 1.3 is bad. If it\u0027s ~2 or more then the chances of your rocket to flip increase up to nearly 100%.\n\n![an34rv0.png](http://i.imgur.com/an34rv0.png)\n\nMany who used stock aero before 1.0 still do the same thing - up to 10 km then 45 degree east and up till the desired height. This doesn\u0027t work this way now. I used FAR before and it it taught me the proper way of doing that.\n\n1. Have fins \u002B reaction wheels. Always.\n\n2. Have TWR less than 1.2 (max 1.5)\n\n3. Start turning earlier (6-7 km).\n\n4.

It is just a matter of getting your gravity turn right. I think people are still launching with 1.5 or 1.7 TWR. You would have to start your gravity turn right away almost to get that to work.\n\nI use 1.25 starting TWR and do my 5 degree kick at 70 meters per second. After that I just follow the center of the velocity vector. You can lag your VV to slow down your gravity turn, or lead to increase but I stay well within the circle the whole way. I use a 20km AP by 45 degrees as a milestone. (I want to have a 20km before I reach 45 degrees.) It isn\u0027t until I reach 30 kilometers in altitude that I leave the VV circle and when I do I leave it smoothly.\n\nWhen I first switched to NEAR (and later FAR but there was not a big difference) I had issues with my rockets flipping all the time. That is until I had experience doing it. With the new aero both V1 and V1.0.2 I have had almost no issues. It is very similar to how NEAR was and my launch profile is not much changed.\n\nReally I think the root cause was that the stock aero wasn\u0027t changed earlier and now everyone has to deal with the learning curve at release instead of before the bad habits got firmly intrenched. I made the switch to NEAR after only a month or so after I got the game so the vertical to 10k with a 45 degree turn never had a chance to become normalized.\n\nP.S. Just to be clear, you don\u0027t need fins, you don\u0027t need extra reaction wheels, you don\u0027t need to worry about your CG. It is just a matter of practice to get any reasonable rocket to orbit without flipping. I never worry about any of these things, and the fins, even the small ones makes it harder. Sure you don\u0027t flip, but you can\u0027t control your gravity turn easily.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T21:06:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 09:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Leszek**"},{"CreatedByName":"eataTREE","CreatedById":116601,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T21:13:53Z","Content":"I am having an enormous problem with this.
