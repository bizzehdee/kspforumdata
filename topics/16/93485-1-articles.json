A good practice to avoid this is to throttle down your engines to minimum thrust (no more than 25%) about 15 m/s from node completion to correct any minor errors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TythosEternal","CreatedById":117821,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T05:34:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say you have to burn 100 m/s in a specific direction, so you point your craft in that direction and light your engines. Thing is, you\u0027re just human and therefore you\u0027re not pointed EXACTLY in the right direction. You\u0027re pretty close though, so you do your burn and, for the most part, you are able to realize the majority of that delta-v vector. What\u0027s left--though it\u0027s a very small part--is pointed in the direction of the DIFFERENCE between your objective delta-v vector and your realized delta-v vector, which--by definition (if the burn is of similar magnitude and very close to the objective)--will be very near normal to either (that is, almost a full ninety degrees away).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s where that jump is coming from--by the time you\u0027ve nearly completed your burn, all that\u0027s left is the error. As explained above, this error can come from small differences between your objective and actual burn vectors. It can also from numerical sources, or as a result of the non-instantaneous nature of your maneuver, which means your ship isn\u0027t pointed exactly where it was when the maneuver was planned or when it began, because as you\u0027ve been burning your ship has still been flying around a curved conic section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution to these jumps, short of backing out and controlling a perfect pointing and tracking solution for an integrated burn, is to simply ignore the blue nav ball pointer once you near the end of your burn. Instead, watch for the moment where the burnometer (the name I just made up for the delta-v counter to the right of your nav ball) turns from red to green. That\u0027s KSP\u0027s way of saying, \u0022eh, close enough.\u0022 You can then cancel the remaining maneuver node, switch to map mode, and make any minor corrections that are needed. You can also ignore the moving blue pointer entirely, staying prograde (or whatever direction your initial burn was in) and controlling your burn from the map view instead, where you have more direct feedback regarding your maneuver\u0027s success (are you on course for your target SOI, periapsis for aerobraking, etc.). This is what I do when shooting for aerobraking periapsis several SOIs away, because it\u0027s confusing, frustrating, and a lot of work to fine-tune as many maneuver nodes as you\u0027d need to place to get that ain juuuuuuust right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
