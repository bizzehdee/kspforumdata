Once you\u0027ve got a good orbit (I like 8-10km just to be safe from mountains) drop a maneuver node, stretch it out till you get a mun escape, then pull the time around so the escape sends you out opposite Mun\u0027s orbit. This will minimize your Kerbin orbit PE. From here, increase the burn then adjust the time to keep your escape at the same angle an your Kerbin PE will shrink. Get it where you want and execute the node. If you do it right your Kerbin AP will be right around Mun\u0027s orbit, while the PE is wherever you want it.

We want to lower the periapsis of our orbit around Kerbin so that it\u0027s within Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere for an efficient return trajectory. However, there\u0027s a complicating factor: Our craft is not orbiting Kerbin directly, but is rather in orbit around the Mun, which is itself orbiting Kerbin. Thus, in order to lower our Kerbin-centered orbit\u0027s periapsis, we first have to raise our Mun-centered orbit\u0027s periapsis so that our craft escapes the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence in the correct direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out that the best way to do that looks something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9kvrHw7.png\u0022 alt=\u00229kvrHw7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to schedule a burn somewhere above the prograde-facing side of the Mun so that your Munar ejection is both parallel and retrograde to the Mun\u0027s direction of travel.
