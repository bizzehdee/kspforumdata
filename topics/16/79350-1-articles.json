Newb here, just picked this game up less than a week ago and I LOVE it... actually it would be more accurate to say that I am obsessed to a degree that makes me fear for my sanity, but I digress. Anyway, let me present the background for my question: I sent Thoemone the Kerbal to Minimus for Science, which mission went pretty well. I had plenty of delta-V left after ascent from Minimus, and so put Thoemone Kerman into an elliptical orbit with periapsis around 20km. So far, so good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen... I got impatient. And I had seriously overdesigned my Minimus rocket, so I had a ton of fuel remaining. And so at about 200km out I decided, hey, let\u0027s use this fuel before I separate the last stage, turned retrograde, and burned it off. Yes, that\u0027s right, I did a suicide burn, and accomplished the exact opposite of slowing down. Oops, well, I have no fuel left, nothing to be done about it now. Into the atmosphere we go at 2.5km/s straight down. And over the course of the next 20 seconds or so the atmosphere slows me from 2.5km/s to 250m/s, during which time I see the \u0022g-force\u0022 meter pin itself in the red at over 20G\u0027s. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E But slow down I did, so I fired my chutes, and splashed down apparently intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut... when I hit \u0022Recover Vessel\u0022, I didn\u0027t get most of my mission rewards -- just the science experiments that remained attached to the lander. And in the astronaut roster, Thoemone is no longer visible. It would appear that he was subjected to fatal deceleration!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now I know why they call it a \u0022suicide burn\u0022. My question is simple: how many G\u0027s can a Kerbal endure? It sucks to send them millions of miles through space, only to have them turn into red goo on the capsule floor upon re-entry -- what\u0027s the limit here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERuefully,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T18:09:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn stock, a Kerbal can sustain unlimited g-forces.
