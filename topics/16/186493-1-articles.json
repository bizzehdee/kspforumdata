This calls for for the Kerbal Universal Docking Adaptor, aka Advanced Grabbing Unit, aka The Klaw! In my previous career save I had the similar problem: I had several crafts (tugs) with a docking port but wanted to dock them to crafts without a docking port. So I sent up a small probe with several combinations of docking port and Klaw (you really only need these two parts (but make sure that the port faces the right way)), and then in turn grabbed my main space station with one of the Klaws and decoupled the docking port. And - voila - my space station had a couple more docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I then used those to dock my crafts to these docking ports, and disconnect the Klaw.
