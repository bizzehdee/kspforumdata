If not, then how can I do it?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been a while since I messed with this sort of thing much so I can\u0027t vouch for this, but I believe this might be possible. As RIC says, works like monopropellant in that the engines don\u0027t need to be attached to the tanks and all tanks drain at the same rate when the engine burns. However, I THINK that if you add fuel lines, you can override this. Could be wrong, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, whether that works or not, there\u0027s a better way that definitely works. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/tac-fuel-balancer-v1-0/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGet the TAC Fuel Balancer mod.\u003C/a\u003E This is EXTREMELY useful in many other situations, not just this one. Wonderful thing, much less clunky and flexible than the default right-click menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, once you have TACFB, you can set the tank you want to drain first to \u0022transfer out\u0022. Assuming all xenon tanks start full, nothing happens to start with. But as you burn the engine, the fuel from this 1 tank goes out to fill up the space created in all the other tanks. The result is that all the other tanks stay 100% full and all consumption comes from this 1 tank. You can do the same with monopropellant to preserve this in the upper stages while the lower stages are using RCS for maneuvering.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T15:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seriously doubt you can change anything on Xenon drawing by fuel lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can disable Xenon resource in some of tanks to prevent engines drawing from them, though. That may be useful if you have e.g. a Xenon-propelled probe on a Xenon-propelled ship and don\u0027t want the ship to draw from the probe\u0027s fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T00:36:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy disabling fuel use in the core tanks, you can make use of drop tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
