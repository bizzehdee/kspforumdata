Your new orbit will still touch Eve\u0027 s orbit on about the place where you had the encounter. Sooner or later, you will meet again in that place. This gives you plenty of wiggle room to tune the second encounter at -comparatively- little cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are calculators to get it right the first time -- once you have an idea where you need to be going, this is much easier to pull off than the above solution.
