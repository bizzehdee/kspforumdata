I have a refueling station usually at 100km orbit above Kerbin. I have the craft in question launch and dock with the station. It refuels there and waits for its launch window from that point. Then when the time comes I undock and continue on the mission.\n\n![PEmp3mn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PEmp3mn.jpg)\n\nNo that isnt a small SSTO, it is large enough to haul 25tons into orbit... its just that station is that big.
