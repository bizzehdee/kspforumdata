When Robotics were announced to be coming to the stock game I like many other players got excited for the possbilities that came along with these new mechanics/parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst I build a new station, with a collapsing solar array, you know that thing you\u0027ve wanted to do ever since seeing a small solar panel unfold? Did that, 1 in 3 times it unfolds successfully, rest of the time it summon\u0027s the kraken and destroys itself or the craft or both. The station itself suffers from the same thing from all it\u0027s fancy foldable parts, apparently all made from jello.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext I thought about making an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, thing hardly manages to get off the ground due to the engines causing so much torque on the hinge/robotics parts that any control / ability of to get it in the air is purely luck based rather than any level of skill (as much as Jeb would argue otherwise).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried different sizes, lower torque\u0027s,\u00A0different parts and it just comes down to parts that don\u0027t seem to actually function in the same realm of physics as the rest of the game, summoned from the kraken realm?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love this game, I have 1200 (recorded) hours on steam, I\u0027ve completed this game backwards and forwards, visited every planet with every concievable type of craft and enjoyed every minute of it. This sadly could be the straw that broke the camels back. Why introduce parts with such massive ramifications if using them in all but cosmetic/small use ways breaks your craft/mission?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis rings back to the days when you couldn\u0027t make the crafts/stations you wanted cause you\u0027d hit the lag/part limit, the feeling of frustration that even if you had a super computer your never gonna see your \u0022Dream\u0022 craft become reality due to lag. It\u0027s the same with these robotic parts, you might get 1 or 2 uses for novilties sake but you\u0027d be insane to actually rely on this parts as a part of a mission/craft, the risk of everything going stupidly wrong is too high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven I paid money for DLC that spoiled the game for me i have a somewhat sour taste in my mouth, I paid money and didn\u0027t get the many new hours of joy i wanted, instead i got disappointment and realisation that the best is over and seemingly this goes as \u0022ready for market\u0022 by the Kerbal devs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSad panda.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll keep a close eye on reddit/forums and I\u0027ve no doubt i\u0027ll pick around with the game now and then but you\u0027ve burst my kerbal bubble dev\u0027s.... and I couldn\u0027t just walk away without letting you know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess the question would be, is there any intention to address these \u0022wobble\u0022 / \u0022Jello\u0022 issues?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-08T08:32:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2019 08:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by osta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-09T20:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223631270\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186174\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221562574700\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107547\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022osta\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/8/2019 at 3:31 AM, osta said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRobotics - Every build results in kraken / sub-optimal performance of craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum, Osta!\u00A0 Sorry you\u0027re having problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll I can say is to look at the many examples folks have been making successfully.\u00A0 There are ways to make the robotics work quite well.\u00A0 You just have to learn their limitations.\u00A0 There are many discussions about that in the BG Discussion section.\u00A0 Here\u0027s a good place to start....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002277770\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8103360382\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/185189-what-is-possible-with-the-robotic-parts-thread/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-10T09:34:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve made tilt-rotors and rotating engine SSTOs and other craft without much trouble, as well as various collapsing/unfolding structures.

Take a break.\u00A0 When anything I do: Kerbal, Trumpet, Adobe Illustrator, kayaking, whatever... gets too frustrating, I just walk away for awhile.\u00A0 There is a certain point where you just cannot make any more progress, so best to give it some distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, I recently played a game called \u0022The Swapper.\u0022 It is an absolutely brilliant game, but I made the mistake a few times of continuing to hammer away at a puzzle I just could not get. Fool that I was, I did not take into account that it was past midnight, and my brain was not firing on all cylinders.

The trick is to use autostrut (and rigid attachment) to make each moving part strong and solid, and to use a servo or hinge that\u2019s strong enough for the job. You can autostrut a servo or a hinge as long as you don\u2019t cross it. I believe they fixed autostrut so this doesn\u2019t happen anymore in 1.7.2, so you can safely use it now - it just might not work quite like you expect if you don\u2019t know about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
