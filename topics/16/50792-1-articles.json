To raise your apoapsis you want to burn prograde on the opposite side of the orbit from where you want your apoapsis to be. Getting the timing is pretty easy if you plot a manoeuvre node to raise your apoapsis and then drag it around your orbit until you get a Mun encounter. You can then tweak the manoeuvre node to get the periapsis at the encounter to the desired height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you reach Mun you will probably want to circularize your Mun orbit by burning retrograde at your Mun periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might run into trouble if your orbit around Kerbin isn\u0027t equatorial since your apoapsis may pass too high over or under Mun. In these cases, if you click on and target Mun you will get two markers on your orbit for AN and DN, the ascending node and descending nodes. These are the point were your orbit crosses the orbit of you target, the Mun. To adjust your orbital plane to match the Mun\u0027s you can plot a manoeuvre node at one of these points to burn normal or anti-normal (pink triangle markers on the manoeuvre node).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallace","CreatedById":77574,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T13:30:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always aim to put the apoapsis about 45 degrees in front of the Mun\u0027s current position.
