It enters a slow spin that I cannot stop, and SAS cannot stop. RCS thrusters are active. I can see them firing, but they don\u0027t affect the ship in any way. Why? I understand that I changed my center of mass, so control will be different, but the way that the RCS thrusters do absolutely nothing makes me think that this might be some kind of bug. Is this a bug or is this a design flaw on my part?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T01:07:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I had an errored occillation once before. I think it is a bug. Try giving a blip to the time lapse which disables the physics sim momentarily. Doing this usually stabilizes mine at which point is typically will control normal. Also, sometimes try hopping back to space centre momentarily to reload the model.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pfpants","CreatedById":72702,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T01:13:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not certain what is causing the spinning, but I can tell you what I would do to troubleshoot it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, make sure you click \u0022control from here\u0022 on the command module. Second, since the RCS thrusters on the lander aren\u0027t aligned with those on the command module, I would disable them all (right click \u0022disable rcs port\u0022). And third, I would put the brakes on (click the brake icon at the top of the screen). There may be no merit to putting the brakes on, but I hate seeing wheels spinning and thinking it may be turning my lander somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then if you need to kill rotation, you can always accelerate time and it will freeze your craft in position.

Make sure you\u0027re controlling the command module FROM the command module for the transfer, that should solve the vast majority of the issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
