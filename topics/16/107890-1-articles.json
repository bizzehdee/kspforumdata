Also comes in real handy if/when you want to start puttering around with spaceplanes. It is mostly working in 1.0.2 though for best results (for the moment anyway) you\u0027ll want blizzy78\u0027s toolbar as well. \n\nI\u0027ve generally found that the Apollo-style, 4 multi-directional thrusters on the CoM works best. Now, if you\u0027ve got a massive vessel that doesn\u0027t turn particularly easily, you might want to consider sets on either end to assist with rotation (and RCS Build aid would help you position them with a minimal amount of unintentional torque). By and large though, for docking purposes you\u0027ll want RCS mainly for translation, and that works best with sets near the CoM.\n\nI might also suggest NavyFish\u0027s [Docking Port Alignment Indicator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901-0-90-Docking-Port-Alignment-Indicator-%28Version-6-1-Updated-03-07-2015%29) as another vastly useful mod when it comes to simplifying the docking process. That one is definitely supported in 1.0.2, and it makes docking much easier; when he featured that mod, Scott Manley put the interface over the navball because he didn\u0027t need it with DPAI in action - that\u0027s how useful it is."},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Jim","CreatedById":142312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T18:42:23Z","Content":"I docked without any mods.

I have had very good luck using the small structural pylons (the tiny, thin scaffolding in the structure tab) as a way to extend RCS thrusters out farther from the ship. This is very effective.\n\nGive it a shot, OP. If you have 4 RCS thrusters, directly over the Center of Mass, extended out from the hull by a few meters with scaffolding, you gain a massive amount of maneuverability that tends to be very predictable and easy to control. I find doing anything different ends up confusing me quite a bit, resulting in wasted RCS and sometimes multiple attempts to dock."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:44:59Z","Content":"I do RCS placement in stages, balanced and based on CoM.

Just bear in mind that when you put that the mod will tell you you\u0027ve got torque after you set the first quad of thrusters on the end of the craft, and then the challenge becomes finding a spot on the other end that cancels out the torque. If you run out of craft, put the second set of thrusters as far down as you can get them and start adjusting the position of the first set. It\u0027s an interative process.\n\nSomething else you might want to check is torque levels based on the various reference points - there\u0027s a button marked Reference that\u0027ll let you switch between CoM and DCoM. If you have no torque on both reference points, you can rely on your craft to be completely controllable under all circumstances. If not - and this happens usually when you can\u0027t get the CoM to not shift - you\u0027ll need to base your thruster placement on which Reference point best matches the intended condition of the craft when you go to dock it. If your goal is to dock a full fuel module, it\u0027ll probably still have most of its mass, so you use CoM. If your goal is to dock a nearly empty space capsule, you\u0027re probably going to want to use DCoM. SAS becomes necessary if and only if your craft is in a state between the two.\n\nNow, for SAS planning - use your two reference points and find where and in what direction the greatest amount of torque RCS Build aid is telling you will occur with the design. Take the amount of torque and multiply it by 1.5 - that\u0027s how much counter-torque you\u0027ll need to have available with SAS units. Reaction wheels provide 5 kNm of counter-torque, Stabilizers provide 15, and Big ASAS provides 30. Add what you need and then re-balance your ship\u0027s RCS.\n\nHopefully that\u0027s all helpful; just like anything else in KSP, there\u0027s a lot of factors to consider when it comes to RCS placement, but it gets easier to know about how to set things up after you\u0027ve gained some experience. Best of luck."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T13:30:34Z","Content":"My experience says that placing RCS thrusters equidistant from CoM is more reliable than placing them on CoM. The reason is that CoM shifts as you burn your fuel/oxidizer/monopropellant. When time comes to translation the thrusters that had been perfectly placed on \u0027wet\u0027 CoM suddenly apply parasite torque to your craft since the \u0027dry\u0027 CoM has shifted. The farther your thrusters from the CoM (provided they are symmetrically placed) the easier the translation would be. Of course, you will spend more monopropellant this way but in nearly all situations you don\u0027t spend all your monopropellant anyway, personally I bring more than half back home every time."},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T13:57:53Z","Content":"I would like a button to stop RCS from working with rotation on demand.\n\nEdit: And more on topic: Where - if really - is the difference in putting the thrusters on top and bottom, left and right instead of diagonally?
