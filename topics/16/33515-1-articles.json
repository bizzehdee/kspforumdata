This is what it looked like when docked with the space station:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921265785248806859/93AA6783D867FE6DC25CA2B2802D71712143E1D1/\u0022 alt=\u002293AA6783D867FE6DC25CA2B2802D71712143E1D1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee the bit of \u0022debris\u0022 in that shot? That\u0027s not debris, it\u0027s my main engine. I detached it on purpose so that I could pick up a fuel tank, disconnect from the station, and then using RCS only (since I don\u0027t have my engine), connect the engine up again to the end of the fuel tank, and thus now have my craft with a heavy amount of fuel to take my heavy payload to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I encountered a problem. The sr docking port is really weak at resisting twisting. It doesn\u0027t have much rigidity and so when I would try to rotate my assembled-in-space vessel, it would almost break off the fuel tank as in this screenshot below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921265785248796752/39ED649FF03D351FB6E29D14F077F6F0FC04D5B0/\u0022 alt=\u002239ED649FF03D351FB6E29D14F077F6F0FC04D5B0\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s just from trying to rotate with capsule torque wheels that\u0027s it.
