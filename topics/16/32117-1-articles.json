(That was probably confusing but hopefully you got it.) At that point burn propogade to escape, and you should move into an ellipticall orbit with apoapsis at mun level, and a fairly low periapsis that you can adjust to suit yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your last question, it is more efficient to travel from the mun to minmus, but as max warp speeds can be quite low in mun orbit and the mun minmus window doesn\u0027t come round very often, it might be more convenient to just return to kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps. feel free to ask any more questions!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"entaran","CreatedById":67823,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T08:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tend to burn \u003Cstrong\u003Ep\u003C/strong\u003Erograde as kerbin is \u0022setting\u0022 (as i zoom around the side of the moon), seems to use less dv to get back.

And you can drop your periapsis even more and make your orbit around Kerbin suborbital or even retrograde, extending the range even further (of course you need to plan your ejection burn correctly to not hit Kerbin). So clearly there\u0027s dependency between the angle at which you need to eject and effectivity you can reach, some angles being very effective and some angles being very ineffective. I\u0027ll need to experiment with it a little when I get home.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis (and your more detailed analysis in the next post) is essentially what I did. I literally just looked at the map and figured \u0022Kerbin will be about here when the transfer needs to take place, and I\u0027ll want to burn this way, so I want my periapsis about here.\u0022 I then left Minmus when it was 180 degrees away from that and (with the added complexity of a mun encounter. seriously. Every time I tried this I think Mun got in the way) then when the time came, I found my guesstimations were off by up to 20-30 degrees. I did the burn anyway and still got huge fuel savings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a Kethane (Or now Karbontie) operation at Minmus, you can essentially just build your ship so it can get to Minmus. Once it\u0027s there and you fill the tanks, it can literally get anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Changed the phrase \u0022literally eyeballed\u0022 to \u0022literally looked at\u0022 because I realized that literally eyeballing something is just gross.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-22T21:11:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2014 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
