Or so I think\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe terrain is rather rolling and uneven, which can lead to the spaceship tipping when it hits the ground\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo oxygen (duh!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploring the planet can eat up some serious amount of fuel, so 3 km/s of dV seems to be the minimum\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEngines\u003C/strong\u003E: That design has aerospikes, which have good thrust, are short and perform well in Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere. However, they lack gimbal - and we already have little control, so a thrust vectoring engine can be a good idea. But is there an engine that can achieve good fuel efficience (the dV target for such a ship should be above 3 km/s IMHO)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried nukes, but their increase in ISP is negated by their weight, their large size (which makes them even more likely to crash into the ground during landing), and their pitiful thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECutting horizontal speed:\u003C/strong\u003E It looks like retrorockets are a must. I\u0027ve used two radially mounted Twitch, but they have too little thrust. The one with nukes I\u0027ve tried (not pictured, it uses 3 nervs) has four but, again, they take to long to cut horizontal velocity. I was thinking about adding terriers instead, or even a forward facing aerospike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EControl\u003C/strong\u003E: RCS, lots of it, as well as reaction wheels. That spaceship I\u0027ve posted completely lacks vernors, and that\u0027s a mistake. Rover wheels for use in the ground also seem like a good idea, since I usually overshoot my landing destination. But the landing gears and firing up the engines work well anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELanding:\u003C/strong\u003E Well, I think this is the harder part of HOTOL vehicles in Duna. Aerobreaks help, but they don\u0027t slow down a lot. There is also the matter of tipping when hitting the ground, so I think the medium (or large) landing gears are better than the smaller ones, despite the extra weight. I usually design the landing gears with a tricycle arrangement, but I often find ships tipping forward and, when the forward gear hits, the ship tips violently towards some side, which leads to breaking the wings. Would four gears instead of three help improve things?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParachutes are needed to bring the ship to a halt once it hits the ground (again, I\u0027ve missed those in this ship) but they can\u0027t be used to slow down before touch down (well, they can, but that tends to lead to an unplanned disassembly). Also, that means an engineer must be among the crew in order to repack them later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other option is to spam vernors and make a vertical landing (or use any other engine arrangement for that). So, kill H/S with a retrorocket, land vertically. But then the question is: if it\u0027s landing vertically, if you want to get the wheels into the air ASAP when taking off, and you don\u0027t get too much out of aerodynamic control surfaces anyway, why bother to attach wings to the thing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, ideas, thoughts, opinions, hints?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T02:56:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should take a look at this recent tutorial, it may have some additional tips for you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/131809-Flying-on-Duna-in-1-0-4-Some-General-Guidelines\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlying on Duna in 1.0.4 Some General Guidelines\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T03:33:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, Kelderek linked my post (not really a tutorial, just guidelines) so I don\u0027t have that much more to say, just emphasize a few points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna and Kerbin are totally different environments so something that flies well on Duna might not fly at all on Kerbin, and something that can fly on Kerbin might be able to reenter and fly around on Duna but probably won\u0027t be able to land safely (except in a few, isolated places).

It\u0027s the ratio of lift value from the wing parts to the mass of the ship that\u0027s important. I don\u0027t recommend going lower than about 1.4 lift/ton or your landing speed will be dangerously high (for STOL) or your landing accuracy will suffer (for parachute STOVL).\u003Cp\u003EThis ratio of lift to mass reinforces a practical upper limit on plane size that is imposed originally by the terrain. The bigger the plane, the more likely it is to high-center its belly on a bump, or for a wingtip to catch a bump and flip the rest of the plane or just break off. Thus, Duna favors relatively small plane dimensions, which means that if your plane is heavy, you\u0027ll want to go with layers of wings to keep the wingspan down while still having sufficient lift. The problem there, however, is that short wingspans mean low leverage for the control surfaces, while the higher mass of the plane requires more force to change its direction, so you start running into real problems with control authority at low speeds. You might end up needing RCS to suppliment your aerodynamic control surfaces, which adds more mass, which means more wing, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say this because aerospikes and their fuel are heavy so having several of them will present problems. But planes don\u0027t need much at all in the way of thrust to achieve hypersonic speeds. I\u0027d bet that you could make a perfectly good Duna SSTO with just 1 aerospike on the back and some of the small orange radial engines on the nose for braking when landing.

Duna at ground level is more or less like flying at ~15-20km on kerbin, its enough to do something, but unless you have excessive wing area, expect alot of lithobraking, which in itself is quite tough to actually do without breaking apart (Duna is notorious for uneven ground in 90% of teh entire planet, and even flat looking area have alot of what id call death jumps, areas where the terrain will send u into the air slightly, and if ur speed isnt high enough to maintain lift, but also isnt low enough to stop u from going airborne, itll whack u into the ground behind hill at rather high velocity. Then again, ive landed on duna a few times in a laythe/kerbin designed SSTO, ofc my landing speed was ~200m/s, and at that speed it took a few quicksaves before i managed to survive the ordeal. That SSTO was ~20 tons heavy, and has ~6 or so total lift area (not counting the vertical tail surfaces). If you come across a death jump, blast ur engine for a split second to help cut or vertical velocity down so u dont slam into the ground at \u0026gt;50m/s vertical speed. Aside from that, if you can manage a flat area, braking is usually workeable, if slowish. Once below 50m/s you are safe unless u fly off a mountain since the death jumps seem most dangerous around 100m/s where you dont have any more lift whatsoever, but are going fast enough to get slammed into the ground rather badly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, ive found lift area and control surfaces to be better then airbrakes in every situation (and aside from a few tests when they were released i dont even use airbrakes for anything except drop pod style escape pods, as in no parachute retrorocket pod, that lithobrakes, but the airbrakes are needed to not go into ground at 500m/s). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh, and if you can make one that works well, and is balanced, VTOL makes every landing a joke in terms of difficyulkty, only issue is that it needs to be very balanced CoM wise, and you need to have more fuel to drag those extra VTOL drives on a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, one question, what do you gusy reccomend for engines? Aerospikes have the bets ISP for a LFO engine (and unless u need higher thrust are pretty good mass wise too, 1.5t is nothing now when jets are 2 tons now), but nukes seem to have so much more ISP that even if you spend forever climbing, they seem to work well. Its getting to the pojnt i feel nukes are the only viable engine is KSP for general purpose non atmo work (tylo aside ofc).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T02:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, one question, what do you gusy reccomend for engines?

Ofc the longer you burn, the more fuel u are using to do teh maneuver, but arent nukes just the only viable engine to use for this situation due to sheer difference in ISP? (id die for a shorter nuke that doesnt look bad on SSTOs). That and ions ofc, but whos going to have 50 ion engines on one craft? Well maybee im not that patient, but i cant stand and less then 2KN thrust per ton of craft, that means 30t is the absolute max ill even touch with a single nuke, unless its a super short burn in the 1st place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
