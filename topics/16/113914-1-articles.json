Since the heat is still turned off (as far as I know) for ISRU and such, engine heat and/or heat from being exposed to the Sun will be your primary concerns."},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T00:30:01Z","Content":"They\u0027re also useful on reentry.

The temperature indicators for the solar panels showed up briefly and then went away as I got into thicker atmosphere. Might have to do more tests to see if very low melt temperature parts like the goo pods will survive."}]}
