I have three of the four main modules up, and kind of connected, I am using two docking ports on long truss\u0027 to lock the four main modules together, however, if i am not 100% exact with the vertical axis, i get a lock with one, and the second docking collar floats. Is there a way other than undocking and going back for round two? I have a hell of a shortage of RCS fuel and i hate resetting flights just because the end doesnt click in. I hope i have explained enough, if not, please yell at me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E, and I will supply more. Thanks Folks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** Edit ** Well, I sent up the fourth core module and decided to attempt docking one to another, doing that to the other pair, and then work them together, to make a 2X2 \u0027Main Station Motor Module\u0027 It appears to have worked well, except I have two floating collars, they do not float much, and I only noticed when I lined it up for a screenshot.

I use three-way docking ports which offer excellent stability even on huge installations... 2 will still have flex in one direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-docking them is usually very easy though and uses only a tiny amount of fuel. Firstly, place the whole station on a North or South heading (assuming you have an equatorial orbit). Undock the section and just give it one tiny blast of RCS directly backwards. As you float out, rotate as required (not using RCS) and again a tiny burst back in. Should be all on 1 tap of RCS back and 2-3 to reverse direction back in. May take a couple of goes to get it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor future designs I really recommend 3-way docking ports... they remove a lot of flex in every direction. Getting the line-up right first time is also the easiest way - make sure you\u0027re coming in straight not at a slight angle (even if it would work), stop, rotate till perfectly aligned, adjust your approach angle as necessary then come on in to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T05:59:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get the first port docked, is the second port more or less in the correct position, just not docked, or is it significantly off?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s close (i.e. the first port docked and dragged the second into position) then you can undock, immediately go to the space center, go to the tracking station, and return to your vessel. This process will reload both vessels into full physics but will not give them time to move significantly. They\u0027ll immediately redock and the second port will connect as intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the second port is off a bit, there\u0027s not a lot you can do other than to undock and attempt to redock in the indended orientation. It should be fairly straightforward to do this though, since you\u0027re already in position for one port. Unfortunately, to get the original port to function normally after undocking you will need to go through the process I outlined above to get it to reload into physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done something similar to this several times when building motherships. I place docking ports on trusses using 4x symmetry and then build a grid of ships that are locked in place by up to 8 separate docking ports. That\u0027s the intent anyway. Getting 4 docking clamps to engage simultaneously has never happened for me. I get 3 all the time, but the 4th just won\u0027t connect. It\u0027s strange really, since to get 3 of them connected the 4th has to be in the right spot at the right time, but the game disagrees. It\u0027s definitely possible - I\u0027ve done it on the ground with more highly constrained setups, but in orbit, no dice for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E You can always send an RCS resupply vehicle to transfer fuel around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HamekEisenfaust","CreatedById":59979,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T11:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jason Patterson\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jason Patterson\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I get 3 all the time, but the 4th just won\u0027t connect.
