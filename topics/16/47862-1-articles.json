This is because your speed is going to be different each time and just a few hundred m/s makes a profound difference on what you get aerobraking at a given Pe altitude. Then, as others have mentioned, there\u0027s the other variable, the orbit you want to end up in. There\u0027s an utter and complete lack of in-game instrumentation for aerobraking and off-line calculators are only rough guesses due to the variables involved. Therefore, you have no choice but to F5, set your Pe at your best guess, and see what happens. If you don\u0027t like what you get, F9, tweak the Pe, and try again. And make your final Pe tweak about 2x the atmosphere diameter because it\u0027s more accurate that way and you probably have room to reverse directions and tweak back if you overshoot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
