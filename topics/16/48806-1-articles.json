I always figured Throughput was the rate of successful transmission; with ratings of 0.8, 0.6 and 0.4 for the antennae- as they\u0027re unlocked- does this mean they actually get WORSE? If so, why would I even bother using the 88-88?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T04:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt does sound worse!
