On most bodies, you can use the maneuver nodes to get yourself into the area you want to land, and the closer you are (so the less time the planet has to rotate), the more accurate you can get. With some practice you can land very close to where you want to land just using map mode and maneuver nodes until switching to ship mode for the final landing burn.\n\nBut with Gilly and Pol (and maybe others?) what you see in map mode is not what you get in ship mode. You can crash into the surface even when map mode shows you way above the surface. You can also be shown on the surface in map mode but actually be a couple of km above the surface."},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T23:16:58Z","Content":"Might be right, might be wrong, I don\u0027t know but for atmo...

Thanks.\n\nLets say you were going to land on the Mun and you are traveling at 20k making your radius 220km. The circumference of your orbit is then 1382.6km. Each degree is then 3.83km\n\nIf you are traveling 540 m/s along the equator, and your craft can accelerate at 1 g, then it takes 55 seconds of horizontal velocity to stop all horizontal or rotational vector. \n\ndistance travel = 1/2 a \\* t^2 14.877, (correct formula is =V\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003ET \u002B 1/2AT^2^, but magnitude is exactly the same as traveling from a dead stop to 540 m/s) therefore you will travel about 3.9degrees when decelerating full along the horizontal vector. If you know the targets longditude you can begin decelerating about 3.9 degrees before you reach it. The lead degrees increases at higher latitudes along the 090, because the span per degree gets smaller. The degrees decrease accurately to about 045 or 135 (prograde) because the distance traveled per degree increases. So for instance if you are crossing the equator at 45 degrees you would begin the retro 2.7 degrees before the targets longditude, and 2.7 degrees before its latitude. \n\nIf you are traveling at more than 045 or less than 135 you need to set targets latitude coordinate as your primary trigger. \n\nAlso since you are burning horizontal the craft will fall according to 1/2 grav T^2. Since grav is 1.63 you will travel 2.5 km downward (a little less because of curvature) and be traveling 89 m/s meaning at 1 g it will take you 11 seconds or 500 meters meaning that the burn will need to end at least 3000m below a flat horizontal start. Thus you should not attempt a horizontal burn unless you have more than 1g accel and are at least 3000m above the target points true altitude. Of course you probably won\u0027t know this unless you have mech jeb or some other program (or you have a flag planted with its elevation in its name). This assumes that at the end of the horizontal burn you immediately point up and burn, if not you can add 100m per second travel to this in the time it takes to reorient the craft. \n\nIt is actually most efficient to calculate this along the retro surface velocity vector starting from a minimal orbit (say 250 to 500meter above the minimum) and burn retro surface velocity down to around 200 meters, then a final 2 second burn a few meters up. Its also very risky, but represents the least amount of time fighting gravity. The orbit above starts at 20,000 and would be suitable for a landing between 15,000 and 16,500 meter altitude(true), there are none of these on the mun. Landing in a crater generally will require a starting retro altitude of much lower 5000-8000 meters. The problem is that there are terrain around the craters at this altitude so you would need to create an elliptical orbit with a periapsis close to the retroburn point that will have slightly more velocity. Alternatively you can do a small retro burn at the maximum terrain elevation that then bring your craft down a few thousand feet before you start your retro. Programs like MechJeb give some of the transition points (different from the above but relative) is you use the landing guidance ap. You can also plant flags and put the biomes, elevations, even the longditude in the flag name, and show the flags in mapview. I used to do this, and also I would find the flattest near-by spot to plant the flag, that why when I return with my expensive geared out lander I am going to have a safe landing."},{"CreatedByName":"Vegvisir","CreatedById":148279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T01:58:05Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never been able to really do it.
