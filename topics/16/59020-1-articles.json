If not you might be losing control due to not have any power (by the sounds of it you do not have an engine that generates power). I would put solar panels and a battery on it, or a generator if you have it unlocked in career or are playing in sandbox. Probes use power even if they are not doing anything, so if your engine does not generate power to recharge it it is dead in the water.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"irongut","CreatedById":97315,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T12:13:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELiowen is probably right but in case you have an electrical supply...
