I can\u0027t time-warp again because it says that the ship is under acceleration... Another thing, I staged off a huge lifting stage, and as I watched it sail away, it exploded into a bunch of different pieces without any visual fire/explosion. It just separated. It could be a mod, maybe MechJeb or TAC Self Destruct but I\u0027m not sure.
