And it seems the larger the craft the more violent the shudder. So violent that the ship explodes. This is my current project. Its a large Duna base and this thing explodes on the pad atleast 50% of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/576750379737406100/D80BFE11CCD8FCCA804AFCBE160DB479F165DC96/\u0022 alt=\u0022D80BFE11CCD8FCCA804AFCBE160DB479F165DC96\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have these camera rovers all around KSC equipped with the Lazor camera that can track. And along with Romfarer I extend the load distance to 100km and I watch all my rockets take off from the ground and all the way to orbit. So I have to switch to these rovers to toggle the cameras and once I switch back to the rocket BOOM. Half the time atleast. So does anyone else experience this? Anything that can cause it? I tried with a default draw distance, no Romfara and cameras. Still does it. Even when I come off of warp it has a high chance to explode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazro","CreatedById":55825,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T01:55:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Kraken strikes back!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason is that when physics loads, the rocket accelerates from N/A to 175 m/s.

I stopped having the problem with parts falling off the tanks. I have struts clipped inside and the rocket does just find after launch. It\u0027s just when it\u0027s on the pad the things a ticking time bomb. I tried more support. More struts, more clamps. It helped, but the damn thing still detonates catastrophicly if I switch to and from vessels to activate cameras. So what I do is I switch vessels under time warp then drop to x1. It helps, but again id say 50% of the time when coming out of warp BOOM.

Couple of things you can do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd more clamps, and have them at different levels of the rocket (MOST IMPORTANT)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5m fuel tanks are definitely dodgy, especially their joint with the engine... moar struts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above got me to a point whereby the rocket wouldn\u0027t shake itself to pieces completely, however, on occasion parts would still break. The final thing that got this sorted for me was immediately turning off gimballing when the physics loads. Not sure why but i found doing this via an action group reduced the duration of any shaking/swaying. See below latest creation, took a lot of playing with struts and supports, but can get it up 100% of the time now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/45N4AAl.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/45N4AAl.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHans\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
