I flew to the moon. He took with him a thermometer. Measure the temperature. Landed back on Krebin. But the contract was not counted. What would it do to fulfill this contract ??? In the contract the following points are indicated: 1) Transport experiment to Mun 2) Satisfy all experiment (check experiment for details) 3) Complete experiment 4) Landbin or splash completed experiment on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-26T05:53:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/197228-vadym/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022197228\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/197228-vadym/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Vadym\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually temperature experiments need to be done in a specific location. If you go to the Mun in the tracking station and double click it you should be able to see some thermometer icons.

I hear about him for the first time. I accurately kept the thermometer readings. I kept both the empty value and the value when there were glasses of science.
