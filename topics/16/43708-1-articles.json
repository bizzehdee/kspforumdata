Is there any way to move/rescale objects like VAB, monoliths, arches around by editing game files or using some tools? Precisely I\u0027d like to make the cave(you know which one) a lot larger. How could that be achieved? They aren\u0027t terrain, in most cases, if I remember correctly, so maybe they are \u0022configurable\u0022 to some extent?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T15:26:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo sorry I dont think so. Only the slider in optons that controls the count. Someone else might know something I don\u0027t though.
