I had completed my contract and had driven to a new biome nearby for sciency reasons. I parked on a fairly steeply inclined crater edge to collect the science and I quicksaved there. Upon trying to leave the area and get back to level ground, I wound up flipping my rover. I reloaded the quicksave and upon loading the rover launched itself hundreds of feet in the air. Er, vaccuum. The rover itself actually survived that first one, but nearly all the underslung storage batteries were destroyed.I finally got one that seemed to survive completely intact, and I quicksaved it, which was immediately followed by a game crash. Upon reload, that save too launched itself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInvestigating the incident, I found a thread regarding a jumping minmus base, which suggested part of the base was clipping into the ground, and careful observation is telling me that is what\u0027s happening here. It loads fine, but for a split second before it throws the rover, it seems to be half-buried in the ground. Following advice I found elsewhere, I used the cheat console and turned off crash damage. However something seems to have happened and the rover is glitching now. The wheels never stop turning, even with motor power turned off to them. Unfortunately my many reloads have erased the quicksaves made just prior to descending on this ridge, so I\u0027m stuck with the non-functional wheels, or the save game I made immediately before driving the rover away from the lander.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way to reset the wheels, or something else I can do to get it functioning properly? Or should I eat the 3 hours of lost gameplay?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-15T14:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about cheating a replacement? \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starchaser","CreatedById":139724,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-15T14:11:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally I don\u0027t like cheating, but in this case I would make an exception as I\u0027m trying to recover from a glitch.

And naming your quicksaves is wise, because they don\u0027t get overwritten that way. And jumping seems to have a lot to do with the slope of the terrain you are parked on. If it\u0027s more than 15 degrees, you could have a jumping problem. If it\u0027s less, you probably won\u0027t have any problem at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yes, build a new rover in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E that has a few small engines, a probe core, and a tiny tank of fuel on it.
