I recently picked up KSP again after having not played since... .19? ish? Was interested in trying out the new career mode. I\u0027ve done a few flights, orbited with my tiny selection of parts and wimpy little launch pad, but I am having a bunch of trouble figuring out how to upgrade my facilities. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s something I am looking right past, but I am just not seeing it. Google search hasn\u0027t been helpful and the wiki is down at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone care to offer a bit of quick feedback for me?
