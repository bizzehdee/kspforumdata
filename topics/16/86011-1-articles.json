I have \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPLENTY\u003C/span\u003E of electricity (literally, thousands of units, and transmitting only uses a tiny fraction of that), and I am using the highest gain antenna. So when I do an EVA or crew report, it will say I can recover 100% of the data by transmitting. Say I\u0027ll get 60 science. However, when I transmit, most of the time I get like 14. Or 20. Or some random fraction of the amount I was supposed to get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo afterwards, I can do the same crew report or EVA again, and it will say, this time, I\u0027ll get like 6.4 science, with 100% transmit value. So, I\u0027ll transmit, and instead get like 1.3 science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t always happen either. Back when I was doing this career\u0027s round of Mun exploration, I found that if I used the monopole antenna (the straight one), I\u0027d have this problem, but if I used the cylindrical antenna, I\u0027d get all of the science I was supposed to get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWTH is going on? The only mod I use is Mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"QuesoExplosivo","CreatedById":102949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T00:48:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you running x32?
