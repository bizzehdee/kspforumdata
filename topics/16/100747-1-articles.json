By the way, I\u0027m playing a FAR career game on a tight budget. It\u0027s waaaay too wide to fit in a Mk3 spaceplane, and any attempt to slap it on top of a rocket, even a very big one, ended in disaster. Waaay too top-heavy, or top-draggy rather (which tends to make your rocket want to fly backwards in FAR).\n\nSo in despair, and for Science, I sandwiched the offending hardware between four of the biggest boosters the game has to offer. I added a couple of deluxe winglets, more for peace of mind than out of real conviction that my ploy might actually work. Then I hit Launch....

Explains why that Mun-transfer stage was still practically full in Mun orbit.\n\nYou can get to Minmus, land and come back with that capsule AND Materials Bay plus 2 Goo Containers (all of which capable of safely landing back on Kerbin) for about 16k in parts. \n\nConsider using 4 boosters instead of 3, staged to drop in pairs (just set them up with different thrust percentages) and getting rid of that triple engine lower stage core for a single line of engine \u002B fuel tanks. In fact, if I remember correctly you can even use BACCs instead of those S1 SRB-KD25ks.\n\nAs it is, it looks like you\u0027re spending a ton of fuel and credits to get a large middle stage (with 3 engines and several half-full fuel tanks) into orbit and then a near-full transit stage to Mun orbit.\n\nJust try and send something ridiculously small to Minmus and back: it takes all of 2x RT-10, 1 LV-909 and 1 FL-T400 to put in orbit a probe capable of going to Minmus, landing and getting back WITHOUT ion engines. Grow from there.
