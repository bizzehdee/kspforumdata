Every maneuver you make is altering your orbit by a specific velocity. If you\u0027re in low orbit around Kerbin and want to flyby the Mun, you need to change your velocity by about 860m/sec. To turn your flyby into an orbit around the Mun, you have to spend another 210m/sec. To land from orbit, it\u0027s 640m/sec.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-v is literally \u0022change in velocity\u0022 expressed mathematically, and is used to determine, more or less, just where you craft can go and where it can\u0027t. Using the example above, if your ship has only a total capability of 1200m/sec remaining when in Kerbin orbit, it can orbit the Mun but it can\u0027t land on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T18:17:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s effectively range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn space there\u0027s no friction so you keep on going forever so it doesn\u0027t make much sense to measure range in meters. Instead what you\u0027re interested in is how you can get to an orbit further out. Orbits further out have more energy so you add to your vessel\u0027s energy by increasing speed. DeltaV is the amount of energy you need to/can add to change your speed by the given amount at that point in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T19:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn even simpler way to look at it is to think of it as the fuel gauge in a car. 0Dv= no maneuvers. There are mods such as mech jeb and kerbal engineer that will compute your Dv for you. Dv takes into account all velocity changes. For example, to go from 0m/s to 100m/s takes 100dv, but to go from 0 to 100 back to 0m/s takes 200dv. If you want to calculate it manually, you can use Tsiolkovsky\u0027s (you\u0027ll probably butcher the pronunciation) rocket equation. The equation is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDv=Ve*Ln(M0\\M1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDv= delta v\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVe= effective exhaust velocity (see below)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELn= natural logarithm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EM0= initial total mass including propellent (in KSP, just its mass)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EM1= empty or dry mass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you use this equation for each stage.

In theory it can do a burn and travel to, say, the Andromeda Galaxy, it is only that it will take millions of year to get there.
