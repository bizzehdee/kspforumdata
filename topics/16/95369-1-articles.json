As you do each burn, watch the periapsys (or closest approach) and how it changes with each burn. (Mouse over in map view, then left-click to keep it up). You will find that each burn will either make the periapsis GROW (get further away) or SHRINK (get closer). Do longer burns on the ones that SHRINK the periapsis (or closest approach) and stop burning when the value quits SHRINKING. Then repeat for the other directions. You will soon learn that one direction will have a much bigger effect than all the others. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you have an encounter, use the TAB key to focus the view on the planet in question. You should be able to see the periapsis of your upcoming encounter. Continue to use the method above to get the periapsis down to the value you want. I suggest that you learn first on planets or moons with atmospheres. Because these can help you slow down by aerobreaking. For example, at jool, I set my periapsis to about 120K and it will slow me down enough to get into orbit. Setting the periapsis too low, will result in having to land (or crash). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor planets / moons without atmospheres, you will have to just bring more fuel\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-02T14:49:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nukeboyt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T14:23:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Very best advise is to make course corrections very early, as late corrections cost much fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Aim for a really low (but safe!) Periapsis on your flyby as this will maximise the benefit of the planet\u0027s gravity to assist matching speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3a. If the planet has at atmo you can aero-brake - this means dipping into the atmosphere to use drag to slow you down. It\u0027s dangerous because if you slow down too fast you will end up descending to the surface, but it can save a lot of fuel if done right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3b. If not, you need to get as close to matching orbit during transfer as possible before the encounter starts, which will minimise fuel use during the encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I recommend practising making transfers from Mun to Minmus and back. Using an ion engines will help to simulate the speed differences and longer burn times for planetary transfers, but \u0027hitting the target\u0027 (getting an encounter) is easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T15:16:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a number of tutorials on YouTube and here on the Forum that can help you get started. The essence is to use what\u0027s called a transfer orbit. Your ship is always in an orbit. When you leave Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, you\u0027re in an orbit that touches Kerbin\u0027s orbit at one end, with the other end out in space somewhere. If you\u0027ve done it right, the other end is closer to your target\u0027s orbit. As a rule of thumb, if you want to go to a planet farther from the sun, you want to thrust across the dark side of Kerbin so you escape in the direction of Kerbin\u0027s orbit. If you want to go to a world closer to the sun, you thrust across the light side. Play with the maneuver node so that your course when you escape is parallel to Kerbin\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in interplanetary space, you want to modify your orbit so that one end touches the orbit of your target. That\u0027s your transfer (\u0022Hohmann\u0022) orbit. That\u0027s easy to do once you\u0027ve got a handle on how to use maneuver nodes. The trick is to time the burn so that when you get to the far end of the orbit, that\u0027s when the target is there, too. If you select the world as your target in map mode, the game will show you where the target will be when you touch its orbit. It could be that you\u0027ll have to wait a year or even a few before the target and your ship are in the right place in your orbits so that sliding the maneuver node around will get you a close intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should give you an intersection that didn\u0027t cost too much fuel to create, and where the relative speed when you get there won\u0027t be too high. If you\u0027re still running out of fuel when you get there, then you may want to built another, much bigger stage onto the bottom of your ship, so that you\u0027re essentially launching the existing ship from somewhere above the surface and already moving. You might also consider using the nuclear engine on one of your upper stages, even though the burns can be painfully slow. It\u0027s much more fuel-efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to think of is minimizing the weight of your lander, and particularly the amount of mass you carry back up from the surface. That will have a cascade effect all the way down through the rest of your ship. If you\u0027re trying to use the same capsule to get there, land, take off, and come back, consider using a separate lander. You could even launch one ship to go there, land, and take off, and another ship to go out there, retrieve the other astronaut and come back. Once you\u0027ve got your technique down, you can get fancy, and do an Apollo-style mission where your lander rides along with your main ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost some screen shots of what you come up with and how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, and fly safe!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to get a feel for the maneuvering and burning is to get MechJeb. It can create the maneuvers for you, and even execute them. I learned a lot about orbital mechanics from watching MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrD","CreatedById":103953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T17:03:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need also to launch at the right time. For this you need 2 things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. phase angle calculator. There are some really good ones, do a google search. I use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz\u003C/a\u003E Basically this tells you the angle you need between Kerbin and your target body when you launch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A way to know current phase angle. Some use a protractor on the monitor (a real protractor.) Considering phase angles are given in hundredths of degrees I\u0027m not sure this is accurate enough. I use Kerbal engineer, the rendevous tab give you phase angle from current active ship to any selected body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip: you can select anything on Kerbin or in orbit as the phase angle will not change significantly during an orbit. This is important because if phase angle is off you will need to accelerate time A LOT or wait A LONG TIME. Since time acceleration is limited when you\u0027re in orbit the smartest thing is to plant a flag somewhere in the space center and \u0022fly\u0022 the flag. Then you can speed up time to the max.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found that if phase angle is off even by a degree it\u0027s very difficult to get an encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SF-1 Raptor","CreatedById":111463,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T16:59:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips guys.

You can use shift to make smaller bursts of RCS, so you can get really quite exact. You can also just point your ship prograde and use the H,N,I,J,K, and L keys to operate RCS in all the directions, though it is easy to get disoriented this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI definitely second the advice to make corrective burns early in your path from one body to the next, as smaller changes in velocity are more efficient early on. A .5m/s corrective RCS burst a few minutes after your big burn to head off to the Mun can alter your eventual destination by hundreds of KM. Doing that same .5m/s corrective RCS burn when you\u0027re almost at the Mun will change you very little, maybe a few hundred meters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bdito","CreatedById":112760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T17:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESimple.

You can then move the node all the way around Kerbol to find the right time to burn. This is less efficient than burning straight out of LKO but doesn\u0027t need any fancy tools to find the window. You can even quick load back to when you were in LKO and to the transfer window you found, then set up the node again to save some dv \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the mod Kerbal Alarm Clock to avoid missing nodes. It also has a tab that lists transfer windows that are somewhat accurate. That\u0027s all I use to find transfer windows. Another useful mod is the Trajectories mod, which will show your orbit after passing through an atmosphere. It is extremely useful for aerobraking and precision landings. I\u0027d link the mods but I\u0027m on mobile right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
