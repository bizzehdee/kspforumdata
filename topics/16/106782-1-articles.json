Use movable fins if bigger winglets make you too stable.\n\nSticking closer to prograde will help, and so will using an engine with gimbal (LV-T45 as opposed to LV-T30).

I think i am using Gimballed engines and i have been trying to stay as close as i can to the prograde. The problem with the winglets right now is that I\u0027m in career mode and only have a couple of different ones unlocked, the bigger ones cause it to be too stable and i cannot actually perform a turn because it just wants to go strait up, maybe there is a good mix that i can unlock soon.
