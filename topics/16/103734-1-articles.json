Do you want to? There is a [test weight mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72707-KERBAL-NRAP-Adjustable-test-weight-for-lifter-building) that is perfect for determining the max mass of your payload. Just raise the mass until the Delta V is at the absolute minimum you need and that will give you your max payload.\n\nIf you really want to calcualate Delta V though...

Compare the resultant mass with the known mass of your rocket. The difference between the two is the maximum payload based on TWR.\n\n2) Now, since you know both the mass of your rocket and its mass when the tanks are dry, add that same payload mass to both the wet and dry figures and run the Rocket Equation to solve for delta-V. The result will be how much delta-V you\u0027d get with that payload mass.\n\n3) If the delta-V with the payload mass is less than 4500, the limiting factor on your booster is delta-V. If it is 4500 or greater, TWR is your limiting factor.\n\n4) In the event that your determine that delta-V is your limiting factor, you\u0027re going to have to run the Rocket Equation **backwards**, solving for payload mass. Let me solve the equation for you there:\n\ndelta-V = Isp \\* Go \\* ln(M/Md) = 4500, where Go = 9.82 m/s^2 and Isp is the specific impulse of your engine cluster. Set Delta-V equal to 4500.\n\n4500 / (Isp \\* Go) = ln(M/Md) = x (divide the 4500 delta-V by the Isp and Go, and call the result \u0022x\u0022)\n\nM/Md = e^x^ = x\u0027 (find the inverse natural logarithm of x and call it x\u0027)\n\nM = x\u0027Md (Solve for wet mass)\n\nM \u002B P = x\u0027 (Md\u002BP) (since the payload mass is part of both M and Md, pull it out as a seperate term, called P)\n\nNow, here\u0027s where we might have an issue: 1 meter and 2.5 meters fuel tanks (from the little FL-T100s all the way up to the Jumbo 64 orange tankls) have a wet to dry mass ratio of 9:1. For 3.5 meter tanks, the ratio is 8.2:1. Either way, you can say that the wet mass equals whatever ratio you\u0027ure using times the dry mass. I\u0027ll assume you\u0027re using 2.5 meter tanks, and therefore I can say that M=9Md. So I plug that in:\n\n9Md \u002B P = x\u0027(Md\u002BP)\n\nAnd now you solve the equation for P:\n\n9Md \u002B P = x\u0027Md \u002B x\u0027P\n\n9Md - x\u0027Md = x\u0027P - P\n\n(9-x\u0027)Md = (x\u0027-1)P\n\nP = (9-x\u0027)Md/(x\u0027-1)\n\nYou then just plug in the numbers; the result should give you the payload mass that will get you the 4500 m/s of delta-V.\n\nNow, if you\u0027re dealing with a multi-stage rocket, you\u0027ll have to go through this process for each stage in turn. And if you\u0027re using both size-3 and size-2 tanks in a single stage and find yourself in a situation where delta-V is the limiting factor, you\u0027ll need to figure out the wet-to-dry ratio of that stage yourself (and then put that in place of the \u00229\u0022 in the final equation if needed.\n\nOr you could save yourself the trouble of manual calculations and download NRAP as Alshain has suggested. Best of luck in whatever route you choose to take."}]}
