I burn retrograde but by the time the escape path connects to a orbit I have burned all my fuel up.

The trick is to burn *behind* the Mun as a sort of anti-gravity-assist so it drops you back to Kerbin, by immediately putting a maneuver node right in front of you and stretching the \u0022radial out\u0022 (blue/fins-out/dot-in-middle) until you get a Kerbin perigee inside the atmosphere (less than 69km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the only burn I had to do, and I ended up with a little less than a pound of fuel left, out of the about 5-3/4 you start with, a Kerbin perigee of 50km and a Mun perigee of about 35km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen ya just wait and wait and wait. I think I did 3 aerobraking passes until I finally landed. Thank god (or Harvester, same person!) for time warp!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I discovered that I didn\u0027t know... a perigee marker does not show up until you have a perigee above the surface. I was watching the Kerbin perigee, wondering why I didn\u0027t have a Mun one, until it suddenly popped up. I never noticed that before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T13:01:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease do not revive \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/13142-The-Good-Conduct-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eold threads.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThread closed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
