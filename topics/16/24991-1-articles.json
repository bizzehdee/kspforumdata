I\u0027ve tried to find some stuff that might do this, but i could only find stuff like merlin\u0027s mod which isnt exactly what i need. I just need something that i can use to, for example, to transfer fuel from a space station in orbit to multiple fuel tanks at the same time on a ship docked at the station. It would also be helpful to have something that can just fill a docked ship with certain resources, eg, fill a bunch batteries or a lots of the small RCS pods in only a few clicks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe main reason i could use this is because some of my space stations have alot of rcs pods on them and take forever to fill, and some of my ships have alot of fuel tanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T17:37:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe TacFuelBalancer will allow you to do what you want\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noticeably FAT","CreatedById":43401,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T18:31:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to mess with a mod, just turn on physics warp to speed things up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
