Not orbit (I\u0027m not far along the tech tree enough to succesfully do that) just fly up to 70km and then land. My approach so far has been to fly straight up, detach my engines, wait until I start falling back down. So far so good. My problem is that every time, my parachute gets destroyed. When it\u0027s in half-deployed mode, I\u0027m still accelerating (at this point, my ship is just the basic command module, a science module and the parachute, nothing else) and eventually, I get the message that says the parachute got destroyed. (if I fly too high, by the time the parachute can be opened at all, it\u0027s too late, I\u0027m falling too far) How do I decelerate enough in order to make sure my parachute does not get destroyed?

Just rechecked, and can confirm it still works, a Mk-1 pod \u002B mk16 chute reentering vertically from 100 Km altitude, by itself stabilizes with the bottom down and slows to a safe speed at about 3000 m ASL, good for opening chute and slowing to safe descent speed 500 m ASL. About exactly the parameters by design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, tested again attaching the science module at the bottom of the Mk-1 pod (what I believe is the configuration in the OP). The science module is very light (0.2 tons) compared to the pod (0.84 tons), however has a larger shape and therefore drag cube: it exerts more drag and that is enough to make the vessel sink nose-down. My test showed the nose-down vessel couldn\u0027t slow enough when reentering vertically from 100 Km, and that\u0027s certainly due to the lower Cd in the Vt equation. Sorry, but that vessel configuration doesn\u0027t allow a safe reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edrag coefficient\u003C/a\u003E (Cd) of the pod changes with attitude, tip Cd of a conical shape ~ 0.5 while tail Cd is ~ 1 (actual Cd also changes with Mach speed, Reynolds number). As others suggested, changing attitude to present a wider area (A) to the flow works to slow down more, and that also gives a larger Cd. In my very early career flights when very few parts are unlocked, I use basic fins on the sides of crafts, perfectly balanced to achieve neutral stability, and steer the vessel to present those fins to the flow and increase the area and therefore drag: works very well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FyunchClick","CreatedById":143109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T12:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129154-1-0-4-Chute-Safety-Indicator-v1-0-2-August-6-2015\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epretty nice mod \u003C/a\u003Ethat colors the background of the parachute icon in the staging list to indicate if it\u0027s safe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Highguard","CreatedById":150696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T12:19:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlexZ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AlexZ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I\u0027m in the early days of career mode and I\u0027m trying to leave the atmosphere and then return to Kerbal in 1 piece.

Almost any second launch will then let you get \u0027general rocketry\u0027. With the T-45 engine and larger fuel tank* that provides you can easily build a SSTO rocket that reaches orbit and returns the capsule. Hint: take the right contracts and you can get enough money from this that you can switch back to KSC once the rocket is in orbit and upgrade the astronaut\u0027s complex. This allows you to EVA your pilot in space for lots more science (and contracts, maybe) before you return the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*The larger fuel-tank is useful because it makes the rocket less wobbly, but it isn\u0027t strictly necessary.
