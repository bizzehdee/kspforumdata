You can still keep the data, and bring it back intact to Kerbin to get 100% of the science points. In that case, the MPL still helps because it can store an unlimited number of samples, and lets you reuse the science instruments for multiple landings and samples. If you only have the instrument, then you can use it only once. And while it\u0027s possible to transfer science data into a command module, it can only store one sample of each type per seat.

If you happen to come down on higher ground, like (gasp!) 500m above sea level, you need even more chutes.

It doesn\u0027t need to be much of an engine, two of those small radial things are plenty, a single Oscar-B tank is more than enough fuel.
