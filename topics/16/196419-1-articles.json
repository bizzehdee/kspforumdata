You don\u0027t mention your facility levels, but it\u0027s quite possible even staying within the 30 part limit (and you shouldn\u0027t even come close to the 18t limit). The limited part selection means you\u0027ll have a few less than ideal parts and it may not be \u0027pretty\u0027, but it can still be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3-4 Junos can do it, or a single Wheesley - pick whatever you prefer or what you are more familiar with. The Wheesley will generally require less parts in total, but it\u0027s possible with Junos too. Regardless of your choice, I would suggest using the Engine Nacelle as intake. You can place it inline on the main body with fore and aft nodes closed and it will still provide ample air to any engine setup you pick in a very drag-minimal way. As a bonus, it adds 150 units of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E which is at least half of what you should need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep the plane as light as you can for what you need to do, as the landing gear you have are easily the most \u0027risky\u0027 parts. I would suggest using the Mk1 Inline Cockpit either in front or after the engine nacelle (depending on how you balance the fuel), it\u0027s the best compromise between weight and drag. A service bay to place your science instrument(s) in is advisable. The goal is minimal drag so your plane can cruise supersonic, which will help it get high and save fuel on the long trip. It\u0027s quite possible to get Mach 1.7 with the Junos or Mach 1.8 with the Wheesley with what you have at your disposal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGive it enough main wing area so it can cruise between 13-14km, but don\u0027t go overboard as wing area also adds drag that will fight the plane in the transsonic regime; if you stay around 5-6 tonnes, about 1-1.5 lift area per wing should be good. The somewhat prettier Swept Wing can be used, but be aware they offer a less than optimal lift to weight ratio. If you pick the Wheesley, keep in mind that its thrust fades very quickly once over 14km, so its optimal cruising altitude is likely to be slightly below that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe placement of the wings, contrary to what some believe, is completely irrelevant - the KSP physics model quite simply does not care. So place them in whatever manner that will make it easier to get \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E as close to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E as possible.\u00A0 What is VERY important though: use the rotate gizmo to give the main wings a bit of Angle of Attack - iow the leading edge should be slightly higher than the trailing one. This way your wings will generate lift for minimal added drag, while the plane\u0027s body can stay pointed prograde for a LOT less drag. When the rotate gizmo is set to angle snap, a single fine tick will add 5 degrees, which as a general rule of thumb tends to be close enough to optimal to not need to bother with any finer adjustment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast, I suggest to keep your control surfaces perfectly horizontal, even the ones on the wings (counter-rotate them after adding the wing incidence). If you pick the right wing parts, you won\u0027t need the relatively small additional lift of the control surfaces anyway, but it will help minimize drag and will make balancing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know why you\u0027re being told to use canards - there\u0027s no need to, and a more traditional design tends to be easier/more intuitive to new players, so my advice would be to ignore that. Regular wing with a traditional tail is easily possible with what you have. I would suggest to dial down the authority limiter of all control surfaces. If you get \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E nicely aligned with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, this tiny size of plane doesn\u0027t need much and it will make flight and landing smoother and easier to control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo all the above, and you should be able to make do with 200-300 units of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E. That should be enough for a complete circumnavigation if need be, which at Mach 1.7-1.8 should take a bit over 2 hours game time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStaying within your restrictions, I was able to make a 3x Juno, 29 part, 5t plane, and one with 1x Wheesley, 25 parts, 5.5t; both can do what you need.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E indicates they already know the basics of plane design, and their choice of unlocked tech evidences awareness of what parts a plane needs.

I have no training or experience in such matters. When I say traditional, what I mean is \u0027what I see used in most flying apparatuses\u0027. I would literally use the word \u0027apparatuses\u0027 in that context. In fact, when I use any terms that might remotely sound like actual science or engineering, assume I am merely reproducing the words in roughly the same order as I have encountered them in aimless Wikipedia clicking or TV/movie watching. I won\u0027t be offended, honest - I\u0027m quite aware of my lack of formal training in the matter. What I am is a KSP addict, and what I do have is a wee bit of experience with how KSP physics works and how to clunk parts together to achieve certain effects in the game. Clunking btw is the appropriate technical term.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, and at the risk of overstepping the boundaries of my knowledge, I feel the need to question. Are you absolutely certain about the way \u0027passive stall recovery\u0027 is supposed to work? As I understand it, stalling happens when either the airspeed drops or the main lift surfaces are over-pitched, to the point where either or both cause the airflow around the airfoil to no longer provide enough lift.

I find that when optimizing for efficient flight and stability, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E ends up considerably more forward than the theory would have us expect, either almost right on top or even in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. I observe that and acknowledge it, but I don\u0027t go and \u0027correct\u0027 it simply because of theory \u003Cem\u003Eif the plane is actually more efficient and stable that way\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also noticed that my tail elevators end up having to work against the natural tendency of my planes to want to climb. I don\u0027t know if that is considered \u0027bad design\u0027 in the theoretical sense, I just know it works. My planes are optimised to be at equilibrium and at minimal drag state at their cruising altitude and speed. At any point before that in the flight envelope, while applying full power, they want to climb, and the tail elevator is having to inhibit/control that natural tendency to climb, which they do by creating lift/upforce to force the nose a bit down from where it wants to be. By the time the plane gets to cruising altitude, keeping the plane level needs no elevator input anymore and it\u0027s at neutral, which is also the least drag and thus the most efficient at the point of the flight envelope where that is the most important element. Result = plane goes far on very little fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf someone goes ahead and tells me that all this is a sign of bad engineering according to theory, I won\u0027t even argue. It might be. I just know in KSP it works. And it\u0027s the result I\u0027m after. If I see someone asking \u0027how do I design a KSP plane to go far and use less fuel\u0027, my answer is going to be based on what I\u0027ve learned, even if that deviates from what is generally considered how it should be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223842163\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196419\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221598098101\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut think of it this way: you are flying along, and you decide you want to go\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.

Of course, make sure the plane can carry the extra weight (they usually can, KSP engines are\u00A0powerful enough), and also be careful to place the tanks in such a way that they do not mess up your balance.
