I was really hoping for smaller ISRU parts.. Considering it is possible in rl with something about the size of a Kerbal. \n\n And the speed of refuelling doesnt bother me, in fact it would be very realistic! Sending a craft first to refuel over many months. A man can dream.\n\nOk, so i have to use that massive tubey part?"},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T15:23:07Z","Content":"The ISRU is about the same size as the mobile lab, slightly bigger than a hitchhiker.

You will get to enjoy running it for a few minutes a day due to having virtually no power, so presumably a couple of Gigantor panels and maybe more battery space would help out, and assuming you want to do more than fill up the Oscar B, you\u0027ll probably want a bigger tank and/or a docking port.\n\n![LMRlasf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LMRlasf.jpg)\n\nHere\u0027s what I consider a tiny mining operation.

That would be amazing even making allowances for realism (presumably a real unit wouldn\u0027t have a 5m magic drill that extracts unlimited resources and never wears out the bit).\n\nEDIT: Also not sure if you like mods or not, but I THINK tweakscale works on ISRU.

Mars direct for example was going to extract fuel from the atmosphere on Mars. The rover was about the size of a man. \n\n Also the machine that Zubrin et al made to test the science was quite small too. Yes I know atmospheric fuel extraction is different from drilling. \n\n I don\u0027t know any planned missions that will use drilling as a fuel extraction method though. Anyway. Yes I believe that the ISRU parts are too big. \n\nArguing about a mans opinion is useless so lets not bother.

Producing a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen / oxygen by electrolysis seems to be the closest analog to the isru in ksp. The ratio of products to ore (water ice?) would be very close to 1, and require only electricy, and a cell which could be almost arbitrarily small. The rest of the refinery would be cryogenic cooling equipment and such... \n\nYou don\u0027t need oil to produce rocket fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T22:18:35Z","Content":"So what about monopropellant?"}]}
