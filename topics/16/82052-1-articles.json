If that\u0027s not enough you can try moving the control surfaces closer to the CoM. The further they are from the CoM the greater the \u0027control authority\u0027 (strength) they will have. Specifically, if they are on the outside edges of the wings, move them inwards so they are nearer the fuselage. Similarly, with elevators, if you are pitching up/down too violently you can move them forward so they are nearer the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T17:26:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOther things to consider:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you sure you don\u0027t have the smaller control surfaces?
