And while it\u0027s transmitting, it chews through the on-board electricpower supply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what I don\u0027t know I would like you to clarify: What if I bounce that much science through a relay satellite through the network. Does the act of relaying the science data through the network\u00A0drain the same amount of power (compared to transmitting it from the ship as described above) through each relay\u0027s on-board electricpower as it passes through?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill the science stop and transmit much slower if the relay runs out of power and sucks it back through it\u0027s solar panels?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have so far been over-building my relays with something around 8000 - 12000 electricpower worth of batteries. But I\u0027m wondering.. to be more efficent at things, do I need that much? Or can I build my relays with say just 100-300 electric power and will they still be able to bounce data through the network without slowing down?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Vanilla game, no mods other than MechJeb.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-27T23:41:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2019 11:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by kithylin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"overkill13","CreatedById":173506,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-28T00:17:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t exactly tested, but I\u0027ve never noticed the EC being depleted on my relays.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven that a solar mining rig on the night side of the mun will keep on pumping out ore/fuel even while it\u0027s shaded for 19\u002B hours so long as you do not switch to it,\u00A0I doubt KSP is\u00A0coded for unloaded vessel\u00A0power consumption from relaying data.\u00A0 It would also conflict with the fact that power does not generate on unloaded vessels, so a relay in the sun would never recharge after being depleted by data transmission until you switched to flying it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-28T01:05:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, I believe they do not use any power if they are not in focus.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Gameplay Questions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kithylin","CreatedById":130653,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-28T03:00:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you all for answering.

Everything further than 3km from the active vessel doesn\u0027t really exist, or you could say, that they exist in a state of non-existence. But before I get too philosophical, back to the gameplay consequences: in stock KSP no electricity is ever added or drained to unloaded (= not simulated, i.e. far from the current vessel) vessels. So if you leave a vessel on low ECs because you just made a bunch of maneuvers and drained the batteries, it will not have recharged even if it spent ages with its solar panels in the sun and nothing running that drains ECs. But also if you have a vessel with a continuous power drain - like the research lab, or and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E system - and not enough power generation to fulfill that need, as long as it had some ECs left in the batteries when it is unloaded (e.g. because you go back to the space center)\u00A0 it will \u0022keep working\u0022(*) until the vessel is loaded the next time. Which is considered a kind of cheat by most people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom this follows, that: no, relays don\u0027t need electricity to relay science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. (*) They don\u0027t really work while they are not loaded. But when they are loaded the next time then the system computes how much it would have done (science generated for the lab, or ore mined/converted for an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E) since the last time they were visited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
