I can use my fuel valve for controlling thrust (very crude) I can use \u0022Infernal robotics\u0022 to rotate the engines, I can even fly with the control keys. my major problem is just that I have seen aircraft start rolling down the strip with 0 throttle, and not having pressed space bar.

So, gravity and the very, very slight incline will tend to pull free-rolling things toward the middle section of the runway. I suggest you apply the brakes, either by holding the B key or clicking the brake button up the top of the screen where the light and gear buttons are. That also helps for slowing down when you land!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for anti gravity, about the only one I know of is one of the lazors from the Lazor Powered Weaponry mod. It functions as a tractor/repellor beam, and you can mount them pointing straight down. No prizes for guessing how that could result in hover vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psyper","CreatedById":90641,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T08:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Chad_hale\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Chad_hale\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eif the only way to really land anything is limited to PARACHUTES... then this game is going to loose my support - fast.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess you haven\u0027t heard of breaks then!!! Hit the B key or the break button at the top of the screen.
