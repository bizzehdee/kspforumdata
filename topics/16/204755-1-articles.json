Using this design, my throttle profile is\u00A0to keep my throttle set 100% all the way until AP is around 75km and then I coast and burn once again until I get \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight profile is as soon as the rocket get to about 50m/s and its stable of launch pad, angle to 60deg instantly, wait for prograde marker to catch up and then instead of staying in the prograde marker I \u0022pull the marker\u0022 by flying rocket on the very edge of the marker all the way till 50deg. I continue slowly pulling my prograde marker and aim to be around 45-35deg at about 10km. Then I check my time to AP and ensure that is going up and also verify in Kerbal Engineer that my horizontal speed is catching up with my vertical speed. I keep pushing my rocket till about 20deg but by that time I am already at stage 2 and will probably start coasting any moment. Sometimes I find myself up in space with still first stage not finished let alone second stage fired which was made in the first place for upper atmosphere and orbit insertion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThing is my rockets on the way up with Kerbals in them burn like a massive fireball, legit sometimes I think that my rockets burn more going upwards to space then when they are coming down to Kerbin. Poor Kerbals have really fiery and aggressive launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, does burning like this all the way up create massive drag inefficiencies, more then gravity? Some people say burn horizontally as much you can and get that horizontal speed, forget about fire but still I think this much drag would count for something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo burn or not to burn.....\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Echo__3","CreatedById":204997,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-09T12:21:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EGravity loss is a far bigger concern than drag for \u0022reasonably\u0022 aerodynamic rockets.
