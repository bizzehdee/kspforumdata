Capsules and probe-cores come with their own reaction wheels, but generally the ones in the SAS module are more powerful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you want to rotate your ship you\u0027ll want to disengage the ASAS temporarily by hitting \u0022T\u0022, or holding down \u0022F\u0022, and then turn it back on when you\u0027re finished to hold the ship in its new direction.

Having ASAS turned on while you do this is bad as mentioned above, but if that\u0027s not the problem, it\u0027s probably that you don\u0027t have enough torque from reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, the stat you\u0027re looking for doesn\u0027t appear in the VAB. Command Pods have two stats, rotPower and linPower. I think it\u0027s the former that you\u0027re concerned with here, but it doesn\u0027t really matter since almost every pod I\u0027ve ever seen has the same values for both stats. This stat reflects how much torque the command pod can subject the craft to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the manned command pods have a rotPower in the range of 5 to 20. Most unmanned command pods have a rotPower of 0.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Stayputnik, however, is the exception to that second part. It has a rotPower of 0.3, meaning it will only turn a ship 60% as fast as the other command pods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that\u0027s plenty of rotPower, possibly even too much, for a very light satellite. But between the FL-T800 and the LV-N, you\u0027re definitely not a light satellite. If you\u0027re trying to turn with those still attached, the Stayputnik will have a hard time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the first step is to use one of the other probe command pods, ANY of them would be an improvement. They might weigh a little bit more, but the weight of the probe pod is insignificant compared to all the other stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt best, that\u0027s going to have you turning about 66% faster. If that\u0027s still not enough then you either need to add more pods (the rotPower is basically additive), or turn your RCS on. You could even stick a Mk1 pod under a probe pod just for it\u0027s greater rotPower, flying a potentially kerbal\u0027ed ship unkerbal\u0027ed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T01:18:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Eric S said, it\u0027s rotPower that is involved in controlled turning of a vehicle. SAS only stops rotation, it does not (and cannot) help start rotation. Your probe module is the reason your turning is slow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can increase turning power by adding additional probe modules (or an empty crew module) to the vessel, or use physics warp (alt-.) or wait patiently for the existing setup to do its job. It really shouldn\u0027t be terribly slow, even with the kind of mass you\u0027ve got.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS - When activated it works to stop rotation by applying a countertorque to the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EASAS - Uses any and all ship\u0027s systems (vectored engines, control surfaces, command module torque) to maintain a fixed attitude. It will return the ship to that attitude if the ship turns away. If it is used on a vessel without any system capable of causing a torque (don\u0027t know how that would be possible, but let\u0027s pretend) then it will do absolutely nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAvionics - Identical to ASAS except that instead of a fixed attitude, avionics works to maintain the vessel\u0027s current attitude. If it is perturbed from that to a new orientation, avionics will maintain the new orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
