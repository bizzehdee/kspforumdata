Anyway, day 1 I was able to get into orbit, I have a pretty basic understanding of space due to my years with Orbiter so that helped. I was able to get a one man capsule to the Mun in 3 days and orbit and return and then Thursday I was finally able to land a 3 man capsule on the Mun\u0027s surface and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway....just now discovering mods and I\u0027ve now mapped the Mun and Earth lol, ok enough of my life story\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, I\u0027ve downloaded the GPS mod and am launching my sats, and I guess this really isnt a geosync question but...I\u0027m not sure what its called, how do I change \u0022WHERE\u0022 over Kerbin my sats are orbiting? I understand inclination but my 4th sat is at a 90 degree inclination, my other three are at 0, 45 and 135...but the one at 90 isnt exactly \u0022where\u0022 I want it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis picture is NOT my GPS network this was from my very first game so the sats are not even at the right height but it shows what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg422/BrianD90_photos/KSP2013-05-1812-41-01-05.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2013-05-1812-41-01-05.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want the one at the 90 degree inclination to pass through the triangle the other 3 form...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mediosthenes","CreatedById":65019,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T18:16:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBurning on the normal or anti-normal should rotate the orbit like a ring on a gyro. Burn on the poles, because where you burn is like the location of the hinge on which the orbit rotates. Because you are messing with velocities, whenever you burn, you are always either stretching or rotating your orbit. Pro-grade/retrograde stretch, normal/anti-normal rotate, like on a gyro, and radial-in/radial-out spin, like on a tire.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T18:29:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efor that, you need to do an orbital inclination manoeuver (purple triangle on the tool) at south or at north pole (basically, the axis around which you want to do your inclination change will be where you put the manoeuver node - here, at north or south pole) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut, judging from here, that will be a high delta V manoeuver at such a low orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IllicitMedic","CreatedById":66677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T18:32:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sgt_flyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sgt_flyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Efor that, you need to do an orbital inclination manoeuver (purple triangle on the tool) at south or at north pole (basically, the axis around which you want to do your inclination change will be where you put the manoeuver node - here, at north or south pole) \u003Cp\u003Ebut, judging from here, that will be a high delta V manoeuver at such a low orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats what I was thinking I just didn\u0027t know where to do the maneuvers so it never looked right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give it a shot, ty so much!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso yea, these are not my GPS sats, my GPS sats are at half geosync orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IllicitMedic","CreatedById":66677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T21:31:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk so, it seems to be working a little but my altitude is also going up, do I need to launch into a lower orbit first?

It seems like only one of those markers can be displayed on the nav ball at a time, so I position it so that the retrograde is just barely visible and keep that attitude until the prograde becomes visible for the same amount of time the retrograde was visible (repeat until burn is finished).
