It should be as close to half-way between the wheels as possible. Too far forward and you will flip forward when braking, and too far back and you\u0027ll flip over backwards when accelerating. Also you want the center of mass to be as close to the ground as possible when driving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this matters either but you should have the wheels exactly vertical when driving.
