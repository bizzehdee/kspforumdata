But more fundamentally you produce more delta-V per second (more acceleration) as your rocket gets lighter. (Simple newton shows F = m*a shows this). So more dV is done at the end/second half of the burning.

Horizontal velocity is eaten only by aerodynamic drag, which gets thinner rather quickly and since you initially launch straight up, by time you get your gravity turn completed (usually around 10 degrees above the artificial horizon) you will be at about 30km give or take, where the atmosphere is getting thinner. In fact it is practically non existent by 45km. This is true for the new 1.0 atmosphere. In pre 1.0 we had something lovingly referred to as the soup-o-sphere. The atmosphere remained almost constant thickness all the way up to about 45km where it just kinda ended very suddenly.
