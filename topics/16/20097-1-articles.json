The most fuel-efficient way to correct anything is as soon as possible, that is, as far away from the destination as possible. So departing from Kerbin, you should start correcting the moment after you have finished burning for the transfer, at which point you will still be very close to Kerbin and Kerbol\u0027s periapsis (assuming that you are doing an interplanetary transfer). If you are having to spend a lot of fuel at this point then your phase angle must be way off to begin with. Perhaps you just need to spend more effort in taking off at as precisely 270 or 90 degrees as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, using said calculator, you should be able to make an elliptical transfer trajectory aligned with the destination body\u0027s orbit in such a way that you do not have to burn to match the orbits completely, but rather head for a collision course. This requires a lot of accuracy but is not too hard to accomplish from Kerbin to Eve or Duna. Having to orbit around Kerbol is not really a bad thing as there is no time limit, but if you miss the encounter on the first pass-by using that calculator then you will either have to wait for another encounter by chance, or spend a ton of fuel to do a rendezvous instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps you would learn more watching videos.

Spending too much time accelerating will result in the ejection angle not actually be what you want it to be and guesstimating how much ahead of it you should start is no good. In fact, if the spacecraft were to be extremely weak, it would just circle around the origin body in increasingly wider deformed circles.

Besides, it is better to look at the map anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever I manage to find an encounter without corrections where it is supposed to be happening, which is rare, my velocity compared to the given ejection velocity is still off by hundreds. This was especially noticeable for me when I tried using only three of the new low-thrust nuclear engines that will not even run at full thrust without exploding on a heavy craft. My trajectories suddenly were off so much it could not be corrected in a reasonable fashion. I think this is one of the biggest problems most people who are trying this method have, other than not knowing how to actually correct the trajectory when it is not perfect, which it never is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not mean to criticize the calculator as it still does a good job of getting you where you want to, but I feel like it is incomplete and not accurate enough (the game itself does not allow for extremely high accuracies either, though). I hope there will be tools in-game which help predict the encounters. Getting to planets beyond Jool, assuming that there will be any, would be very difficult at this stage. Trying to get there using gravity assist would be even harder.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-24T22:17:19Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2012 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Grizzlol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PictoKong","CreatedById":20043,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T22:03:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrick with the calculator: instead of the velocity, use your eyes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean: when the apopasis/periapsis (kerbol relative) is aligned to the planet you are trying to reach, you should have an encounter displayed (set the max patched to 3, to get it in Kerbin\u0027s SoI). If not, plnace change once there and you should see it. I usually start at the required angle or a bit before (ejection angle, that is) but my interplanetary stage is pretty powerful... also, be sure the planets are correctly placed (i use adamKSP, really useful for thoses kinda things. Lastly, quicksave a bit before you start your burn (like one orbit) so you can quickload if you mess up. This is the only way (collision) to make it to planets and back with stock parts and not overly powerful rockets. Juno for exemple... you can\u0027t waste THAT much fuel since it costs a lot just to get there in the first place\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
