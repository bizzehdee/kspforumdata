Do you look at your relative velocity at your closest approach? It sounds like it\u0027s pretty high, but you want it to be as low as possible. It\u0027s somewhat counterintuitive, but you can\u0027t just thrust in the direction of your target. As you close in on your target, you want to do a series of small burns or RCS maneuvers to match your orbits and therefore lower your relative velocity.

It is however useful to know (and rarely spelled out anywhere) that you can reduce your closest approach to your target even as you slow the relative velocity, giving you a nice arcing brake line that looks super pro. While looking for your green pro/retro-grade markers to begin slowing to meet your target, also take a look at where the pink/purple target direction markers currently are. You really want these to line up. This is a docking approach (or collision course if you dont slow down). It may well shift a bit as you approach, but you can use the ijkl lateral RCS controls to keep the green (which will move) on the purple (which wont unless you use wasd) Once you get a bit more experience then you can make little radial burns to push the markers together whilst performing your brake.
