KER, MechJeb, RemoteTech2 antenna on the tug, Interstellar radiators and magnetometer on the Ike lander, and one of the experiments I\u0027m carrying is from the BioMass pack. Possibly TAC Life Support as well. I\u0027ll make a \u0022public\u0022 version of the .craft with those non-critical mods removed and share it this evening or tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission profile: I built separate single-use landers for Duna and Ike. The assembly was built in orbit with Extraplanetary Launchpads, and the tug stage between the two landers took them from the construction station to the interplanetary ship. The interplanetary transfer ship will park in low Duna orbit and both landers will operate from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Duna lander deorbits from low Duna orbit, makes a few burns during the descent to minimize entry heating, and deploys drogues around 10km. Main chutes are armed at drogue deployment. Terminal velocity under chutes is around 10 m/s. Final burn just before touchdown to land at 5 m/s or less. Should be enough fuel in the descent stage to cut chutes and extend powered flight if you need to move off a steep slope, but you\u0027ll want to add an action group to cut all chutes together. Don\u0027t forget to hit the Infernal Robotics controls as part of extending the landing gear. Science pods are for upper atmosphere, lower atmosphere, and landed. They are all on the descent stage, so don\u0027t forget to collect the data while you\u0027re on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ike lander includes a transfer stage to get it from low Duna orbit to low Ike orbit and to return the ascent stage to low Duna orbit afterward. Science for Ike high and near space located on the transfer stage. Science for Ike landed is on the descent stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T23:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/zp722uknlo808zf/Duna-Ike%20landers.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/zp722uknlo808zf/Duna-Ike%20landers.craft\u003C/a\u003E is a reduced-mods version of the lander package I posted a picture of.
