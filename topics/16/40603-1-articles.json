This is kinda a two part question by the way. So first, if my space station (using solar panels) has Kerbin block the sun every so often then wouldn\u0027t I eventually run out of power until I come around again? I think batteries should solve that though. Also what is the best orbit for a space station LKO, MKO or Geostationary?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-02T16:12:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2013 04:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ChrisWill\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snooze","CreatedById":67712,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T04:58:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as where you want to put it: what do you want to do with it? Is it gonna sit there and look pretty? Any orbit will do. Is it a refueling station? Low-orbit for spaceplanes, 250km or higher for refueling any sort of inter-planetary expedition. Are you launching it in one piece? Or modular? The higher the orbit, the harder to go modular (especially in Munar or Minmus orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBatteries will help when you\u0027re in the dark half of your orbit. Most stations, however, can run off a pair of RTG\u0027s if part count is your concern (RTG\u0027s mean battery-free).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s your station.

It\u0027s going to be modular it\u0027s main service is refueling and the rest will be a couple of Habitats an show pieces really and part count isn\u0027t to big of a deal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T06:24:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven though my station has a huge battery reserve I stuffed 5 RTG\u0027s in it (one in each module). This way no matter what there will be some power coming in, also means that if I accidentally clip a solar panel or 3 (hey it happens) I am not without power coming in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to orbit, Snooze is dead on. If it is just there to say hey I did it then you can put it at whatever orbit you want. Fueling stations tend to do better in high orbit. In fact, any station that you are planning on visiting often I would suggest a higher orbit since you will be moving slower making docking easier. (at least for me). Speed is ultimately relative, but for some reason its easier to get to in a higher orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisWill","CreatedById":77045,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T06:47:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll probably stick some RTG\u0027s on also and probably put it in a 250km maybe more orbit.
