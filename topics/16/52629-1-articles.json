It will now orbit \u0022slower\u0022 than that ship; since it\u0027s in front of it, it should only need a few orbit for an intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Set the target and time accelerate until a decent intercept shows up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Grow or shrink the docking ship\u0027s obit until the intercept is \u0026lt; 5km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Tutorial takes it from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, if you can get two ships into the same orbit, all you need to know is that larger orbits take longer. So if you are behind your target ship, shrink your orbit; if in front, grow it. I like to start out in front of my target because you can always grow your orbit, but sometimes in shrinking it Kerbin will get in the way.

If so, the booster engines aren\u0027t very strong, nor do they last as long as an orange tank on a mainsail. If you just mean mainsails attached radially, then strut the sh*t out of it.

For example Kerbin Liftoff \u0026gt; Kerbin Orbit \u0026gt; Transfer to Duna \u0026gt; Duna Capture \u0026gt; Duna Landing/Liftoff \u0026gt; Kerbin Return \u0026gt; Instant Landing \u003Cem\u003Eor\u003C/em\u003E Kerbin Orbit \u0026amp; Landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach of those steps costs a certain amount of Delta-V (change in velocity in (k)m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you divide your rocket into stages for lift-off \u0026gt; transfer\u002Bcapture \u0026gt; landing/liftoff\u002Breturn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are maps of required delta-v for landing/liftoff, planet-planet transfer, planet-moon transfer and capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Don\u0027t forget to add the numbers for the return journey as well.
