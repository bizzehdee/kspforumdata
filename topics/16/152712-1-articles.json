Easily\u00A0identifiable\u00A0biomes to boot, that are perfectly flat to land on. If you make a lander for the Mun that is capable of\u00A0returning to kerbin from the surface of the mun, expect that same vessel to be able to do 2-4 biome hops on Minmus. I start by getting in a highly inclined orbit and collecting all the EVA science from the biomes (Minmus also rotates faster than the Mun so this can be done easier). I then land on either pole and biome hop my way to the equator for an easy return burn to Kerbin. This will net you about 2500 science in one trip!

for it by abusing the flag planting contracts on your next launch and The bonuses you get for doing things the first time can help make that up aswell.\u00A0 if you place a command ship in orbit of either mun or minmus, you can go to the space center and look at contracts, there is almost certainly a flag contract worth 50k advance and 100k completion, if there isnt you can warp a few days and there will be one.\u00A0 then go make you landing and return to orbit.\u00A0 go back to the space center and repeat the process.\u00A0 I made the decision to do it that way so that i would ensure i
