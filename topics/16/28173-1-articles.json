I fly up, extend the arm and release the rover all ass planned, but the rover just dissapears after falling a few kilometers. I know it is landing safely becuase there are parachutes attached and ive watched it land, but if i keep watching it will eventually dissapear. I can enter the tracking station and its gone, I don\u0027t understand, am i doing probes wrong? My question i guess is if anyone has done a simmilar thing and how did you pull it off? Idk if it\u0027s a bug or I set something up wrong, please help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T21:42:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is just how KSP works unfortunately, it only simulates physics for nearby objects. Once your rover got more than around 2.5km away from you then it was assumed to be orbiting - an orbit that was about to hit a planet and was consequently removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere has been mention of recoverable parts so maybe in future another secondary simulation for parachutes/falling objects will be made in the same way there are one for orbits and stationary bodies but at the moment you have to hang around within a couple of kilometres until your probe comes to a stop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cal\u0026#039;Mihe","CreatedById":65567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T21:47:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative can be to extend the range of the physics calculation (requires tweaking the config files), though this may be bloody murder on your computer memory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"youbenhad2","CreatedById":67169,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T21:53:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edarn, ok, thanks for the help, i was afraid it was just not do-able, it looked so cool too lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aleis","CreatedById":62823,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T06:10:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edid you add a probe \u0022core\u0022 to your rover. anything i\u0027ve wanted to control after it detached from the main ship i just added one of those with a small battery maybe a solar panel or two and the game seems to be pretty good on making it accessible to me later.
