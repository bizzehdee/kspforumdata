There are subtle differences, mostly in formatting, but also differences when docking. When you attach two docking ports in the editor, it\u0027s still considered 1 ship, if you launch and undock a new ship is created then. When you dock in space, it creates a tree structure where the docked ship can still exist and be undocked without losing information (in theory, doesn\u0027t always work). There is also information about the state of the craft, which only exists in the persistence file, not the craft file.
