I looked around and I cannot find a way other than having a calculator and a scratch pad in front of me. Is there a mod for this or is there some window I overlooked in the VAB?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: For the record, I know about the Kerbal Engineer Redux mod and it comes close to what I am looking for here. However it does not give me max burn/charge rates for the craft.
