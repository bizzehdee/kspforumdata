Also when I do reentry burns, I aim to get my periapsis just inside the atmo, and let drag do all the braking. Also if you aren\u0027t already using it, I would recommend MechJeb, if you just want to see how your designs work because you\u0027re a rubbish pilot, it has functions like an autopilot, if you\u0027re a great pilot, it has other features like predicting where you\u0027ll land, preventing jet flameouts, and other little things that reduce some of the workload when piloting vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout refueling, something like only 8000 delta v is needed to go from launchpad to Laythe orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorpi15","CreatedById":34189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T10:28:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe that a burning for a mun slingshot and then a jool capture is less efficient than a straight burn out of Kerbin\u0027s SoI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flanders","CreatedById":64586,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T10:29:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry using aerobraking in Jool\u0027s atmosphere, if you do it right, you can get an orbit around jool without using hardly any delta V at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy carefully choosing aerobraking depth, you can even make the resulting orbit end up with an apoapsis at the same height as Laythe and then just wait a few orbits for an encounter (after raising periapsis out of the Jool atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your timing is right you can even manage a direct capture to Laythe orbit directly after the Jool aerobrake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo find the correct aerobraking altitude at Jool atmosphere you can either use these charts: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30433-A-handy-chart-for-Aerocapture-at-Jool?p=376099\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post376099\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EA handy chart for Aerocapture at Jool\u003C/a\u003E, use trial and error by quicksaving and quickloading, or use the aerobraking calculator included in MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd using a Mun assist to escape Kerbin is almost never \u0022cheaper\u0022 than doing the burn directly in low Kerbin orbit due to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eoberth effect\u003C/a\u003E (higher speed lower in gravity well =\u0026gt; each m/s Dv spent will affect your orbit more, thus saving you fuel)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-13T10:33:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2013 10:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Flanders\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T10:38:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, so the aerobrake seems to be the best way to reduce fuel requirements, nice.
