I had it at the bottom near the shore, but then I decided to take it out a bit further. From what I read, the bottom of the ocean is supposed to be ~1000 meters, but I\u0027ve gotten quite a bit deeper than that and have yet to see it. Did my craft somehow glitch into Kerbin, or is the ocean just this deep?\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kerbal.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002280.42\u0022 height=\u0022801\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://oijon.net/img/kerbal.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leganeski","CreatedById":220954,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-14T01:17:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, the deepest that the ocean gets is 1393 m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022128643\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed645442353\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173446-lowest-highest-points-of-celestial-bodies/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:197px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ve somehow managed to clip through the surface.
