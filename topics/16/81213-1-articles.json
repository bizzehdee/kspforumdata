I tried it on low, medium, and high detail terrain and low detail sinks everything completely below the ground, medium has the same issue but pops things into the air higher, and high detail has the same issue but pops things into the air only a few meters, which you can eventually, with a lot of quicksaving and loading, get things to land appropriately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Eversion\u003C/strong\u003E of KSP you are using;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- .24.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u003Cstrong\u003Edetailed explanation\u003C/strong\u003E of what happened and what you were trying to accomplish;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Above\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich \u003Cstrong\u003Eaddons and plugins\u003C/strong\u003E you have installed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EToolbar\u003Cp\u003EActiongroupmanager\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBahaEPL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBahaSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoulderCo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECactEye\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChatterer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrewManifest\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDistantObject\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnhancedNavBall\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtraContracts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEPL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirespitter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKlockheedMartian\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKWR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENRAP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EORS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPartCatalog\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPartWizard\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreciseNode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProceduralFairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProceduralWings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtractor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemotetech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERomfarer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCANSat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecialTech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStationScience\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwitchVessel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETarsierSpaceTech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETextureReplacer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToadicus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweakableEverything\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweakscale\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlags\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOKS/MKS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T23:48:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re clipping too much on that thing.

Try landing on eve with a ship that\u0027s heavy on fuel for the return trip, and then finding out that you don\u0027t have enough landing legs. Many times, the legs don\u0027t break initially, but will start to wobble and act funny, often clipping below the surface. Exiting to the space center and then returning can sometimes fix the issue, but can also cause explosions. So, the best tool to get around this kind of thing is the alt-f5 combination for quicksaves and the alt-f9 for quickloads. But, everything that has been said here in this thread so far may be totally off-base.
