My opinion:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor an optimal intercept you should first match orbital planes of your target and your interceptor, this should be done right at launch (into the planet of target), if you use mechjeb there\u0027s an option that will do it automatically for you. So, assuming the planes are now the same you are left with the present case, two co-planar elliptical orbits. Assuming you are starting from a near circular \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E orbit with your interceptor you are interested in NOT getting into an higher energy orbit than your target, because that would be a waste of energy, this means you will match your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E with the target and then push your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E as necessary so that you and the target rendezvous at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E. You will be trailing the target, as you should.\u00A0If you are intercepting in any other point than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E it means that your your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E is higher than target\u0027s (waste if energy) and / or the angle of interception will be not zero (as it will be at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s match perfectly), meaning there is an additional DeltaV to spend.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBear in mind that, in the real world, it is very difficult to do this \u0022one shot\u0022 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E matching interception so what the Shuttle, Cygnus and so on do is to get into a circular slightly lower orbit, trailing the ISS circular orbit\u00A0and approaching it orbit after orbit, pushing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E to match circular orbital radius\u00A0of ISS when close enough (last orbit).
