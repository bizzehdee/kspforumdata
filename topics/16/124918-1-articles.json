I have no idea where Steam puts it, but if you mod you should know where it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Right click and copy it in Explorer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Navigate somewhere else. I suggest either d:\\ if you have it or c:\\ksp (create the directory).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Right click in that directory and paste. This will copy the ENTIRE KSP install to the new place. It may take quite some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Never ever run KSP from Steam ever again. Run the version in that folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll lose Steam tracking of hours and stuff like that but you\u0027ll have to decide what\u0027s more important, playing older versions or the benefits of Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dafni","CreatedById":149636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T09:11:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, thank you. And what if I want the new version too? You say never ever run from Steam again, this has me confused. How about doing what you said, ie keeping a copy save in another folder, and THEN run it from steam, get the updated and save THAT file again in yet another folder. Would this give me both versions, independent from each other and independent from steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, I guess: will steam check my whole computer or just that directory it\u0027s allocated to in the first place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T09:41:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESteam only checks the directory it originally installed in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I do it, I have a dedicated KSP folder which includes fresh instances of every single version since I started playing that survived longer than a few weeks...
