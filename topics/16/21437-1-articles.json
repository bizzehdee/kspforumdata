In the current build there is no way for the engine to detect where along an orbital path the mouse is. Harv recently implemented a function that can detect exactly where the cursor is when it\u0027s hovering over an orbit path. With that ability, drawing shadows of where other orbital bodies will be at that time in the orbit should be far easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: So, essentially, what you\u0027re asking for is coming, it just isn\u0027t available yet.
