Easy question, hard to do... I just start with a small rocket, go to 5000m with a random, small sideway speed, stop my engines and try to land anywhere on Kerbin, but that\u0027s hard. I drift sideways? Try to negate, but shooting over the goal or just don\u0027t properly reach it. It\u0027s very hard to get really NO horizontal speed, because even a small value will make your rocket falling to the side. Getting down is also hard. Trying to get the rocket to ca. 2 m/s down is not easy. Too much thrust = starting to raise. Too few thrust = crashing into the terrain. Even with a small speed, you just bounce from the ground and fall sideways, because you horizontal speed was 0.02 and not 0...

But if you are trying to land on kerbol, you are going to be having a bad time, \u0027cause I\u0027m pretty sure you cant land on the surface of a star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELol, I assume thats just a typo though, and you really meant kerbin. (One of my pet peeves is when people call kerbals kerbins or kirbins, or kirbils, or kirbals. Also when people call kerbin kerbal, kerbol, or kirbin, etc.) However, if you are trying to land on the surface of a planet, or moon, you can normally deal with a couple of cm per second sideways (Barring moons or planets with ridiculously low gravity, like gilly or pol.). It seems you woes are more to do with a poorly designed lander. You dont want a lander to bee too tall or top heavy, or have the landing gear too close together. Overall, a good lander will have a low centre of mass and a wide stance with the legs deployed, and shouldnt be too high off the ground with the legs deployed. Also, dont try to slow down too early, That just wastes fuel. On kerbin (over KSC) a good time to start slowing down is between 100m and 50m, depending on your TWR. Also, parachutes on atmospheric bodies help a lot, and most of the time you wont need to use engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T07:25:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhy do you want to land on kerbin using engines? that\u0027s why parachutes are for \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T07:54:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are three basic tips that can really help with landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is your lander itself. They will bounce or have slight horizontal, no way around that. As result, make them low and wide. Below will be my usual lander setup. Even if you have a slight horizontal or bounce, center of gravity makes it quite tough to tip or flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond is your landing power. The ability to set commands really helps with this and is very good for the final stage of lunar landing. You need lots of power to decelerate, but that power makes thrust control way to finicky with 2% meaning difference between crashing or flying back off. What I do is set a toggle to toggle on/off some of my landing engines once close to ground to give me more throttle control. I like my final landing throttle setting to hold speed to be near 30 to 50%. This will give you much better landing speed control. Less bump, and more focus on maintaining orientation and position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, camera position. When you are flying, if you are in third person, try to keep camera positioned so that you can naturally control that way.

I didn\u0027t want to get there and realize I had no idea what to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience, small amounts of lateral velocity aren\u0027t a major problem when landing on higher gravity bodies, like Kerbin. It\u0027s more an issue on low g worlds, and it\u0027s worse when relatively high centers of gravity (my landers tend to be taller than is ideal). I tend to deal with this by using more control methods (SAS, RCS, etc). It\u0027s a trade-off that I\u0027m happy with, though when I get back from holiday travels, I may play with some alternate designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething that I\u0027ve found works well for zeroing out small amounts of lateral movement during landing is the translational controls on the RCS. I just keep the ship as horizontal as possible, roll so that N is straight up on the navball and use IJKL to keep the retro marker dead-center of the navball. I\u0027ve had lots of luck with that. This should work on Kerbin, too, but it\u0027s probably just not as important as it is on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, practice practice practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T14:43:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, there is no good way (known to me) in the game to see what is the slope of the terrain below you. You need to zoom out really far to be able to see it and by the time you do it you might be already crashed. So just hope you\u0027re landing on an acceptable slope. Making your lander really low and wide helps a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you\u0027re landing on horizontal surface, all you need to land is your navball and notion of the distance to surface. The altimeter on the top of screen is mostly useless for that as it shows distance to sea level. There are several ways how to see your distance to actual surface:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/ command pods have often IVA view with \u0022radar altitude\u0022 instrument. You can switch to IVA using the C key, adjust your view to point at the altimeter and switch back pressing C again. To check the altitude, you then can just press C twice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/ In daylight, you can use ground texture and ground scatter to estimate the distance. Also the distance of your ship\u0027s shadow helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3/ During night (but also in daylight), it is very useful to mount down-pointing lights (Illuminator Mk1, NOT Mk2 as that has way shorter range). You\u0027ll be able to see it appear on the surface when at about 450 m. It allows you both to see the surface texture, and to estimate the distance from size and shape of the light circle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor actual landing, I found it good to completely forget about ship\u0027s orientation. Use the ship view only to estimate the distance to ground, nothing else, and land using just navball. Normal direction to point to is at the middle of the blue half, to kill eventual horizontal speed you need to point between that middle and the retrograde marker. If you see prograde marker, you\u0027re not landing anymore. Also get ready for the fact that the lower your vertical speed is, the bigger your horizontal speed appears to be, but it does not mean you need to keep killing it. When below some 30 m/s total speed you point within 5 degrees (1 tick on the navball) off the center all the time. Regulate speed by short taps on Shift/Control keys, don\u0027t forget these things affect your thrust, not the speed - so one short tap on Shift will not make you brake instantly, but it will start decreasing your speed or at least decrease the rate at which you\u0027re gaining it. You need to tap them both to keep your descent at certain rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd landing speed of about 6 m/s is perfectly fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep your SAS on during landing. Kill your engines (X key) as soon as you touch the ground. If you have RCS mounted, keep it on as well, it will help SAS to keep the ship vertical after touchdown. After things settle down, you can shut down both RCS and SAS to stop wasting resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecent powered landing training instrument is the top stage of Kerbal X Stock craft. Put it on launchpad, launch, get to about 500 m height, then kill engines and stage 5 times to get the lander out.

You can try doing the straight shot, but that is too much work for me, even still, the fuel difference from mun to minmus isn\u0027t too much more. The maneuver nodes and targeting makes it easy to know when and where to burn in order to align orbital planes. Lastly, minmus has lower gravity than mun meaning less fuel burned and less velocity as you come in to land. Speed control is a bit easier since it won\u0027t be accelerating due to gravity to the same extent. A bounce can be worse, but since slower, if you toggle your SAS and have any rcs before you touch down, should keep you stable, or you can burn upwards if it bounces bad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T08:11:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Novastar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Novastar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe advice \u0022practice on Minmus, it\u0027s easier than Mun\u0022 sounds weird.
