However, the OS, AFAIK (and I haven\u0027t paid attention), only defines \u0022click\u0022 and \u0022command click\u0022. Most mice (again AFAIK) send \u0022command click\u0022 when you click the right button, and most game writers (Squad included) use that as \u0022right click\u0022. The mice that Apple sells do this these days (have a right and left click). My mouse does send something when I click the scroll wheel button. Currently it brings up the widgets, but I\u0027m not sure how what it sends matches anything else.\n\nWhat info is middle click suppose to bring up? Does do windows users with track pads do?"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T05:05:29Z","Content":"To display part info when selecting a part (not placing it) on windows, it\u0027s just right mouse button, not middle mouse button (This is the window that shows things like the exact amount of fuel in a tank, the lift rating of wings, and the exact reaction wheel torque).

(using Windows scroll wheel).\n\nMaybe it\u0027s some functionality left out at the last moment. However I would like to get rid of the message stating to use the middle mouse button, because it obscures the settable options when right clicking on a part.\n\nGreets,\n\nJan"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T08:39:11Z","Content":"Hold middle mouse and move to pan the view in the SPH, I think it was disabled in the VAB due to the vertical nature of construction in that area ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T08:43:10Z","Content":"Clicking the scroll wheel works as a middle mouse click in every self-respecting operating system, for as long as I can remember.\n\nOn my OSX laptops, I use [Better Touch Tool](http://www.bettertouchtool.net/) to map a three-finger click on the trackpad to a middle mouse click."},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T15:38:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hold middle mouse and move to pan the view in the SPH, I think it was disabled in the VAB due to the vertical nature of construction in that area ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nMiddle mouse and move adjusts zoom in the VAB.

Panning around the construction area is done while holding down Right click with the mouse.
