It still like doing the contracts and leveling up Kerbals so I want to convert all science to $$$ and Rep. There are 2 strategies that do each of these. I put 50% science into converting science to money. Then I try to activate a 2nd contract in a different sub-section to convert the other 50% science into Rep. Even if I put the slider on 1% it says it would exceed 100% of the science. I also have 3,000\u002B science so it\u0027s not the start-up cost.
