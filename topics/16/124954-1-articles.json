So I\u0027m trying to meet up with this satellite to give it more fuel so it can continue on it\u0027s mission but I can\u0027t get an intersect to get closer then let\u0027s say 8km or 9km from each other in the outer orbit of Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it even possible to do what I\u0027m doing? I almost feel that you have to be in orbit of a planet or moon to make the intersects occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT::: Great!

When I intercept asteroids in solar orbit, the initial close encounter is often hundreds km apart. When you get close, all you need to do is push the retrograde velocity marker on top of the retrograde target marker, and you\u0027ll keep heading toward your target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T19:44:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Empiro said. Basically it\u0027s the same procedure as when docking in Kerbin orbit. The main problem is that a Solar orbit is so big (simplifying things here) that your encounter is going to be FAAAAAAR more sensitve to any change. If your craft isn\u0027t too heavy (with large fexible craft rotating can cause several hundred km of deviation) you could try thrust limiting your engines to like 2% for more precision. Alternatively use RCS for very precise manouvres.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uncle_jew","CreatedById":152178,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T19:52:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E8-9km (even 100km) is not a problem in a solar orbit. The reason why you need close approaches in low orbits is that due to the curvature of the orbit, spaceships in different orbits start drifting relative to each other, which makes an approach from a long distance very difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the curvature of a solar orbit is very low, so if you arrive at a point e.g. 100km from the target spacecraft and cancel the relative motion, you can just give your spacecraft a delta v of like 5m/s directly towards the target, and arrive almost exactly at a target a few hours later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
