I was doing calculations and found that the 1500 ore it can carry will get a little more deltaV if left full on launch then used at some point during transit. Next thought comes along and I figured the earlier I spend the fuel, aka on takeoff, the more efficient it will be and the more deltaV it is adding to my overall trip. So I go about mining and fueling my vessel on the runway, as this is innitially empty to be hauled inside another vehicle and is saves me a lot of carrying weight and I take off. I then notice something. If the ISRU is converting materials at all the velocity drops to 0m/s. I originally took off, got to about 80m/s, but then the velocity drops to 0m/s and I reland on the launchpad for some mysterious reason. I sit there a second thinking about what is going on and notice that the ore is dropping. This led to the obvious conclusion. The ISRU turns on when it has the chance again and does not actually shutoff fully when it runs out of resources.. So I turn it off manually via my shortcut and the ship magically starts going in the air again. This leads me to why I\u0027m here. I actually want to use the ISRU during takeoff to use up the ore as early in the flight as possible. But, as mentioned it for some weird reason kills my vessels velocity in flight... Is this supposed to happen? And if so does anyone know why it does. Why would the ISRU have any affect on my velocity during flight?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, pardon the overheating engines. I just removed 4 twin boar engines and replaced them with orange tanks to give it more deltaV.

It\u0027s not very good for your purpose, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, maybe you should reconsider your use of TwinBoars. They\u0027re designed to be boosters: comparatively cheap, high thrust per weight, but only mediocre efficiency. Their whole data encourages to use them only for a short time and jettison them quickly -- when used like that, there is no time for them to overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you start dressing them up with radiators and stuff, have a good long look at the outcome: it may well be that an unadorned Mainsail\u002BTank is cheaper and more lightweight than a TwinBoar with heatsinks.

I was using radiators and stuff and wasn\u0027t seeing any difference. I wasn\u0027t sure if that is just the engine or if I likely placing them wrong. I get to like 45k apoapsis before they blow up. I just need to get a little farther. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically I placed them on the outside of the ship. Since it\u0027s very condensed I didn\u0027t technically make sure it was directly on the engine. It could have been on the tank. Does that make a difference atm? I have yet to find proper information on how heat works and how the radiators and panels work with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd they did work I just reduced the TWR to save weight and gain DeltaV a bit so this thing could hop around more easily. With the 4 extra engines I had placed they did not blow up before orbit or virtually ever. But they did not get as far because of the base weight increase. I was hoping to keep the ship smaller with the reduced engine count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I put up a bigger version with better TWR but it still doesn\u0027t easily dissipate heat when you get into orbit. Do you have to have some radiators to do it or should it do it on it\u0027s own? I would think several days in orbit and is should lower the heat. But it does not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you need to have extendable panels and passive panels together to make it work or are they like solar arrays and just different versions of each other?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: I have now put on the largest deployable radiator panels and it does nothing. I spin around kerbin over and over and it does not seem to reduce the engine overheat.. The only thing that reduces the heat is if I get 500k plus past kerbin orbit and it just goes away...

How is it acceptable to have this bad of a mechanic in this game. It should not stay hot for 34 days in the cold of space... Sorry, I don\u0027t find a mechanic this simple acceptable if they are going to keep it this way stock.

My phsyics weren\u0027t running at all. I actually wasn\u0027t dissipating heat at all or seeing atmospheric or other affects correctly.... I may have to redo this and other ships now.
