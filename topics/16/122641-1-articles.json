The rover (which was built separate and merged in) just stays red and even though I have docking ports on both the rover and the ship it refuses to connect to it. I know many people have done it so is there something simple I\u0027m missing or could it be a glitch?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T05:18:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure about the merge feature, but you should be able to do it using a subassembly.

You can adjust the ejection force of the decoupler by right clicking it so it has the same force as a docking port.
