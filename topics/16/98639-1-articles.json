The Mars Rover Spirit has functioned with a broken (stalled) wheel from 2006 to 2011 (when it ceased functioning completely). NASA didn\u0027t expect a repairman to suddenly pop up on Mars either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf something breaks on an robotic vehicle, that\u0027s a shame, but you\u0027ll either have to try to cope with the faulty part, abandon the mission completely, or send a rescue mission.
