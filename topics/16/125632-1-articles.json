Now (in 1.0.5) drag is too low to brake my lander, and the chutes are destroyed above 400 m/s, so i need to use engines for braking under 400 m/s.

Well, that\u0026#39;s going to depend on the design of the lander. Post some screenshots or better yet post a link for the craft file. I use the engines on rockets a little bit just to bring the surface velocity down just before landing so that the landing gear doesn\u0026#39;t break. For spaceplanes, I thought Duna was way easier than Kerbin as far as reentry was concerned, but landing was not as easy mainly because of the higher surface velocity and lack of a nice long flat landing spot. My plane kept rolling over and crashing, but that could probably be cured with design changes. I just took the easy way out by adding 2 parachutes and landing on the engine, using the engine to lower velocity before touching down, then rolling over onto the gear. I haven\u0026#39;t tried using a rocket yet in 1.05, but if you post the craft file, I\u0026#39;ll give it a go and see what\u0026#39;s going on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit : and as far as the atmospheric breaking. I reentered with a PE of around 20km coming from Kerbin. I tried to use an AoA of 30 degrees, but because of fuel balancing issues, was not able to maintain that. 10 degrees was all I was able to keep. But it didn\u0026#39;t matter, I didn\u0026#39;t have to retry because the plane survived. Duna capture was successful, and on the 2nd pass I readjusted PE to 20km and landed after about a 10 minute reentry. All in all a good mission and not too hard.
