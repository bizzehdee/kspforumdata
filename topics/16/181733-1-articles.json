Usually I start re-entry opposite \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and keep the nose around 40-50 degrees elevation until I don\u0027t have enough pitch authority to hold that anymore. Usually gets the speed down pretty effectively. At landing, I\u0027m usually on a 3-5 degree glide slope, like a normal aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan I see a screenshot of your shuttle? Just curious what it looks like. Add your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E balls at landing if possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s a bonafide Shuttle replica, you\u0027re dealing with a tailless delta design, is that correct? In that case, the best advice I can give you is to bump up the pitch authority on your elevon controls to maximum. The other thing I\u0027m curious about is your wing area and mass at landing (your wing loading). From the behavior you\u0027re describing it sounds like it might be a tad on the high side. I\u0027ll know more when I see your design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you playing with any other mods?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry that I\u0027m not answering your question directly; I don\u0027t know the Shuttle numbers off the top of my head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
