It looks to me, to be roughly 1m x 1m square.\n\nWhen I looked online about solar panel power production, I saw 150w-200w per square meter in vacuum.\n\nAlso about 100w-150w at sea level. Both of these are at 100% optimal conditions.\n\nSo when I look at the solar panel in KSP it says 0.35 per second of power generation.\n\nBut what is that? 0.35 watts? 0.35 kilowatts? Megawatts, Gigawatts?\n\nI\u0027m trying to understand how much power they make so I can adjust them to more realistic values.\n\nThanks in advance ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T00:48:23Z","Content":"First, your online data is for Earth, correct? Well, this is Kerbal, so it\u0027s not entirely the same. Same laws of physics, but different values for the variables.\n\nAs for the power generation, my understanding is that it\u0027s not a particular measure of power. It\u0027s just electric charge."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T00:55:29Z","Content":"EDIT: Go to page 2.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T02:59:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 02:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows**"},{"CreatedByName":"Solar71","CreatedById":140993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T01:12:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E .35 ECs per second.
