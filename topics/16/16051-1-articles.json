The 94 metre rocket does have an issue where without some fuel modulation once it\u0027s down to 4 engines, it will crumple under the high jerk forces that the gimbaled engines create (it can crush one of the fuel tanks, which normally destroys everything as the engines and remaining tanks fly through everything above them). It has even more struts that you cant see bracing the centre stack to try and combat all of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shorter one looks flimsier, but all the orange units you see stuck to it are lander SAS units from a mod, each with 6 force available, and I suspect they help try to hold everything together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can build your rocket in a pyrimid shape, so that it gets wider towards the base as it gets taller, that helps, though as you can see I\u0027ve also shortened both rockets by strapping tanks to the side further up.

Preferably both, since I\u0027m using unmodded large decouplers. The idea is to have it wired up like old aircraft: Whichever way the rocket tries to bend, there\u0027s a strut/wire pulling it the other way. So have 4X, 6X or 8X fins at the midpoint of the wobble, attach struts to them from tanks well above and below, and make sure the fins themselves can\u0027t rip away. It\u0027s not brilliant as a solution if used excessively, the lift can destabilise rockets during gravity turns, but usually it works fine. Struts really don\u0027t work well when you try compressing them, or subjecting them to loads that are off the axis of the strut. By making the strut more horizontal, you convert more of the load to tension along the strut, and make it a more effective reinforcement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T02:25:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust in case anyone reading this was looking for the stronger decouplers, they can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/15491-16-Fix-for-weak-large-decouplers-plus-reduced-wobble\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/15491-16-Fix-for-weak-large-decouplers-plus-reduced-wobble\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
