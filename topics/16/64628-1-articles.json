But you know what, hardly anyone uses docking mode, so I\u0027m not sure why you want to. Some people think they need it for translating or a good camera angle, but there are other ways around that. Use V (or whatever button you assign) to switch camera to chase, and use IJKL/HN for translating, mapping translation controls to your hat switch (hopefully you have one).
