It would seem to me that altering the probes\u0027 abilities between career and sandbox doesn\u0027t make any sense. Having every Kerbal you hire automatically being level 5 makes sense if the whole system was implemented, but what is the point of having the levels and specializations in sandbox if all Kerbals can do all things? I know that to suddenly have your super-duper 20 year deep space mission suddenly not have any SAS because you run a Stayputnik (no SAS) would be quite annoying, but the same could be true for old career saves as well, and yet in new and old careers the limitations are in place. It seems that back-compatibility with old saves is the only reason for this choice but it still impacts career, unless of course I\u0027m missing something (it\u0027s quite likely, I\u0027m not Squad \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I\u0027m saying is that I believe there should be consistency between career and sandbox, or at least an option to do so, though I understand that there may be an overwhelming majority who just want all their sandbox Kerbals and probes to be able to do everything despite their training.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy have this new system if it\u0027s not going to be used?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T06:21:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Carsogen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Carsogen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy have they chosen to go with this implementation?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually \u0022sandbox\u0022 means everything is unlocked.
