Big ships have a tendency to have low TWR, which means that it has to burn longer and start earlier which means that if you start from a low orbit, it can turn you into a smoking hole before your orbit has time to carry you around to clear the planet. You can either increase the thrust on your ship but it will decrease the amount delta-V available to you, reduce the size of your ship which will increase the TWR and dV available, or you can start from a higher orbit which is sort of counter productive from the perspective of the Oberth effect, but will give you more time for your orbit to come around so you\u0027re free of the planet.
