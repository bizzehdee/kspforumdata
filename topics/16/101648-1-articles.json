I can\u0027t find the video again. Its not in history.\n\nSo do you guys have a link to a video that explaines how to get this timing. Or maybe give me some data and can work with. I know what my apoapsis should be. But what about the periapsis, what should that be, to get that near perfect spread ?\n\nofc he raises the satellites periapsis after release.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T01:38:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 01:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nicklas**"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T02:12:15Z","Content":"Alright, I suggest getting a mod like [Kerbal Engineer Redux](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-0-25-0-90-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-6-2-12%280-25%29-and-v1-0-15-2%280-90%29) or something else that shows you your orbital period. The Altitude for Kerbosynch orbit is found on the [Wiki page](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Synchronous_orbit). Put your AP around that altitude and make sure your orbital period is 2 Hrs (1/3 the 6 Hrs for a Synchronous orbit) Then you can release a Sat at each Apoapsis and circularize.
