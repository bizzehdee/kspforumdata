I\\\u0027m wondering, has anyone else been preparing? Does anybody have a suitable launch vehicle? Are you using a certain flight plan? (assume that Mars will be about twice the distance from Kerbol than Kerbin)\n\nSo far I have a vehicle that I think is capable, along with a lander, but it\\\u0027s not exactly elegant and uses a generous number of long 3m fuel tanks. It\\\u0027s also wobbly, unfortunately.\n\nUpdate: I managed an aphelion of 27GM, even after I screwed up and jettisoned the Kerbol orbit insertion and martian orbit insertion stages. It\\\u0027s probably not the most efficient, so if anyone has a better design, I\\\u0027d love to see it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The parachutes are not there for testing only.

You sure this isn\\\u0027t overkill?\n\nLet\\\u0027s say that you aren\\\u0027t planning a return trip (seriously, don\\\u0027t do that. Get mechJeb, and send an unmanned probe.), and there\\\u0027s no need to have an asent stage (you\\\u0027re going to want to keep your first couple missions relatively simple.) Another important thing to consider is fuel efficiency, and conservation. MechJeb is one of the most fuel-efficient ways to get into a Low Kerbal Orbit. From there, you\\\u0027re going to want to perform a maneuver that\\\u0027s similar to a TLI, but in such a way that you are flung away from Kerbin\\\u0027s sphere of influence. From there, rendezvous is a relatively simple thing to implement, in concept.\n\nOf course, there is a more efficient way to do things, but we don\\\u0027t currently have the tools to accurately time when to launch so that we are captured by the moon, and flung out into a solar orbit in such a way that we don\\\u0027t have to perform very many course corrections.

The directional setup (and slow speeds) you need to get a gravity assist from the Mun obliterates the significantly larger benefits you get from the Oberth Effect by doing all your burning in low Kerbin orbit.\n\nIf the Mun was much smaller, but with the same mass, such that you could get a significant trajectory bend by scraping its surface at ~ 4km/s, things would be different. And the Mun certaintly can turn an object in orbit of Kerbin into an object on an escape trajectory. \n\nBut if your aim is, and has always been, to head for something in Kerbol orbit, you\\\u0027re wasting fuel by attempting a Munar gravity assist."},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-09T23:33:09Z","Content":"Ive made a rocket that was originally for the mun, but i think it can go to mars because by the time i had to jettison my stages, i still had 1 halft full stage and one full stage left ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png) so im sure it make it to mars.\n\n(actually not that big)"},{"CreatedByName":"chillman1212","CreatedById":16988,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T01:40:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ive made a rocket that was originally for the mun, but i think it can go to mars because by the time i had to jettison my stages, i still had 1 halft full stage and one full stage left ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png) so im sure it make it to mars.\n\u003E \n\u003E (actually not that big)\n\nIs it a stock rocket?"},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T02:15:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is it a stock rocket?\n\nNah, its made up of IFE engines and C7 tanks (but still, its not like im cheat (AKA dosent have super-amount of thrust or fuel)"},{"CreatedByName":"chillman1212","CreatedById":16988,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T20:18:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nah, its made up of IFE engines and C7 tanks (but still, its not like im cheat (AKA dosent have super-amount of thrust or fuel)\n\nI\\\u0027m just asking since it would be pretty amazing if it was stock.

A few people have made such rockets. I have made one, using 27 tanks of fuel (all stock). The first return stage to kerbin has two parachutes, that could be used to assist in slowing down the craft in the Martian atmosphere. The second Mun return stage should then have enough fuel to return to Kerbin. This is, of course, assuming that the delta-v needed to get to or from Mars is not greater than the delta-v needed to fly to and land on the moon, and return and land back on kerbin again. (I personally think it would be plenty)"}]}
