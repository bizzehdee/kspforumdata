This is despite using a radial decoupler to force the cargo outward. I have even equipped the rocket with an RCS system to directly thrust away from the cargo hold to no avail. The really odd thing is that once the cargo is decoupled, it will slide back and forth along the cargo hold, but it will never slide out, almost as if it was tied to the cargo hold with a pair of rails. Even firing the main engine will not work, the rocket will actually drag the space plane along with it.\n\nAny idea what is going wrong. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"satnet","CreatedById":147366,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T03:35:22Z","Content":"A screenshot might help. Usually I run into that when I have some part clipping that leaves a part on the outside of the cargo bay. \n\nYou probably have two options (without relaunching). You can spin the spaceplane as fast as possible, that can often dislodge the cargo. You can also timewarp, which will cause the two craft to pass through one another (just don\u0027t stop until they are completely separated)."},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T00:07:06Z","Content":"Check the underside of of your craft in the hangar and make sure there aren\u0027t any parts clipping through it.\n\nThe Mk2 bays are only just slightly larger than the \u0027standard\u0027 rocket parts, so if your payload is a rocket and you have things like landing legs radially attached, then those parts can clip through to the outside of the bay. The doors still open fine, that won\u0027t clip things.. but on the underside that one part goes through the outside, with the rest on the inside, but it all still attached.\n\nOnce you\u0027ve found the culprit, you can perhaps either rotate your payload so that extremity is more off to the side where there\u0027s more room, or use the offset tool to move it a little closer in to the payload\u0027s centreline so it doesn\u0027t stick out so far (or both)."}]}
