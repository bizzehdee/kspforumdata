Use the RCS to continue to refine the orbit of the second craft until you get an intersection of less than 1km (you can usually get it to 0.3km or less with some care).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse the target and direction indicators in the navball, use RCS (with SAS enabled) to literally steer your direction indicator until its pointed straight at the target. Use RCS to speed up or slow down so your approach rate is under 1m/s when only a few hundred meters away. Let time pass, you will eventually reach your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is happening here is that your second craft in the lower orbit is going faster around Kerbin that the first craft, which means it will eventually \u0022catch up\u0022 to the same point over the planet. But since they are in different orbits, you can never rendezvous. So what you do is use the lower orbit to get \u0022nearly close\u0022 then keep raising the orbit until you are very, very close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is definitely not very quick, but its very simple to learn and with practice you can rendezvous much faster (align your launches, use lower orbits for longer, etc). Have a lot of patience and resist the urge to timewarp too often until you get the hang of it. Hope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alterbaron","CreatedById":57492,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T01:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWatch this video:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHkY3FusJIQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027d rather read, here\u0027s a quick guide on how to rendezvous without using too much fuel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESet the other ship as your target in the map screen.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMatch target\u0027s inclination (burn at ascending or descending node to do this).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBurn at apoapsis so that your periapsis lies on the orbit of the target.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBurn at periapsis to make our apoapsis either a bit higher or a bit lower than your target\u0027s orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETime warp.
