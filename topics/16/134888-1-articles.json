However nothing is stopping you from using structural parts or an empty SRB with attached docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should be able to transfer crew through most parts so long as they aren\u0027t connected with a junior docking port. Best thing to do if unsure is build it on Kerbin and see!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T22:43:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey could be a mod. They could also just be empty Mk1 fuel tanks, and they would work fine. A mod might provide ligter parts, but at least with fuel tanks you can use the contents on the way and avoid having a flippy craft on leaving Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd Kerbals can transit through naked girders, as long as they have a standard-sized docking port on the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vim Razz","CreatedById":43764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T23:48:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this case, they\u0027re the old version of the Structural Fuselage.\u00A0 If you like the look of the old fuselage model better than the current model, then I think there are mods that can add those part again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth the old and new models are passable in stock or with Connected Living Spaces installed, though at the time that particular base was built their use was purely decorative.
