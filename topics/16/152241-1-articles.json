However let me one consideration from what you wrote. Radiators in KSP work by irradiating energy, in a similar way to how radiators work on a space vessel. Radiators we commonly know on Earth also irradiate a bit, but mainly work by convection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen a radiator is at the same temperature of the air around it, convection ceases to work (and that perfectly matches what you wrote).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead, radiation works with temperature at the fourth power (and surface of radiator, and Stefan-Boltzmann constant) and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eemissivity\u003C/a\u003E of the material. Because of difference in emissivity, is common to have a radiator at a lower temperature (but with emissivity = 1, as a black body) losing heat to another facing object with low emissivity (e.g. silver, emissivity = 0.02). Some devices in real world use this phenomenon to actually pull heat from one warm surface to another at even higher temperature. Heat pulling is simulated with TCS in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-21T23:24:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n@Jarin I have more or less stopped using radiators on my craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is possibly a use for them when for example coming back from Mun or Minmus with multiple aerobraking passes, you can get rid of the heat from the last pass before starting a new one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your search for a more efficient ascent\u00A0they are probably creating more drag/performance loss than you are gaining. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I find helps\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
