I have so many things I want to learn and do with cars, but one of these things is attempt to build cars in Kerbal Space Program. I have done so in the past, with various vehicles under my Kerbolet brand, but some things I simply can\u0027t seem to figure out. namely quarter panels and fenders. And trunks. And having wheels that don\u0027t lock up from parts being too close. Any car builders have any tips for building these tricky buggers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-11T04:58:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot an expert, but I have seen people use vernors to help make quarter panels and fenders.
