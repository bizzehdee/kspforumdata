I am sure there are more efficient and smaller versions of a rocket which also make it on mun and back, but this is the first one working I\u0027ve built so far. However, it has Mechjeb on it, so if you don\u0027t have that I could upload a second version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://uploaded.net/file/z7uq0vjl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://uploaded.net/file/z7uq0vjl\u003C/a\u003E - Sorry for uploading there, mediafire gave me an upload failure every time :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img6.imagebanana.com/img/m1tuefj2/EagleII.PNG\u0022 alt=\u0022EagleII.PNG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage has 4 liquid boosters and 3 solid boosters. Launch them at ~75% thrust until you drop the solid ones, then get thrust to 100%. As soon as this stage is burned out completely start the next one. Only the 3 outer engines will apply thrust as you\u0027re high and light enough now. You should be able to get into a circular 200-300km orbit (may be higher) with 75% of the center engine\u0027s fuel. Wait for the right moment and then rise your apoapsis until it reaches moon-distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should have 4 small engines (with landing struts) and a small engine right below the capsule now. The 4-engine part is going to be your lander. Extend the landing struts and slow down as much as possible to land (I often use MechJeb to do that). After you landed you should still have ~15-20% fuel left. You could either use that to start you back to space again, or decouple it while it is on moon to have a landing reference for your next missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last thrust-stage should be enough to get into a 30km orbit around the moon, delete the inclination, rise your orbit to a high orbit around Kerbal and finally lower your periapsis until it\u0027s negative. Finally decouple the last fuel tanks and open your chute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope my instructions were good enough to follow them and my design suits you.
