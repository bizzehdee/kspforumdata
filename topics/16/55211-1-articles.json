Assuming it\u0027s still passing overhead, that\u0027ll be the direction in which you want to take off. If it\u0027s not in an \u003Cstrong\u003Eexact\u003C/strong\u003E equatorial orbit, expect to be off (the alternative is to make sure you don\u0027t launch until you know it\u0027s going to pass directly overhead; that can take a few M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar rotations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Target the CSM. Launch when the CSM is about 150,000 m downrange or so. Circularize at roughly its same altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Make a plane change correction at either the ascending node or descending node. This will be along either the normal or anti-normal heading to your prograde vector (set up a maneuver node and use the little purple triangles to set it up; assuming an eastward launch, north at the descending node, south at the ascending node). Get it to zero (or as close as you can manage and be prepared to try again the next time you hit a node).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Look at your close approach chevrons. Set up a maneuver node to burn prograde at the next -apsis (doesn\u0027t matter which). If the chevrons get further away when you pull prograde, stop and pull retrograde. Make sure when you\u0027re doing this that you don\u0027t send your periapsis below 10,000 m; if that happens, trash the maneuver and set it up at the other apsis instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Ideally you want to get those approach chevrons down to 0.0 kilometers, but anywhere below 1.0 kilometers is good and below 2.3 kilometers is good enough for a rendezvous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should get you your rendezvous.

You have to do fine maneuvering and you don\u0027t want to be doing that with main engines only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t worry too much about the need for extra delta-V for rendezvous and docking; if you\u0027ve got a little extra in your LM\u0027s ascent stage, you should be just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need design hints, check out the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39630-Doing-it-Apollo-style\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDoing It Apollo Style\u003C/a\u003E Challenge and look at people\u0027s designs.
