I built a simple stock rocket capable of ~100 km orbit in 2 stages (with Mechjeb attached). I launched one going east and a second going west. I tried my best to get them on perfectly circular orbits at that same apoapsis and periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried for over an hour an half to get them to collide! I couldn\u0027t do it.
