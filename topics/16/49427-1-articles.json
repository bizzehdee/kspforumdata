But just to clarify, if I press that button, any data in my vessel and any data in my canisters attached to my ship are gathered even if my kerbal is not in the ship? Because I was outside my ship and pressed the recover button but I only got science for my ground sample that was \u0022on\u0022 my kerbal and nothing from my ship. I had 4 canisters attached, each one of them had one observation worth 10 science each which were collected from various places in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T14:41:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be because you only recovered your kerbal.

I launched a rocket with 4 Mystery Goo Containment Units and 2 Science Jr beneath a Capsule. During the launch I observed the MGCU:s at different altitudes and saved the data.
