Which is you go your max speed at a lower altitude then climb converting your forward momentum to altitude.\n\nThe 2nd tier plane parts can give you a little more altitude.\n\nThe 3rd tier plane parts can take you up to around 15K. I have not progressed further than this yet.\n\nWith some of the contracts I need to have a jet/rocket hybrid. The jets take me to their max altitude with a skip and the rocket motor takes the plane the rest of the way. It is very important to check your COG in the SPH by draining the tanks fueling the rocket. You do not want to try to recover forward momentum after climbing with the rocket motor in an unbalanced plane.\n\nOn a side note adding more engines do not always equate to higher TWR, particuliarly once you gain altitude. The extra weight of the engine counters the extra thrust you gain."},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T20:31:23Z","Content":"Simple, squad does not want you to use planes anymore, build a rocket."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain H@dock","CreatedById":139017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T21:06:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E With some of the contracts I need to have a jet/rocket hybrid.

First option: nose up and blast. Engines will flameout. Let them. Nurse the throttle to get whatever altitude you can. When it\u0027s finally a waste of effort but your apoapsis will eventually qualify (taking into account future drag losses, which the game doesn\u0027t model very well, so you have to guess) switch to flight view, manually shut down your engines, manually put them onto a NEW stage, and then stage-activate them a second time once you\u0027re at altitude. Second option: essentially the same as the first, but instead of nosing up and clasting, just switch to rocket mode. Shutdown and re-stage jet engines, activate at target. Third option: NEVER stage-activate your engine on the runway. Instead, control-group activate them. Fly your choice of the first two options.
