Playing career mode. I\u0027ve a \u0027space station\u0027 built with crew and lab modules, and with cross segments holding RCS and fuel storage tanks. I built a \u0027tug\u0027 and brought it up to the station, the idea was to use it to move parts around during the construction process. It worked quite well, and I left it docked overnight. Today, I resumed my construction project. The tug holds a lot of RCS, and figuring it didn\u0027t need fuel, I offloaded what was left to the station holding tanks. I decoupled the tug and waited for it to drift clear for a moment, then switched to Tracking to go pick up the tug and fly it. It was gone. It just disappeared... and with it, the pilot onboard, who is now listed as \u0022Lost\u0022. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea why?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-09T04:46:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2014 04:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LordFerret\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECould not duplicate circumstance.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T03:40:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know why, but I do know you could just switch vessels from the map screen or (in such close proximity) by pressing [ or ].\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blind Dead McJones","CreatedById":109600,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T03:47:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible that it reentered atmosphere accidentally.
