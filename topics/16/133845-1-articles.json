You\u0027re capable of landing on the Mun and back and want to start the science slog\u00A0on the Mun and Minimus. I\u0027ve wanted to start getting \u0022infrastructure \u0022 as early as possible to make things quicker and more efficient. Pre-sci lab pretty much the only infrastructure you can use is a reusable lander you park in low Mun orbit. So the question is: What is more efficient?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) standard missions to the Mun and back\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) parking a lander in Mun orbit and your missions bring fuel to the lander and transfer everything. You save the weight of the science tools, lander engine, extra drag of an extra wide lander for steep slopes and have a overall lighter lander.\u00A0\u00A0You incur the cost of orbital docking (I can do it easily, but I\u0027m surely not the most fuel efficient).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-09T13:51:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost efficient? ignore the Mun - or at least, don\u0027t farm it for science. \u00A0There\u0027s a lot there - but you need a fairly large amount of\u00A0dV to get it and get it back - over 1000 m/s for the round trip to and from low Munar orbit and you\u0027ll need a relatively heavy engine to land with (limiting the amount of fuel you can carry) -and- the gravity, early shape of components means early ships can be rather tall and thin whch isn\u0027t ideal either..\u00A0 And, even with a lab in orbit, you\u0027ll have to run a lot of refuelling missions to keep it going. Which might be more fuel efficient, but it will waste your time considerably.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to save your time and Kerbin money, then do this around Minmus instead - getting there isn\u0027t much more expensive, or much more difficult once you get how to launch at the right time and inclination but the landing/reorbit requirements are just 360 m/s, and the low gravity means carrying enough fuel to do small hops around the surface to do multiple biomes\u00A0during one landing is much more practical since you\u0027ll only need a tiny, tiny engine. It\u0027s also hugely\u00A0easier to land on as it\u0027s a lot less bumpy. Hell, you don\u0027t even need landing gear if you\u0027re gentle, and it\u0027s much, much more forgiving for landing tall thin ships as your reaction wheels will be much more likely to counter the gravity if you land at an angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for whether or not direct ascent or KOR or MOR is more or less efficient... that depends on what your definition of efficient is....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWemb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-09T13:57:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt depends on how early in the career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option that I have I have played with in the past is a single use lander bus.

you can do surface samples you can transfer fuel (that doesn\u0027t match with my play, but I could be wrong). \u00A0You do need clamp-o-tron [jr]s if you want an orbital fuel depot, and that will cost you 90 science (but let you easily hit all the biomes on Minmus. \u00A0Hitting multiple biomes on Mun likely is an exercise in planning and mapping (plus having an orbital depot)).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d still prefer to go to either without docking, but that is mostly habit. \u00A0Assuming you don\u0027t care too much about calendar time, I\u0027d recommend probes to Duna/Eve (before any kerballed flight beyond orbit). \u00A0They don\u0027t require much more than to Mun, and bring back a ton of

psychological hang-up about elapsed calendar time.\u00A0 As a rule I don\u0027t role-play the kerbals much, but for some reason I hate to waste calendar time and it bugs me to have a year of game time go by when all I\u0027m doing is timewarping.\u00A0 I hate for the poor lil\u0027 green guys to have to wait so long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, my careers almost always start off with mining the Mun and Minmus for science to get at least most of the way up the tech tree-- not necessarily every single science result from every single biome, but certainly a lot of biomes from both of them.\u00A0 I don\u0027t like to start off by sending Eve/Duna probes, due to the wait involved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA different player, who finds Mun/Minmus science grinding tedious and doesn\u0027t care about calendar time, would make the opposite choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually what I end up doing is sending a couple of simple land-and-return missions (no docking) as early as possible in career, which can \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E jump-start my science program.\u00A0 Then I use a little bit of the science returned to unlock docking ports, and do a follow-up mission that hops a lot of biomes with an orbiting tank.\u00A0 Doing one such mission on Minmus and another on the Mun generally boosts my program to the point where I\u0027m ready to take on Duna and such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T11:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote
