For example, let\u0027s say you have a ship whose full mass is twice that of its dry mass (i.e. half its weight is fuel mass). In atmosphere at 220s of Isp, the Tsiokolosky Rocket Equation tells us that a rocket using an LV-N will have just under 1500 m/s of delta-V.

I\u0027ve been calculating delta v for weeks now, still trying to get a small compact Eve lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust is basically the force that is applied to CoT. To get Thrust-to-Weight-Ratio you simply divide your thrust by 9,81*mass. So for example 1 aerospike can lift no more than 18 tons on Kerbin vertically. It is a good idea to have your TWR above 1 even if you use wings because current drag model gives absurd amounts of aerodynamic friction. I usually prefer TWR at about 1.05 for rocket engines or 1.4 if i use jet engines. Remember that as you consume fuel your weight will be reduced and TWR will increase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-v is technically an advanced analogy to mileage. The more delta v the further your craft can get. It depends on your fuel amount and on your Isp. I am currently working on a small craft with 1 aerospike and 2 LV-Ns that has 2/3 of its mass as fuel, in total it has around 7000 delta-v according to formula:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelta-v = Isp*9,81*LN(full mass/dry mass)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere dry mass is mass without fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is actually getting a craft that has huge amounts of fuel relative to its total mass and efficient engines that can lift it all at the same time. Because efficient engines weigh a lot you have to combine them with other engines in a way that would give you a lot of TWR at take-off and an efficient burn later. This gets really hard, especially getting fuel ratio up when your Isp and TWR are capped.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-13T19:48:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2013 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jod\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T21:36:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat about the \u0022weak\u0022 ion drive - is it any good at moving bigger interplanetary ships?
