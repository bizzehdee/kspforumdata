Here it is, in the VAB:\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/Ih3yr#0](http://imgur.com/a/Ih3yr#0)\n\nLooks good, right? (I know, it looks like crap.) It\u0027s an accurate replica of the Dreamchaser, it is even a lifting body ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif). The spaceplane part of it flies really well, but with the booster attached, it isn\u0027t flyable at all. It flips out of control if you want to do a gravity turn. So, I want to hear your ideas about how to make it aerodynamically stable. Here are some pics of it in flight:\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/2F2fR#0](http://imgur.com/a/2F2fR#0)\n\nIf I can fix those aerodynamic problems, I will make a stock-only version as a kind of giveaway for your help. A big thank you, if you consider helping me anyway ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif)!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T11:39:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 11:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ZentroCatson**\n  \nfixed the problem"},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T18:42:53Z","Content":"Its because your center of lift is in front of your center of mass.

I used elevons, the game did tell me that the center of lift is behind the center of mass. Maybe I should try bigger wings or MOAR boosters. Btw, thanks for the quick answer!"},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T19:08:46Z","Content":"Try throwing a bunch of tail fins on the bottom?"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T19:20:47Z","Content":"You want the center of drag in the back.

(Bearing in mind that center of drag isn\u0027t visible in VAB.)\n\nAs JTpopcorn suggested, put fins at the bottom of your rocket, as far down as possible (i.e. not on the spaceplane part-- on the booster part). For even more stability, use something like the Delta Deluxe Winglet, which can actively steer to assist SAS, rather than just passive fins."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T19:46:45Z","Content":"Unless I\u0027m mistaken, it looks like you have no fins of any sort near the bottom of the booster. You may want to consider putting some there.\n\nGenerally, you want your center of lift pretty far back, and the way your ship is set-up currently, it\u0027s pretty far forward. This means it wants to flip 180 degrees, so that the CoL is further near the back.\n\nI recommend putting fins in 4 or 8- symmetry on the very bottom of your booster. If you put too many, it will be a lot harder to do your gravity turn, but that\u0027s a much smaller problem than flipping around. Try a few different set-ups til you get it just how you like it.\n\nHope this helps!"},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T21:54:56Z","Content":"I\u0027d try the deluxe delta winglet.

Have you considered a more \u0022traditional\u0022 shuttle approach? It has it\u0027s own set of difficulties though, such as getting all the angles and thrust levels right (particularly since you can\u0027t throttle engines individually).\n\n![pfyowwbh.png](http://i.imgur.com/pfyowwbh.png)\n\nAs the SRB\u0027s get near the end of their fuel, their TWR goes up and induces a gravity turn. Of course, this was in the 0.90 aero model. It might be disastrous in 1.0\u002B.\n\nA much simpler solution would just be to put fairings around it, if they\u0027ll fit. Still add some fins near the bottom.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T06:39:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 06:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T08:13:10Z","Content":"You could always try my [idea](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117918-Cipler-Micro-Shuttle), I\u0027ve found it to be pretty stable."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:46:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Been there, done that.

All the feathers are in the back, which puts the center of lift in the back. The farther back the CoL is, the more stable the aircraft or rocket, or arrow, will be. The farther forward, it will be less stable, but more maneuverable. Like shooting an arrow with the feathers on the front, any deviation of the arrow\u0027s orientation from it\u0027s direction of motion, the feathers on the front will catch the air like a sail and flip it around. I don\u0027t know how the real Dreamchaser does it without an absurd amount of wings on it, but at least in KSP you\u0027re gonna have to do it that way.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAlso, congrats on getting it to work!"}]}
