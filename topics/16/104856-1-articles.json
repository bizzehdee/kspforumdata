I\u0027ve tried with and without struts, separatrons, different decouplers, going slower and cutting the engines all together. The only way this doesn\u0027t happen is if my rocket is spinning at a rather sickening speed... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nHow do I prevent this from happening?

Also I often rotate the upper sepatrons upward a little (since the upper part of a booster is lighter than the rest) so the booster is not only being pulled away, but it also falls behind the rest of the rocket a little slower, thereby giving it time to distance itself from the central engine before passing it.
