It shows you which biome has a particular default base concentration. But it always displays either the complete biome (if it meets the spec) or nothing. You can never narrow it down to less than a complete biome at a time with the resource map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rauko","CreatedById":188489,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-22T11:40:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe for a (afaik) more realistic resources scanning (both the scanning process and the results outcome) you may want to try\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72679-15x-16x-scansat-v1810-real-scanning-real-science-at-warp-speed-december-31-2018/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ESCANSat\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strider3","CreatedById":199830,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-22T17:23:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried SCANSat and removed it after trying to do a Duna resource (Ore) scan.

I really hate the \u002250 shades of brown\u0022 biome maps that exist for, say, Duna? I was hoping to create new biome maps, to share with the community, that had very different colors for each biome (like the Mun biome map), which would make it easier for us to differentiate the biomes. Then I found out that I cannot change the colors for each biome in a SCANSat created biome map...it will always use the default colors of the current biome map. SO SAD. Other than that, I have no real use for SCANSat, the standard KSP scanning does well enough and is simple to use. I just wish we could adjust the overlay in 5% increments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
