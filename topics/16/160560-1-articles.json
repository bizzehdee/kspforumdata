Two large or (maybe) two edge static radiators should be enough. Anything that needs radiators will tell you in its extended info what module needs those radiators, and how much \u0022required cooling\u0022 is wanted. Like this nuclear reactor, it will say \u0022Resource Converter\u0022 then \u0022Required Cooling: xxx kW\u0022 which is\u00A0250kW if I remember right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224wSzssA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4wSzssA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen for all radiators, look where it says \u0022Radiators Specs: -\u0026gt; Core Heat xFer: yyy kW\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMatch the sum of Core Heat xFer from multiple radiators to Required Cooling.

That \u0022required cooling\u0022 value is a maximum, per \u0022channel\u0022, if the converter is running at 100% load, to keep the device at a constant temperature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA converter has 4 channels\u00A0-- that is, it can convert ore into 4 different things at the same time, if you tell it to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the next thing to look at is \u0022Max cooling\u0022 -- the device can\u0027t use any more cooling than this value, no matter how many radiators you have attached to it. So if you have all 4 channels running at 100% load, that\u0027s 800kW of core heat being produced. And the device maxes out at 750kW of cooling, so it will overheat in that case, no matter what you do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving an engineer on board will increase productivity, and also reduce the maximum amount of heat produced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-12T23:32:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2017 11:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
