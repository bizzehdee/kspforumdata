This is done because the physics simulation takes the majority of the CPU time and is the single largest limitation of the game (e.g. for large craft with many parts). So without any drag being computed: if a piece of junk is place on a sub-orbital trajectory around Kerbin with a PE of 50km then it will stay there forever, the orbit will not decay unless you \u0022take control\u0022 of it and watch it de-orbit while being focused on it. Craft that get too close to a planet or moon while \u0022on rails\u0022 will just be considered crashed and be deleted from the game, without checking anything else. So if you have a second craft in your physics range bubble during reentry, this then deploys its parachutes before the controlled craft does, and leaves the physics range, then it will be deleted even though the parachutes were deployed!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIIRC this \u0022death zone\u0022 is 20 km for Kerbin, and around 10 km for the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
