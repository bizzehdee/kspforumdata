In the screen shot, the red circle shows an area where the colours do not fade together.

I am not sure if other people see this but is there any way i can fix this. I have tried adjusting the gamma but it does not seem to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso in the dark i can not see my ship at all i and i can only see the silhouette against the background.

I also agree that your brightness and contrast settings are out of whack. Especially if you fiddled with them to see into dark places. If you see high gradients, your contrast is probably way too high. Just make sure to adjust the settings on your monitor AND video card. Many video cards and monitors also have gamma values. I recommend you reset the settings both, then calibrate one at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for dark ships, space is dark, you aren\u0027t going to see things without lights. I too put the brighter portions of the night sky in the background and use silhouette if I need to dock or do other maneuvers. If you find yourself in the dark for too long, you can also raise the orbit (if you don\u0027t want or can\u0027t add lights).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T17:12:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys, ill just mess around with the settings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T18:47:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, and I want to stress this is a VERY hackish solution, you can use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71536\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAmbient Light Adjustment\u003C/a\u003E mod.
