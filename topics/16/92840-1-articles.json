Several good suggestions have been offered. I also usually view from the side of whatever I\u0027m working on. When you get used to that, you won\u0027t actually need the ALT key that much. It also helps to have the view set before you grab a part. Sometimes rotating the view with a part in hand causes it to slide off to the sides or into the background, which makes it harder to align. Also, you need to have the part roughly oriented in the desired direction. Otherwise the editor thinks you DON\u0027T want the part attached to the stack node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESummary:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- View from the side\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Have the view set before selecting parts from the list\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Orient the part in roughly the correct orientation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are other tricks too, like zooming in or out a little.
