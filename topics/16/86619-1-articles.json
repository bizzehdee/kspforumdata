The bombs themselves are just five small Oscar-B Fuel Tanks attached to TR-2V Stack Decoupler which are attached to the ship proper via a small Cubic Octagonal Truss (can be surface attached). The decouplers are also activated by action groups (or by stagging).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen in the action group screen in the VAB/SPH, click on a part you want to use and set it up to one of the custom action group (1 to 10).
