Also, I never remember which one is which, but if you hover your mouse over them, one will say \u0022target position...\u0022 while the other won\u0027t. Obviously, the one tha tays target is the target position and the other one is you."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T02:07:50Z","Content":"Also, if there is only one set (It is pink I believe) then your orbit will only cross the targets orbit once.
