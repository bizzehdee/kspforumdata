Its an older thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40515-Duna-Apollo-Style\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E . After all kinds of theory crafting for that thread the subject of even harder Apollo style missions came up. So the question is how far has someone pushed that design within the realm of KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Would it be possible to do a mission to Moho using an Apollo style setup that used only chemical rockets? Three Kerbals leave Kerbin, two man staged lander, rover, etc. Specifically we were discussing a mission using those challenge rules linked above and assuming we want maximum points so that leaves out LV-Ns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-11T13:09:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2014 01:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by esinohio\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T14:17:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that would be impossible.

It is possible to do a round trip (Not including landing) with about 7km/s dV.

That\u0027s quite high, but should be within what a three-stage launcher can do (remember the Saturn V used the third stage for trans-lunar ejection.) The gotcha is that that\u0027s in an optimal launch window, but then waiting for said window isn\u0027t \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CSM then needs 5130 m/s to circularise at Moho, and later depart Moho back for Kerbin. 2200 of that needs to be done with the LM as payload. That is again quite high, but I believe doable, for a single stage; the limit with a 390 Isp engine and traditional tanks is 8397 m/s. Perhaps not in the spirit of the challenge but still perfectly viable and I feel reasonable would be a two-stage CSM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LM needs 2800 m/s. Entirely reasonable - Tylo needs much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake no mistake, this is going to need a \u003Cem\u003Ebig\u003C/em\u003E rocket.
