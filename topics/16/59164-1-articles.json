Usually people do this to unlock extra performance, but I have a very good computer, and I\u0027m curious: are there any advantages to doing more calculations as opposed to less?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also somewhat annoyed by the way my apoapsis and periapsis points start jittering like mad as soon as I get them under 2 km of each other. I kind of like my near-perfectly circular 72km orbits around Kerbin, but all I can see is the markers spazzing all over the place. Is there something I can set in the config to maybe increase the resolution or whatever it takes to make the markers more precise?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T14:03:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, that\u0027s because your craft is moving and shifting the center of mass very little, because the games physics calculatoins are so precise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T14:26:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding physics step, as far as I understand it, it is only used when your framerate drops. Until then, the game makes as small physics steps as possible (delta t = time since last frame). This value actually prevents it doing too big physics steps. Big physics steps may lead to structural failures and other problems similar to what happens in high physics warp. Smaller physics steps mean more reliable physics simulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding Pe/Ap jittering, it\u0027s result of how the game is implemented. Sometimes it causes problems, e.g. when placing a maneuver on such orbit. Then you can force them still by entering time warp (x5 is enough).

As far as I understand it, that needs to be done super precisely, but the second apsis at least will be jittering so much that it\u0027s impossible to see its value within a large margin of error.
