Those contracts suck, so you should usually just decline them unless you\u0027re hurting for science. If you get a part test contract that\u0027s suborbital or in orbit (at Kerbin! Don\u0027t bother with Mun/Minmus) though, that might be worth doing. Some of those for endgame parts pay an absolute fortune and cost next to nothing to do (e.g. the Kerbodyne engines, toroidal aerospikes, RAPIERs to name a few)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
