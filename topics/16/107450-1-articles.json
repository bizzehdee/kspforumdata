I was having a very hard time trying to bring back my SSTOs and, all of the sudden, I install 1.0.2 and the parts still do heat up but they don\u0027t explode at high atmosphere, almost for nothing, like they did in 1.0 even with a shallow reentry angle.\n\nand another question? Are parts damaged from heat? I had an SSTO with canards, when I lift off they were working, after being \u0022baked\u0022 on reentry they do not move ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nyes, I know, I shouldn\u0027t put canards on a spaceplane...

The LV-N engines no longer heat up as much either and the ore drill/refiner also are a lot more resilient at least in my limited experience. I think I read somewhere that there was a mistake in the code where a sign was reversed in one of the equations which has now being corrected."},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:16:36Z","Content":"See [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118785-No-heatshield-risky), but yes reentry heat has changed; aside from vulnerable parts like science experiments, it\u0027s not worth worrying about in 1.0.2, regardless of how aggressive you are with reentry."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:59:56Z","Content":"Seems like finding the proper balance between everything exploding and nothing exploding has been a challenge. I would say, at least it seems like they\u0027ve found the bounds of the system, with 1.0.0 maybe a bit on the explody side and 1.0.2 being on the non-explody side. Perhaps we will end up with something closer to the middle.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T17:13:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E with 1.0.0 maybe a bit on the explody side\n\nI thought 1.0.0\u0027s reentry heating was just about right - at most maybe 10-20% too much. Enough to make reentry a challenge for spaceplanes or poorly designed craft, but not so much that even well designed craft with heatshields (with the PhysicsSignificance fix) had to be super careful about their reentry profile. New players of course have the option of turning down the difficulty setting ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
