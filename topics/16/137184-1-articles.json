Now, the question is, what do i do next? There are no contracts for a Minmus landing, so basically a waste of money, and there are only contracts for testing stuff, going to certain locations on\u00A0Kerbin, and sending tourists to Mun and back. I don\u0027t wan\u0027t to send tourists to Mun, as i only the 3rd time made a rocket with enough delta-v that can return(just placed bigger fuel tanks), Testing engines can be awkward as the requirements are a bit hard to accomplish, and going to a certain location, just feels uneasy. What do i do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KocLobster","CreatedById":159324,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T20:44:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you feel like you\u0027re done with the Mun, I would suggest going to Minmus and doing every science experiment available to you, one biome at a time. And by landing on Minmus, your kerbals will level up too. After your first Minmus landing, you will start seeing more contracts for Minmus. Lastly, it\u0027s not at all a waste going to Minmus, or anywhere for that matter, even if you don\u0027t have a contract related to it at the time. You can gain tons of Science from biome hops on Minmus. I\u0027m assuming this isn\u0027t a sandbox save; I\u0027m guessing you\u0027re likely playing in career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T21:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what you\u0027re saying, I think you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edo\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E want to take tourist contracts to the Mun, and use that as an excuse to get more science and a paid way of testing and improving your rockets, and above all improving your piloting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEspecially for the piloting bit, since you can easily reduce your fuel needs by a sixth or more if you get each bit perfect compared to just \u0022middling\u0022: a good ascent to orbit (i.e. good gravity turn) (\u2248400m/s saved) followed by a well-plotted Mun intercept (\u2248100m/s saved) followed by a very low circularisation burn direct into Mun orbit (\u2248100-200 m/s saved) followed by an ideally timed suicide burn (\u2248200-300m/s saved) followed by a clean burn off the surface and straight to a 30km atmospheric Kerbin Pe (\u2248100-200m/s saved).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you definitely want to unlock science instruments in priority, so that you don\u0027t have to keep going back to the same biomes too often.

Dock two ships and you get the \u0022started creating a space station\u0022 and \u0022transferred crew in orbit\u0022 world firsts for a bit of cash and reputation, and should also trigger the possibility for \u0022expand your space station\u0022 contracts to come up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if you ever get a hugely difficult contract (like: \u0022create Mun orbiting station and have 4000 fuel\u0022), take it - the advance is good, you\u0027ve got years to do the contract and this\u0027ll let you upgrade, explore for more science, unlock parts and so on and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, for Minmus: you\u0027ll get a world first payment for going to Minmus in any event.

However, if you wait for those contracts to come up before exploring anywhere, your progress will be slow.
