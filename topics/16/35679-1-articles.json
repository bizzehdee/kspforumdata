I\u0027ve made a few great little creations in the SPH that handle well and are fun to play with in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I decided to try building a VTOHL. It launches in a vertical configuration on top of one of my standard lifters. I take it up to an 80x80 orbit around Kerbin and detach the horizontally-designed payload (pic below), and then do a quick de-orbit burn. As you can see I am using B9 Aerospace parts in conjunction with stock. I also have the Ferram Aerospace plugin running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is that as soon as my plane reaches 33,000m it stalls and spins wildly out of control. ASAS does nothing to help. My airbrakes only worsen the spin, and parachutes simply alter my trajectory to become completely vertical, which of course means I\u0027m completely screwed. Are there any obvious errors I\u0027m making, perhaps in the design of my craft or the way I\u0027m flying it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kf8lAuJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Kf8lAuJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iqKzjkn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iqKzjkn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-02T23:54:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2013 11:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by XenonSpark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rradley","CreatedById":72432,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T22:35:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConcerning your problem space planes when no designed correctly will destabilize in low air, to fix this increase the speed of the aircraft or find a way to switch from air intake engines to rocket fuel.
