It is impossible to get fuel lines from the tanks to the engine, they just end up attaching to the adapter. I then found that I could still attach mk0 tanks to the 3 nodes, clipping through the adapter. Fuel lines to the LV-N and everything \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eseemed\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to work fine, only it doesn\u0027t: even though they are connected at the same node, th mk0 tanks don\u0027t draw fuel from the Mk1 tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, I had to be well into my interplanetary burn by the time I found this out, so that was a huge pain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the second design, I thought the Mk2 Bicoupler might work. The LV-N draws fuel fine from the bicoupler, so I just removed the oxide and added Mk1 tanks above. And again, it was only on the interplanetary burn that I found out that the bicoupler will NOT draw/allow the transfer of fuel from the connected mk1 tanks. Again, fun to have to transfer fuel every minute or so on a long burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, has anyone found a way to get this to work? I\u0027m coming to the conclusion that I\u0027ll just have to bite the bullet and clip the engine into the parallel stacks of tanks. or clip a cubic thingy into the tanks and attach the engine to that. The downside is obviously the time and effort making sure the thing is actually perfectly central.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mudkest","CreatedById":115812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T16:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s GPO fuel pump and TAC fuel balancer mods that can help you with the transfer every minute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/58458-fuel-flow-rules-0242/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnice post on fuel flow rules, dont think much(if anything) has changed since it got posted\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T16:44:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Plusck, designs like this are always a bit tricky because only one node of the adaper/tricoupler will connect to the tanks above. only one stack of tanks will be accessible to the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you run fuel lines from the Mk1 tanks to the adapter it\u0027ll allow fuel to flow from them to that part and then the LV-N can draw from the adapter, it helps to add struts as well because with only one node actually connected the adapter may twist a bit when the LV-N is running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother trick is to put docking ports with fuel crossfeed enabled on the bottom of those tanks and the top of the adapter, this can be done by first adding the adapter, adding the docking ports in symmetry then removing the adapter and using the re-root tool (4) to make one of the docking ports the root.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr just by adding one docking port, then the adapter, then the other ports singularly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne node will connect and the others will dock when you launch so you won\u0027t need fuel lines or struts, the only downside to this is that aero occlusion will only work on the node attached docking port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then you will already have ends exposed to the airflow with the strut\u002Bfuel line method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus feature, with the adapter on docking ports you can replace the engine in flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what it would look like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HEedELa.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022318\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/HEedELa.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022573\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T17:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcellent, thank you for all that info.
