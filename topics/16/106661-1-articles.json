And minmus is the same DV away so you can get even more by going there second (or even first)\n\nA small rocket with just a 909 on the upper stage and a T30 on the lower should be able to orbit the mun at about 12T launch mass. Not at my computer, but I think I used 600 units of fuel on the upper stage and 1200 on the booster stage. (The same design with a T45 on the upper stage should work for a flyby, maybe an orbit if you are efficient with your ascent). This gives a bit over 5k DV, 3500 to orbit, 900 to fly by, 250 for orbit and another 250 to escape, and a couple hundred to set up aerocapture.\n\nFins on the booster stage are helpful but not necessary.

You can get most of those from an equatorial orbit and each of those is worth new science.\n\nYou can also run materials bay, goo, crew report, and EVA report from high orbit (though you won\u0027t get biome specific data for the biomes below you). To get to high orbit be above 250km.\n\nAlso keep in mind that for experiments like Goo and Materials Bay you may be able to re-run experiments for more science (though less than the initial run)."},{"CreatedByName":"Garius","CreatedById":142266,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T21:59:46Z","Content":"You can get enough science from a flyby or two to unlock the 909.
