But then I accepted this contract later and came back to the Mun with a different rover and scanned it again, however the contract still says 0% of 33%. How can I get this contract to complete?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kerb.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002273.00\u0022 height=\u0022683\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/JKFtXmZ/kerb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: neverminded, apparently that\u0027s not a mun crater. sure looks like a crater...on the mun\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"domendemo","CreatedById":206846,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-26T01:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe you did not use a \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
