The typical profile is a dash to 20km altitude, at which point you level off and begin a very slow climb to 30km, gaining as much horizontal velocity as possible, using rate of climb to balance thrust and air intake with drag.

You can dump off most of your useless mass (wings/jet engines/intakes/anything that doesn\u0027t work in space) once in orbit and use a very efficient engine to use the rest of the fuel to go to where ever you want.

Once in space, unless it is a lightweight below 10t, the nuke will ALWAYS give you the best range. For super lightweights, a rapier can actually give higher dV, but it has to be very small for this to be true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_Would it be more efficient to have an external seat to save weight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eits extremely theoretical. for starters, kerbals have mass when outside of a command pod. While it is still LESS then a command pod, i dont think the effort of setting up command seats is worth a negligible benefit (it may help for extremely long range vessels but its quite possible to drag a 1 ton command pod to laythe and land it there). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_is there a secial way to go when buidling these things sutch as Light and Manovrable or heavy and Fast\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy recent SSTO is manuverable and fairly fast, but id say at least for beginners, maneuverability is not the priority. Stability and minimizing drag/unneeded mass is key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor someone who isnt very experienced with SSTOs, here are a few general tips on building something that WILL get into orbit at the bare minimum, and can easily go farther if needed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 jet for 10 tons (you can get away with 1 for 15 with a very large amount of wings), or 1 rapier for around 8 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave at least some wings. While some SSTOs are technically wing stabilized rockets (i tend to build this way recently), the best efficiency during ascent is with enough wings to be able to fly somewhat straight at low altitudes. The more cargo capacity and mass, the more wings you will need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerospikes or LVT-30s are good for short range, but are only 13% more fuel efficient then rapiers, and still make little sense over a nuke that have around 200% the fuel economy of a aerospike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave at a bare minimum 0.03 intake area per engine with a medium sized 10-20t SSTO, but i myself tend to bring around 20 on most builds to let me get some thrust above 50km with either jets or rapiers. If its very small/light, one ram may very well suffice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you plan to dock, bring RCS/ports, but if you dont intend on docking, leave it out to save mass (and remove monoprop from teh cockpit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, cut out anything that isnt deemed essential to the mission. The less mass, the more range and the easier it is to get in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekeep center of mass IN FRONT of the center of lift at all times (need to compensate for shifting CoG due to fuel drain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn average, you want 2/3 LFO, 1/3 jet fuel, although this can vary greatly on mission requirements (need more fuel when going to laythe for ex), and also on your ascent profile (rocket like sstos generally use less jet fuel and get in orbit faster but need more rocket to circularize, whereas more classical planes spend alot more fuel on jets, and get to a faster orbit on jets, using less rocket fuel to circularize).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bitslizer","CreatedById":127646,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T05:51:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyes, yes, and YES!
