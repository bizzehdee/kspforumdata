Even using \u0022fine\u0022 adjustments with the middle mouse button, the intersect points can jump around and disappear for no apparent good reason. Sometimes there are no intersect points when it seems clear there should be. My rendezvous points are well inside Mun orbit so what could be causing these disturbances?\n\n2. I\u0027ve found that I need to add roughly 6 orbits to the node in order to get an intercept point near the asteroid\u0027s perigee. The tutorial mentions nothing of this. Am I making things overly complicated? If I shoot for a rendezvous further out, the intersect points become even more jumpy and unpredictable.. not to mention the longer burn required to make it way out there (see below).\n\n3. My engines overheat after roughly 2 minutes of what appears to be around a 4-minute burn. I tried to lengthen the burn but still suffered engine overheating. Is this part of the tutorial design or am I doing it wrong?\n\nThank you in advance."}]}
