Looking through the top-level directory, I see five files that would qualify as executables (by the way, the executable bit is set on everything, which is overkill; only directories and files that can actually be run should have that bit set). I\u0027m not sure what KSP.exe is for, as Linux doesn\u0027t employ the .exe \u0022extension\u0022. Then, we have KSP.\\* and Launcher.\\* Does one invoke the Launcher.\\* appropriate to the host, which then exec()s the corresponding KSP.\\* or do these executables serve separate functions? I\u0027ve looked over the readme.txt but it appears to be more a ChangeLog than anything else.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T02:14:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 02:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by dclarion**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T23:05:48Z","Content":"I\u0027m not familiar with Linux, so I\u0027m not going to be really helpful there, but just a quick question: are you sure you downloaded the Linux version on the KSP website (just checking) ?\n\nAnd, also, KSP.exe launches the game directly, while Launcher.exe launches the launcher (yo dawg) which gives you news about KSP, the possibility to check for updates and a few other things. I personnaly do not use the Launcher.exe since I had a bug in 1.0.2 which made that I had infinite \u0022checking for updates\u0022 and was not able to launch the game. I don\u0027t know if this has been fixed, but anyway, if you have a doubt, use KSP.[whatever you have]"},{"CreatedByName":"dclarion","CreatedById":146813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T23:12:54Z","Content":"Absolutely sure.
