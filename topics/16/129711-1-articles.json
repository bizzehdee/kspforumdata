Mainsails used for the boosters and the huge vectoring engines on the shuttle. I get the fuel from the boosters to also transfer to the shuttle, and when the boosters have no more fuel, i jettison them. But I realized that the left booster doesn\u0027t use its fuel as quickly as the right booster, i end up with one vectoring engine flamed out on the shuttle and the left booster still has\u00A0fuel in it. As you may see in one of the pics listed down below, a fuel line is going from the bottom of each booster to the top fuel tank. I was just dicking around to see if it changed anything. but it didn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/364030469400217089/839E5789917212CB34D6E437FB2DE74F72CFC5B9/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPic one\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/364030469400216891/5EC001686719BB9FDAE0CD35C2FF5C73ECEA2C05/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPic two\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/364030469400216462/2DB9C8B73F627071B35CB50CFBFA351C49ECA78C/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPic three\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe things on the top left boosters are the seperatrons. I forgot to enable symmetry mode when I added them. The fuel lines are in fact going to the central tank. When I took off the central tank (and it also took away the boosters) my left engine on the shuttle\u00A0was also taken off. My guess is here that there is a glitch where it thinks that the left engine is apart of the external tank and boosters. I\u0027ve encountered that problem before with a larger shuttle, where the structural part that mounts the 3 vectoring engines had came off with the external fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-12T06:51:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2016 06:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MakuziTheInuk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-11T21:27:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is that on top of your left booster, on the side?
