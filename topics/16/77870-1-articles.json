I have seen that in KSP a station in orbit takes around 0.7x real time for my computer (a large, refuelling station with tugs). However, a base that has around the same number of parts, but split in different pieces (main base, two crew vehicles, and a transporter) slows my computer down to 0.3x real time. Does anyone know whether if it is the textures of the ground around my base or if it is because I have separate vehicles sitting around my base instead of having them all attached?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have several mods installed, although I don\u0027t think that is really significant since all of my parts are stock and the game\u0027s not crashing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trentendegreth","CreatedById":86953,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T22:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei tried to do a mun base and ran into the same issues, if you have a craft less then 2.5km away then you can expect more lag, i don\u0027t know how many calculations each part gets per second, but lets say 10, anything around 400 parts really starts lagging my machine, as the calculations per second on one core of my cpu are around 4000. i hope that helps (note numbers are arbitrary and only for example as a demonstration of what i think i know, if some one smarter can chime in, please by all means.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maxkm5st1","CreatedById":115411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T22:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne reason may be because KSP has to calculate the velocities of each craft\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T13:02:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that\u0027s exactly the reason-- You have multiple craft inside the physics distance. Even if the part count is overall about the same, now you have a lot more calculations to do. Inside of one craft, the parts are only interacting through joints, and not collision meshes. A second vehicle nearby? Now every collision-mesh on each craft could potentially interact with the meshes of the other. The only way it\u0027ll know they\u0027re NOT touching, is to run through the calculations for all of them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s my best guess, anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qazsedcft","CreatedById":114699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T14:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NecroBones\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NecroBones\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EInside of one craft, the parts are only interacting through joints, and not collision meshes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you sure about that?
