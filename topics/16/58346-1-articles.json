For starters, I\u0027m about halfway through the tech tree. While I can bring light payloads to the Mun, Minmus, and beyond with fuel to spare, I just can\u0027t seem to lift my most recent project into orbit. It\u0027s a fuel module made with the second largest Rockomax tank, plus a few bits and bobs so I can adjust attitude and attach it to my 200km station. However, the lifter that has been my workhorse with smaller modules (basically a tri-coupler with double stacked FL-T800s over LV-T45 engines and some large SRBs on the outside to help it) does not come close to cutting it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I tried redesigning the lifter to use the same larger fuel tanks. I stacked two Rockomax 32s together to equal an orange tank (not unlocked), then made a cluster of 6 T45s and a T30 in the center underneath. Then I radially coupled a combination of solid and liquid boosters on the outside, but \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E I couldn\u0027t get it to the desired altitude and orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that, I\u0027m pretty much out of ideas that don\u0027t involve ridiculous concentric circles of asparagus-staged boosters.

Each one of these jet modules can easily lift 13 tons on top of its own weight and have more than enough fuel in their own tanks to last 4-5 minutes, a typical 300 ton rocket would need about 24-25 of them to get off the ground. The obvious advantage of this is that you can either get your main rocket up to 10000m before you even need to ignite your main engines or you can simply ignite the whole stack and limit your main engines to 50% in order to boost net ISP. Once you hit the 10k mark its the simple matter of throttling back then waiting a few seconds before staging off the jet engines and hopefully not getting blown up by them as they fly off in all different directions, since they take quite a while to stop once you throttle back, For this reason I tend to hold off on starting my gravity turn until about 12km. But using the first method I can now happily get a 15-20 ton payload into orbit with only 1.25m tech and then still have enough dV to get me to any nearby planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T23:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FREEFALL1984\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FREEFALL1984\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Once you hit the 10k mark its the simple matter of throttling back then waiting a few seconds before staging off the jet engines and hopefully not getting blown up by them as they fly off in all different directions, since they take quite a while to stop once you throttle back, For this reason I tend to hold off on starting my gravity turn until about 12km.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry seting up an action group to kill all the jets at once. Not only can you continue burning full throttle on the rockets but it kills the thrust of the jets instiantly instead of haveing to wait out the spool down time. Action group them off and then stage them and they\u0027ll drop like any other spent stage.
