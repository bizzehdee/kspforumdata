They can have the same use as a space station. You can use it for science. If you send extra fuel there, you can refuel any future landers. You can make it a place to visit any time you visit the mun so you have a place you know is safe to land. You can use it for some of the challenges that are on the forums. All in all, they\u0027re mostly for fun, you can do it as a challenge to yourself,( i am acutally in the process of building a Duna base\u002B space station), you can practice precision landing, ect.

There are enough biomes, but they can hardly be researched via rovers. So I set me a goal. Let\u0027s break it down from the top stage down:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. A manned flying vehicle (\u0022Probe\u0022) equipped with all science instruments I can afford at that point lands at some biome. Crew reports, EVA, samples, all the science instruments. The vehicle then heads to the Munbase and lands there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Either the vehicle itself heads towards the stationary Lab, or some kind of tug carries it there. It docks to the lab. Astronauts carry all the data to the lab. The lab resets the MatLab and the Goo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The Probe undocks from the Lab and is carried (or drives itself) away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. A refueler rover docks with it and refuels it. The fuel is taken from a separate tanker that is launched from Kerbin and is landed nearby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The Probe goes to some other location to repeat the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. And of course, every once in a while, a capsule from Kerbin comes (maybe with a replacement crew), all data is loaded back into it and sent back to Kerbin to be recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E: )\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-30T21:03:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2013 09:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by BlackBicycle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T03:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the only use I see besides looking cool is having a processing lab to recover science, but that could be in orbit instead, you know what, I\u0027m gonna do just that!

They\u0027re mostly to give yourself something more to do than just send 1 guy somewhere to grab a handful of rocks and plant a flag. Also, they give you an excuse to use all the big rocket parts you unlock near the end of the tech tree but don\u0027t actually need to unlock the rest of the tree \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd BTW, Kethane is pretty much a complete waste of time within the Kerbin system, because it\u0027s a lot easier to just send tankers where needed from KSC. Kethane only really becomes useful at other planets. There, it lets you avoid having to send out monster ships with fuel to go and return. Instead, you can send smaller ships with fuel for a 1-way trip and refuel them at the destination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
