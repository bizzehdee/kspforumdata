She got herself in a clockwise orbit around Duna. And I didn t realise her direction until I was parked in low orbit around Duna. In the right direction of course. On that subject I think it would be unbelievably helpful to get the direction of an orbit like we get with satellite mission. I had a quick look and couldn t find a mod that does that. Is there one? The only way I know to find out the direction of an object is to time warp.. \n\nSo here is the situation:\n\n![KSP_KarenSit.jpg](http://lacroixdidier.com/temp/KSP_KarenSit.jpg)\n\nAs you can see brutally inverting my orbit will cost me more than 1758m/s.\n\nAnd the best I could do so far is this:\n\n![KSP_KarenMn.jpg](http://lacroixdidier.com/temp/KSP_KarenMn.jpg)\n\nThis adds up to 792m/s if it goes according to plan.. which is unlikely. Then I ll spend some more DeltaV to rendezvous and the way back. With only 1459m/s on that ship I don\u0027t think I can come back to dock in low duna orbit after rescue.\n\nIs there a more efficient way to turn around?\n\nIs there something to transform all orbits in map view into satellite mission orbit display ( simply showing those little dots travelling in the direction of the object).\n\nThanks for the help.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T12:22:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 12:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nookos**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mighty1","CreatedById":95750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T11:49:02Z","Content":"Well, you could try to get out and push.

Much much better. \n\n![KSP_KarenMn3.jpg](http://lacroixdidier.com/temp/KSP_KarenMn3.jpg)\n\nThis should be only 474m/s one way and the way back will be cheaper I guess. So thanks a lot you just saved Karen\u0027s life.\n\nBy optimizing my previous maneuver I didn t get much further. From 792 to 718m/s. Thanks again.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Karen is pretty far out, so she should be going relatively slow (check with mouse hover).

It just undocked from the station. I could probably detach a tank from the station and attach it to the rescue ship thanks to KIS but no need now. I m gonna try and see if I can use Ike to raise Ap as you suggest. I didn t think of that either.

Doing a tiny change to flip the inclination shouldn\u0027t cost much, and then leaving Ike you would basically have reverted your orbit? maybe not a full 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 but at least 120\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0?\n\nJust speculating here... any people who know if that works? can\u0027t try right now..."}]}
