I know what TWR means for each individual stage - liftoff, ascent, orbital. And I know how to fix TWR issues when I encounter them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027ve been thinking lately. 2.0 TWR at liftoff... why, exactly, is that the best way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, ostensibly you want a thrust profile that lets you accelerate at terminal velocity without too much throttling. Some people even advocate 2.0 as a mnimum for for a hard initial sprint to 110 m/s so you can be flying at terminal velocity as early as possible. It sounds very sensible; clearly you are flying more efficiently at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now follow this thought experiment: assume you have a rocket with a launchpad TWR of 2.0. This thing can do the sprint-style launch just fine. But instead, you add extra fuel to the liftoff stage only. You add extra fuel until the TWR is only 1.2 or so. As a result, the rocket will not sprint off the pad. It will crawl off the pad, laborously gaining altitude meter by excruciating meter. But, here\u0027s the interesting thing: At some point, the rocket will have consumed all the extra fuel you have added, and it will be back to 2.0 TWR and the same amount of fuel that it had at the beginning. But instead of sitting on the pad with that amount of fuel, it is already off the ground a little ways, in slightly thinner atmosphere, with some initial speed under its belt!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously this doesn\u0027t work with upper stages. Those either need a certain TWR to not fall out of the sky in the middle of the gravity turn, and don\u0027t have the luxury of taking their time to burn off excess fuel; or they are orbital stages and have exceptionally low TWR requirements to begin with. But for the liftoff stage only, doing this is an option. The question I have is: why are we not doing this? Why are we doing the sprint-to-terminal-velocity instead? I\u0027m aware that dry mass is high for tanks in KSP, but we do have decouplers for building drop tanks and asparagus bundles, so that can\u0027t be the excuse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, what am I missing here? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T19:28:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 1.7 TWR advice is usually given for asparagus staged rockets, so that the overall TWR of the ship can be kept constant since staging happens frequently during the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lower liftoff TWR is, as you noticed, more advantageous on serial staged rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there is an advantage in climbing the first kilometer quickly - raising the ISP of the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest example of this is the LV-N: at sea level it\u0027s 220, one kilometer up and it\u0027s already something like 320-330 - comparable to all the other rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T19:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00222\u0022 is just a rule-of-thumb and I don\u0027t know anyone who recommends a \u003Cem\u003Elaunch\u003C/em\u003E TWR of 2 - that\u0027s rather an average you should aim for over the first stage(s).

You will actually get more overall delta-v by taking your existing lifter and adding fuel tanks until your TWR is barely over 1.0. Mathematically speaking, this happens because you are increasing your mass ratio. That is, a larger percentage of your rocket is fuel by mass when you add fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you will also lose more delta-v during your ascent due to gravity drag because you are not flying at terminal velocity. You spend more time thrusting in direct opposition to Kerbin\u0027s gravity. The reason people say you should aim for a TWR of 2 is that you need about that much in order to only use 4500 m/s of delta-v getting to LKO. With a lower TWR, you will use more than 4500 m/s of delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the question is, if you add more fuel until your TWR is just above 1.0, will the additional delta-v you get out of the design be enough to overcome the additional delta-v that it will take you to get to LKO?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, let\u0027s find out experimentally!
