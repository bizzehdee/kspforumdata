I know the lab can hold 2 scientists, but is it required? Can I just stick 1 scientist in each one (maybe with a pet rock or something for company), and still get the research speed bonus? Also even assuming 1 is all I need per lab, are there any bonuses to putting 2 scientists in each one?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T00:30:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 12:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veldez**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xkay7","CreatedById":129537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T04:25:38Z","Content":"science labs **require** two scientists"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T05:13:45Z","Content":"Science lab itself require two scientist but you can put as many scientist as you like in a craft that is connected to the lab and those scientists will still give you bonus. So more scientists ftw. Just a note; multiple science labs don\u0027t work well with each other in the same craft. But you can always have seperate science labs staying side by side yet separated and use the same report in all of them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T05:16:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 05:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T07:14:01Z","Content":"I think the Science Lab actually requires one Scientist input, but is going to get the job slower. I have tried a lab with Bob and a pilot, and it worked just fine. However, all scientists aboard the station the Lab is... well, stationed, will give a bonus, with no max cap attached AFAIK.\n\nSo yeah, you can get away with one. But I don\u0027t recommend it."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T07:26:11Z","Content":"you need two kerbals, at least one of which must be a scientist. (Something about pilots/engineers eating the samples). The amount of scientists in the entire craft, not the lab itself, it what determines the speed."}]}
