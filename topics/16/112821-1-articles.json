However, it turns out there was a much bigger problem causing the in flight break up. The first thing I noticed was that the anomalous events would take place at a definitive moment during the vehicle climb out. Somewhere around 15k. The anomalies being, a strange snap/click/buckling sound coming from the vehicle, after which the entire vehicle would pitch steeply and the break up would occur. I noticed that when this strange snap or clicking sound would take place, there was a marked deceleration and the engines seemed to get quieter. I started to wonder if for some reason the main Orbiter engines were the issue. Perhaps the engines were running out of fuel. However, while watching the fuel gauges on left by the stage display, the main engines still showed fuel to be burned. I checked the fuel window that shows all the fuels on board and their status\u0027s and saw again that there was still fuel left to burn. Then I noticed the Oxidizer. 0/2750. I ran the launch again and watched the Oxidizer drain to 0 and all of the anomalous events once again took place. There was fuel enough left to burn alright but, it couldn\u0027t burn anymore. No Oxidizer. Which I learned after looking up rocket engines and SRB\u0027s and learning what I could about fuel/propellant mixtures and how Oxidizer is required. I thought Oxidizer was only needed in space where there\u0027s no atmosphere or oxygen to be had. Apparently it\u0027s needed on the ground as well. \n\nAfter all of these findings I concluded that, the Oxidizer was running out, the main Orbiter engines could no longer produce thrust, symmetry was gone, the SRB\u0027s thrust took over, overwhelming the SAS stability control and the sudden pitch of the vehicle caused the in-flight break up. \n\nNext task? Figure out the solution to the loss of Oxidizer. If there is any other solution other than merely carrying more Oxidizer.\n\nIf anyone after reading this sees that my logic or understanding of how these things work is flawed, please let me know what I\u0027m missing. I\u0027m eager to learn more if I can. My hope is that this might help someone else avoid this mistake during their KSP travels.

After all, many people that use simulations like this, want to simulate the entire experience of having to do things manually or \u0022by hand\u0022 and work their way up to easier days. Just like we did with NASA. That\u0027s why I love simulations. Especially ones that strive for realism and immersion. It gives you a unique perspective on what it was or is like when you can\u0027t actually be there yourself. I\u0027ve launched and failed so many times that, I imagine what it must have been like in NASA\u0027s early days. The Astronauts routinely risking their lives for the Adventure of the Century. The \u0022New Frontier\u0022 of spaceflight. My experiences also taught me how complicated the process really is. Why attention to detail is needed. The need for the creation of checklists, contingency procedures etc... One thing that has stuck out in my mind is how at least in KSP we can slap on SAS and test some things out without having a Kerbal on board, risking his little digital life. Astronauts like John Glenn, Ed White and Alan Shepard weren\u0027t that lucky. And in Ed White\u0027s case, unfortunately we didn\u0027t have automation to test things out even during ground testing. All that being said, I will still try out Mechjeb at some point. After I learn to do things the hard way and manually ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) I hate the fact that I don\u0027t have a joystick to use.

I probably just used the term incorrectly. What I meant was, when I lost the Orbiter\u0027s main engine due to the lack of oxidizer, I lost thrust on that side of the vehicle when before that happened, I had the thrust from the two SRB\u0027s plus the Orbiter engine. So, it was a bit more equal. Once the Orbiter\u0027s engines seized up, the whole vehicle pitched over. I\u0027m assuming from the sudden loss of thrust from one side. If there is a word used to describe the placement of engines in order to create an equal amount of thrust, then that is what I mean. Again, sorry for the confusion"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T16:01:50Z","Content":"I find Mechjeb worth it for the customizable engineering readouts alone. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Of course, Kerbal Engineer does the same thing, too. \n\nAs far as autopilot is concerned, while I do a fair amount manually still (docking, most landings, all rover driving) I go all the way when using probes - I try to design it so that NO manual input is allowed, only commands through Mechjeb\u0027s various autopilot modules. It\u0027s a probe, after all. It HAS to land by itself! It becomes an engineering constraint - How can I design this so that even Mechjeb won\u0027t mess things up?\n\nEDIT: Well, next to no manual input.

These are arcade game skills, and while I highly recommend everyone learn to do everything in KSP manually first, to me, adding the automation to some of these steps adds realism, and doesn\u0027t take me out of the experience the way that key mashing does.
