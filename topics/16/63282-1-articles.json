Normally I do this from inside a planet so not quite sure coming from outside.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T00:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want to pass behind it relative to its orbit and you want your orbit to be as eccentric as possible.

Its gravity will tug you along behind it, accelerating you around the Sun and increasing your orbital energy. If you mess up and pass ahead of the planet, it will decelerate you relative to the Sun and decrease your orbital energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine bouncing a ball off the front of a speeding train, and you\u0027ll have a basic picture of what\u0027s happening. The ball comes in opposite the motion of the train, bounces, and then leaves in the same direction as the train but at a higher speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
