And it has enough reaction wheels and/or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to control its attitude on reentry? And it is built so that the nose has a nice high heat resistance?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, the answer is that you create a reentry profile that your shuttle can handle, as far as heating goes. I prefer a shallow profile, myself. So I initially set my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E at about 60km altitude. I position the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E either a few hundred Km ahead of, or behind the runway in question, depending on the dragginess of the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you try the reentry a few dozen times. You need to maintain a high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (like 90 degrees) for most of the initial part of the reentry. You may need to turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. You pick out landmarks on the ground (such as when you cross from land to water) and note your speed and altitude as you cross them -- to see if you are going \u0022too fast\u0022 or \u0022too slow\u0022 and/or \u0022too high\u0022. You adjust your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E according to your speed and altitude. I find that being around 1500 m/s, at 25km altitude, when you are 100km from your runway works out OK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-30T01:12:21Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2020 01:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-30T17:27:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it\u0027s a simplified version of how it was done in real life\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jb4prVsXkZU?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus point if you have a parachuting kerbal alongside. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EBut you may also consider putting parachutes in the shuttle itself if you are no so confident in your skills.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour question being a bit vaguely about \u0022a shuttle\u0022 limits our advice to more generic principles, basically what people already said in previous post.
