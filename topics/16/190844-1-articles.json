I have a lot of parts count I added from my shock cones not quite being good enough 1:1 with rapiers. Could I add a few nosecones and improve the intake. Or does anything more interesting happen to thrust with rapiers as they are supposed to increase thrust with intake etc. does it get to speed faster.

I assume you mean a fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea what would happen if you put an air intake inside a fairing. If it still sucks in air at all, then that could easily reduce the drag of the intake, and increase its heat tolerance. You should test it once and find out. It would be easy to test on the runway or launchpad -- you don\u0027t even have to get into the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-05T07:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean a shroud.
