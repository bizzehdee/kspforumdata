If you accelerate too quickly, your apoapsis will overshoot your target orbit long before you\u0027ve had a chance to build up some horizontal velocity. I think this is fairly inefficient, because the sharper your ascent profile is the less time you\u0027ll spend near your apoapsis (the longer you\u0027re up there, the more of your circularizing burn will be while you\u0027re facing prograde). If you accelerate too slowly, more of your fuel is spent fighting gravity and not building orbital momentum. So there has to be a happy medium in there somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thorfinn","CreatedById":8349,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T22:10:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECompared to Earth, launches on Kerbin have higher gravity losses, and also quite high aerodynamic resistance losses in the first few kilometers.
