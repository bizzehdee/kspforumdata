The current HECS2\u2019s gold exterior is one example of foil-type insulation and the Restock mod gives most stock\u00A0probe cores the option of having gold or silver foil on the outside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMLI is also used to insulate fuel tanks to prevent cryogenic propellants from boiling away into space; this isn\u2019t modelled at all in stock KSP but for real rockets boiloff is a real issue as liquid hydrogen, methane and oxygen will all slowly evaporate away and escape, which MLI can slow down or even stop by preventing heat from the sun from reaching the cold liquid(s) inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
