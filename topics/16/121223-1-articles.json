A Mk1-2 module, with an X200-32 tank and radially mounted LV-n engines. It was always a \u0022get home from anywhere\u0022 strategy that worked well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just completed a mission using a Poodle under a X200-32 and I\u0027m trying to determine how this could go better. Using my old strategy and just draining oxidizer, the dv doesn\u0027t get where I want it. You can put a mk2 or mk3 liquid fuel fuselage in there but for some reason the adapters that make it fit the circular command module are filled with oxidiser. Again, I can drain it, but then you\u0027re hauling that dry mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could also base everything in a mk3 cockpit, but I don\u0027t see an easy to fit separator and heat shield to deal with my return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow is everyone else approaching this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Branjoman","CreatedById":123426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T11:16:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the best option here is using the Mk2 or Mk3 LF tanks, just without the pesky adaptor.
