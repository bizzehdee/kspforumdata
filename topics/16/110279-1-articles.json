I looked up how to build a plane, and moved the wings back so lift was behind CoM. But no matter how much or how little I tilt up the same thing happens:\n\n1. Quickly get up to ~300m/s\n\n2. Rise slowly to ~10km, slowing down all the time\n\n3. Start losing altitude\n\nI removed a lot of the fuel, emptying the back tank, removing half the oxidizer from the main tank, removing all oxidizer from the wing tanks. I made all the horizontal controls not do yaw and the tails only do yaw.

Seems like I\u0027m doing something wrong though. Going straight to 45 degrees gets me up to around 13km, I gain speed like crazy (can easily get up to over 1000 if I want to), but as soon as I pitch back up the engines flame out and I lose all my speed.

They generate a large amount of drag for their size when active as control surfaces, and in combination with SAS they seem to cause oscillations that further increase drag inefficiencies.

It could be I\u0027m bad at flying but in the end I just couldn\u0027t get the speed up with only 2 turbojets. 4 got me to speed easily but I ran out of air too quick. Added two more intakes and made it with almost 400 dV to spare, which is plenty to dock with the refueling depot. And that was even with forgetting to hotkey the rapiers so I had to manually swap them over. Not a big fan of how the back of the intakes look, but it\u0027s good enough.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/5E7Oc)\n\nThanks again to everyone for all the help!"}]}
