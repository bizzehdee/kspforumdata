an old-but-still-valid introduction to KSP\u0027s comm system.\u00A0 That will explain all reasons why you don\u0027t need to get overly complicated with your network but \u003Ca

already :).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re sending a lone scientist, then I\u0027m assuming you\u0027ll be returning the bulk of the data instead of transmitting, so you\u0027re primary concern is having a link so the probe core on the ship can handle \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E for the burns along the way.\u00A0 Is that about right?\u00A0 If so, then the 1st thing to understand is that you only need a link at all when you\u0027ll be doing those burns.\u00A0 You can always wait a little while\u00A0to transmit science until you get a link.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best way to get this is to put a pair of the biggest relays you\u0027ve got in highly eccentric polar orbits at both Kerbin and Duna, one going up and the other down.\u00A0 This will always give you a link as far as the Duna system (unless the sun is between Kerbin and Duna) , over or under every planet/moon that could get in the way.\u00A0 And this will also cover the bulk of the Duna system as well, plus all the interplanetary space in between.\u00A0 The only blind spot would then be the back side of Ike near the equator when that\u0027s facing away from a direct line to Kerbin.\u00A0 To fill this gap, put 1 (or 2 at most) small relays in medium-altitude equatorial orbits at Ike.\u00A0 Then the link can come from one of Duna\u0027s polar relays to an Ike equatorial relay, and thence to the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no such thing as a network that provides 100% coverage 100% of the time.\u00A0 But with a fairly simple set-up like this, you can provide coverage everywhere and usually right when you need it.\u00A0 You might have to wait a short time on the back side of Ike once in a while for the equatorial satellite to come over the local horizon, but this won\u0027t be very long and is easy enough to plan your burns (and any transmissions) around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned, no matter how you set up your system, the sun will always come between Kerbin and whatever planet you\u0027re at somewhere along the way.\u00A0 So when planning your flight, try to get to Duna before this happens, so you can grab your science and be ready to leave.\u00A0 By the time the return transfer window comes around, you should have a clear shot home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo avoid this worry, it\u0027s a good idea to put polar relays at every planet except Moho.\u00A0 That way, you can almost always have a link around the sun.\u00A0 This is especially important when you go to Jool because the size of that system means it takes months to explore, so the sun WILL definitely block the line from Kerbin at some point.\u00A0 So any time you go to a planet for the 1st time, be sure to include a pair of polar relays in the plan.\u00A0 Equatorial relays can wait until you actually want to land there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space

more possible paths around the sun when other planets are inconveniently aligned.\u00A0 Nice to have but not really necessary.\u00A0 If you launch a Sentinel mission, you might as well stick a relay antenna on it as well but I don\u0027t I don\u0027t go out of my way to populate solar orbit with relays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA problem with putting things in synchronous orbits (as if at the Trojan points) is that they don\u0027t stay there.\u00A0 You can\u0027t ever get the periods exactly right and even if you come close, floating point errors accumulate over time.\u00A0 Thus, eventually the satellites will drift into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of the planet they\u0027re sharing the orbit with and then get ejected higher and yon.\u00A0 The time required for this depends on the orbital period:\u00A0 possibly years in Kerbin\u0027s orbit, just a few weeks or months in Mun\u0027s orbit.\u00A0 So it\u0027s generally better to put solar-orbiting relays in between the planet orbits to avoid this problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, of more day-to-day\u00A0concern is that relays in solar orbit are in the ecliptic plane so are vulnerable to being blocked by intervening planets and moons.\u00A0 Thus, it\u0027s best to put them in somewhat inclined orbits so most of the time they\u0027re not QUITE on the ecliptic.\u00A0 However, significant plane changes in solar orbit are rather expensive on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space
