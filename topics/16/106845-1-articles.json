I have sent in Kerbin orbit Narrow band and it did do nothing.After launch I went to tracking station and there wasn\u0027t anything to show about Kerbin. I have accelerated time so the probe did couple of orbits for sure and probe was in polar orbit. Maybe I am using them wrong?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T14:04:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by purpletarget**"},{"CreatedByName":"ManuxKerb","CreatedById":139441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:54:02Z","Content":"I think there is no ore on Kerbin so it will get you no results.....

Like maybe some charts with terrain composition geography etc. Not only ores. \n\nOh and is there any Ore on Mun? So i send one probe there to test these parts. I am now in sandbox just for learning new mechanics and parts.\n\nAnd what about this surface scanning module? Where that could come handy? Alo in the description of surface scanner it is mentioned that they improve the accuracy of orbital scanners. Anybody played with this one?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:23:02Z","Content":"I believe you do the wide band orbital scanner, then the narrow band one, then finally the surface scanner (in areas that look like they have ore)."},{"CreatedByName":"ManuxKerb","CreatedById":139441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:43:50Z","Content":"Yes there is ore on mun.\n\nSee Here: [https://imgur.com/a/REm8c#0](https://imgur.com/a/REm8c#0)"},{"CreatedByName":"seaces","CreatedById":131939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:56:40Z","Content":"Ok. I didi the wide band now and got some results regarding Kerbin. It says average 3.4% I believe and then there is this cutoff thing that I have noticed if I set it up to 100% the legend that indicates ores is all over the place and if i decrease it gets more precise. So i believe it shows where is highest concentration of ore?\n\nGonna try and send the probe with narrow band to see what will happen."},{"CreatedByName":"ManuxKerb","CreatedById":139441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:58:55Z","Content":"Cutoff level means: Ore concentration below that level will not be visible.\n\nFor example: 30 % Cutoff means that you only see deposits who have 30 or more percent of concentration.\n\nHave fun"},{"CreatedByName":"seaces","CreatedById":131939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T13:00:40Z","Content":"Thank you! there should be manual that explains more in detail how to use some parts especially if some parts work in tandem."}]}
