Pardon me if this topic has been already raised but I couldn\u0027t find any that told me specifically what was happening and how to fix it.\n\nEvery time I try to EVA while orbiting Kerbin the ship immediately starts spinning and turning, making it impossible to let go and recover the results from science experiments like the mystery goo. If I make the Kerbal let go, the ship heads off in one direction and Jebediah, Valentina or whoever tumble away in another. I\u0027ve tried chasing the ship using RCS but with it tumbling so chaotically it\u0027s impossible to get a grip and board (for me anyway).\n\nWhat can I do to prevent this, or at least work with it? Thanks in advance for your answers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T00:24:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 12:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wakaleo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T04:56:33Z","Content":"Let me guess: when you leave the ship, yellow text says \u0022No Pilots aboard and no SAS modules\u0022\n\nYou can\u0027t stop that. However, you can warp time for a bit to stop the rotation once you are off the ladder. And then do whatever you need to."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T05:00:15Z","Content":"Three things...\n\nOne, make sure it\u0027s not moving at all before you exit the craft.\n\nTwo, make sure there isn\u0027t anything around the hatch. If something is too close, your kerbal might be colliding with that part and causing the ship to spin. Since the kerbal is hanging on to the outside, SAS will not stop the spin once it starts.\n\nThree, take control of the ship and press MOD KEY\u002BX (ALT\u002BX if you are using windows). This will zero out the trim. So when you go EVA and the SAS turns off, there won\u0027t be trim input causing it to spin out of control.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Wakaleo","CreatedById":143502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T05:55:39Z","Content":"That was a quick response! Thanks Dman979 and Claw, I\u0027ll give those a try.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nClaw, (1) the first time I tried to EVA the ship was motionless (well, obviously in orbit but motionless on the nav ball) but it still spiralled out of control when Jeb went extra-vehicular. Fortunately he was still hanging on so I could board again. (2) I do have a couple of mystery goo containers and batteries but they are mounted on the sides. Is that still too close to the hatch/ladder? (3) And do you mean I should press Alt\u002BX while still in vehicle, because when I tried it while hanging on to the ladder both the ship and Jeb went haywire and flew apart from each other."},{"CreatedByName":"Wakaleo","CreatedById":143502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T00:13:46Z","Content":"Claw, your third suggestion worked for me.

Or you can use ] or [ to \u0022switch vessels\u0022 while EVA and press Alt\u002BX to zero out the trim. Although at that point, the ship will already be spinning so it won\u0027t matter much.\n\nThe trim indicators are in the bottom left of the screen. You can see how much work the SAS is doing by looking at these indicators with SAS on. When you turn SAS off, the indicators will show you your trim state. You can input trim by holding ALT and pressing WASDQE (or whatever you have your steering keys mapped to). Alt\u002BX returns this trim to zero on all three axes.\n\nGlad you have it sorted out. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
