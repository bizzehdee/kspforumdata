Is this other people\u0027s experience as well, or am I getting hosed by the RNG? It wouldn\u0027t be the first time that the RNG decided to not like me."},{"CreatedByName":"orven","CreatedById":112519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T12:33:10Z","Content":"I have a lot of low rep tourist missions but I suspect that is because I have another types of low rep contracts accepted (satellite deployment, rescue missions, flags and some tests).
