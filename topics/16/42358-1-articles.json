If you just attach it to surface, it will stick and won\u0027t detach. You can use decouplers, but at least some part of them will stick to the rover. It\u0027s not a big problem with big or medium sized ones, but it completly ruins micro cars like DEMV Mark 3 EX \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/demv-mark-3-ex-2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/demv-mark-3-ex-2/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how do you solve the problem of attaching a rover in a cargo bay?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luckyhendrix","CreatedById":78280,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T18:51:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStock I use a decoupler that I attach to a small cubic truss on the rover, and then strut a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith mods I\u0027d use KAS and quantum strut to secure the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cartz","CreatedById":73435,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T18:54:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/TR-2C_Stack_Separator\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETR-2c Stack Separator\u003C/a\u003E seperates from both surfaces when it decouples. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re really anal about it, it becomes debris that you can then terminate from the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AtilaElari","CreatedById":75929,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T19:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tip, it is indeed helpfull.
