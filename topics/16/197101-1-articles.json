Everything was fine until orbiting Mun and back to Kerbin, but when I attempted my first Mun landing an annoying issue rose up: I turned on the engine full throttle to leave the orbit and start the descent, but when close to landing I hit the LeftShift key to slow down, the thrust went to the top (with a \u0022beep\u0022); the opposite hitting the LeftCtrl key to reduce the throttle. Practically, I wasn\u0027t able to make any fine regulation of the thrust, only maximum or zero. I could land anyway, but then I had the same problem with the Jetpack commands during the EVA. I suspect it\u0027s a problem with the keyboard setting, but it\u0027s strange that it happens only by Mun\u0027s surface. Any idea?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fierce Wolf","CreatedById":200019,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-24T16:08:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not tripulated, right?
