It\u0027s my Jool-5 mission, and using multi-node docking, I\u0027ve got like 50 ports. On closer inspection, almost all of my docking ports lack a top attachment (and it\u0027s not as if they\u0027d all be pointing into space). The prospect of fixing the whole mess doesn\u0027t look too inviting. Then again, assembling the mission and sending it on its way took like two days -- doing that all over again also lacks appeal. The more so because I completed some other mission in the time since.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion1: once I fixed it, will it stay fixed?
