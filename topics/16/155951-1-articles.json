So I\u0027m a HUGE fan of racing, as you may know, and I\u0027m creating a racing series. But when I\u0027m setting up the cars for the race, I\u0027m continually confused on one very important thing: Suspension. I know the wheels have settings for this (I mainly use the TR-2L for 90% of my cars,) but I have no idea what they do!

For the damper, as the turn is a long force rather than a short perturbation, I think the spring would matter more in this case.

With a low spring and low damper, your right side would sink, and would continue bouncing around after the turn. With a low spring and high damper, you would sink and take a little time to get back straight after the turn, but you wouldn\u0027t bounce around.
