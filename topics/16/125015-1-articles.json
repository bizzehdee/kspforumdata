This is the root of all the mystery drag problems people are running into in 1.05 IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Rather than looking at which intake can get the most air for the least drag, we need to look at which intake setup can keep an engine lit throughout it\u0027s envelope for the least drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My early testing confirms that any air breather up to and including the RAPIER can be supplied adequately with just 0.001 m^2 effective intake area. I have run all of the spaceplane engines up to their operational limits using just 2 structural intakes, and this is *much* less than what was necessary in 1.04.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My testbed Panther hybrid SSTO is successful using a plain old nacelle, and that\u0027s not a particularly good intake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Shock cone is technically the second-most drag effective intake, but it\u0027s advantage is wasted if you\u0027re not driving a large number of engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Mk1 radial intake is going to be the best intake available because it feeds an engine and adds absolutely no drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Anywho...
