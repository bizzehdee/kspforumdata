You\u0027re talking about mass fractions of tanks. It is completely independent of density.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIRL, density is a measurement of how much mass fits into a specific volume. In KSP, \u0022density\u0022 is the name of a field in the resource config file that says how much mass one \u0027unit\u0027 of this resource represents. At first glance this may look like it\u0027s the same thing, but since KSP does not have any volume units, there is no such thing as an actual quantifiable density. Instead, what KSP calls \u0022density\u0022 is actually a unit of mass, not a unit of the relationship between mass and volume. The 1.25m xenon tank holds 5,250 \u0027units\u0027 of xenon, which means nothing other than that it holds 5,250 times a mass of 100 grams. Which is the \u0022density\u0022 - or rather the mass - of xenon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the only reason why it has to be 5,250, and not perhaps 15,000 or 42, is because that\u0027s the design target for the mass fraction of a xenon tank with a dry mass of 413 kg. Its hypothetical volume has nothing to do with it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-20T16:15:33Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2016 04:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-20T18:48:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222894240\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153647\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221482229797\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153700\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blaarkies\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Blaarkies said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe square cube law is very very true.

The stock structural girders and such are very heavy but even with those the extra thrust from more engines probably negates the supporting structure and then some. I made a ship with a ring of ion engines around the centre and it works reasonably well but the partcount is a bit too intense for my system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-21T07:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222894507\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153647\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221482250436\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not density you\u0027re talking about though.

This can cut down on the weight and part count for ion powered craft. Luckily Ion engines don\u0027t need much structural support strength since they are so weak.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe for larger ships it is fair to build multi-layer ion engine stacks(the upper clipped engines firing directly into the bottom engines). Even though that is horrible clipping, it\u0027s the closest we get to building a stock 100kN ion engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n...but they do cost a lot of funds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
