It allows the ship to float through the atmosphere like a feather without any thermal protection. In fact it is a composite craft which basically means its fabric and glue and it has proven it self as an effective suborbital ship ready to take passengers. As most of you might know Virgin Galactic has teamed up with Burts company and is using his design for the Virgin Galactic flights. Now my question is, using deadly reentry in specific, and whatever realism mods you like is it possible to recreate this in KSP? I am not asking for a mod (that would of course be wonderful) but is it possible to create a ship that can easily take off with limited drag, but have so much drag during reentry that no thermal protection is necessary? Now obviously KSP doesn\u0027t have reentry effects yet. However Using DR, is this possible? Im not talking about powered descent either, I am talking about sending a ship up on a sub orbital path and coming down safely without burning up and with no heat shield like Space Ship Once? Also I am not talking about getting lucky I am talking about slow reentry with very low temperatures. Remember the windows on SS1 are plastic and the ship is made almost entirely out of composite materials if it gets too hot it will melt.

I add some details. Kinetic energy is much more significant factor than potential energy, so we can neglect heights. Maximum speed of Space Ship one was 3,09 mach, which is about 1200 m/s. Re-entry speed of orbital spacecraft is at least about 7900 m/s. Kinetic energy per mass unit is proportional of velocity squared. Space ship one\u0027s kinetic energy per mass is 1/40 part of orbital spacecraft\u0027s energy. Therefore re-entry effects are very different and SpaceShipOne had very much easier conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProportions of aerodynamic effects and orbital velocity are different in KSP than in real world, but some kind of analogy is suborbital craft, which maximum velocity is 12/79 of low orbital velocity.
