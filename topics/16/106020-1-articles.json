Stock ships arent meant to be merged--they are meant to standalone.\n\nAs i understand it, its sorta like a sub-assembly, such that you can design a \u0022ship\u0022 so serve one function, like a lifter or an efficiently packed science service bay, and then just load it and attach it somewhere.\n\nDont think about it as \u0022merging\u0022 but rather, just loading the ship into the current building space."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:34:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I could be wrong, but i think you have to design the ships to be mergable.

Take, for example, my sky crane and the drilling unit I\u0027ve just merged into the sky crane.  The crane has a docking port Jr on the bottom and the Drilling Module one on the top.  Yet the ONLY node available is the one on the bottom of a micronode.  So I thought I\u0027d try it the other way.  Load the drills first and merge the sky crane in - This way the sky crane has no attachable nodes at all.  \n  \n![5mUonWW.png](http://imgur.com/5mUonWW.png)\n\nMerging seems to be buggy to say the least.  Incidentally I get the same effect if I store the drills a sub assembly.  \n\nIn order to test the above I had to \u0022launch\u0022 the two seperately and dock them together in orbit around minmus.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-28T17:38:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2017 05:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by NewtSoup**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-28T17:44:58Z","Content":"I can\u0027t seem to find where I saw the answer, but it only works for me if the two nodes I want to merge are their craft\u0027s respective roots.

It seems you can only connect to the root part.  Once it\u0027s connected other nodes on the merged assembly become available.  Which will be why the lifter had no nodes available as it\u0027s root part had all the nodes occupied.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-28T18:38:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2017 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by NewtSoup**"},{"CreatedByName":"NewtSoup","CreatedById":178829,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-28T18:55:00Z","Content":"Oh, just to clarify I did not re-root the lifter to the docking port jr.
