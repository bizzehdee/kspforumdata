If you had a fully fueled rocket far out in space with the engine off you can consider it, for the purpose of this example, to be stationary. If the rocket had a Delta V of 2000 metres per second, that means that if you fired up the engine and ran it until you were out of fuel you would be traveling at 2000 M/S at the end. Also, disregarding mass changes due to fuel use, if you accelerated from stop to 1000 M/S, turned retrograde and fired until your tank ran dry you would finish up stationary again. But your speed would still have changed by 2000M/S, 1000 up and 1000 back. So the Delta V figure gives you the total of all the changes of speed that the rocket is capable of. The importance of the Delta V figure is that regardless of what you want to do in space, go from Kerbin orbit to Mun orbit, Go from Minmus orbit to surface, change an orbit, anything at all, there will be a required Delta V figure that your rocket will need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If this explanation is wrong I am sure that one of our genuine rocket scientists will correct me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T08:19:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt isn\u0027t the sort of thing you\u0027ll be taught about unless you specifically get involved in the field.

The other thing I want to comment on is: think of things this way: Rather than thinking of yourself or your craft in stationary, non moving points, think of being in an always moving situation. On Kerbin\u0027s surface, while sitting on the launch pad, your ship rides the surface around the center of mass of the planet, \u0022orbiting\u0022 as the day and night progress. In order to move your orbit higher, and to be able to more easily escape from Kerbin\u0027s sphere of gravitic influence, you need to change your dV by about \u002B4500 meters per second. That\u0027s true for a rocket, regardless of how big it is or how many stages you have. When you launch and fly, you are not just flying straight up or horizontally; you are flying in a new orbit, which always changes dimensions as your dV changes. It might seem to be an arc in map view, but the hidden part of the orbit is now under the surface of Kerbin. When you achieve orbit, it is a new orbit which is completely visible in map view. Not only do you have the apoapsis (high point) displayed, but also the periapsis (low point as well). In this case, KLO (Kerbin Low Orbit) is in space, a little over 70,000 meters altitude above sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same principle applies when you change your dV to move from Kerbin orbit to another planet or moon; or coming back to Kerbin. Changing dV is how you change your orbit from one sphere of influence to another. During an interplanetary flight you may leave the SOI of planets completely, and find that your craft is orbiting Kerbol (Kerbin\u0027s sun) during part of the flight. So you are always in an orbit, and you get from one place to another by changing your orbit; done by changing your velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T15:53:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rkman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rkman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot exactly.

The change in speed is usually less, unless the direction happens to be prograde or retrograde.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, what Jouni said. It is vector math. Speed is directionless, vectors are not. When you \u0022use\u0022 dV, it is not directionless. If you do a theoretically perfect inclination change, your speed didn\u0027t change but your vector sure did, and it took some dV to do that. dV is a measure of how much you can move that vector around (make it longer, shorter, or \u0022turn it\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it\u0027s more complicated than that, but I guess I think of dV as a measure of \u0022how much can I move this particular ship around.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
