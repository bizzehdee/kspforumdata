IF you are using the Launch Stability enhancer, be sure to stage it so that it decouples at the same time your engines fire (Be sure your throttle is all the way up) this way as soon as you fire your engines you will decouple and rise skyward (Assuming you have a Thrust to weight ratio greater than 1)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VFRHawk","CreatedById":508,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T00:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, hadn\u0027t thought of putting it in the first stage, so I was releasing them manually!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply Taki.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
