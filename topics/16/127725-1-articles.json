That is pretty tight. I want to use it for transportation of crew and stuff to the KSS (Kerbin Space Station) I\u0027ve built before. It orbits Kerbin at 100x100km altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy SSTO takes around 16min to reach apoapsis where it can perform circularization burn. The question now is - how do I correctly time the launch so that at the time of circularization burn, I\u0027m as close to the target as possible (preferably under 5km).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using simple target distance between my SSTO and target. Once it goes down to a certain number, I launch. But it will take my ages to determine the correct separation by trial and error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do I calculate how far away my target should be at the time I start up the engines on the runway so that I intercept it as close as possible? As I said, target orbit is 100x100km, and my SSTO reaches it\u0027s apoapsis in 16 minutes from the moment it starts rolling on the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aser","CreatedById":139420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-12T22:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFind the point that your SSTO reaches Ap and time how long it takes you to get there.

You can approximate the maths for rockets since the acceleration increases over time at a relatively even rate, and you don\u0027t even need to consider the vertical distance and/or curvature of the planet since you can just consider the whole system as running along one dimension.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni.e. you have this system:\u00A0 A-----B-------------C, where A= starting position of KSS, B= launch position of SSTO, C= meeting point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, since your acceleration is going to be changing quite significantly at different stages, it\u0027ll be a slog to determine your distance from B to C using maths since you\u0027ll have so many components to the equation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, since you know that it takes you a set time to get to C, you don\u0027t even need to make any calculations. You just need to set a flag at KSP, set it as target, climb to 100x100 orbit, note distance to target. Revert to the runway and leave your SSTO sitting there. Switch to KSS, set flag as target, and warp until your distance to target is the same. Set a manoeuvre node at that point on the KSS\u0027s orbit as soon as you\u0027ve passed it, then go back to the tracking station and wait until your KSS\u0027s time to that node is exactly 16 minutes (or whatever your SSTO flight time is). You then hop in your SSTO on the runway, select KSS as target and see how far away it is. Theoretically, that should be the exact distance that you want to launch at every time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RokRoland","CreatedById":153955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T10:07:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222320099\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127725\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449959324\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152712\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022aluc24\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 13.12.2015 klo, aluc24 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi all,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure this has been discussed before, but I really couldn\u0027t find any definitive answers to the issue except for \u0022guess until it works\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy SSTO takes around 16min to reach apoapsis where it can perform circularization burn. The question now is - how do I correctly time the launch so that at the time of circularization burn, I\u0027m as close to the target as possible (preferably under 5km).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using simple target distance between my SSTO and target. Once it goes down to a certain number, I launch. But it will take my ages to determine the correct separation by trial and error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do I calculate how far away my target should be at the time I start up the engines on the runway so that I intercept it as close as possible? As I said, target orbit is 100x100km, and my SSTO reaches it\u0027s apoapsis in 16 minutes from the moment it starts rolling on the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter reading the initial question, then the answers, and then the original question again, I am unsure what you\u0027re actually asking. Whether you\u0027re asking \u0022how to determine the correct separation in order to launch reliably\u0022, or \u0022how to calculate how far away the target should be\u0022. Despite referring to calculation in the last paragraph, I do believe you\u0027re actually trying to find a method that will give you the correct time to launch on a reliable basis. Also, the method does not need to be mathematical but it should not be a \u0022guess then correct until you hit it\u0022-method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe following method should give you the right point of reference to your launch with just a single attempt used for experimentation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLine up your launch and wait until your space station is exactly overhead KSC, or whatever the closest point of separation is. At this time, launch your SSTO to the identical 100x100 orbit. No, you will not reach the space station this time. However, carry on and achieve the orbit with no regard to the space station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet the space station orbit around once. Once the space station again passes exactly overhead KSC, note the \u003Cstrong\u003Edistance of KSC to your SSTO. \u003C/strong\u003ELet time pass, bring your already-orbiting SSTO down if need be, and line up another launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the distance of KSC and space station is what you noted down in the previous step (outlined in bold font), launch your SSTO, and this time rendezvous with the space station in a coordinated fashion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this solution, you can keep on using your distance to target method as you currently are, without giving thought to orbital periods or mess about with maneuver nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, if you are having trouble eyeballing the distance of your reference SSTO to KSC at the proper time, jot down the distance between the SSTO and space station, put a satellite with sufficient delta-v to correct for position the identical distance in front of your space station on the identical orbit, and use the satellite for launch reference instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all it does sound like a bit of work considering that just one second delay in start will throw you off by over 2 km, but hey, this sounds like a very Kerbal way of doing things, so thumbs up, don\u0027t give up and why Hohmann if you can eyeball it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ForScience6686","CreatedById":144187,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T19:43:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027ve done is set my ap above the target orbit until I get an intercept on the way back down. \u00A0So I do not complete my orbit until the rendezvous. \u00A0It\u0027s not always to efficient, especially if I\u0027m too early on the launch. \u00A0But I\u0027ve gotten a rescue down to 18 minutes with the rescued kerbal safely inside. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis method is quite easy and repeatable, but you\u0027ll take a hit in efficiency as you usually need to burn radial to match the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T22:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not do the opposite?
