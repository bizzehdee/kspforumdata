Now when I do the optimum Hohmann transfer it predicts on the maneuver node that the Delta V required is around 3900ms. Now I use the correct phase angles and everything is how it should be but I do not get the 1900ms delta v that I should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECAN ANYONE HELP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T21:32:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs your ejection burn maneuver in the correct position?
