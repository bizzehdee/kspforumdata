Recently I\u0027ve orbited the mun, which has given me enough science to unlock the electrics upgrade for 90, and stability for 45. So far I\u0027ve unlocked all 45 science upgrades other than the plane one (sorry for my limited knowledge) My current plan is to land a space probe to test if I can get kerbals up there.
