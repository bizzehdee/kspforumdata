If you already have chevrons appearing, skip this step.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Place a new node between the point that your target\u0027s chevron appears and your own craft\u0027s chevron (i.e. the one that gives the distance to target). Leave it at 0 m/s for the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Place another node a bit further along in the orbit. About a quarter should be fine. Leave it at 0 m/s. Now, the chevrons will indicate the target\u0027s position and distance at the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eend\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of that orbit, not at the beginning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Go back to the node you placed in 2) above. If you add prograde/retrograde to it, the chevrons for the next orbit around will move. You should be able to get a decent appproach without using too much fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4b) if this takes a lot of fuel, then one single orbit is not enough. Go to the node you placed in 3), right click it, and then click on the \u0022next orbit\u0022 button on the bottom right. The chevrons now show the positions of your two craft two complete orbits later. If you go back to node 2), and add prograde/retrograde, you should get a match with a lot less fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Burn! Once you\u0027ve deleted the node at 2), you\u0027ll be sure to find a slight difference. If the target is still behind, burn a smidgeon prograde then click and hold node 3) to see what changes. If it is ahead you\u0027ll have to turn around (or use RCS) to burn back a bit. You can also click and hold the node 3) while burning to see what changes in real time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this makes sense (sort of) but you\u0027re not quite sure about any of these steps, I could post screenies.

When in \u0022target\u0022 mode, the retrograde marker should be close to the anti-target marker. What you want to so is burn while aiming on the other side of the retrograde marker compared to anti-target. This has the effect of pushing retrograde over antitarget. Keep watching the map and mouse over the chevrons to make sure they are showing an ever closer encounter. Stop doing this when the result is close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have a really close encounter, drop a final maneuvre node on the two chevrons. Add anything to give a number of m/s equal to your speed relative to target. It doesn\u0027t really matter which direction, because what you really need to know is (a) exact time to closest approach, and (b) burn time to neutralise that amount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can then switch to external view, target mode, and turn to face retrograde. Looking back behind your craft, the target should be there. When it is close, do a full-thrust blast (again aiming to push retrograde over anti-target, if it has started to move off) to force a recalculation of burn time. If you burn retrograde about 50-60% of that time away from the target, you should finish your burn with the target extremely close, and with relative velocities cancelled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T05:41:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d probably take the easy way out ... do a plane change before setting up the intercept (which means it\u0027s probably going to cost a couple hundred m/s assuming a similar inclination to Minmus) then just play with your transfer.\u00A0 Since you\u0027re in the same plane, you can just make a node to get you out there and slide it around the orbit to improve closest approach.\u00A0 A quickie delta-v budget from orbit is in the 2k m/s range (300 for plane change, 950 for Minmus-like apoapsis, 200 for rough velocity match, 200 for deorbit, and an extra 350).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA capsule on top of a terrier with one FL-T400 fuel tank puts you in the 2600 m/s range (2400 with heat shield with ablator at 40%, probably a good idea), even more to spare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thucydides","CreatedById":160572,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T11:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to Snark for instruction on how to upload the image: Hope this works.

Since it\u0027s at the same place, the game will otherwise only show the immediate crossing of paths, not the one you want the next orbit around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-20T22:52:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2016 10:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
