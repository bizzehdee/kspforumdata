I have a number of robotic parts on the ship, and during bits of the mission, some were flopping around. I solved this usually by resetting to build angle, and that worked... some of the time. Now that I have the thing stable and ready to land, some parts are not giving me the option of changing the angle (hinge) or extension (piston) at all. The motor shows as engaged, but the slider bar for the angle/extension is not present. And reset to build angle does nothing. The craft has plenty of electricity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the really weird thing.

They work fine in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, they work fine on the pad, but once in space they never seem to work. And no, I\u0027m not having a symtery issue. Here in an example, I attached a hinge to the side of a ship, on the end of the hing I have a piston, on the end of the piston I\u0027ve got an advanced grabber. The program moves the hinge so the piston is sticking straight out from the ship, then it extends the piston and arms the grabber unit. Works 100% in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and the launch pad, but once it is on orbit the hinge never moves when instructed to do so. I\u0027ve tried moving back to the build angle, and tried\u00A0again, same results . I\u0027ve verified the play direction, etc. I\u0027ve tried reversing it and then playing forwarded repeatedly, and once in a while, it will wiggle, but it never really changes the angle. I\u0027ve even zoomed in as far as I can to see if perhaps there was some clipping or obstruction and I can find nothing.I\u0027ve also verified that there is electrical charge (plenty) available.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny suggestions would be helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ken.C","CreatedById":197914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-25T00:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi all,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for\u00A0the input.

The symmetry thing may be what\u0027s going on. I\u0027ve had a fair amount of luck with the robotic parts and controllers in flight, but it seems the more outlandish and complex I make the vessels (this one has 4 controllers and I\u0027m not even sure how many parts on it) the weirder it behaves.
