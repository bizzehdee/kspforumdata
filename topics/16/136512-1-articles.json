Pitching up the part slightly will also produce the same effect but it is not correct since it will introduce a minor unalignment in your ship, increasing lift and drag too.\u00A0pitching up wings slightly will also solve the problem but it will generate more lift and, therefore, more drag which might not be intended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-13T21:15:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEssentialy, what is happening is that since KSP uses\u00A0symmetrical\u00A0airfoils, all craft if moving through the air in the default orientation with no rotation on the wings, would\u00A0produce no lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SPH COL indicator therefor assumes a slight Angle Of Attack on the whole craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwith careful use of the Rotation widget you can simulate 0 AOA and make the arrow on the lift marker\u00A0disappear\u00A0altogether.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nO9RULw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nO9RULw.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
