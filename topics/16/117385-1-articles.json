If you left-click the Goo nothing happens. You have to *right-click* it.\n\nI also play on a Mac but i usually use another mouse, because it\u0027s hard to use the trackpad to play. In order to use the right lick on you trackpad, you can change your mouse settings or use left-click\u002Bcmd.\n\nI hope that\u0027s the problem! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T13:18:48Z","Content":"In mouse settings you can enable right click for Apple mouse or magic mouse, its a life saver for macs"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T13:50:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m playing on career mode and I\u0027m on a macbook pro so there is no left/right clicking.\n\nKSP heavily relies on right-clicking, so you will need to sort that out.\n[http://www.wikihow.com/Right-Click-on-a-Mac](https://www.wikihow.com/Right-Click-on-a-Mac)\n\nYou might additionally need to change the throttle controls in KSP to something else, since the default Left Control/Left Shift probably interferes with Ctrl\u002BClick."}]}
