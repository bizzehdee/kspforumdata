There you only have two times symmetry, which is great for making planes. On planes, you\u0027ll usually have two wings on either side of the plane, so you only need two times symmetry. Also, it auto-orients parts to face forward in the Spaceplane Hanger which makes things easier because you will most likely be launching your planes horizontally down the runway rather than vertically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Vehicle Assembly Building you build vertical rockets and have access to symmetry levels up to 8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethey need to really work on the basic guidance, not just tutorials.

This game can be difficult to get started with. I\u0027d recommend Scott Manley\u0027s tutorial on youtube, or there are other great tutorials there as well. Also the basic rocket tutorial in the game isn\u0027t too bad if you read everything carefully.

I had figured it all out at the time of this post, it was just something so simple I got wrong that it was not explained anywhere really, in game or even in other tutorials I looked at by the community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know career is heavily in development, but I sure hope they add tasks to achieve. It\u0027s fun to just try stuff, but I also don\u0027t know what the natural progression should always be. The community has done a great job filling in the gaps, but in game explanations or even a calculator in game for determining orbital velocity for a sustained orbit, stuff like that, would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, the game is great, I can\u0027t wait for the final product. My dad\u0027s gaming experience consists of Atari, and monopolizing my Gameboy the day I got it as a kid on Christmas Day. He just retired though, and he is an aerospace engineer. He worked in mission control during the Gemini and Apollo missions, and I think he\u0027d absolutely love KSP. Hopefully once it is released it will be a little less daunting. I worry about introducing it to him as a virtual non gamer at this stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
