Then compare the 2 rovers in the persistence.sfs to see exactly what the difference is, and what needs to be removed. Also, it\u0027s easy to just replace the location information of the vessel(by copying and pasting), making it probably easier to delete and replace the original vehicle rather than trying to delete individual parts. Or just use hyper-edit. Obligatory safety disclaimer : make backups of persistant.sfs before messing with it.
