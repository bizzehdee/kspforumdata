Because as the CoL/CoM indicates, this is a nose-heavy design that naturally wants to pitch down. Slightly nose-heavy is good for stability, but you need control authority to balance it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in your plane, it looks like you have only the reaction wheels in your cockpit for that job, and they\u0027re not enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only two control surfaces you have are small, and almost directly in line with the point around which the plane pivots. This means they have almost no lever arm - and therefore, pretty much no effect on your pitch at all. They\u0027re ailerons, only good for roll control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you want are elevators. They should be placed far away from the point around which the plane pivots, so they have a long lever arm. Two locations are typical: on the tail, or on the nose (canards). Your plane has neither, because what you mounted as \u0022canards\u0022 are not control surfaces, but rather static fins.
