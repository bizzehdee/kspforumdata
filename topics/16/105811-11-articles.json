Specifically, I can\u0027t see how it can be considered \u0022overpowered\u0022 in any shape or form.\n\n**1) The MPL does not provide a solution for people who \u0022don\u0027t want to grind\u0022**, \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E those are also people who \u0022don\u0027t mind warping forwards for years at a time\u0022.\n\n1b) also, even before you do all of that warping:\n\n- you don\u0027t get the MPL straight away, so you have to go through the science-gathering and learning process anyway before you get there,\n\n- you still have to do all the science-gathering to start with before feeding it to the lab,\n\n- science from Kerbin is low-value stuff, therefore low-data, therefore \u0022grindy\u0022 if you want to try to fill an MPL with it,\n\n- you need to launch and orbit (or land) the MPL to start with, which is not easy at the corresponding tech level (i.e. when the MPL first becomes available),\n\n- you need to bring your science reports to your MPL, which involves orbital rendezvous skills (and time and effort), or rovers (and time and effort), and/or dropping back into orbit on the way back home (and time and effort)... and (can you see where I\u0027m going with this?...),\n\n- you need to dedicate a scientist to it. To be efficient, you need to send your scientist to plant flags on the Mun and Minmus, bring him/her home, *\u003Cu\u003Ethen\u003C/u\u003E* send him/her back up to the MPL to get a decent return. Preferably two scientists. Micro-managing your roster can feel pretty grindy, if you\u0027re really set on a \u0022non-grindy\u0022 science return.\n\nSo in answer to your conclusion that it is great for people that don\u0027t want to grind, I would say no. It provides *\u003Cu\u003Ean alternative route\u003C/u\u003E* for dedicating time and effort, it doesn\u0027t take away the need for some time and effort (or at least, planning and execution).\n\nSo, in any event, the only people who really can benefit from \u0022non-grind\u0022 are those that are willing to warp forwards for years between missions. And they must be willing to do that after having done all the missions they needed to get the MPL to start with. A couple of quick missions to Ike and Gilly, not even visiting all the biomes, would also fill out the entire tech tree at that point so you could just as well claim that interplanetary travel is OP if you\u0027re willing to warp enough.\n\n**2) The MPL is absolutely not useless and over-powered for people who like mining science**, because it adds a further benefit to industrious science-mining.\n\n- mining science involves training up scientists to do it best, and once trained they have a place to \u0022hang out\u0022 between missions, paying back the efforts made to train them,\n\n- it can\u0027t be overpowered if you\u0027re seriously mining science, because by the time you get any significant return from the MPL your tech tree will be virtually maxed out, therefore it can\u0027t have changed your own personal style of play prior to that time.\n\nSo while I hear you where you say you find it OP and useless, I still don\u0027t understand why. In particular, I cannot imagine a point in time when you could have unlocked the MPL and then suddely found that your science-mining gameplay was being overshadowed by the science points you were getting from the MPL. I can understand you looking at the specs on paper and *thinking* that, but not actually *finding* that in real use.\n\nI use MPLs all the time, from the time they can be unlocked. And I find that the vast majority of the tech tree is unlocked without a single \u0022OP\u0022 data-derived science point.\n\n**3) \u0022Repeatability\u0022 is not an overpowered aspect of the MPL in-game**. This is because the repeatability of earning science points from experiments requires multiple MPLs and also multiple scientists and/or massive time warping and/or multiple stops at different moons and/or multiple repeats of missions you\u0027ve done in early career.\n\nSo by the time you get around to using multiple copies of experiments to get science points, you no longer actually need the science, and they in fact become a way of ensuring a constant revenue stream to fund your exorbitant projects.\n\nSo for all these reasons, I cannot quite fathom how anyone could consider the lab to be overpowered and/or useless. It can\u0027t fundamentally change gameplay (unless you\u0027re desperately wanting to stop science-gathering missions... in which case one may wonder why you chose to play career to start with). It cannot compete with science-mining from missions, especially if you tend to have a bunch of missions on the go at the same time. And it doesn\u0027t provide something for nothing since optimal use of the MPL requires good planning and skills."},{"CreatedByName":"strollen","CreatedById":142693,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T05:49:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3/18/2016 at 1:00 PM, Snark said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think the issue here is basically one of \u0022different players have different playstyles\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For example:  Personally, I agree with you.

I am playing at Hard career level (with a slight boost to income),so without any revert to mission reloads I end up having to pay for all my rockets that go boom.  I also have reduced science and contract income, and significantly more expensive upgrades, it is a challenge to pay for everything.  The final upgrade on the R\u0026D lab is 3.500K and I only have $1.500K.  So I don\u0027t have funds to launch science only trips to Mun, and Minmus. Not to mention since Jeb died on Mun, I\u0027d rather user safer unmanned landers despite them only yielding  half the science.\n\nIt cost like 75K to launch a space station, and much of the cost is associated with the getting the heavy MPL labs into orbit around various objects.,  so it seems silly not to utilize them. Right now I have four polar stations around Kerbin, Mun, Minmus, and Kerbol which is on the way to Duna.  Mun and Minmus have 2 stars scientist and the others 1 star.  I have lots of ships active so I rarely warp more than a day at a time.  About once a week I transmit science and get 40 science from the 2 stars, 20 from Kerbol and only 10 from Kerbin.  The Kerbin station is only 1/2 full of science experiments, so I\u0027ve made several not always successful attempts to add more science experiments to it   The science absolutely adds up, but it takes more than a month worth of 4 labs to equal one manned mission to Minumus.\n\nI find that much of my career is devoted to the care and feeding of the science labs. A Kerbin base expansion contract, cool I can add the  Atmosphere fluid instrument, add tundra and ice cap biomes and also add more science to the MPL. Base expansion for Minmus, a good excuse to include the new orbital  survey for future mining operations to my base.. I have landers on both Mun and Minmus and I periodically send them down to the surface, so that I don\u0027t run out of science for the lab   I also use tourist spacecraft as a way of shuttling experiments from the science stations back to Kerbin.    \n\nAll in all, I think the labs adds a lot element of realism to the career mode.  I think without that added emphasis on gaining more science,  adding or expanding orbital stations  just another fairly lucrative way of making money . Without actively MPL I doubt I\u0027d need nearly the number of Kerbals in my space program. I can easily imagine setting up another science base on or in orbit are Ike. but I\u0027m out of scientists, and don\u0027t have spare 500K to recruit a new scientist. so that makes me excited to get more rescue missions.  \n\nI\u0027m going to focus on making money. I expect that by the time I make another 2 million to upgrade my R\u0026D, I\u0027ll also get enough science to need the upgrade.  My science labs, will probably account for roughly as much science as I gain from exploring Duna and Ike.\n\nLong term, I expect to complete the tech tree, and then probably stop playing Kerbal for a while. I imagine that I\u0027ll end up flying a similar number of flights as other who\u0027ve \u0022finished\u0022 the game.  The difference is I won\u0027t have done as many manned missions to land on planets in such (probably Ike, Duna and couple of others) but I will have done probably  more rendezvous and docking procedures as others because the mobile labs are such an important part of my career.\n\n As I type this there are two space ships berthed at the ISS, the Dragon, and the Cygnus.  I think it is fair to say that in the real world, NASA, the European and Russian Space Agency are all playing Kerbal at a very hard level.  The super smart guys at SpaceX are paying the bills with satellites and space stations expansions/resupplies while they are gaining lots of science from doing part testing.  NASA is gaining science from  less expensive unmanned missions, but probably just as much from the ISS. Of course, I\u0027ll probably complete tech tree in less than 2 years and NASA has been doing it for almost 60 years :-)."},{"CreatedByName":"KocLobster","CreatedById":159324,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T16:05:47Z","Content":"The most productive and interesting thread derail I\u0027ve ever seen. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-09T22:37:57Z","Content":"Help please!

That seems like a fair balance. \n\nIt feels like the new balance was struck to plug an exploit used by a handful of power players rather than balancing it for a \u0022regular joe\u0022 player who want\u0027s to explore, gather science and move on to new adventures.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-10T00:04:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2016 12:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tjt**"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-10T02:47:11Z","Content":"If you have two or more krew compartments on your exploration vehicle, then you can take two samples during each biome stop -- and store one copy in each compartment.

I still think the labs should do more of a 1 point of science for 1 point of experiment value exchange, but do it very quickly rather than 1:5 over months. This would give players a reason to send science labs with their interplanetary expeditions to cash in on science that normally loses value when being transmitted.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-10T16:44:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2016 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tjt**"},{"CreatedByName":"le_daim","CreatedById":171539,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-16T14:01:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 10/07/2016 at 4:47 AM, bewing said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you have two or more krew compartments on your exploration vehicle, then you can take two samples during each biome stop -- and store one copy in each compartment.

On each biome, you do all the experiments you want, then collect into the science box and re-do the experiments to put them into your crew compartment.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-16T14:02:38Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2016 02:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by le\\_daim**"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-16T14:45:24Z","Content":"You are perfectly correct, but the new mini-science container didn\u0027t exist when I wrote that. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"le_daim","CreatedById":171539,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-17T09:10:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 hours ago, bewing said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You are perfectly correct, but the new mini-science container didn\u0027t exist when I wrote that. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nGlad to see we agree on this point.

The only condition is to be approx. on the retrograde side of M\u00FCn.
