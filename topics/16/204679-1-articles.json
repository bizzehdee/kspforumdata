I am asking because in this screenshot, you are still in time warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second thing that immediately comes to mind is: did you check whether the probe is set to hybernate automatically through time warp (this is default)? And if so, whether it successfully came out of hybernation again after the time warp?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly: how long has your play session been so far? Especially relevant if you\u0027re playing on 1.10 or later. I find that beyond at most an hour or two, especially if doing many scene changes or reloads, the game just starts to randomly malfunction in unpredictable ways. Just the other night, while iterating on a plane I was working on, it randomly decided that my plane had no functional brakes anymore, after about a bit over an hour\u0027s play. On a pure stock game. I had to close the game and restart to get my brakes back. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"antipro","CreatedById":173370,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-04T11:29:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know why you\u0027ve no control, all I can say is that, in a recent mission, I had an incomprehensible relay-vessel link behavior, as if the relay didn\u0027t work at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis would not have compromised the mission, but I could not continue playing knowing that there was something that was not working properly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I reloaded the save and/or restarted the game until the relay-vessel link started working again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-04T21:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks all.
