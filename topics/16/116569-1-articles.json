Let\u0027s say I have a probe, with one rcs thruster ([Linear port](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Place-Anywhere_7_Linear_RCS_Port)) for translation purposes (early stage game). The problem is a time of \u0022burn\u0022 needed to apply dV I needed to put the probe on the specific orbit. So, I have two questions:\n\n- is it possible to \u0022toggle\u0022 thruster to work without continuing press of the button.\n\n- time warp. Does the physical warp will work? (don\u0027t have KSP to test it now) And if it does not, are there any way to do so?\n\nAny mods that do the job are welcome! ))\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T14:29:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 02:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mad\\_Scientist**"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T14:37:10Z","Content":"No, RCS is always activated by pressing a button down.
