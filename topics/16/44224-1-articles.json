The one fly in my ointment right now is if there is a flat spot on Laythe big enough to land a standard 60 tonne SSTO plane? I\u0027m not asking for a landing strip but something about the length of Kerbal\u0027s landing strip without too many humps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre those spots common on Laythe? Anybody with any other advice on landing on Laythe and take off to orbit? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther questions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. How much less thrust then on Kerbal did you need (I run 6 jets on Kerbal, I\u0027m hoping 4 will be more than sufficient to rise to altitude in laythe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. How high can you get in the Laythe atmosphere before running out of air for your jets? I didn\u0027t stack air intakes (just on the fronts of jets/rockets) so on Kerbal I can go to about 24K at good speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. How fast do you guys get going before you hit the rockets in the ascent stage on Laythe? I aim for 1300 m/s on kerbal before I punch the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. How was lift / air thickness at surface level on Laythe? On Kerbal I usually use a straight glider unpowered landing but I noticed on an attempt on Duna I really couldn\u0027t slow down to landing speed in the thin atmosphere. That\u0027s another ball of wax for later but I think I might try a drogue shoot there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CosmicScientist","CreatedById":78000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T02:12:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis thread might help you, a little way down will have a screenie of a possible landing spot: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/44795-Landing-spaceplane-on-Laythe?highlight=laythe\u002Bequator\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/44795-Landing-spaceplane-on-Laythe?highlight=laythe\u002Bequator\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally don\u0027t know what you need on Laythe, I haven\u0027t gotten there yet with any Kerbals so I don\u0027t know what strength jet number you need compared to on Kerbin, just try it out, if you don\u0027t want to risk it, you might as well cut down only when you\u0027re comfortable with design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes I\u0027d recommend a drogue on Laythe, I don\u0027t recall its atmospheric thickness but you might as well take a weak parachute for precautionary measures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T05:25:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAim for a beach.
