Assuming you launch when you are directly under the space station, you have to match two velocities:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The Prograde orbital velocity (the component in the east/west\u00A0direction)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The Normal orbital velocity (the component in the north/south\u00A0direction)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you hyperedit your spaceship to the stations radial altitude, find your relative velocity and cancel it, you will end up in the same orbit. However, this is not how you normally launch into orbit. The vector you need to cancel your relative velocity (assuming a gravity turn in the radial direction gets you to the right altitude) will NOT be equal to your target inclination. The planet\u0027s rotation will give you an initial velocity which you need to take into account. Over time, this initial velocity will deflect your course away from the proper heading.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy rule of thumb is to try and launch from the latitude matching the inclination of the target - this lets you launch due eastwards and match inclinations once per planetary day. This is why you can launch to the moon from Cape Canaveral fairly easily (at least at certain times) - the moon almost passes over that latitude at its farthest northward excursion from the equator.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are at 37 north and your target inclination is 45 degrees, you should launch about 9 degrees south of east when the station passes overhead (and is approaching its decending node). Burning at -8 will put you a little under 45 degrees of inclination due to the extra starting velocity from Duna\u0027s rotation - you need to burn a little farther southwards to cancel this out. Matching just after the ascending node will be more expensive and require a launch significantly north of east, with more of a normal component than the alternative path.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI try to put space stations in polar orbits - it is a little more expensive to get into that orbit but much easier to rendezvous and allows any surface site to have two equal launch windows.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-29T20:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you know (by testing once) how long it takes your ship to get to orbit, and you know how fast the station is going (by looking on the map view) --\u00A0then multiply the speed by the time and divide by 2 to get the relative distance it will cover while you are ascending.

Go to target mode, click Retrograde, and burn at full thrust. Each time\u00A0you\u0027ve knocked off maybe 50% of the relative speed or distance, go slightly off retrograde to push your retrograde marker reasonably close to being on top of\u00A0the antiTarget marker, repeatedly, as necessary -- just as you would normally do.
