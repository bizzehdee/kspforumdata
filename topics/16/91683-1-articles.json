This is the only body I haven\u0027t visited yet, so I wanted to make a big mission this time. I have landers, probes, rovers, a base, an orbital station, a refueling craft, tugboats and pretty much everything I could conceive of. I have been assembling it slowly in Orbit and strutting it all together with Kerbal Attachment System Strut End Points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m like 80% done and here\u0027s a snapshot of what it looks like at the moment: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4ekoM8P.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/4ekoM8P.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s just a \u0022tiny\u0022 problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not even finished, and it turns out that I already have over 1000 parts!!!

Well, it\u0027s not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is: Once I get this monster into Eloo orbit, the problem is solved. It will disassemble and I will put the crafts into different places/orbits, so I expect a final part count of around 500.

You get the worst flex between docked ports, rather than within the actual modules of the ship, so you really need to add KAS struts across the docked ports. Attaching them to radial girders will help in some cases, but aren\u0027t necessary in others. For example, where your truss (with 2 large and 2 small ports) meets the part in front of it (holding the 2 landers), you could strut from the port that each lander is docked to, directly over to the 2.5m docking ports on the truss, and that should be pretty stable without the need for radially attached girders. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with KAS struts well placed, you will still have to take it pretty easy when you\u0027re making your exit burn from Kerbin.
