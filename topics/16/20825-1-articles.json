This is just an issue with 0.17, and I have my suspicions that Grizzlol is sorta right about the gyro\u0027s force being insufficient. Thing is, it flew fine in 0.16 regardless of my fancy wing arrangement. The only problem was a slight tendency for the nose to lift when the flight surfaces became useless in the upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plane doesn\u0027t glide very well now either. Before 0.17, I could bring it down unpowered with all tanks empty after a deorbit burn and it would glide smoothly. Now at about 10km up the nose drops and it goes into a steep dive even with the avionics on. It almost feels as though the efficacy of the gyro and the control surfaces has been reduced by quite a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I know the 0.16 fuel exploit was a bit daft, but it seems that no matter how much fuel I strap on this thing it still doesn\u0027t have enough to reach orbit. The few times I\u0027ve managed to manually overcome the instabilities, I run out of fuel at 50km altitude. The best I\u0027ve done was a suborbital lob with an apoapsis of 65km with the SSTO pictured, and it carries 2000 units of fuel more than my original Buzzard Nk1 which could reach a 100km circular orbit with relative ease and still have enough fuel for a deorbit burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost seems as though SSTOs are now impossible in KSP, except maybe an unimaginative rocket with a simple wing strapped on \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-30T10:11:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2012 10:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Narcosis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T14:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen plenty of working SSTOs in the Spacecraft Exchange built for 0.17, so I think you just need to rethink your methodology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re having stability issues where the atmosphere is thin, it\u0027s going to be tough to correct without vectoring engines, since control surfaces do practically nothing up there.

The reason for the toroidal engine is its improved thrust to weight ratio, and the fact that the vectoring LV-T45 has a nasty habit of being knocked off when pitching up on take off. I\u0027ve tried models with more RCS thrusters and they felt like a bodge to me. And like I said, the avionics package never had this problem in 0.16.

The aircraft masses 30.44 units fully fueled and 15.14 dry, and carries 3100 units of fuel. It only uses 200 units of fuel to get to 13km altitude when the rocket stage is ignited. After that, my most efficient ascent profile only gets it to 65km. I\u0027m using small tanks so they reach their dry weight faster, but without the game being redesigned to calculate the rate of loss of mass, and without jet engines that can take me closer to 20km altitude, I don\u0027t see this working any time soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-30T18:48:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2012 06:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Narcosis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T15:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple of working designs for 0.17 SSTOs in the K-prize thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout the fuel bugs you definitely have to build more efficiently. 15 tons dry weight does seem a little excessive.
