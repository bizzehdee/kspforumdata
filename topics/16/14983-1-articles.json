EX: press W and he faces away from you and walks away from you. Pressing S makes him turn and face you and walks towards you. Pressing A or E makes him face sideways from your vantage point and... you know what I\\\u0027m saying. The other movement mode makes him sidestep when pressing A or D, and backwards when pressing S. He would always try and keep his backside facing you when you start moving him.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silent_prtoagonist","CreatedById":1927,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T10:37:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I see now.
