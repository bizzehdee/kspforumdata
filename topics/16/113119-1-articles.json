You could be passing through Kerbin for all the energy equation cares. Then I was thinking conservation of angular momentum.

If you have read or written a research paper on the topic please don\u0027t give away the answer.\n\u003E ...\n\nFrom experience, I usually pack 3650m/s for my LKO stage. BUT they are self deorbiting and landing rocket SSTO.\n\nDepending on the payload, I did a LKO with 270m/s left. So I used less than 3400m/s. Further more, this is VAC dV. On early acceleration, ISP is lower then \u0022real\u0022 dV is even less.\n\nFrom intuition, I would say that minimal dV would be around 3200m/s, but as KER or MJ don\u0027t give \u0022real dV\u0022, but only full VAC or full ASL (which either of them aren\u0027t realistic - except VAc for vacuum worlds), it\u0027s hard to tell. \n\nRocket shape impact your drag and your flight plan. This has a huge impact on dV as well (probably even bigger that ISP variation)."},{"CreatedByName":"WeirdCulture","CreatedById":76591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T11:27:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E From experience, I usually pack 3650m/s for my LKO stage.
