I think asparagused aerospikes are best, but may be mistaken.\n\nI\u0027ll lift this to LKO.\n\nI\u0027ll bring up a tug to take this lander to eve and back.

If you want to take a look at some other successful missions, check out [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95642-The-Eve-Rocks-Challenge).\n\nEvery kilogram counts. You don\u0027t need a lot of chutes because the atmo is so dense.\n\nLand at as high an altitude as possible.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T17:43:52Z","Content":"You\u0027ll need more landing gear than usual, Eve\u0027s gravity is punishing. It\u0027s also somewhat difficult to find a level place to land, so tall/tippy landers will add some challenge of their own.\n\nTake nothing back up to orbit that you don\u0027t absolutely need. Set up your landing gear and chutes so that they can be staged away immediately before or after liftoff. Your return vessel should be separate from the lander itself and left in orbit. I don\u0027t even bother with a docking port, I just EVA the kerbals from the ascender to the return vessel. You can save a lot of mass if you\u0027re willing to use a command chair rather than a pod for ascent.\n\nThe ascent profile for Eve is a bit different from Kerbin, you want to ascend straight up until 30km altitude or so before beginning to turn (assuming stock aero). This is a long slow trudge out of the thickest part of the atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"rockbloodystar","CreatedById":59828,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T06:30:32Z","Content":"EVA instead of docking is not an idea I\u0027d considered.\n\nBrilliant, thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"rockbloodystar","CreatedById":59828,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T07:50:34Z","Content":"The Eve Rocks Challenge has been informative, Norcalplanner\u0027s craft look achievable."},{"CreatedByName":"rockbloodystar","CreatedById":59828,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T10:56:46Z","Content":"Success, quicker that I thought.\n\nThanks folks!\n\nHighlights:\n\n![screenshot37_zps4f43t87r.png~original](http://i1284.photobucket.com/albums/a572/rockbloodystar/Mission%20Eve/screenshot37_zps4f43t87r.png~original)\n\nDamn crawlerway!\n\n![screenshot71_zps6d424mg5.png~original](http://i1284.photobucket.com/albums/a572/rockbloodystar/Mission%20Eve/screenshot71_zps6d424mg5.png~original)\n\nAll pictures here:\n\n[http://s1284.photobucket.com/user/rockbloodystar/library/Mission%20Eve](http://s1284.photobucket.com/user/rockbloodystar/library/Mission%20Eve)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-30T11:02:17Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2015 11:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rockbloodystar**\n  \nImage link fix."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T11:08:04Z","Content":"Congrats, rockbloodystar, getting back from Eve is one of the game\u0027s Big Challenges. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T11:24:38Z","Content":"I play with FAR, and have never managed it.

As Red Iron Crown said, Eve return is one of the game\u0027s big challenges.\n\n@Red Iron Crown - In my mission, I designed the ascent vehicle as the return vehicle as well. My IP stage to Eve just acted as a fuel dump for the return vehicle, so that meant the ascender had RCS as well as a docking port. Of course, that just made it harder on me engineering-wise, but since I decided to make the challenge harder by bringing the Mk1-2 pod down and back up, that\u0027s par for the course.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T06:28:05Z","Content":"Glad I could help! :-)"},{"CreatedByName":"Der Anfang","CreatedById":134627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T18:22:21Z","Content":"How heavy was that lander? o-o Looks to be well over 100 t."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T19:43:30Z","Content":"IIRC the most lightweight landers that returned from sea level were on the order of 170t per 1-man pod.

I shouldn\u0027t even be reading this thread.\n\nEdit to add: as to the OP, I\u0027m really surprised at the small number of legs; one leg can barely hold ~8t on Eve; half as much if you want them to dampen a slightly rough landing. If the vessel is really resting on the engines (as I suspect), it\u0027s impressive that none have been sheared off.
