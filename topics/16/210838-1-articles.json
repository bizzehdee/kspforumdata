Perhaps the one you need to repair is not this one, but rather a different solar panel, which is not currently extended (because it is broken)? Isn\u0027t there a mount visible on the opposite side of the truss in this picture? I\u0027m not sure if it is another panel, but it well could be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiel814","CreatedById":223988,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-28T11:28:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh my...
