I didn\u0027t have that problem. I do find however, on take off, it\u0027s virtually impossible to right that angle and the rocket ends up flying into the ground. I became convinced that the rocket was unbalanced in some way, although it flew fine on Kerbin and made the trip here without a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did once manage to correct it with RCS, but by that time, I\u0027d floated in circles for so long there was no way I was making orbit. I did however go straight up and prove there\u0027s nothing unbalanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a design issue or do I just need to revert to an earlier save and try and land somewhere flatter?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrivateFlip","CreatedById":68273,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T11:55:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there any visible cause for an unbalance, like for instance a fuel imbalance. If you know the cause of the unbalance or at least the direction of the unbalance you can try to correct it by redividing the fuel between tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T11:58:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI checked all the fuel tanks and they were all even.
