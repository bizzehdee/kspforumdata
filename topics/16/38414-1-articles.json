But, as you can tell, I have no idea how. I understand that for smaller, atmosphere-less bodies it\u0027s not too difficult, you just overshoot a bit and cancel out your velocity over the site. But what about bodies with atmospheres? Is there any way to calculate the drag coefficient in order to determine where I\u0027ll have to deorbit that spaceplane or capsule to land at the KSC? Or ae you supposed to just eyeball it. This isn\u0027t a particularly pressing issue, but responses are appreciated, as always.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-24T12:55:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2013 12:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Omicron314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T03:20:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a chart floating around on the forums that will tell you where to put your periapsis when you\u0027re at a particular distance from the target to ensure that you\u0027ll end up in the right place.
