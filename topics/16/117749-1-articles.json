Cuz as of right now things are surviving that normally shouldn\u0027t survive reentry.\n\nYes I know that the velocity of reentry in LKO is very low and that the reentry heat settings isnt the problem per se, but I would like to have my game operate in a way that REQUIRES heat shields on objects in order to survive reentry in one piece. \n\nAny advice?"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T00:30:15Z","Content":"Max settings (120% I think) or [Deadly Reentry](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54954-1-0-4-Deadly-Reentry-v7-2-2-update-July-24-2015-%28The-Melificent-Edition%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T00:50:26Z","Content":"Forget about \u0022realism\u0022 in this context. At the speeds we have in this game, pretty much nothing should burn up (though a lot should be ripped off). So just toy around with the settings until they approach what you consider to be truthy. Be advised that landing on Eve or even Laythe is a lot tougher than Kerbin though, so better take notes or a screenshot of the original settings."},{"CreatedByName":"TeeGee","CreatedById":82434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T01:16:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Forget about \u0022realism\u0022 in this context.
