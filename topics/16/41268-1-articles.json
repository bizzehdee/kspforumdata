Question for you. I want to do an interplanetary mission that delivers multiple probes to the Jool system. The idea is to have a core interplanetary stage and then docking ports attached radially and each probe docks to the core to hitch a ride. My concern however is, how strong are the docking ports? Would they snap off/undock under the stress of the interplanetary burn? Would is be better to align them up/down with relation to the direction of thrust?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-10T08:17:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2014 08:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cashen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThePsuedoMonkey","CreatedById":58589,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T07:03:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027ll be more stable if you line them up parallel to your engines, but that shouldn\u0027t be necessary if the probes are short and under a ton.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T07:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends on how heavy your probes are. Otherwise what you could do is use a bi/tri coupler with ports on each one and attach them to the ship that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also mitigate the stress put on the ports by throttling up slowly rather than jumping strait to full throttle. There is really little difference between full throttle and say half throttle on stress once you are up to speed but kicking it in to full throttle right off the bat tends to jerk the ships connected by the ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kyne","CreatedById":77515,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T07:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, considering that you\u0027re going to be using the docking ports to carry probes and not to join pieces of a bigger ship together, you should be fine (as long as your probes are relatively small, and not entire multi-stage rockets in themselves \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E). Make sure your ship is balanced first, and if the probes start to wobble try the quantum struts mod to sort that out. You could always ditch the docking ports all together and radially attach separators and reinforce the probes to the hull with struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about it, I think.
