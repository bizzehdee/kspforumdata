If I have a ship in orbit with 35 degrees inclination as reported by mechjeb, and I want to rendezvous with it, do I need to wait for a pass where the ship is passing north-to-south, or vice versa, or shouldn\u0027t it matter? It seems that every time I launch and start my turn, I always go the wrong way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatBum","CreatedById":57405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T18:01:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoing those is an incredible pain. With an equatorial rendezvous, you only need to launch at the right time to catch up with the station, or have the station catch up with you. KSC is already on the equator, so no weird math and plane changes are required. With an inclined orbit, you need to catch up with it \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E launch where your orbits will intersect. So, the whole thing involves very narrow launch windows and little margin for error.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T18:02:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt helps to get on the same inclination yes, just as when you are trying to intercept Minmus or Eve, a craft is just smaller and can be on a more inclined orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for pitching the wrong way, I assume you mean you pitch north when you want to pitch south, remember you are trying to match the orbit of the other craft so if it\u0027s orbit line is slanted upwards where is passes over you, then you\u0027ll want to pitch north a bit when taking off so you don\u0027t need to waste too much fuel later to change your inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T18:13:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf both craft are already in orbit, target the ship and wait until you\u0027re at a crossing node. If it\u0027s the Ascending Node, burn 90 degrees toward the south of prograde. If it\u0027s the Descending Node, burn 90 degrees to the north of prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 35 degree plane change is going to take a lot of delta-v, though, if both craft are already in orbit. It might be easier to just land and relaunch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf only the target is already in orbit and you want to keep the target at 35 degrees inclined, you can launch directly into that plane by waiting until KSC is directly under the craft\u0027s orbital path and launch on a heading of 055 or 125 (depending on if the target\u0027s orbit is crossing the equator toward the north or the south, at the time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, you should always turn toward the east when launching, heading 090. This gives you a free boost by adding the planet\u0027s rotational velocity to your orbital speed and eliminates the need for major inclination changes. Unless you need an inclined orbit for some reason, such as polar mapping satellite, a GPS-style satellite constellation, or emulating the ISS orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-06T18:35:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2013 06:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
