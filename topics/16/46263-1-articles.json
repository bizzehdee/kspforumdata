I\u0027ve got 2 Kerbanauts currently EVA. I don\u0027t seem to get an option to put them back into the command pod they exited from. To keep them from coasting too far I have had to dock a new module with some external command chairs that they can lock in to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question, is there a problem with getting them back inside the command pods?
