I\u0027ve searched everywhere but the only requirements for flags that I\u0027ve seen are: 1) in the Flags folder, 2) PNG format, and 3) 256*160 px resolution. If there is a hard cap on file size, no one has seemed to mention it anywhere that I\u0027ve been able to stumble upon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d greatly appreciate any insight others may have on this issue, and whether or not there\u0027s a work-around.
