Meaning it will use it\u0027s torque to try preventing you from tumbling around. Basically, if you attach one to a pod and drop this in space without anything else, then give your pod an intense spin, activating it will stop your spin completely over time. It won hold the heading you had when you first activated it, but it will stop your rotation at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ASAS is a flight computer that will try holding the heading you have when you activate it. It will use engine gimbal, control surfaces, your RCS system and your command pod\u0027s or probe core\u0027s torque to hold this heading. Unlike the SAS, it can\u0027t work on it\u0027s own, and it will try to hold a heading, not just stop your spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope it\u0027s clear enough ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
