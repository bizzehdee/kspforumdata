Since I\u0027m still new, I don\u0027t really push for any particular goal (despite playing career mode), I just stick stuff together and launch it to see how it behaves, what leaves me with the most fuel in orbit, what makes rockets easy or hard to control and such. It also helps me practice controls... At this point I can launch directly into a perfectly equatorial 70km orbit with periapsis and apoapsis within 250 meters fo each other... and reproduce the feat at will. I have never installed any autopilot mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there\u0027s something that\u0027s seriously cramping my style, and that\u0027s the way launch clamps work. Rockets are naturally slimmer up top, because later stages are smaller and lighter... and as a result, the wide lower stages (especially with boosters) keep me from attaching launch clamps to the upper stages. This, in turn, results in the upper part of any rocket higher than 2-3 fuel tanks wobbling about erratically on the launch pad, and eventually settling into a minimal lean off to one side. The result is that even with perfectly symmetrical rockets fitted with gimbaling engines, extra SAS modules and control winglets, the craft just won\u0027t fly straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I am still using less than a quarter of the VAB\u0027s vertical space, and I honestly have no idea how I could utilize more of it. I\u0027ve tried slimming down the lower stages or fattening the upper ones, but I always end up in a situation where I can\u0027t fit enough engines on the first stage to launch to any meaningful speed. I need the wide base for engine space, and the slim top to save weight. So how can I properly stabilize the top of a tall rocket?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-04T17:18:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2014 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T00:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry getting Kerbal Joint Reinforcement addon helps stability a lot.

It\u0027s a silly experimental design that I wanted to do just because I could. The boosters are neither solid nor liquid engines... they\u0027re jet engines, six times three of them. And because they start to flame-out north of 10 kilometers, they hardly need any fuel. Those already tiny tanks carry only 10% of their maximum filling amount. All in all that gives me a ridiculous thrust-to-weight ratio of over 100 kN per ton of booster. No liquid or solid fuel engine comes even close to that. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44754370/screenshot1.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s another screenshot\u003C/a\u003E of the boosters without all the hubbub around them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re kind of iffy to handle overall though and cut out just a bit too early for my tastes, so I probably won\u0027t be using that design for regular carrier duty.
