In Career Mode I had a ship in Low Munar Orbit. When I figured \u0022Hey, why not EVA and get some science, what can go wrong\u0022 Well, let me tell you. EVERYTHING can go wrong! I hit EVA, and all the sudden, my Kerbal goes spiraling out of control flying away from my ship. Im hitting R, Space bar, and all the control keys. NOTHING IS HAPPENING. I would have to hit R several times to get the stabilization phase, and after that no controls at all. So now I have a Kerbal and a pilotless ship heading out to an encounter with minmus and then into deep space.
