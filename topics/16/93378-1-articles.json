The skybox is (as far as I know) not reliable as a constellation reference. The point of the origin for longitude of the ascending node is to provide an origin not relative to the various rotations of its own orbital system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s what you really want, I would suggest using the ascending node of Minmus as your origin for all other ascending nodes.

I know that when you have an inclined orbit, you can find the ascending and descending nodes by finding the point where the plane of your orbit intersects with the plane of a non-inclined orbit, with both intersecting the center of the body you are orbiting.

Longitude is measured w.r.t. a point fixed to the rotating surface of the body you are orbiting (a la prime meridian). Ironically, Longitude of Ascending Node would be easier to eyeball in KSP without any other references--you\u0027d just look at how far away you are from your reference, as measured by a projection into the equatorial plane (i.e., from a top-down view).
