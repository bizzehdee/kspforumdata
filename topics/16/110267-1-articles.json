I never do.\n\nAim for a big crater, always manage to land on a slope. Aim outside of a crater, always manage to land on a slope. You get the idea.\n\nI play career, so for my first few stabs I generally don\u0027t have any Rockomax engines or tanks, so I try to be efficient, which means that I don\u0027t have the delta-v to mooch around. \n\nMy landing profile is normally:\n\n1. Orbit, obviously.\n2. Burn prograde so me path crosses my landing site after my landing target\n3. Over the target, Burn retrograde to kill horizontal velocity.\n4. Start a suicide burn around 100m before Kerbal Engineer suggests as I bottle it\n5. Throttle down and gently come down under 6m/s\n\nIs there anything anyone can suggest, or am I just being unlucky?\n\nThanks,\n\nP\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T13:51:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 01:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by scola\\_p**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T19:01:18Z","Content":"Are you sure the problem is landing sites, or lander design?

If I\u0027m comfortable that the current speed and trajectory is safe, I\u0027ll time-warp a bit to trim it up even more, and repeat the process until I have a vertical path to the target. When in normal view, I just keep an eye as to what is below. Zoom in nav-mode usually helps ensure you don\u0027t hit the edge of smaller craters, but sometimes you hit a lump that\u0027s apparent only when you get down there. When this happens, just speed up a bit to stop descent, change course slightly, then start your retrograde course to the ground."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T19:20:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Aim for a big crater, always manage to land on a slope.

I would give up on trying to find a flat surface to land on because no matter how flat an area might look from above, odds are it still contains copious amounts of slope that are more than capable of tipping a tall and skinny lander. And any actually flat area is likely quite small and ringed with slopes and pinpoint landing Is a rather advanced skill that you will only learn with time and practice (time and practice can of course be substituted with copious amounts of fuel to make corrections with). \n\nFor now, go the other route and adjust your landers to make them more capable of landing on slopes. Then, of course, you have to worry about new aerodynamics pulling on you nice wide lander, but that can(most likely) be solved with fins. \n\nGood luck, Happy Landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T19:56:34Z","Content":"Minmus is way easier, but if you really want to go to the Mun and are playing without mods, try to land in the center of a crater.

A little earlier if your surface TWR is \u003C1.5.\n7. Control your vertical velocity by pitching up or down as appropriate down. Reduce thrust as you approach your target area but keep controlling your vertical velocity. Burn off prograde left or right to adjust your direction and thus your landing site.\n8. Throttle down and pitch up to keep on progressing toward your intended landing site, to prevent canceling your horizontal velocity too early.\n9.
