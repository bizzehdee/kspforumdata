That works whether it\u0027s on a plane or a rocket. One trick you can do is to set the ant\u0027s thrust limiter to zero. With this setting, you can put the ant in front, or\u00A0on top of a vehicle. It just needs to be activated, it doesn\u0027t have to do anything useful. If you use the Tweak Scale mod, you can make test parts tiny. That\u00A0also makes testing easier. If it\u0027s not what the customer wanted, they should have worded the contract differently!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bubblegum","CreatedById":212589,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-05T14:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay thanks, seems to be impossible at this point, I only have basic airplane parts and it will take a while to get more science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is air resistance, I already tried with all sorts of rockets and they can\u0027t speed up fast enough.
