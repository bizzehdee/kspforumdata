The first left a crater (RIP Bill), the second landed but destroyed the rocket engine and the astronaut survived. The third mission, sent up to rescue the astronaut, landed about 15km away (I didn\u0027t want to waste precious fuel moving closer). It was late last night and closed everything down and figured I\u0027d come back today and hike my stranded astronaut over to the rescue vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so today I launch Kerbal and from the space tracking center, I pick the stranded vehicle and select Fly. I set the target to my rescue ship and a marker shows up on the screen showing it 15km away. Now the strange part, when I tell my astronaut to go EVA, the marker disappears. I think this is weird, can you only see the marker when the astronaut is in the vehicle? So I have him get back on board, still no marker. So I zoom out and can\u0027t find the rescue ship at all. I go back to the space center and it\u0027s no longer even available to be selected, like I never flew the mission at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else seen something like this?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-25T04:20:37Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2014 04:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PixelThis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T23:48:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEither a bug, or you unintentionally ended the flight (recovered) when you switched to the other.

If it really has disappeared, you\u0027ve either found a bug (which are still very prevalent) or you\u0027ve accidentally removed the ship by reverting or similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, targets you select inside a craft are targetted by the craft, not by the Kerbals inside it. So, if you target first and then go EVA, you\u0027ll lose the target and will need to reselect it from the map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the map view (and tracking station view) have switches to toggle what kinds of crafts are visible. These switches are hidden on a pull-down at the top of the screen in map view. If they\u0027re greyed out, no crafts or objects of that type will be shown on the map. Debris crafts, for example, are hidden by default. If your particular craft is deselected, you won\u0027t find it on the map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, zooming out and hoping to see a craft 15km away from your current position on the surface of the Mun isn\u0027t necessarily going to work. 15km is a long way, and unless the game considers the object to be close enough to be worth giving a reticule (others probably know exactly how close this needs to be), the chances of you just seeing it are pretty slim. Non-targeted craft reticules are basically grey anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPro tip: in future use the F5 quicksave feature when you quit for the night, that way if anything goes wrong first thing tomorrow you can just hold F9 and get a do-over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T20:43:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Rocketeer said, objects you targeted while inside the ship are targeted by the ship, not by the Kerbal. When you EVA you will need to re-target the ship from map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get to map view while on EVA by pressing the M key (unless you have re-mapped that to a different key..). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, you could do it without targeting also. Get a bearing to your rescue ship, and start walking that direction.. I like setting targets personally, easy to lose your bearing while on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I suggest conserving your EVA monopropellant, don\u0027t be tempted to use it all up during the hike to make it go faster. That\u0027s just in case you forgot to put a ladder on your rescue ship, or in case it doesn\u0027t extend as planned.
