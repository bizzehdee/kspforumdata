This time, I landed a miner for a fuel platform in orbit around Minmus, and it got a horrific return. I went so far as to send another orbital scanner out to see the spots I should land, I tried in monochrome light spots, no change, tried in dark spots, no change. Literally 5 different spots, no change. Even the last one, I landed within 700m of my other miner that\u0027s getting like 20x the ore return.\n\nThe only difference between the miners (mining wise) is the # of small ore tanks. The one that works better has 6 ore tanks. The one that sucks balls has 1 ore tank. None of them get filled up though, because the ISRU is using all the ore without problem just as fast as it comes in.\n\nIs there some kind of bug where the first spot you mine with, the drill stays stuck mining at that rate or something?\n\nEdit: Just saw the engineer level is a 5x multiplier... the engineer on board is a level 0. The mining rig that sucks is unmanned.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nNevermind, it\u0027s the 5x multiplier for having a horrible engineer onboard vs having no engineer at all.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T04:45:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 04:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by barwick11**"}]}
