Even with ordered Asparagus staging, i seem to need about 20 units of fuel per single one i want to get into orbit to refuel my station. I don\u0027t see how i would even fly to Minmus here - just today i had to EVA three of my Kerbals into Munar orbit with their packs because their craft didn\u0027t have enough fuel left to get out of its suborbital trajectory (Bob\u0027s second similar experience), after i had to do a small surface deplacement to get to the position of my rover, then later pick them up with a different version of the same craft. And the first craft had even refuelled at my space station in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy usual procedure for getting up into orbit is burn up to about 200 m/s, then stay stable there untill i reach 10km of altitude, pitch over to 50 degrees east, burn untill my apoapsis is between 80 and 100 km, then wait till i get to apoapsis and burn till my periapsis is also in space.

It\u0027s already very very wobbly, so i can\u0027t imagine bringing anything taller very far into orbit. All SRB\u0027s fire, aided by my liquid engines to maintain the right acceleration. The short ones drop off to allow my first asparagus stage to fire, then the longer ones fall off, after which i continue asparagus staging as usual. I need to control this nicely after my ascent to get to my station without using some of the payload fuel, payload being the tank with the batteries, the monoprop tank and the tank with the radial engines. I already seem to have a tall vehicle here, so i have no idea how i would design something capable of controlled Kerbin escape, braking for a Duna orbit, then getting back into Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/3x3Px.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223x3Px.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the hopefully named Mission Minmus, only it never got past the Mun.

I got it to orbit, upon which it had to refuel at previously mentioned Skyjeb station before continuing to the moon. I arrived there, small unaccounted burn to get my periapsis outside of the mun, then retro burn to catch into orbit, landed on the mun. Made a few dozen kilometers of movement over the munar surface with it to get to a previously landed rover, then attempted to take off. Not enough fuel. I had to rescue my kerbals with their jetpacks and send the craft over again. It serves okay as an orbital tug, but something must be fundamentally wrong with my approach if a poodle engine with three full tanks can\u0027t make mun, a small munar surface covering, and back to Kerbin, starting fully fueled in Kerbin orbit.

Where you point your rocket will determine your inclination. Aimed right at the equator will give you an equatorial orbit where aiming toward a pole will put you an a polar orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Hope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spyritdragon","CreatedById":70515,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T19:36:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tend to launch East for that reason, yes.

But those combined don\u0027t really weigh all too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve added in Neil\u0027s design tips, a different angling timing and keeping my G-forces under 2. I\u0027ve replaced my poodle with 5 LV-909\u0027s, one below each of my main fuel tanks and two under single FL-T200 tanks i attached radially for that purpose. Still need a little bit of payload fuel, but i\u0027ll change it to a 6-pylon asparagus and that should fix it. With all this, once i manage to fire a rocket into the proper inclined orbit for Minmus, im hoping ill make it :-). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get into a Mun orbit, i plan a prograde maneuver node to put my new apoapsis slightly past the Mun\u0027s orbit, around 45 degrees ahead of where it is at the moment. Usually my maneuver nodes will tell me when i\u0027ll get caught by the Mun\u0027s SOI. Then i adjust my maneuver to get mun periapsis around 50km. (Forgot this one time, had to burn laterally to get my periapsis to be higher than the surface). Then just timewarp till i get to that periapsis, then burn to close into a more or less circular 50km orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Mun descents are a bit invent-on-the-spot. After sometimes a few orbital corrections, i tend to arrive in a (slightly) inclined orbit even with a pure prograde burn when at Kerbin - not that that\u0027s a problem right now. I wait till im a bit past the other side of the mun from where i want to preferrably land, then i burn retro untill the point where i\u0027ll hit the surface is a bit past the landing point. I let myself coast, then when i\u0027m content with the point i\u0027m over, i burn retro to kill my horizontal and sometimes partially my vertical velocity. I usually keep my navball pointing close to the horizon though, so i don\u0027t have to worry about my horizontal velocity too much. I let myself fall down to the surface, occasionally burning to keep my vertical speed from going too high. I aim for 200 m/s in the start, go to 150 when i start to get close, 50 m/s when im within a few kilometres, and about 10 for the last hundred metres. When i get to the point where i can see my shadow (i usually aim for the bright side), i cancel out the remains of my horizontal velocity, then touch down as softly as i can manage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor leaving i just turn up the throttle, point my nose towards Kerbin, burn till i have a 50km apoapsis, then go to a 50km periapsis when i get to apoapsis. Then i wait till im at the right position and burn Mun-prograde untill i have an escape point, hopefully pointing a bit towards Kerbin. When i reach it, i wait a small while to make sure im clear of the Mun\u0027s gravitational field, then burn retro to put my Kerbin periapsis around 50km or lower. Usually leads to me arriving at about 3000m/s in velocity. Then just use my parachutes, drag and any remaining fuel to slow down and safely land on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@John I\u0027ll take a look at my crafts, but i think i\u0027ve got those amounts of thrust, at least on my lander. And generally i try to stick to those guidelines when launching too, but i haven\u0027t been looking at the 100m/s mark yet. Ill try that on my next launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help so far everyone \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
