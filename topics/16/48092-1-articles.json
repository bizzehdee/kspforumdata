I do understand how the Forum search engine works, and I HAVE checked for the answer, but could find nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I have seen many YouTube videos and Tutorials (yes, already! doing my homework), and after each and every flight, whether it achieves its mission objective (ie achieve orbit, land on Mun etc) a window pops up with the Flight Details. I have yet to see this, and have checked my settings for an unticked \u0022Display Flight Details Window\u0022 or something similar, and have no idea why I do not receive this valuable information. At the moment, I\u0027m writing them all down by hand and keeping records to try to achieve small steps in mission objectives. How do I get this window to appear?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)In \u0022asparagus staging\u0022, is it more efficient to fire up ALL of your engines initially, burning through fuel until your first stage empties and is jettisoned, then the second etc until you have achieved your orbit (or achieved weightlessness) or is it more efficient to fire up your (for example) four external tanks with their respective engines, leaving your central final stage intact until just before the last stage exhausts all its fuel, then initiate that stage by firing up the engine, and jettisoning the penultimate stage when it expires, then throttling back to sit back for the final stage of your journey? I have seen both methods used. I guess, whilst there is no \u0022career mode\u0022 (yet!) and we don\u0027t have to pay for fuel, it is a moot point, but perhaps it might enter into calculations when attempting to transit to the outer planets of the Kerbal System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) My Nav Ball is inaccessible from the Map screen. A tutorial vid showed that I need to click on the arrow, but there is no point on there where I can click to expose it. I know that I can toggle it on or off with the Num Pad period key, but I just would like to know why I can\u0027t just \u0022grab\u0022 it. I think it might be that I am running in full screen mode. Up the top right of my screen is a dull red glow, and when I \u0022cursor over\u0022 it, it says \u0022close\u0022 or nearby it says \u0022minimise\u0022 so I guess that the three buttons that normally appear on each screen (close, minimise, maximise) are hiding just off screen. Should I just go with a windowed screen (for such a beautiful game game, it seems a shame) or leave it as is and live with the Num Pad period Nav Ball?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I haven\u0027t yet tried to use a joystick in this game (I have seen threads where it is mentioned how to set up your joystick) despite the fact I first tried terrestrial (err...Kerbal) flight in an airplane and successfully took off and landed back at the Space Centre using WASD. Are they easier to use for finer movements? I have seen some people stressing out badly whilst trying to dock. It seems as if it might be easier with a joystick if you could adjust your deadspots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have purchased the full version of the game from Steam, and downloaded it from there if that helps you to understand why these things are a mystery to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have many, many more questions, but I tend to go on a bit (as you might have realised) trying to explain EXACTLY what I need/want. I will ask those questions in due time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any that assist by answering any of the above questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck Six\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"check","CreatedById":71875,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T08:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) When you catastrophically crash the stats window should pop up. Otherwise, if you land safely (or at any other time in the mission) you can tap F3 to bring it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Haven\u0027t done the math, but I\u0027m assuming if you\u0027re not firing your core stage engines and just the boosters, you\u0027re just carrying the dead weight of the core engines that aren\u0027t doing anything until you stage your boosters, wasting fuel. If your boosters alone are able to lift your rocket without the core stage firing, then they\u0027re probably overpowered. You\u0027ll want to find a balance where a) the core stage without boosters can lift itself and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E the core stage with boosters can just barely lift itself. Again, I haven\u0027t done the math, but that seems reasonable to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) There should be a little grey square with a dark triangle in the middle, at the bottom centre of your screen in map mode. Clicking that will bring up the navball. If you cant see it then maybe your resolution is set wrong for your display.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Only used the joystick a few times, but I\u0027m more comfortable using WASDQE to control my spaceplanes.
