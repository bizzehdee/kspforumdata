I created a utility rover to be a workhorse around the base. It\u0027s really handy. it has three containers for various stuff that the kerbals can do small modifications with, a winch, a bunch of connectors, a portable generator, a nice fuel tank and all science instruments I have unlocked thus far. However, I see that it cannot really tow much using just its wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, one of the modules of the base detached a stage during landing which contains a decent size fuel tank. The tank and engine survived and was laying not far from the base. Since the base is mining karbonite and refining it to fuel, I wanted to retrieve the tank for the additional capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tank was much too heavy for my rover. However, the rover had four downward rockomax thrusters that was used during landing. I never planned on those being actively used during operation. Modding the rockomax thrusters to point backwards made the task easy peasy. However, those toroid tanks dry out fast. And I am wondering what I can do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize I can take those big tank pipeline connectors that usually connect the various modules of the moon base, but it looks strange to have two major components and a overly dimensioned pipeline just to transfer the fuel a few feet (from the utility tank of the rover to the four toroid tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought I could haul the fuel using the Karry Kans that I had brought. However, it does not carry regular liquidfuel and oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any lightweight carryable (by an individual kerbal) container for fuel for this purpose?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any flexible component that a kerbal can use to connect two tanks and allow a regular fuel transfer? Preferably something that can be stored inside the \u0022Container Type A\u0022 or \u0022Container Type B\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
