Modular girder segments and octagonal struts for example will always allow fuel to pass along them to other attached parts. In fact, most parts in KSP allow fuel to go through them with some exceptions. The I-beams and structural panels however will not allow fuel to pass through them so if you want engines attached to I-beams to get fuel you will have to run a fuel line across instead. All of the docking ports will pass fuel by default, but right-clicking them will give you the option to disable fuel flow. In contrast, decouplers and separators will block fuel flow by default, but you can enable fuel flow in their right-click menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith those part connection rules in mind, all fuel tanks that have a connection to any engines within their same stage will all drain fuel together at the same rate by default. But this can be altered two different ways. If you have \u0022Advanced Tweakables\u0022 turned on you will have the option to adjust fuel flow priority. \u0022Advanced Tweakables\u0022 can be turned on from the main game settings menu. It adds an extra slider to any tank\u0027s right-click menu that shows the tank\u0027s fuel flow priority number. It will also turn on an option to show an overlay of the path that fuel is taking from each tank to the engines (or if you are right-clicking an engine it will tell you which tanks that engine is drawing from.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA different fuel flow priority number can be set for each tank. Within each stage the fuel will always drain from the tanks with the highest priority number to the lowest number. Remember, for fuel flow priority a lower number drains later -\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003Elower is later.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other option is to run fuel lines from one tank (or multiple tanks) to another tank in the same stage. As long as all tanks in that stage have the same fuel flow priority, then the fuel lines will pump fuel from whichever tank you first attached it to into the tank the other end is connected to. Be aware that those fuel lines are directional. They move fuel from the first end you attach to the second end you attach. All that\u0027s left to do is make sure that the last tank that receives fuel has a fuel connection to your engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-09T07:47:51Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2017 07:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-09T13:15:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

I even added a second \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E but still at the end of the solid boosters it went out of control. I didn\u0027t lose the ship, but it was spinning wildly and very difficult and fuel costly to bring under control. Annoying because the last eighth of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s is where you go from 750 m/sec to 1500 m/sec even with instability.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had added a lot of fins on the whole thing, both as low down on the SRBs and high too. This smoothed out the ascent tremendously but still at the end it went nuts. Maybe a longer rocket? Maybe more weight at the top. I\u0027m surprised they don\u0027t have a way for you to see how the rocket changes as fuel burns. I\u0027m guessing the SRBs burn from the bottom to the top and so the rocket becomes too light on bottom whereas when burning liquid fuel the rocket gets to light at the top. Also, at the end of the SRBs I\u0027m leaning more. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E moves up and away from the force pushing up and leverage takes over.

Gravity pulls straight down to earth and straight through the center line of the rocket so it doesn\u0027t affect stability. when you lean the rocket the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E is the fulcrum and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECol\u003C/abbr\u003E is feet away and lower. The COG pulls down above the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E and this produces a lot of torque which is not very strong compared to the engines but the engines are not doing anything to correct this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I could put the engine on the side of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E half way to the top. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E would stay more constant that way.

What you need is an engine that shifts up and down as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E shifts. That would make the rocket much more stable.

All those structural parts can catch a lot of air and pull your rocket over. You already know that you need your center-of-mass closer to the nose and your drag at the tail. The easiest way to counteract a draggy nose is to put larger fins at the bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes using an engine with a high gimbal range can help, like the Vector engine. The vectoring can steer the craft back into the prograde direction and adds a torque to counteract the aero force. But it\u0027s a fine line to walk as you are just as likely to encounter oscillation if it over corrects and thrusting too hard will still cause flipping out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chik Sneadlov","CreatedById":68474,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-10T08:03:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI stabilized it some more by wrapping the lowest stage of the fuel tanks with six more huge fuel tanks and putting huge engines on each.

Remember, the SRBs will burn at full thrust until they burn out, but you can reduce their default thrust setting in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E before you launch the vessel. Try right-clicking them and turning down the thrust slider a little on those solid boosters before you launch next time. That will allow your nose to fall a little for a better gravity turn. It also reduces ram pressure through the atmosphere for less drag and allows you more steering control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-10T20:17:22Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2017 08:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chik Sneadlov","CreatedById":68474,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-15T10:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never noticed that you can adjust the thrust of SRBs.

If your rocket gets tippy towards the end of the thrusters, put huge fins like airplane tail fins or airplane wings near the top of the rocket.
