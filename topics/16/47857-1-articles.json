Once you have an encounter, the most efficient way to capture into orbit is to tweak your Pe as low as possible (which is pretty low given it has no atmosphere) so the effect on your Ap is maximized.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merlinux","CreatedById":83117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T04:19:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used to fail my missions to Dres by using way too much delta v until I used \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E instead of kerbal alarm clock or visually plotting the transfer window.
