How much delta-v do I need? I think I have a few craft capable of making the trip but I want to make sure first!\n\n2. What was that trick for making it so that both turbojets flame out at the same time that was floating around a while back? Just want to know this for another interesting design I have in mind!\n\nThanks for your time!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T04:39:38Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 04:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DerpenWolf**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T01:20:56Z","Content":"Number 2, it\u0027s to place the intakes that will feed an engine, then the engine, and repeat that process.

[Check out this dV chart for more info.](http://i.imgur.com/IV8rzue.png) though, roughly you will need, at a minimum 6520, but you\u0027re better off packing about 8km/s, but this only accounts for 4.5km/s to LKO. It also assumes you aerobrake into Laythe landing."}]}
