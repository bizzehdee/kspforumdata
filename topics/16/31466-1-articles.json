As odd as it sounds, there are sometimes tiny variations in exactly how the rocket is put together, which can result in weird things like structural failures or uncontrollable rotations even in designs that you\u0027ve tested and flown successfully many times. It can be extremely frustrating, but the fact of the matter is that if this problem comes up, your rocket is pretty close to failure tolerances anyway, and some reinforcement or a re-design is called for. In short, add struts or move components around until you get a more stable ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epic DaVinci","CreatedById":58581,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T11:45:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat exactly is going wrong? loss of control? explosions? spinning?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thorodin84","CreatedById":69417,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T03:56:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the late reply totally forgot about this post...

The wobble at the top is going to cause you hell. It wobbles and mechjeb and the ASAS will try to correct. as it wobbles more, it corrects more making an oscillation that will eventually spin it out of control The air resistance will help hold it steady at lower altitudes, but as that decreases, bad things will happen. If you have trouble running struts up that high, attach some hardpoints halfway up, strut those from the bottom, and then run struts up from the top of the hardpoint to the wobbly top.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
