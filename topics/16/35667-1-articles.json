Putting it there is essentially idiot-proof (The base is under 15 tons). I know exactly how much my tugs can move, and this isn\u0027t going to be anything remotely close to that. Where I\u0027m running into problems is crew return systems. I\u0027d like this to be a long-term base with the ability to transfer crews to orbit and, especially, back down. However, I\u0027m not sure how to make this happen. Docking inside Jool\u0027s atmosphere seems impossible. Also, I\u0027m really not a huge fan of the Firespitter parts as they\u0027re rather ugly/very incongruous, so I\u0027d rather not make my CRV with propellers. I realize that that may be impossible, but if it were easy, where would the fun be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: If I could switch vessels while in atmosphere, I might be able to crash the CTV into a KAS electromagnet, but that doesn\u0027t look promising. Innability to switch vehicles in atmosphere looks like it\u0027s going to be a killer.
