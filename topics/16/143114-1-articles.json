You have two options. 1) Use a manned mission and get all 70 when you return the experiment results to Kerbin. 2) Transmit 25 points from an unmanned probe, and then use a manned mission later to get the other 45 points.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, you can only ever get a max of 70 points for that experiment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaElite101","CreatedById":166055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-05T00:57:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, thank you.
