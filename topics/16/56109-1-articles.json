My problem is: the docking ports have to be perfectly aligned so that the five elements touching the ground are perfectly aligned as well. I therefore thought about applying a trick: DOCK - UNDOCK - ROTATE - REDOCK. But this didn\u0027t work out so well. The docking clamps do not seem to be made for redocking \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 for they aren\u0027t remagnetized after undocking... How can i VERY QUICKLY make them magnetized again. Is there a shortcut key I missed out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anybody help me out with that...

The requirement for re-docking is. you have to back off from the dock 5-10 meters for the magnets to reset, then going forward docking will work normally. What you are doing is very finicky, chase camera might help some also.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dogface","CreatedById":75396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T15:42:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use quicksave (F5) just before docking, when I am trying to line ships up.
