The speed of the roid is so small because it was spawned at that location. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as there are only a few kerbals alive on the planet (only at the KSC) they panicked and build what they could with existing tech. It cost some 200 k spacebucks - around 2/3 of the overall budget. So I made a rendezvous with the roid, maneuvered with no RCS (which is a big deal for me) and in several tries managed to push it out of the way. And as a bonus made a soft landing in the ocean. I think I over designed the ship as I had over half the fuel left. There are some pics in the original post and I an sorry for missing some crucial parts of the mission but I was to busy with maneuvering and I didn\u0027t have time for photographs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T04:36:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh yes..
