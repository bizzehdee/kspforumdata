When comparing two different noses on the \u003Cstrong\u003Esame\u003C/strong\u003E radius, it\u0027s easy - you add a ballast tank to null out any difference in mass, and just swap the relevant nose parts, keeping the same fueltanks and engine. When comparing the drag of different radius rockets, you can\u0027t be consistent with the engine since it obviously no longer matches all the rocket sizes. (Edit: so you get un-occluded drag from the engine/tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s probably a mathematical solution to this but I\u0027m not a strong mathematician and I\u0027m not sure where to find or make sense of the necessary drag data anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not just looking for the lowest drag configuration either - depending on the mission profile, it might be preferable to use a slightly draggier nose to give larger cargo bays or more crew capacity etc. What I\u0027d really like to be able to do is make a comparison table for the best 2 or 3 options for each radius, but that may not be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-26T18:27:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2015 06:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T18:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInstall \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117141\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAeroGUI\u003C/a\u003E, it gives summary drag data.
