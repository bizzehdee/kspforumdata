If so, each part only has one \u0027sticky\u0027 spot that you have to place in contact with an existing part in order for it to be part of the vehicle. (Except for struts, which have a sticky spot at each end.) That part won\\\u0027t stick to anything else, though other things can stick to it. If you\\\u0027re trying to make those wings stronger by connecting the panels to each other better, one panel\\\u0027s short side will not stick to another\\\u0027s. Your only option is to put struts between them.
