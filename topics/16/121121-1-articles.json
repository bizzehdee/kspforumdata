If I use Alt - X it resets time compression (which isn\u0027t on in the first place) but doesn\u0027t reset trim. If I manually reset trim to as close to 0 as I can get it (which is never absolute zero) and then use Alt - X, it resets back to the out of balance position it was in before I manually adjusted it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI read somewhere that ASA has to be turned off. - Did it. - Doesn\u0027t matter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is driving me nuts!
