To fix this, you\u0027ll need to balance them. This can be done by first displaying the center of mass. If you don\u0027t already know, this is done by pressing the weight icon in the lower left in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you want to place either one or two sets of thrusters in 4x radial symmetry. 2 is good for both rotation and translation, while 1 is better if you have sufficient torque from reaction wheels to rotate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor 1, place them exactly level with the center of mass. It\u0027s advisable that you double check this and adjust with your fuel tanks tweaked to be half full (or whatever they\u0027ll be at roughly while you are translating) to best balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor 2, you want to place them a distance off the center of mass, BUT you want them to both be the same distance away. This setup also enables rotation and is harder get out of line by center of mass shifting, but is also more difficult to balance from the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Sierra\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T02:07:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe i shoudl use some fuel balancing plugin to prevent com shifting?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anton P.

I find the linear ports are easier to deal with because the RCS thruster blocks tend to get blocked by wings, tails, engines, etc. You can certainly use them, but they get a bit tricker to keep from blocking. EDIT: That being said, placement considerations like the picture I posted still apply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, gravity hack makes space plane RCS designing a lot easier.
