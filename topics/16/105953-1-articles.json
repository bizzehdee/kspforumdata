The switch was happening by pressing space, you were unable to run your main engine ect. Now engine controls (shift) work as in normal flight and space IN ADDITION to change rot/trans separate next stage. yay... so how should I put my rcs in translation mode?\n\nav.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T15:11:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 03:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Avantar**"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T12:52:58Z","Content":"Stay in staging mode and use IJKLHN for translation.
