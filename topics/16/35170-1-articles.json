Is there any reason no matter what plane I use (Stock KSP, Mod, stock parts) No matter what it is if I give it a pitch up about 10 degrees and turn ASAS on it will slowly (quickly sometimes) descend and lose altitude. I don\u0027t know how to overcome this and it is kind of annoying for those long flights up too orbit or around the planet when you have to manually fly the whole thing with no time accelertaion the whole way! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly is there a way to turn time acceleration on when normally it will not let you? Like a rover moving over the ground I can\u0027t time warp, or throttled a rocket up I can\u0027t, anyway to overcome this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance guys!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aqua667","CreatedById":66078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T18:42:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the plane problem try using avionics(but they\u0027re crap in space).

As for planes, I have limited experience, but the avionic package works better than asas. Also I generally use both SAS and ASAS on everything I build. Also I\u0027d imagine a slow descent might have something to do with fuel being burned, though I could be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been thinking about modifying my one successful plane (it has yet to go into space though, but working on it) by pitching the wings up slightly, to hopefully increase it\u0027s lift just enough to counteract the slow descent. Speaking of which, I have problems trying to keep my plane level, it\u0027ll either dive of climb by more than 10 m/s. Guess I just need more air time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELol I see Aqua beat me to it by a few minutes on the time warp thing, as well as avionics package.
