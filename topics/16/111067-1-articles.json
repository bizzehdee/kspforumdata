I\u0027ve never seen the ship actually move under it\u0027s own power once I was out of it. To confirm that there\u0027s actual control inputs in the ship while you\u0027re outside of it, try adding RCS jets to the ship and leave them active when you EVA. Since the jets are easily visible it should be easy to tell if the ship is receiving control inputs.\n\nIf it\u0027s a bug, it\u0027s one I haven\u0027t encountered yet. Have you tried going back to the space center then back to the ship through the tracking center? I\u0027m wondering if the bug is persistant through a reload of the ship."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T01:17:14Z","Content":"Oh, yes, the infamous Remote Control Ship bug.

So when you are within physics range and press on a button, the SAS on the vessel unlocks and starts to maneuver.\n\nYou can also fix it by switching to the vessel and pressing MOD\u002BX to zero out the trim.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T07:41:01Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had it without trim.
