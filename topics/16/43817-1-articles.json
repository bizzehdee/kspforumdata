Do you know they want me to show up EVERY day!!!?? WTF!!!! Anyway, I DID finally get my rovers/habitats landed. The first time I landed them directly onto my Mun Base and knocked everything over. The whole Mun to land on and I hit the one place that I should\u0027ve missed by three feet! LOL \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TO9dJVf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TO9dJVf.jpg\u0022\u003E Since I had neglected to do a QuickSave (of course!) I had to revert and re-fly the mission. While in the process, I realized that I was unhappy about the location of the Mun Base, especially the slope it was on that meant it will cause issues in the future when I try to build up the location. In addition I had some fuel.....issues. (\u0022issues\u0022 translates to running out of it around 25 meters above the Munar surface. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E ) Only one lander survived that mission. So I landed my next Tri-Habitat Lander at an alternate location near the \u0022north pole\u0022 in order to scout out a better location for my base and then figured I\u0027ll re-fly a new base to that location. Come to find out that the \u0022north pole\u0022 has a lot of mountains and valleys and steep grades that landers like to tumble down during a landing. Who knew! (Good thing that I put that stock mapping satellite in Munar orbit back when I started my campaign in order to find out that I can\u0027t map the Mun without installing a mod! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) THIS landing was somewhat improved in that I was able to land with the literally the last ounce of fuel in my tanks! Once we completed our subsequent tumble down the slope, I was even able to salvage TWO landers from the wreck! The third one was stuck upside down, no way to flip it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mVvni9M.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mVvni9M.jpg\u0022\u003E The nice thing was that I was able to actually use my detachment/deployment concept and it DID work nicely. Just some minor tweaks to that and I\u0027ll be able to use it just about anywhere. The down side of this landing site is that I\u0027m in a valley with slopes too steep to climb out of with my current capabilities. I\u0027ll have to try out some additional sites in order to locate a compatible location and then I\u0027ll just rebuild the whole base.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-02T20:37:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2013 08:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Graknils\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"matt3526","CreatedById":72260,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T20:37:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blizzy78\u0022 data-cite=\u0022blizzy78\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kspbbpwl.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/kspbbpwl.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t do this without mods, because a newly-created PPD-10 has only vertical stack attachment nodes.
