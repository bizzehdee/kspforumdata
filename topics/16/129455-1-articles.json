Most of those mission reports that had interplanetary missions always had aerobraking in it! So I tried doing it on my Duna mission but all I knew about aerobraking was lowering my periapsis down towards the atmosphere and hoping I don\u0027t explode so I ended up doing a braking burn whilst aerobraking anyways since I didn\u0027t know how ti aerobrake properly. Sooooooo I\u0027m just going to sit here and ask for tips on aerobraking so I don\u0027t make the same mistakes I made on my Duna mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T13:56:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you may be confusing aerobraking and aerocapture. You have already successfully completed an aerobraking maneuver by just entering the atmosphere. Aerocapture is the process of using the atmosphere to slow down or aerobrake enough to remain in the target body\u0027s sphere of influence. Completing a successful aerocapture requires a ship to be designed such that it can create enough drag to reduce orbital speed to the point that you remain in the target\u0027s soi while not blowing up from overheating. The ship\u0027s design is what is key here. So a ship that is designed to fly efficiently through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is going to be terrible at aerocapture at Duna. For a ship to be good at creating enough drag to aerocapture at Duna, you have to make it wider rather than taller. Think short and fat. Also, some screenshots of some of the craft you have already tried would help people help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T16:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there are, generally speaking, two challenges with aerobraking:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMaking the ship tough enough that it doesn\u0027t burn up from reentry heating\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nJudging the altitude right so that you get the desired amount of dV change (i.e. not too much or too little)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the tough-enough problem:\u00A0 mainly, make sure you\u0027re behind a heat shield with nothing important and/or heat-intolerant peeking out from behind the shield.\u00A0 In general you\u0027ll do better with short, fat designs, which have the most square meters of heat shield per ton of ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for judging the altitude:\u00A0 that can be just about impossible to work out in advance, since, 1. the \u0022right\u0022 altitude totally depends on the mass and shape of your ship, and, 2. aerobraking altitude can be very sensitive, i.e. just a very small amount of altitude change can be the difference between \u0022too much\u0022 and \u0022not enough\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only real solution to that is trial-and-error.\u00A0 That is, as you\u0027re approaching the target planet, do a quicksave when you\u0027re still far away (like way out on the SoI boundary), so that it\u0027s cheap and easy to make a minor correction to adjust your periapsis altitude.\u00A0 Then just pick an altitude and try it.\u00A0 If you get too little braking (and fly off into space), then reload the save and try again with a slightly lower altitude.\u00A0 If you get too much braking (and go down to the surface when what you wanted to do was slow just enough to be captured to orbit)), try again with a slightly higher altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MagicFireCaster","CreatedById":149926,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T17:32:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif your ship is heat resistant enough you can do multiple aerobraking to get your desired orbit, but you need at least the first one to close your orbit around the planet, then repeat the process adjusting your orbit until you get the desired ammount, you will consume a little extra fuel, but it can help you until you\u0027re expert enough,\u00A0remember to adjust your periapsis, you don\u0027t want to get land on your second aerobraking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
