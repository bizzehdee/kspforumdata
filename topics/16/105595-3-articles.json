Gameplay-wise you can say it\u0027s not exactly \u0022fun\u0022 to timewarp through something but on that same principle you could just as well skip all travel through space since hey, that\u0027s just timewarping too right? We have timewarp exactly so we can retain the realism level of having to actually do the travelling but still have it condensed to under one minute no matter where you\u0027re going. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a major issue and in any other game I\u0027d probably back it up as a good decision but not in KSP, it just doesn\u0027t fit.\n\nHaving to actually complete the orbits also forces you to think about the power requirements in the craft design. How much power does the scanner use? Do you have enough batteries to keep it going on the dark side of the planet/moon? Enough solar panels to keep it running in the sunny side as well as to charge the batteries? Now you don\u0027t have to think about these things.\n\nHaving a map being drawn in front of your eyes actually teaches you about how real world satellites move and how the different orbital changes affect the path over ground. It shows you exactly why you have to be on polar orbit if you want to scan everything. If you can\u0027t make it to polar you should still be able to scan something, it\u0027s just not as complete. But now the scanner magically can\u0027t scan at all on equatorial orbit. Just doesn\u0027t make sense.\n\nIt just seems like several interesting mechanics are being thrown out and you\u0027re being imposed an unrealistic and potentially infuriating limitation all just so people can avoid 20 seconds of timewarp after first timewarping probably 10 times to get to their destination.

For example, the very best data requires ground truthing with rovers or probes, but in turn enables the other scanners to have more accurate data. And your fine grained area detail has a limited FOV, and requires manual flybys (and also incorporates terrain data for planning landings).\n\nThis is what I mean when I say you really have to take the system as a whole, yet folks are fixated on one bit (the least significant, actually) because, in fairness, it appears to be the closest analogue to what they are used to."}]}
