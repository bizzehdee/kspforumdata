Continuous 3-axis control input is required to maintain level flight. The B2 stealth bomber had independently controlled engines which varied their thrust output slightly to act as yaw controllers, in addition to the pitch and roll control you can get through thrust vectoring and control surfaces. Since you are stuck with pitch \u002B roll only ( at least using SAS - a mod or manic mouse clicking could allow differential thrust to some extent, although it would be funny to watch and probably would not work) you end up having difficulty controlling your aircraft. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou might be able to get around this using Vernor engines as RCS thrusters - they point outwards (so near-nose placement gives you decent yaw torque) and they are quite a bit more powerful than standard RCS thrusters. Since you need RCS for spaceflight anyways (if you want the SSTO route) I would recommend using a couple and trying it out. 50\u002B tons may be pushing it a bit, but you should be able to stay at least somewhat stable with SAS working with your jury-rigged 3-axis control. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn short, you have 3 degrees of freedom with 2 degrees of control, meaning that no matter what you do something is going to mess you up eventually.

This can be adjusted, and the less twist... the better they glide... many pilots flying the gliders in competitions tune the twist to very low levels, and have gliders that have little passive pitch stability and require fast reactions from the pilot... competitions actually have quite a few pilots tumbling their gliders (which normally requires a parachute deployment)\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn contrast.. a paraglider has massive roll and pitch stability from hanging from their wing from many lines, not a single one like a hangglider\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd... that still does nothing to address yaw stability.... even in paragliders\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe B2 is yaw stable without the yaw breaks... because it has a swept leading edge.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs it yaws relative to its direction of flight, one wing will present more frontal area than the other, resulting in a stabilizing torque...\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course a thin low drag \u0022blade\u0022 wing won\u0026#39;t present nearly as much torque as the flat surface of a vertical stabilizer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is *less* yaw stable, but it is still yaw stable. It just means more \u0022gentle\u0022 and less \u0022aggressive\u0022 maneuvers are needed if you\u0026#39;re going to rely on passive stability.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich is not typically a restriction that the military likes to have.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain, I\u0026#39;ll point to the flying wings from te 30\u0026#39;s, 40\u0026#39;s, and 50\u0026#39;s, in particular that yellow one above...\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey were perfectly safe when flown within their limits. Its true that many eventually crashed and they were largely abandoned... but thats what happens with experimental craft and test pilots... they were flown beyond their safe limits.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMuch like a plane in KSP can be pitch stable enough... but if you pitch up too hard/fast... it will flip (this is particularly likelyto happen if your CoL is just barely behind the CoM)... The flying wings are stable, they are just *less* stable and a pilot that isn\u0026#39;t aware of their limits or pushes their limits will eventually go beyond them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHang gliders are quite yaw stable because of the relatively high angle of attack and low wing loading (a consequence of slow speed flight).
