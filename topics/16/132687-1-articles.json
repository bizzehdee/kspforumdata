No need for heatshields, right? It would just take a bit of fuel to circularize at Kerbin during Ap, or I could just aerocapture, right??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, months have passed and, long after that ship was dispatched, I learnt the obvious: no, you can\u0027t forgo a heatshield (or several!) in such a mission profile and, no, it doesn\u0027t take \u0022a bit\u0022 of fuel to circularize while zooming through Kerbin\u0027s SOI within a couple hours. It takes 5,000 dV, in a ship that has some 1,200 dV remaining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now that I\u0027m trying to rescue my pilot (and the science!), I wonder exactly how.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could try a rendezvous in solar orbit, which would cost an horrendous amount of dV, but is doable with ion engines (actually, I have a ship designed: the Rhino from the ascend stage makes it to orbit and kicks first, then an orange tank with MRS 2.5 nukes and finally the ions). Should I send that ship out of Kerbin right after the poor Sundiver ship zooms through?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other option I\u0027m thinking is to try to keep using gravity assists to raise the Ap to Jool, see if I have enough fuel left to get a slingshot out of Tylo and get rescued by whatever ship happens to be there within the 7-10 in-game years it would take for Sundiver to make it there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny other ideas? Oh, and obviously, I\u0027m not using any life support, else my poor lost kerbal would be dead before I get to him.

I\u0027m now thinking about putting Sundiver\u0027s Pe rather high above Kerbin, say between the Mun and Minmus. If I\u0027m right, and I\u0027m often not right, matching velocities would still require a huge burn, but the rescuer would already have burned a lot to make it to the RV point... but does that even make sense? Sundiver would still be travelling at fast solar orbit speeds, even if they are slower relative to Kerbin, and, supposedly, the Ap has the lower orbital speed so the rescuer should still need a lot of dV to match speeds\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T01:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been in a very similar situation just recently, as it turns out, though for a very different reason.\u00A0 I\u0027ve been playing with the Outer Planets mod, and was sending a craft home from Sarnus, and didn\u0027t want to wait a decade to do it, and got ... impatient.\u00A0 I\u0027m too embarrassed to say how fast I was going when I hit Kerbin\u0027s SoI, but suffice to say it was faster than you\u0027re dealing with.\u00A0 By, um, a lot.\u00A0 And it turns out that at those speeds, a heat shield is pretty much useless.\u00A0 I was able to shave off maybe 1 km/s of speed by aerobraking, but that was the best I could do-- any deeper, and the ship just exploded, heatshield or no heatshield.\u00A0 So a rescue mission was in order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you need is not a high TWR, just a high dV.\u00A0 Keep the rescue ship as light as possible, maybe even just give it a command chair in lieu of a pod.\u00A0 If you make it ion-powered and use drop tanks (to cope with the absolutely abysmal mass ratio of xenon tanks), it\u0027s no trouble at all to build a craft with 15 km/s or more of dV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSet it up to start accelerating away from Kerbin before the stranded ship has even arrived, so that you can get a matched-velocity intercept with it right away.\u00A0 As soon as you rendezvous, you move your kerbal across, brake to a halt relative to Kerbin, then turn around and go home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe amount of dV your rescue ship needs is basically 2x the stranded ship\u0027s Kerbin-relative velocity (once to match velocity with the target, then a second time\u00A0 to brake to a Kerbin-relative halt), plus however much dV you want to use to come home (can be low if you want, it\u0027s basically a question of how long you\u0027re willing to wait to get home after the rendezvous).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T04:07:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason you need far more deltaV than needed\u00A0is because your trajectory is not tangent to Kerbin\u0027s orbit. This means your own velocity (relative to Sun) can\u0027t cancel out Kerbin\u0027s velocity effectively, and what\u0027s more, orthogonal component is introduced to increase your velocity relative to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen doing Solar orbit stuff, my habit is to always control in such a way that either Pe or Ap (depending on whether my destination is farther or closer to the Sun than Kerbin) is tangent to Kerbin\u0027s orbit. In this way, I can just control orbital period to be a multiple of a year and make sure I can reenter Kerbin at the right angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA typical sundiving for me would be, eject to Sun low orbit first, complete one orbit going back to Kerbin orbital height (but Kerbin is not there of course) - then I\u0027ll adjust my periapsis there so that I can encounter Kerbin a couple of periods later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother scenario is previous hilarious contract when tourists ask for sub-orbital Sun flight.
