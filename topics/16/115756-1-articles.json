While a 4 leg lander can tip easily on two legs, a 3 leg lander will be less likely. 3 legs are still more stable than 4 for this reason.

Then attach small engines (radial engines or small strut\u002Bterrier/spark, need enough TWR) in positions that minimize the torque. Also add a small docking port (or probe core) on top that you can use to \u0027control from here\u0027 (not necessary but it helps).

(I can mitigate this somewhat by putting a couple of spotlights on the lander, angled down by about 45 degrees. Great for night landings, but they also help even in daytime by giving a couple of visual reference points. But it\u0027s still tricky for me.)\n\nMaybe others are better at eyeballing slopes than I am, but for me, that makes it so that if I want to adjust roll for the optimum case, I can only do that in the last few meters of descent, when I tend to have my mental hands full.
