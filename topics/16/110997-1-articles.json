Everytime I set up an encounter the Mun SOI encounter pushes him onto a different orbit, compounding to that problem my own orbit also ends up having SOI encounters. I ended up dropping the contract after I whizzed forward in time and saw that the encounters continued indefinitely.\n\nIs there any way to do a contract like this, or is it just some freak accident?"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain H@dock","CreatedById":139017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T12:03:46Z","Content":"It\u0027s probably a freak accident. Likewise you get sat contracts for orbits that clearly are too close to the mun (though you don\u0027t have to sync it with the actual mun phase).\n\nAs for trying to complete it, why not having the rescue pod wait in orbit of the mun? Wait for the next encounter, and depart the mun post target change of course. Then you just have to catch up with the target before it completes its next orbit (this will obviously require slightly more aggressive RDV maneuvers than usual).\n\nNote: I\u0027ve never tried that strategy and it would probably cost a lot more in dV than what these rescue was supposed to, making it less profitable."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T12:04:22Z","Content":"It could be worse, sometimes they crash into the Mun\u0027s surface within a couple of orbits after accepting the contract!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T12:14:49Z","Content":"Actually I love this, it adds some drama to the rescue! I send my rescue ships with a couple thousand more dV in the tank than I need for a straight Munshot and return. In a recent mission the stranded ship was in Mun orbit when I launched, but then got spat out to HKO again. I was watching carefully during transit, so I was able to burn to a parallel course when my rescue ship entered Mun SOI and then meet the target in HKO. Lots of fun, and what someone else called \u0022paying the iron price\u0022 rather than the Kerbucks price to get a new crew member."},{"CreatedByName":"One Wheeled Panda","CreatedById":108769,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T12:23:07Z","Content":"On Monday I accepted a \u0022Rescue from Kerbin Orbit\u0022 contract where the Kerbal to be rescued was captured by Mun right away - on a collision course...\n\nThese contracts should really consider SOI boundaries.

I actually kinda *like* a challenge like this... but it ought to happen deliberately (with appropriate design), not by accident. That is, I wish they\u0027d do something like this:\n\n1. When the game is generating a rescue contract, and rolling the dice, it should decide \u0022should this be a hard-rescue-with-encounters or not?\u0022\n\n2, If it decides \u0022no, this is a normal rescue\u0022 (which should be the majority case), then the orbital parameters should be set up safely, to guarantee no encounters with the Mun or whatever.\n\n3. If it decides \u0022yes, this is a hard one\u0022, then the contract text should clearly include something like \u0022NOTE: This orbit is subject to Mun encounters and is extra-hard\u0022 or whatever... and the contract reward should be made higher, to reflect the added difficulty.\n\nAnyway, regarding the current problem,\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As for trying to complete it, why not having the rescue pod wait in orbit of the mun?

It actually wouldn\u0027t even be all that hard in terms of dV. Send your rescue craft into a Mun orbit, target the rescuee. Even before the rescuee enters the Mun\u0027s SOI, you can see what its trajectory will be as it transits the SOI, so you just set up an intercept to that (it\u0027s pretty much the same problem as setting up a rendezvous to capture a passing asteroid). So it\u0027s a bit more dV, but not all that much (basically, the only extra dV you pay is to get captured by the Mun, and then to leave again; just a few hundred m/s). Totally doable."},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T18:30:29Z","Content":"The bigger the difference in orbit between you and the target means it takes less orbits to do a rendezvous. In case you didn\u0027t know, you can drag the maneuver nodes along the orbit path making rendezvous a lot easier. If you are in LKO and he\u0027s in HKO, you should be able to meet him within one orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain H@dock","CreatedById":139017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T19:20:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...That\u0027s a brilliant suggestion, excellent idea!

And if the target is on a collision course, you could even try to RDV in advance (for a huge dV budget). But like you said, freak accidents won\u0027t provision for the extra cost, so it\u0027s not really worth it."}]}
