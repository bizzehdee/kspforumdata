And you have a gimballing engine, so if you do a gentle burn you regain some turning control?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that\u0027s right, then there are three\u00A0answers. To turn a ship without using fuel, you need a reaction wheel. You probably already have one in your command pod or your probe core, but it\u0027s not very big. You can unlock better reaction wheels in the tech tree, and then your ship will turn a lot better. You can do a little better for now by adding an additional inline command pod to your ship, if you like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, you can use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. This uses a different kind of fuel (monopropellant). But it can turn your ship really fast. Again, there are various bits that you must unlock in the tech tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, you can realize that the gimballing engine is what you have to work with for now, and until you unlock some more of the tech tree, you will have to burn a little fuel and use your engine to turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut basically at the beginning of the game, you have to be very patient, and plan ahead when you want your ship to rotate. You have to understand that your ship will turn very slowly, and you have to expect that it\u0027s going to take a minute or two to make it turn around. Yes, that\u0027s inconvenient, but it\u0027s an accurate part of the simulation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-25T01:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222689779\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144486\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469407607\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166991\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlykaAZ\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, AlykaAZ said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring launch as I yaw left or right, the apoaps indicator lags behind. same thing with pitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you mean this indicator drags behind where you are pointing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002290px-Prograde.svg.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/a/a4/Prograde.svg/90px-Prograde.svg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is by design, and accurate.
