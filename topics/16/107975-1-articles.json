I attach to it with the claw and lower the drills without a problem. They seem to go right in the asteroid based on graphics. However, when I go to turn them on nothing happens. They just say no info and do not start up. I checked the craft on the ground and it works just find in respect to mining ore. I have tried three different asteroids and I am at a complete loss."},{"CreatedByName":"spaceBrezel","CreatedById":69240,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T00:25:29Z","Content":"greetings,\n\ncan you share some pictures? because attaching a claw and lowering the drills sounds alright.\n\n- is there an ore container for your ore?\n- do you have enough electricity?\n- did you right click the drill again after deploying (start asteroid harvester)?\n\ndid capture an asteroid today and had no problems at all.\n\nsome pictures of your harvesting attempts might help ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tea","CreatedById":143307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T01:00:25Z","Content":"I\u0027ve found that mining asteroids requires my drill to be pretty deep inside them - almost up the the orange part - or else I\u0027ll get a message \u0022no surface impact.\u0022 Try unlocking the pivot on your claw and tilting your craft to put the drill body closer to the \u0027roid, it worked for me!\n\nLeft: Able to drill ------------------------------------------------Right: Drilling impossible\n\n(@impyre thanks for catching that, I\u0027ve been in retrograde hold a bit too often the past few days)\n\n![%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%202015-05-06%2020.55.18.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/81033840/KSP/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%202015-05-06%2020.55.18.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T15:35:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 03:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tea**\n  \nI\u0027m directionally challenged"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T02:59:31Z","Content":"@Tea: mix up our rights and lefts again?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T04:50:24Z","Content":"Moved to the how-to section, under the assumption that it\u0027s not a bug.
