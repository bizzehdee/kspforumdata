It was working fine for a few runs. Now, no matter how I attach the boosters it results in two things. The booster swings toward the midsection and demolishes it or the nozzle end swings into the bottom and demolishes it. I\u0027ve tried using different radial decouplers, B9 solid fuel boosters, more struts, going to maximum thrust as I jettison them. NOTHING is working. Someone in this thread experienced the same thing but his solution didn\u0027t work either. This is incredibly frustrating. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/19763-keep-my-radial-rockets-from-colliding-with-the-core-stage-during-staging/page2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/19763-keep-my-radial-rockets-from-colliding-with-the-core-stage-during-staging/page2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance if you can help!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-13T07:02:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2014 07:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kinryu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T05:34:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse some sepratrons to give your boosters a boost away from your rocket as you jettison them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zylark","CreatedById":101018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T05:40:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESlap on some Sepatrons.
