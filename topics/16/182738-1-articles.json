It translates vertically, and longitudinally, but not laterally. The thrusters are all balanced. It goes up, down, forward, and backward straight, but when I try to move laterally it just spins along its longitudinal axis. Changing modes affects the other movements properly but it seems like roll is stuck in rotational mode. Anybody have a similar issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-08T22:37:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm.
