The easy way to do that is make sure your speed display is set to Target (if it says Orbit or Surface, click on it till it changes to Target). Then find the retrograde marker on the navball and align to that. Wait until you\u0027re within a few hundred meters of your station, then thrust towards the retrograde marker until your speed gets to 0.0 m/s. At that point, you\u0027re travelling at the same speed and in the same direction as your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it\u0027s just a case of thrusting gently towards the target to close in for docking. If you\u0027re more than a few hundred meters away, you\u0027ll find your trajectory seems to drift off the target - this is because of differences in your orbit altitudes, so although you\u0027re travelling the same way at the same speed for a moment, gravity is affecting you differently. The closer together you are, the less this is an issue, so just keep correcting and soon you\u0027ll be right alongside.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T14:28:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TokiTech\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TokiTech\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for tips guys, i\u0027ll let the station catch me up then.
