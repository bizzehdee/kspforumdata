I started and was able to get it int orbit, but wasn\u0027t left with any fuel. After making modifications, at 14000m or so, the nose starts to drop. I mash the S key, but it stays low and slowly starts dropping. At this point only my jet engines are going. I have enough air intakes to use the jets until about 20000m, so those are not the problem. The CoL is just barely behind the CoG and I haven\u0027t had any problems with stability.
