There were a few bugs having to do with very special cases, and those were fixed. But a simple signal loss followed by a dead probe is something we would have noticed, and we never did. So, despite your short list of innocuous-looking mods, I\u0027m still going to have to bet that your problem is caused by one of your mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-21T11:51:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso the probe didn\u0027t have signal or it wouldn\u0027t respond to inputs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had a couple of occasions before 1.2 when craft wouldn\u0027t respond to inputs, I think both crewed and uncrewed.
