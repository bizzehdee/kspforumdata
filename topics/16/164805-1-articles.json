Why does the game save like this? I do not understand the rules - if i did i couldn\u0027t gripe, cuz, well, gems da rules, but bc I totally cannot get it seems an aspect of the game thats utterly unfair.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-25T19:33:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums first off!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like the game autosaved in flight before your laptop died, you\u0027d have to manually load your prior save to go back before that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlt-F5 and Alt-F9 create named quicksaves and bring up the list of named quicksaves to load from respectively. I find this to be much more reliable and predictable than counting on the game to keep my autosave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jman66","CreatedById":180763,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-25T21:03:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwell, I figured that out pretty quick so I always over-ride the autosave (persistent) by doing my own back up save under my own label, so that I am not forced to use persistent in case I\u0027m in an irreversible situation. now if i want to revert to my old save if \u00A0I burn up or whatever, cool, I have it. However, i have noticed some times that when i save something and log out or leave the game and come back, it seems to autosave over my own save and i cannot revert to the old save. Thats what happened in this case. Now, if the game is saving over my own files...? well thats different, and seemingly counterproductive.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Allocthonous","CreatedById":169833,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-25T22:11:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game does keep a few backups of older saves on hand. They should be in Kerbal Space Program \u0026gt; Saves \u0026gt; (what your save is named) \u0026gt; Backups. Delete the persistent.sfs file from the (what your save is named) folder, copy and paste the persistent(date of creation).sfs file from the backup, and rename it to be just persistent.sfs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-25T23:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAutosaves only ever save to the filename \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022. Unnamed quicksaves only ever save to \u0022quicksave.sfs\u0022. If you used either of these names, then it will get overwritten. If you didn\u0027t use these names, it should be completely impossible for your named save to get overwritten, ever. If it does happen, that is a huge bug. If you got the game from steam, you need to verify your downloaded files. If you can reproduce the error, we need lots more info on how you did it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jman66","CreatedById":180763,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-25T23:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice.
