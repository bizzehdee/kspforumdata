The first stage is a pair of SRBs, with sepratrons to push it away when decoupled. Second stage is a pair of liquid tanks with engines, also with sepratrons, and the main stage is a single 3.75 meter stage.\n\nI need the sepratrons because without them, the separated boosters sometimes collide with the ship. But, when I use them, I get the following in the Flight Results\n\nThe amount of damage doesn\u0027t appear to be significant, since I am now getting most of the parts and cost being recovered. But it concerns me when I see that the EnergiaQuad was damaged, since that is the main engine of the main stage.\n\nI also tried stepping the sepratrons down to 50% thrust, but that didn\u0027t help. \n\nIs this inevitable, getting some minor damage like this?\n\nTIA\n\n    [00:00:00]: Liftoff!![00:00:47]: Separation of stage 8 confirmed[00:00:47]: sepMotor1 was damaged by engine exhaust from
