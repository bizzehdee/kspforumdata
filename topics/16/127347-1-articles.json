Without using the cubic strut you have to attach the Oscar-B radially, rotate it and\u00A0connect the Round-8 at the bottom of it.

I still see your point, but mine also still stands. Even in much older versions, there were prettier and more stable ways to attach things without always using the cubic strut - the BZ-52 Radial Attachment Point, for instance, which was designed for that purpose yet always seems to get overlooked :\\\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
