Problem is, I can\u0027t do that. I can\u0027t build an SSTO. I have in fact done it, but only once. I cannot replicate it. The Orion I crew shuttle, a problem. It can make orbit, but it barely has enough fuel to rendezvous with a station so long as it\u0027s under 200km, making it useless to ferry to my million mile high Horizon Station (1.654 million km). I need an SSTO that can reliably orbit and make it to a 250km station around Lathe, and probably some lessons on building one.

It was a U2 design with a large wing span and very little weight. I really didnt think it was going to go full ssto so I didnt have an rcs so getting home was a chore. I do think that intake spamming helps but is not needed, I collect all of my speed at lower altitudes and carry it up with me on a 15* attack angle and switch to rockets after .8 intake air is on the bar. I think that is the biggest hurdle, getting my mind past the needing altitude all of the time, it is about orbital speed. With FAR it makes it very easy and you can get a moon intercept at 30k on kerbin and just hold the throttle full until you get to the end of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T05:38:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso, 15* AoT slowly gets you out of atmosphere, max efficiency.
