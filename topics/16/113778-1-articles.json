My recommendation is to start a new game, but play differently.\n\nAdd some mods, like Construction Time, station science, or one of the contract mods, and make it a goal to NOT grind science. You\u0027ll find that the game plays very differently, and you\u0027ll probably enjoy it a whole lot more."},{"CreatedByName":"ikehaiku","CreatedById":74589,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T08:58:23Z","Content":"In addition, if you go the \u0022start a new career\u0022 game, you also can change the difficulty settings.\n\nI personnaly find the hard settings maybe just a little bit too grindy, so maybe you can try either a \u0022stock\u0022 hard career, or fiddle with the difficulty sliders to your liking."},{"CreatedByName":"Falkenherz","CreatedById":141969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T11:23:54Z","Content":"I agree, playing without grinding for science adds to the experience. I am still stuck with Mk2 parts and focus on completing missions as efficiently as possible; much slower pacing, lots of more challenge. \n\nAt some point I might want to add that big colonization mod, life support mod, scansat, remotetech, in order to make the experience more challenging by simulating even more realism."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T11:38:00Z","Content":"Eh, science is an endless currency for a limited things that can be purchased by it.

Would be nice if that can be used to train pilots or to \u0022locate\u0022 (spawn customized) asteroids around the system, or to reduce random failure chance if we are adding that (think of science as development and testing time, the more you put in, the less risk)"},{"CreatedByName":"Unheld","CreatedById":74707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T12:53:40Z","Content":"Would it be possible to make a mod that adds a \u0022future technology\u0022 node into the techtree which doesn\u0027t do anything apart from being unlockable multiple times?\n\nSomething like the last Tech from the Civilization-games?\n\nLike in Civ, each time you unlock it, it counts up (Future I, Future II...) and gets more expensive...\n\nSo you had something to spend your science on and although absolutely useless you get at least a sense of accomplishement for unlocking it everytime.\n\nShould I post that idea in the \u0022suggestion\u0022 - subforum?"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaia","CreatedById":95282,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T13:15:59Z","Content":"Some repeatable upgrade-tech would be nice, these would give a bonus to engines, solar panels, tanks, etc"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T13:18:43Z","Content":"KSPI needs tons of science to unlock all nodes \u002B you can spend it for upgrades."},{"CreatedByName":"NASAHireMe","CreatedById":131205,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:57:11Z","Content":"Here\u0027s [a thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109490-Potential-Uses-for-Extra-Science-Points) on the topic.
