It occurs only where the rims procedural craters intersect. At such places, there is a weak anti-gravity force on the outside of the crater rims that will pull rovers uphill to the rim crest. The direction of the force is along the line across the conjoined craters to where their rims intersect on the other side. Rovers can drive downhill against this force but if they stop and don\u0027t set the parking brake, after a few seconds they\u0027ll start rolling uphill and accelerating. Doesn\u0027t affect landers, EVA Kerbals, or flags, only wheeled vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy boffins have been studying this effect since it was 1st discovered but haven\u0027t found either a use or an explanation for it. Sadly, if you let nature take it\u0027s course, the rover does NOT keep on going up into space, but just goes down the other side into the crater basin normally. Still, it appears to be a type of zero-point energy that might be exploited someday for a type of portable generator \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Buckminster","CreatedById":76961,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T18:20:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERandom question - what mode are you driving in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had read this tip somewhere, and it made all the difference in the world. When driving a rover, switch to \u0022docking mode\u0022 and use the linear controls. If you are trying to drive in the standard mode you are also acting on the pitch, yaw and roll of your craft as well as the wheels, and it makes it a lot easier to accidentally flip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
