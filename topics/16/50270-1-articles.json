For example, I put a \u0022Rockomax BACC Solid Fuel Booster\u0022 as part of my rocket\u0027s body. I needed more lift so I attached 6 more around the first one. I assumed that because it turned green and allowed me to place the part that it was attached properly.

My case is probably a bit more complicated (it\u0027s an enormous rocket), but with you its probably that you have either staged incorrectly (pay attention to the order of the staging list on the right side in the VAB) or your machine is too big to hold together without struts. If you are in career mode, stick to smaller rockets until you unlock struts, then use struts to hold everything together.

In career mode you don\u0027t have access to much, so everything looks like a derp stick (That\u0027s what I aptly name my rockets). I unlocked the radial decouplers and those Rockomax BACC Solid Fuel Booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I tried upgrading my current derp stick to waste less fuel on launch, so figured those solid fuel boosters would be perfect. I add a new stage to the bottom of the rocket and put some radial decouplers around the outside. The next step is attaching the solid fuel boosters to them. I fiddle with the placement over the radials until they turn green. At that point I assume they are placed correctly. I move the camera around and they do seem to be placed on the radial (the radial face does seem to clip into things sometimes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen in launch things can go two ways. Either the tanks just fall over and explode or the ship launches and when I activate the radials I see the parts fly off, but the tanks stay attached some other part of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a bump when the rocket is loaded that doesn\u0027t seem to help either lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T21:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay - here\u0027s what you need to do. In the VAB, take the part that you want to stick on the 38K and just kinda attach it radially to whatever the 38K is attached to. Don\u0027t attach it to the 38K itself; not at first anyway - just get it to stick somewhere. Once it clicks in place, pick it up again and try to put it over the 38K; if it\u0027s going to work, it should look slightly further out from where it was when you attached it originally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an old problem with radial decouplers in general. Bit easier to catch with the TT-70 (which is why I pretty much use it exclusively, except for the occasional Hydraulic Detachment Manifold on the end of a Girder; I hate the 38K); your pieces are in fact not sitting on top of the decoupler. So when you hit the decoupler, the tanks stay attached and if you\u0027re lucky you\u0027ll see the decouplers come flying out the back end of your ship. Happened to me the other day with what was supposed to be a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnshot; wound up being an abort to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you should watch is your gee meter as you ascend. If it gets out of the green zone, you\u0027ve got an enhanced risk of pancaking your stack. All that thrust you had at launch you really don\u0027t need by the time you\u0027re 30,000m up. Throttle back down into the green and see if that helps a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, struts REALLY are your friend. If you\u0027ve got a rocket that\u0027s failing in the same spot over and over again, MOAR STRUTS is the advice you\u0027re going to get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing - when you build your rocket in the VAB, stick the bottom stage engine nozzles into the ground. No, seriously; the game will adjust your rocket so that they\u0027re above the pad when it gets out there. If you still have crap falling off after you\u0027ve strutted everything, add some TT18-As (ground clamps) and see if that helps matters.

It\u0027s not so bad in a single stack, but if you branch out at all, the side torque of the lifting is going to shear away at your designs and ensuing explosions usually occur.

If a firing engine becomes separated, it has none of the weight it was once carrying and will now travel faster than your ship coming up from behind and try to sneak in your back door. Again with this ensuing explosions tending to occur. Best to wait a second after it shuts down to stage than to try and stage at the exact moment the fuel expires.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe higher up your core ship the expended engines are, the farther away from the core of the ship they will need to be.
