They\u0027re great and fun to use, but I want to deploy them without right-clicking on my kerbal. So I took to the code. I searched the landing gear, lights, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E-related parts and couldn\u0027t find anything related to action groups. So how do you set them? I know it\u0027s possible to assign action groups and staging to kerbals, just get in an EVA seat. I know next to nothing about this stuff, so a video tutorial would probably help the most but I\u0027ll take any help I can get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-09T20:25:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2018 08:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Fireheart318\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-09T20:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the parachutes press P, for the action groups thing no idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-11T22:07:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread moved to Gameplay Questions, since it\u0027s seeking help rather than offering it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
