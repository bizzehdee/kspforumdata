So... if you may, i would appreciate clean sentences and very detailed, but keep in mind that i am not good at Math, nor at Kerbal. So, i thought to me misself, would it be possible to achieve a Stable Orbit with the plane model i\u0027m using? Im gonna put it down there so you can take a look, if you need any extra info, just say something down there. And pleaaaase, don\u0027t go saying: \u0027Ah! To achieve Orbit you need to calculate the vector of x, after multiply 4 by 475.\u0027 or something like that, i\u0027m not good at Math, has i previously said.

You should have your engine on, and very slowly turn, so that at about 30,000 m, you are fully horizontal. Your vertical speed should carry you up to around 40,000m. Build up your speed to around 2300 m/s, and then shut of your engines. You should, if done correctly, be in an orbit. A lot of the time, with some of my more \u0027experimental\u0027 (BOOSTERS AND EXPLOSIONS. EVERYWHERE.) designs, I tend to cheat a bit and instead of speeding up or slowing down at apogee/perigee, I just face directly up or down and blast off until I am at the desired hieght, or until my vertical speed is zero. It makes for quick, stable, and surprisingly, circular, orbits if you do it right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedShootLeo","CreatedById":48,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-08T16:12:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the quick awnser guys! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Ohh... and... by the way, yesterday, i was trying something i, myself, think it\u0027s pretty mutch impossible.
