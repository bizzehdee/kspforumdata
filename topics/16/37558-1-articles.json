I am not using any stock crafts because I want to get a feel for which designs work and which don\u0027t by myself. Anyways, I designed a fairly standard airplane: MK1 and Mk 2 fuselage, 3 Turbojet engines (one center, two attached directly left and right of the fuselage) with a delta wing shape and canards. In order to get into space, I have 2 aerospike engines each with it\u0027s own tank (the tank that is the same size as the MK 1 jet fuselage plus one Oscar \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E, situated in the middle of the delta wing. Tons of intakes (about 14.0 air intake max, though I never reach that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter many tries, I can now get the plane to about 23 km altitude with a surface velocity above 900m/s. At this point, I have to essentially point the nose downward with all my might (or rather, the SAS does) to keep the airplane from just flying straight upwards and then start flipping. My angle will usually be at about 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at this point (I go up almost vertically after liftoff, and after reaching 10KM point the nose downward to pick up speed). At this point, I usually am below 0.20 air intake, and as the intake drops below 0.05, I cut the engines to prevent uncontrolled flameout (that is, I shutdown all 3 engines via action group, took me a while to figure out that you could do that). Then start up the rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then it happens: My nose pulls up and no amount of counter-steering helps, leading the plane into a backflip and eventually uncontrollable spin. Sometimes I manage to get it back under control, but at that point I have burned too much fuel to get into orbit. My center of mass upon take-off is just slightly in front of the center of lift, and the center of thrust is in the middle of the plane, as near as I can tell. Basically, all planes I designed so far have this problem: They fly very well up to altitude, but at about their max altitude, they start backflipping. I tried going slower, but while that sometimes prevented backflipping, it also made me fall slightly. Then I tried going faster, which seems to keep the plane controllable for longer, but fails as soon as switch to rocket power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone on the forum noted that this might be caused by the CoG drifting backwards as the tanks empty. That sounds reasonable, as the tanks empty from front to rear. I have no idea what to do to counteract that though.

That fixed a lot of problems, as the plane now takes longer to build up speed, but is much more stable and has a better intake/engine ratio.
