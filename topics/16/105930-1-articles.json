It\u0027s not always possible, especially if you\u0027re playing career and you haven\u0027t gotten very far into the tech tree. Boosters should only be used to get you off the launchpad and moving in the right direction.\n\nLast but not least, when building rockets, design darts. Top heavy is good. You really **want** your CoM well in front of your CoL. This actually makes your rocket **more** stable. \n\n![rktstab.gif](http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/Images/rktstab.gif)"}]}
