The engine module (at the front; it\u0027s a pull design rather than a push design) has 16 atomic engines and each fuel module has four large Kerbodyne rocket fuel tanks, assembled in orbit with large docking clamps because it\u0027s (in my opinion) way too heavy to launch the whole thing at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClose-up of fuel module:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-t8mKkEzxxgw/VMWtNXSdu_I/AAAAAAAABUk/epaIDAadGi4/s800/screenshot147.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot147.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the fully assembled tanker:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-E6LMa670mwc/VMWtYp36-nI/AAAAAAAABUs/fp2fUSUb9KE/s800/screenshot135.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot135.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe general design of each fuel module\u0027s central spindle is like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[dock] [sAS wheel]* [adapter] [girder] [batteries] [probe core]** [monoprop tank] [girder] [adapter] [sAS wheel]* [dock]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* radially linked to each SAS wheel: 4 fuel feed lines; from the aft wheel to the tanks and from the tanks to the fore wheel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** radially attached to the probe core: 4 RTGs, at the end of each of which is a cubic octagonal strut, attached to which is a large Kerbodyne fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intention here is for fuel to drain from the aft-most tanks first, so that when they are empty I can detach and abandon that module and the remaining modules will still be full of fuel. I assumed that the arrangement of fuel feed lines would mean that the engine module would try to drain fuel from fuel module #1, which would in turn drain fuel from fuel module #2, which would in turn drain fuel from fuel module #3; thus only fuel module #3 would actually lose fuel. I used girders as structural elements because they disallow fuel crossfeed, which I assumed meant that fuel could only flow through the fuel lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESO HERE\u0027S THE PROBLEM:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel isn\u0027t draining only from module #3 as I had intended. However, it\u0027s also not draining evenly from everything! It\u0027s draining evenly from all four tanks of module #3, and from THREE of the four tanks in each of modules #1 and #2! Any idea why this might be, or what I could do in the design phase to make it work like I want it to? At the moment I\u0027m coping by manually transferring fuel out of the aft-most module whenever the total fuel load is low enough to make a difference, but it\u0027d be nice to avoid that next time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Baron_von_Fluffy","CreatedById":52776,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T05:40:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know why it would cause this but one easy solution to avoid transferring fuel would be to disable resource transfer for them. Tedious but better than transferring fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: (unless, ofcourse, it starts draining lopsidedly even like that - docking port bug maybe? you could try and bypass that with kerbal attachment system\u0027s fuel pipes)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T05:42:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no center tank, is there? Try adding a small central tank, to be fed by the four outer tanks, and see if it makes a difference.
