You\u0027d be landing with parachutes, so very little of the lander\u0027s mass is dedicated strictly to the landing. The only mass that is really disposable is the landing gear, parachutes, and perhaps some science experiments. Since most of what you\u0027re landing is needed for the ascent, then two-stages is rather pointless.

If you use the smallest decoupler (15kg), then the fuel used to get the decoupler to the Mun is 57kg, straight from the ideal rocket equation.
