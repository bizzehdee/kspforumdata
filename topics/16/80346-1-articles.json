I ended the contract thinking that he would die as a result, and because I have TAC life support installed, he will eventually if I take no further action. I decided the merciful course of action was to try to have him burn up in the atmosphere, but this also failed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as Johnzer Kerman is merely teetering on the brink of death (and also because I have another Kerbal to rescue if this mission fails), I\u0027d like to try to rescue him again. I\u0027m not even sure if I have a chance of getting to him in time (since I have been to the moon and back since then), but I have since researched RCS (though I do not know if this is going to be enough). The grabber is also potentially within my reach at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to know how you might approach this situation.
