Let me start out by saying how much I love this community and how addicted I am to this game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve had it about two days, so I\u0027m still mainly working with satellites and trying to figure out intercept trajectories and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve gotten a few permanent(ish) satellites around Kerbin, and one good one around the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E These are really small, symmetrical satellites that I just mounted on the to of my rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So onto the problem,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to get a larger satellite to Minmus (or beyond) so I built a really sweet satellite that I\u0027m really attached too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E it has all the science stuff (I know it\u0027s useless but you gotta have principles) ave lights and stuff, a little heavy but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also it is asymmetrical as hell. I\u0027d really like it to stay that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have it mounted in a large fairing assembly, with fairly large rockets (though I\u0027ve tried about six redesigns by now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E EVERY EFFIN TIME I get to around 3000 meters it noses down super hard resulting in an unrecoverable death spin screw up. I\u0027ve tried covering it in rcs and sas equipment to no avail. Also tried to ballast out the satellite as much as I can without being absolutely matching symmetry-wise. Everything else is symmetrical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Please help! it\u0027s so frustrating! Is this just bad rocket design? Or should I give up on asymmetrical things? I just get this bad-a satellite into some far away orbit! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E running kw mod and some parts mods.

Seemed to be that the asymmetry (really the amount and weight of asymmetry in relation to my launch vehicle) was the problem. Bigger rockets, more sas, smaller satellites, less asymmetry seems to \u0022work\u0022 but is also a headache.

This reduces the effect of the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA more extreme (and less efficient) way is to attach a small rocket engine, like a 77, at one end of the rocket that points its thrust in the direction that the rocket tends to yaw. So if your rocket is too heavy on the right, have the rocket exhaust at the top pointing to the right (or bottom pointing left). Then put this little rocket in an action group. As you ascend, use the action group to turn this little engine on and off as needed to keep yourself flying straight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
