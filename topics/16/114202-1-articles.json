The only thing is my space plane does not accelerate like his in the video and at a 30 deg incline my plane is lucky to get over 160 m/s and will actually stall out well before I get up to 10k meters in altitude. I\u0027m lucky to get 5k meters. Has there been a change that is causing this? I\u0027m just baffled on what\u0027s wrong. \nAny suggestions or insight?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T17:39:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 05:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rollo1002**"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T04:00:20Z","Content":"I\u0027m not certain, but I do agree that there\u0027s been tweaks to the jet engines. Nevertheless, I was quite capable of getting the design from that video into orbit, if not precisely on that flight path.\n\nA couple pointers:\n\n- Make sure you\u0027re using the Whiplash turbojets and not the Wheesleys.\n- My quickie copy made it with a 10 degree ascent instead of the 30 degrees he made. Fine-tuning might\u0027ve let me pull up harder, but the slower ascent was fine for a quick test.\n- Watch your balance - that bit where he disables fuel flow in the front-most tank is not something you can ignore."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T07:25:57Z","Content":"Also, I didn\u0027t see what version Scott is using, but jet engines were adjusted again in v1.0.3 (reduced thrust) to offset some of the changes with drag. So it\u0027s possible that you aren\u0027t maintaining a high enough speed on the climb to keep the engines spooled up. If you maintain a slow speed while climbing (such as 160m/s), the engines will provide less and less thrust as you climb. So eventually you will reach a point where the engines can\u0027t provide enough thrust to even maintain altitude.\n\nAs DeMatt suggests, climb out a little shallower to keep your speed up. Higher speeds will translate to more thrust, which is essential as you start climbing up (where the low thrust and high AoA makes it even harder to speed up).\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"rollo1002","CreatedById":145192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T17:34:04Z","Content":"Thanks for the responses. I\u0027m going to assume that he was on 1.0.1 or 1.0.2 because the video was released in early June which would fit that timeline."}]}
