It comes across a nice location where I want them to land in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn mission 2 another station was brought to Minmus, again around 7000m height (blue orbit). Getting to Minmus is not a challenge anymore, but I ended up in a random plane because I\\\u0027m not able to plan in great detail yet. So now I\\\u0027m wondering how I could align the orbit of the blue station so that it matches the same orbit as the grey station ? I will probably need to do this maneuver again in the future when I bring in my landers and they get random orbits too at first. I tried burning in several directions already, but I don\\\u0027t see the inclination changing, I just make my orbit bigger or smaller. So when do I need to burn and in what direction ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.quwi.com/_stuff/screenshot5b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot5b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rasheed","CreatedById":29903,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T21:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust burn sideways between the pro-grade and retro-grade markers on your nav-ball, simple as that...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T22:11:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are at the point where the orbits intersect, burn 90 degrees out of plane until they match.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T22:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo know which 90 to burn towards, the direction you are facing is where the half you are orbiting towards will move.
