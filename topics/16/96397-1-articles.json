Also are you using FAR/NEAR? You should be able to build launchers that can lift payloads of 40 tonnes relatively easily using 2.5m (rockomax) parts in stock. With FAR/NEAR you might need to use the 3.75m parts instead (edit: because you typically build thinner rockets), but it should be doable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally you can actually build quite complex stations by launching components less than 8 tonnes each \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (launch fuel tanks empty).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-11T20:17:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2015 08:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by armagheddonsgw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T20:05:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave a look at the launch-vehicles in the last chapters (7 and 8) of the tutorial in my signature (stats in the text are for KSP 0.25 but the ships still work as advertised).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA single mainsail can SSTO 11t, a KR-2L 25t.
