It seems to be a difficult task to build a mk3 sub though, since it needs a lot of electricity and SAS to stay upright if you did it the way I did, and SAS and batteries make it float. One time I did get it to sink, but not all of it:\n\n![omG9HJB.png](http://i.imgur.com/omG9HJB.png)\n\nOr it stays upright but just won\u0027t sink:\n\n![jT5vply.png](http://i.imgur.com/jT5vply.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T19:08:34Z","Content":"I discovered this thing actually by obliterating a ship withmk3 fuel tanks and the fuel tanks sank and the plates floated."},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T19:11:48Z","Content":"We have discovered that the only part that sinks is mk3 rocket fuel fuselages.
