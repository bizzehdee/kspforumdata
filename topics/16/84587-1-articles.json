My question is about those insets on the front of the cockpit circled in red. What are those insets for? An intake of some kind? A reaction thruster/RCS port like those on the front of the space shuttle? Just eye candy to make the low poly model pop?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the grey ports just to the left on the side below the cockpit circled in blue, I\u0027m guessing those are either hand/foot holds or more random eye candy panels? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1vJTYL9.png?1\u0022 alt=\u00221vJTYL9.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-14T15:33:57Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2014 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by esinohio\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T15:12:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe gray ones are a integrated ladder, you can get the kerbal to climb them, and you can mount an retractable ladder below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe black are just decoration, as in they would probably have an mission on a real plane, air intakes for cockpit air and cooling of equipment probably.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T15:14:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs above - but I would point out that the cockpit models are being redone for 0.25 so unless you\u0027re really just messsing around for fun it might not be worth putting a lot of effort into them as they are.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"esinohio","CreatedById":57681,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T15:33:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh I\u0027m just having some fun in Blender doing Hi-Poly models for the hell of it and needed some clarification on those individual pieces up there.
