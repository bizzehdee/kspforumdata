I\u00A0can build a plane that has a really good balance of center of mass and center of lift both with full fuel and no fuel, I can get to orbit, I can get to duna even with a 250 ton Mark 3 cargo plane that needs to orbit kerbin 3 times to even get out of its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and over to duna. And I can also land on kerbin. However, I CAN\u0027T land on Duna. There\u0027s just no way, and it feels like I never will. I can\u0027t even control the plane anywhere near duna. All the way from kerbin over to duna is completely fine, takes a bit of time to turn the giant ass plane sure, but near Duna its impossible. The problems start when i get around like 50k or something around there. From that point on I just can\u0027t turn the plane around in less than a really long time, and once I start turning I just keep turning the same way forever, I can\u0027t stop it. And once I reach 30k in the atmosphere the plane just goes wild and starts spinning everywhere uncontrollably. I\u0027ve watched every tutorial I could find, even videos that aren\u0027t tutorials just to see what they are doing, I\u0027ve downloaded countless of Duna planes just to cheat them over to duna and try to land, I\u0027ve tried with full fuel, no fuel, some fuel here and there, balance things out, but same thing every time. Spin spin spin forever. I\u0027m at a loss of words and action, I\u0027ve got no clue what to do. I\u0027ve never been more angry at a game than right now. Sure the 2 first days I played was a bit hard and I managed to land on the Mun and Minmus, rendezvous and even dock fairly easily, but this is just (excuse my profanity) dumb. This community has been very welcoming and helpful since the day I made my account, so anybody, please teach me the ways of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s I beg you ;-;\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, TLDR; How the frick do you land a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E on Duna. I must be missing something. Do I need a ton of reaction wheels and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters everywhere? Or is it my angle of approach that is wrong, idk. Someone please help me. I refuse to send a rocket there, once I saw all these crazy \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E videos on youtube I fell in love with the game for the second time and I probably won\u0027t use a rocket again, unless I have to.

And I can also land on kerbin. However, I CAN\u0027T land on Duna. There\u0027s just no way, and it feels like I never will. I can\u0027t even control the plane anywhere near duna. All the way from kerbin over to duna is completely fine, takes a bit of time to turn the giant ass plane sure, but near Duna its impossible. The problems start when i get around like 50k or something around there. From that point on I just can\u0027t turn the plane around in less than a really long time, and once I start turning I just keep turning the same way forever, I can\u0027t stop it. And once I reach 30k in the atmosphere the plane just goes wild and starts spinning everywhere uncontrollably. I\u0027ve watched every tutorial I could find, even videos that aren\u0027t tutorials just to see what they are doing, I\u0027ve downloaded countless of Duna planes just to cheat them over to duna and try to land, I\u0027ve tried with full fuel, no fuel, some fuel here and there, balance things out, but same thing every time. Spin spin spin forever. I\u0027m at a loss of words and action, I\u0027ve got no clue what to do. I\u0027ve never been more angry at a game than right now. Sure the 2 first days I played was a bit hard and I managed to land on the Mun and Minmus, rendezvous and even dock fairly easily, but this is just (excuse my profanity) dumb.

need to employ at least two of the following methods.\u00A0 \u00A0Three is better,\u00A0 and all four is best of all\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMOAR WING\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere means landing speeds are just over double what they are on Kerbin, despite the low gravity.\u00A0 \u00A0Your spaceplane needs to be able to land on Kerbin at less than 35m/s even if you\u0027re using brake chutes and lift thrusters.\u00A0 \u00A0I did have a super STOL \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E that had very strong landing gear and a stall speed of 20 m/s on Kerbin that was able to set down down on Duna without using thrusters or parachutes,\u00A0 but 30-35 is a more realistic goal.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Note,\u00A0 the extra wing area can make it harder to milk top speed out of your air breathing engines, because it will generate so much lift it wants to zoom to such high altitudes they can\u0027t produce thrust, before the jet engines hit their design top speed.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0OTOH,\u00A0 \u00A0those extra wings make good fuel tanks for NERV engines and will give a really high lift/drag ratio in the upper atmosphere once the jets quit.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 So,\u00A0 \u00A0spam big S wing parts, don\u0027t use any fuselage liquid fuel tanks, keep all your fuel in the massive wings.\u00A0 \u00A0The only oxidizer you bring should be for the Vernor
