The savegame says that when that tech node was unlocked, it had the Wheesley engine in it (and that is correct).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- However, you still do not have access to the Wheesley, because you are now playing a different version of the game, and you need a different tech node as a prerequisite for it, which you do not yet have.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSolution: unlock the tech node that [I]now[/I], in the new version, actually does have the Wheesley in it.
