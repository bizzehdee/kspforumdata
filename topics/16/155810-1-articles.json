I messed around in stock and then shelved it because I need my mods. Anyways I\u0027m attempting to set up a basic relay network in Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, I want to be able to see behind the Mun essentially, and put an equatorial satellite there. My relay satellites are at highly elliptical polar orbits, roughly 78Mm \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E. They each have an HG-5. Those connect to the ground just fine. However the attempts at a satellite around the Mun leave me blind when I\u0027m passing over the far side. I\u0027ve\u00A0had them equipped with HG-5s and 3 Communotron 16s, and I can\u0027t get the connection. There is a clear line of sight no doubt about that. Am I missing something? They all should be well within their respective ranges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-31T00:53:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222939669\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155810\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221485822618\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022147118\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkippydaHippie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, SkippydaHippie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n78Mm \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure HG-5 and Comm16 can talk to each other at this distance?

Max range between two antennas - assuming you only have one on the craft in each end - is the square root of the product of their ratings (in other words, sqrt(rating_a * rating_b)).
