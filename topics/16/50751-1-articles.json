Also, unless you are launching you\u0027re entire craft into space without staging anything, you\u0027re loosing a bunch of parts and once they pass the render threshold of 2.3km they don\u0027t have physics loaded anymore so the game will run more smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T17:55:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat theory isn\u0027t consistent with what we see: when you load a ship in the VAB, it fails to load properly if it has 1800 parts or more, whereas it does load properly with 1500 parts or fewer (and somewhere in between we get problems). So under your theory, there\u0027s a 3600-part limit internally. However, when you work on a moderate-sized ship in the VAB, you don\u0027t get it bugging out after adding/removing parts four times to a 900-part ship, as your theory would predict; instead, you can work arbitrarily long on that 900-part ship, even though you can undo repeatedly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaveofDefeat","CreatedById":58539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T18:32:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E7km high ship lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1286.photobucket.com/user/DaveofDefeat/media/2013-10-12_00001_zpsb095ea18.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1286.photobucket.com/albums/a610/DaveofDefeat/2013-10-12_00001_zpsb095ea18.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-10-12_00001_zpsb095ea18.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
