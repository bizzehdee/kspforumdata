At first, it was just a station core with a habitation module and some big solar panels. Now that I have added a fuel can extension and an extension off to one side with another core to make docking for vessels easier, my station\u0027s apoapsis and periapsis are constantly \u0022wobbling/fluttering/etc.\u0022 When viewed from the tracking center, I don\u0027t see this odd back and forth on the orbit, but when approached by another vessel or controlled directly, the station always have this. Is there any reason for this or way to correct it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T08:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your orbit is nearly circular, that\u0027s normal. It\u0027s from rounding errors because the apoapsis and periapsis are too close. Try raising or lowering your apoapsis or periapsis to make the orbit non-circular.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
