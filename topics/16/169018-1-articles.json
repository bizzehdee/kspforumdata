That\u0027s three separate designs now, so I have no idea what\u0027s wrong, and in fact I can\u0027t see much in common between them. They all have the exact same problem though. On the runway, during takeoff roll, a particular speed comes when the aircraft starts leering of the center of the runway. It should be noted that I am using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E and I\u0027m not really an expert with plane design, even though i enjoy it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight coming back to the case, I present to you most recent of these troublesome designs. It is in no way a spaceplane, as one can see by its engine. Hence it was designed with low-speed, low-altitude performance in mind. However, the runawy sideslip is fatal on takeoff, the plane ususally rips off a wingtip, rotates around it and comes to stop, sliding backwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/zPpRW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/zPpRW\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XEBpDR2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/XEBpDR2.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\nI have checked all landing gears, they are straight.

It\u0027s important to understand that not all problems with airplanes are aerodynamic ones! Sometimes, they are \u0022automotive\u0022 problems, instead. Sometimes you can overcome automotive problems by adding extra aerodynamic control, but there are other ways. If you were to remove all the aerodynamic surfaces from this vessel\u00A0and then roll it down the runway, you would most likely see the same problem -- or maybe even worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo: ground drag. Basically you want to consider this vessel as a rover, and not as a plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStability comes from having\u00A0 low drag ahead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, and high drag behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. The design you show above has 2 gear ahead, and one behind. The one behind may be off the ground by the time you see your issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in this case, the problem is that the gear that are ahead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E have \u0022too much\u0022 drag, and they are so far ahead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E that the torque from that drag is enough to spin your plane.

I have made tests and made sure that the tail wheel is well on the ground when the swerve occurs. Since it\u0027s a prop plane, I was even wondering if proppeler inertia is simulated, since the plane always swerves left. However, the other design mentioned was a jet with tricycle gear and had the exact same issue.
