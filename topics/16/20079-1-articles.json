You might have 20 SRBs strapped to the side of your interplanetary craft, and you think, \u0022surely, this will get me off of Eve\u0022. Not so fast though! Do you really want to fire all of those off at once just to get dragged down by the thick atmosphere? The faster you try to go through thick atmosphere, the more it\u0027ll just slow you down. You\u0027re wasting your Delta-V by trying to gain as much speed as possible early on. Now, how to actually do it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of firing all 20 SRBs at once, you should instead fire a few; enough to lift you off the ground and accelerate you a little bit, but not waste all of your thrust at once. Ok, now you\u0027re thinking: \u0022but I have all this extra weight that\u0027s dragging me down now, surely that\u0027s not efficient at all\u0022! Nope, not true. Take, for example, this simple craft here I use to get into low Kerbin orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[spoiler=]\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rj0Pp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rj0Pp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Keep in mind, I\u0027m not using the upper stage at all in the tests I ran. Let\u0027s just call it our \u0022interplanetary return stage\u0022 analog.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFiring all of the SRBs and the main engine at once (max acceleration mode) results in a straight-up Apoapsis of ONLY 48.8 km. The same craft only firing the SRBs and waiting to fire the main engine until after the SRBs are spent (yes, the engine is just dead weight while the SRBs are firing), can reach 112.7 km straight up, quite an improvement! Finally, in my last test, I only fired two of the four SRBs at once, then ejected them and fired the remaining two, and once those went, the main engine; this resulted in a whopping 148 km straight up! Even though it\u0027s slower off the launch pad, and slower when the main engine finally fires, it\u0027s at a higher altitude and a thinner atmosphere when it fires, and thus doesn\u0027t have to fight nearly as much atmosphere or gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, my final conclusion, is that in order to get off of Eve with a craft that can even remotely get into Kerbin orbit, you will need to slowly but surely use your rocket\u0027s energy and wait until you\u0027re at a higher altitude to expend most of your fuel, and thus should be able to get into low Eve orbit to either return home, or wait for a rescue craft.

If you used mechjeb\u0027s autopilot for launching you\u0027ll have noticed that when you get it to auto throttle it will actually restrict your velocity sometimes, this is because it picks the most efficient speed, i.e. reduces the amount of drag as much as possible while not spending so long in higher gravity. Not sure about values for the new planets, but on Kerbin it\u0027s best to stay under 250m/s in the bottom 8kms or so and then only go full throttle when you\u0027re over 25km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nadrek","CreatedById":25326,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T02:12:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPurely from observation, I think Mechjeb perhaps tries to lower your thrust whenever your drag losses exceed your gravity losses; i.e. don\u0027t lose more to drag than you do to gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome other forum users have stated that Mechjeb ascent autopilot defaults are not the most efficient way to get to Kerbin orbit, however. I have yet to do serious testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the OP goes, yes, balancing increased drag vs. more staging is critical. For those who prefer LFE\u0027s to SRB\u0027s, make sure your fuel always goes from outer (i.e. early dropped, higher number) stages to inner (i.e. late dropped, lower number) stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
