But I i\u0027m having trobule using them to destroy the spacecenter buildings, even though it seems so easy when you\u0027re not trying.\n\nI was just about to start some scientific tests to see how much energy is needed, but I would be great I someone knew off the top of there head what the \u0027magic number\u0027 was.\n\nThanks\n\nFlying Beaver ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T02:29:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 02:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flying Beaver**"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T12:04:47Z","Content":"I\u0027m not sure... It could be about 50 kN, from what I\u0027ve seen and done. Probably more.\n\nBTW Howitzers are anti-infantry.

Then I\u0027d test the physics model by trying to scale different masses to different altitudes--I don\u0027t think we don\u0027t know for sure whether explodyness is based on just mass, just velocity, momentum (mv) or kinetic energy (mv2)."},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T12:56:16Z","Content":"It seems to be that weight is a much bigger factor than speed; you can have 200 ton VTOL/Rocket land on the VAB at 0.5m/s and destroy it, yet a 15t plane travelling at 200m/s into it won\u0027t even scratch the paintwork. Also, I think part impact tolerance can make a big difference too, as I have a car made out of structural panels (80m/s Impact Tolerance) that can destroy any building in the KSC by bumping into it once at a mere 2m/s..."}]}
