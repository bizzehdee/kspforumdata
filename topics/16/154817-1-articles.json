I created a rover and drove it around the runway. I then made a plane and merged in the rover. I attached the rover underneath the plane with a radial decoupler. As a test--without even flying--I staged the decoupler and the rover fell to the ground underneath the plane as expected. I used the right bracket to switch to the\u00A0rover but I was unable to move it. If I turned the wheels, they turned. If I accelerated, the \u0022motor\u0022 under the right-click wheel info screen went to the max. It just wouldn\u0027t budge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought the plane might have been in the way--some weird clipping--so I swapped back to the plane, drove it a fair bit forward and switched back to the rover. No luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelp?

When you are trying to control the rover, often the navball will show you if something is going wrong, by pointing in some funny direction.

You will have to turn them before you put them onto the rover! Learn about this by building a much simplified rover and take it for a test-drive. Also, posting a screenshot helps.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPress \u003Cstrong\u003EB\u003C/strong\u003E to toggle the brakes. Normally they are off by default, so it\u0027s unlikely, but easy to check. (Also there is the brake icon at the top of the screen in the middle which will light up if the brakes are applied).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI assume you have batteries and something to generate electricity? I have forgotten batteries in the past, but I believe you cannot use steering either in that case. Without batteries it certainly won\u0027t move, even if you have solar panels and plenty sunshine.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you are unlucky something was clipped while it was still attached to the plane. In that case the wheels may have experienced a sort of Kraken attack. Can we see a screenshot? Sometimes it is a telling sign if the wheels have sunk partially into the surface after you dropped the rover onto the surface. Haven\u0027t experienced that in v1.2 though...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf nothing worked (or if the last point is your problem), the solutionto now involves some de-bottlenecking: First test the rover separately. Then keep the plane, but make a tiny and much simplified rover which is certainly not clipped anywhere. If both tests show no problems, then both the rover and plane have no problems individually. Basically, just start ruling out one thing after the other.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut screenshots always help to get a good answer!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mystik","CreatedById":172088,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-11T17:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222917900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154817\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221484138601\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258254\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Tex_NL said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake sure you have power AND the brakes are off.
