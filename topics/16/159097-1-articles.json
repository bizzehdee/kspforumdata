This leaves part tests, science grinding around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and a full fundraising campaign strategy (25% of reputation going to funds) to pay for building upgrades. Otherwise I\u0027d be using a lot better parts for this craft. As it stands, the only remaining source of decent science is Gilly, and I can\u0027t reach that and get back on 1400 m/s. I didn\u0027t do any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E math really; just tried plotting to Gilly\u0027s orbit needing 1425 or so m/s, and came up short just by 20\u002B m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, I remember someone saying\u00A0that ascending from Eve\u0027s surface to orbit needs a launch profile that goes straight up for a large part of the ascent, then starts the gravity turn very high up. With this craft I find I can start my turn just around 20 km, and also before staging away the last of the Adam engines and going to my first non-EoE; the Swivel, close to 35-40 km. Then some careful throttling and I can get to about 1400 m/s orbit speed\u00A0before staging away the Swivel and going to my Terrier, finally closing my orbit with maybe 2/5th of my fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat would be a better ascent profile for launching into Eve orbit? Where to start turning away from vertical? At what altitude\u00A0and at what speed should I have a pitch of 45 degrees?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you try this craft, note that Eve Space Program\u0027s launch pad is only at 450 m altitude, and I\u0027m using tank priorities and decoupler fuel crossfeed\u00A0to use a\u00A0hybrid\u00A0of onion staging and asparagus staging, so watch the tank levels on ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[Update 15 APR] There\u0027s so much good advice here I can\u0027t mark any one answer as correct.

Since gravity is acting off-prograde, it has the effect of changeing the direction of your velocity as it is integrated WRT time. As your velocity changes direction, drag on the stabilizers creates torque to reorient the craft to prograde. The goal of a gravity turn is to make orbital velocity as you approach 0\u00B0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E so that acceleration due to gravity keeps you traveling in a Kepler orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was saying something a little different, but admittedly not in a very precise way. \u00A0In my experience launching from Eve (testing identical rockets with and without fins), the one without fins dropped much more sharply once I started my pitchover maneuver. \u00A0I think this is aerodynamic in nature; not the phenomenon you\u0027re talking about. \u00A0The same thing happens on Kerbin when you pitch over too sharply with a rocket that has no fins and/or poor control authority; Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere just seems to amplify the effect. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicias","CreatedById":168284,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-14T19:31:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA craft without fins will resist the *start* of the pitchover maneuver. When you pitchover you are turning from prograde which the fins resist. So it takes longer to actually do the pitchover. So for the same control inputs a fin-less rocket might pitch more. Of course, the depends on the details of the two craft. If the fins have control authority, they can help with the pitchover too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Fecyk","CreatedById":157121,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-15T02:27:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK I\u0027m uploading a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5OjLk5feag\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Evideo\u003C/a\u003E showing the craft I\u0027m trying to launch.
