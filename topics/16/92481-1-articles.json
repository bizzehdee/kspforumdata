This means the nose gear could be turned ever so slightly left or right which is causing your issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other problem is your main gear, the ones on your wings are probably to far back away from the point of rotation on the aircraft. This is a common problem, the easiest fix is to bump those main gear a bit further forward near the CoM marker. The nose gear you should move back to a more flat area near the nose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso check to see if your craft is getting some wing flex on take off that is causing your landing gear to change camber.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voculus","CreatedById":85437,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T19:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre your rear wheels too far behind the CoM?

The lift from the high speed will start to raise the rear of the plane and the majority of the weight will remain on the single front wheel. Commonly known as wheelbarrowing. Your plane will start to fall over wither to the left or right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMove the rear wheels forward to just behind the CoM to make it easier to lift the nose at lower speed.
