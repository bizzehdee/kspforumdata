With 7 asparagus stacks the first two to be jettisoned feed fuel to the next two, which feed to the next (penultimate drop) two, which feed to the core. Thus the fuel runs through all of them to the core and the outside ones are emptied and jettisoned quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no point in carrying multiple communitrons as they are resusable. Similarly, if you have large batteries than the z-100 they will mass the same for a given capacity but incur lower drag. On the other hand, if you have solar panels just one fixed one and a battery will be all you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just going to build what I think you mean to see how it goes ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: Yes, it\u0027s a pig isn\u0027t it! It behaved well during the ascent but once it was drifting engine-off to the cicularisation burn I couldn\u0027t get it lined-up at all, despite leaning on the key for nearly 30 seconds^^. Adding an ASAS unit between (I assume) the SC-9001 and FL-T400 sorts it out nicely. Your design is otherwise sound, a standard ascent using a 10km gravity turn puts it in orbit with over 5km/s deltaV left. It might be a bit over-powered but that\u0027s better than the alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-11T00:03:35Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2014 12:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T23:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry a payload like this which was sent to Eve, Duna, and Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3ShcRQU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223ShcRQU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, one SAS module will be more then enough to control this Career Mode launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eKQOxWV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eKQOxWV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-10T23:58:57Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2014 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T00:41:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed a tendency for my craft with 6-tank asparagus staging to rotate once they drop the first pair of asparagus tanks, might this be similar?
