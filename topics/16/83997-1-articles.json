So to get an intercept you need to get very close. My approach is to get to a high Kerbin orbit - around 30.000km, wait until the approximate launch window give or take a couple of weeks either way and then just eyeball it until I get a little flicker of an intercept. That means I\u0027m in the ballpark. Then I use the Maneuver Node Editor of MechJeb to make very fine adjustments until I get a stable intercept. Any intercept will do. After performing the initial burn, about halfway out I make some small adjustment to get a better intercept (or regain it should it disappear whilst en route - happens often especially with crewed vessels using powerful engines, less so with small probes using low-thrust engines), preferably even a Pe marker. Repeat that as I get closer still.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T01:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDres is actually a lot easier to get to than some of the other destinations like Eeloo or Moho which suffer from a small SOI like Dres but also require lots of delta-v due to the fact that they are farther out and inclined compared to Kerbin\u0027s orbit.
