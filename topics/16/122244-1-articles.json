I gather that\u0027s not a problem in their current incarnation, but I\u0027m unclear on the details: do they not produce heat at all any more, or is the change merely that their heat production has been reduced to where overheat/explosion is not an issue, or what? (For my own RP enjoyment, I get annoyed when heating leads to crew compartments substantially hotter than the inside of a pottery furnace. Even if nothing explodes, per se.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineers are useful for mining. I know they speed up drills, with higher-level engineers having a larger effect. Are there any other aspects to that \u0027increased efficiency\u0027 that I should know? Increased/decreased power usage or heating, for instance? And do they have any effect on ISRU converters, or just drills?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis equipment is also notoriously power-hungry. Are the power-consumption figures in the part description accurate? (i.e., can I use the part descriptions to figure out how much solar/battery I need?)

But the part descriptions can most certainly be sufficiently misleading as to be useless to those who haven\u0027t reverse-engineered the source code--and in that sense, though they are accurate they are nonetheless \u0022wrong\u0022. Using the drill as an example, the part description notes that it produces ore at a max rate of 1.00 units/sec with a max rate of electric consumption of 15 E/sec. That is, no doubt, \u0022accurate\u0022, in the sense that they are values pulled directly from the config file. But by itself it\u0027s ... not helpful. Does the electric usage scale with ore production? IS the actual absolute maximum production 1.00 Ore/sec (and thus assuming a Level 5 Engineer, 100% Ore concentration, and all the Electricity the drill can eat)? Or is that an input to a formula which presumes NO Engineer, and an Engineer improves on that--thereby, in fact, allowing theoretical maximum production to be *considerably* higher than that? If the latter, and a high-level Engineer IS present, so the Ore production actually EXCEEDS 1.00/sec, what happens to Electricity usage? Does it go above 15E/sec correspondingly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I can take those numbers as gospel. Maybe it turns out that I only need to supply 7 E/sec if the best available site only has ~40% Ore concentration. Maybe I\u0027ll find out that a high-level Engineer will allow it to produce Ore WAY faster than that--and suck down Electricity way faster than expected, such that I\u0027d better be prepared to shovel 100 E/sec if I want to take full advantage of that high-level Engineer....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the sort of thing I meant by asking if the power-consumption figures were \u0022accurate\u0022. Can I use those numbers as a GOOD, USEFUL data point for refinery design/sizing? (Using some other types of data from part descriptons: mass and Isp I can use as gospel. Drag coefficient? That was nigh-unto useless prior to V1.0 due to the wonky drag mechanics...and just as it became a useful/necessary parameter with the 1.0 drag redesign, Squad pulled it OFF the part descriptions.

When active it will always consume 15 energy per second regardless of how much ore it is producing. Think of it this way, you are pulling something out of the ground, be it ore, regolith, or bedrock, something is there coming out of the ground and for simplicity they require equal amounts of energy to extract. Regolith and rock is then discarded and you don\u0027t really see it. Now, if you turn the drill off it consumes nothing. Only the probe cores will consume all the time, unless I\u0027m forgetting something.
