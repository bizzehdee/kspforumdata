A low orbit, let\u0027s say 100 km circularized, would enable you to gain much more usable velocity from a smaller amount of propellant due to the oberth effect. However, a higher orbit, let\u0027s say 600 km circularized, would allow you to utilize the maximum amount of time warp, giving you more freedom to wait for a transfer window without utilizing a second craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am wondering, is how much delta v do you then sacrifice in utilizing the higher orbit for a Duna or Jool departure?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-29T01:37:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2013 01:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by footman04\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T01:55:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.

The best timetable for launch is from midnight to dawn for the outer planets and noon to dusk for the inner ones. Just be sure that you shut down the instant you hit escape velocity as an elliptical orbit can be far less efficient for planning the capture burn then a nice circular one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if timed right, you can go from launch to transfer burn all in one step.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T22:15:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour best bet is going for a lower orbit so you use less of your Delta-v on circularizing some silly orbit that will not matter for the majority of your trip.

Time warping isn\u0027t my concern since I have a rover parked at KSC for advancing launch dates, the real reason I go to 200km is that long burns (8 min\u002B) at around 100km tend to dip you into Kerbin atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYMMV and everyone has their favorite way of doing things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
