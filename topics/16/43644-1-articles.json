Problem is, they like to flop around like noodles, and I have a difficult time maneuvering when half of your ship is going right and the other half left. Assuming the two stages don\u0027t break apart. I\u0027ve tried using struts between two cubic octagonal struts and attaching those to the tank, but that doesn\u0027t help a whole lot.

You can stitch each component to the next with 3-4 struts and reinforce between decoupler-engine connections (the engine fairings are entirely cosmetic).
