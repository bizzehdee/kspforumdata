To do this I\u0027m using FAR, spaceplane plus, and some firespitter landing gear. This lets me build some planes without having to go to space first for loads of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is that when my planes get up to speed they veer off/tip and clip a wingtip resulting it rapid unplanned disassembly. I\u0027ve experimented with different configurations but I can\u0027t work out the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a pic of an example plane I think should work fine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qs9gG2f.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qs9gG2f.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt uses firespitter landing gear with skids at the back. The gear is mounted the the top of the fuselage for rigidity and low centre of mass. The tail skids provide some steering ability and give about 10 degrees resting angle of attack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe takeoff run is generally problem free up until about 50m/s where it either tips sideways or rolls a wing into the ground. Trying to use the rudder to correct is ineffective, probably due to it lifting off around then. Roll controls have not much effect. I expect a no input liftoff about 55-65m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking it\u0027s to do with one wheel lifting and the drag from the other wheel spins it around but I can\u0027t work out how to avoid it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible to brute force it off the deck with thrust but then landing is impossible. Even a perfect landing touchdown results in the same result when brakes are applied or even if left to roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be greatly appreciated. This has been causing me problems for ages!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s. I experimented with a canard configuration aswell, although it was not as good to fly. It was able to roll safely at high speeds due to the front gear being held off the ground by the front lifting surfaces, and the centre of mass ahead of the rear gear. It was possible to brake to a stop but it was still very sensitive to misalignment and seemed to be more down to chance whether a wheel would dig in or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heagar","CreatedById":67859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T23:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you described has a simple reason:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the landing gear in front of your plane is at the same heigt or more than your landing gear in the rear, your plane will \u0022dance\u0022 while accelerating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo avoid it, your landing gear in the front must be slightly lower than the rear.
