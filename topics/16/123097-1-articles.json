The speed building stage of aerobic flight leaves you with a horizonal prograde (near Ap). You want to use your wings and cheap thrust at the end of aerobic mode to alter trajectory to ballistic and push time to Ap out far enough that your gravity turn will reach orbital speed. Low TWR designs need a lot of time to accelerate that needed 1.2 km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have RAPIERs, the oxidizer you can store on just the adapter parts can really push that Ap to the future and give the OMS time to finish circularizing (RAPIERs can also give you more aerobic speed in jet mode, but LOX is cheap). An alternative thrust solution is an incorporated (or staged) SRB. SRBs have a ton of thrust for their weight and cost.

The details of your engines and aerodynamics determines your profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe edge of the aerobic flight profile is 1-1.4 km/s depending on engines and aerodynamics. You need to double that for orbital velocity. You need to thrust with prograde to gain that speed. If you thrust above prograde, you are using thrust to fight gravity more than gaining speed (a small AoA is okay because of the nonlinear cosine decay). On the other hand, if you pass Ap before you circularize, prograde now points downwards! The key to efficient anaerobic ascent is to pull your velocity vector up so that you enter a gravity turn that will give you the time to build that orbital velocity by the time you reach Ap (and prograde matches horizon). The lower your anaerobic TWR the more burn time needed to accumulate orbital speed and the steeper your initial ballistic velocity needs to be (time to Ap is a function that is dominated by vertical velocity while suborbital).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI propose a slight adjustment to your flight profile. Accelerate to max jet speed between 16-17 km. Light rockets at 1 km/s (keep jets on to) and pitch up (20-30 degree AoA) to pull your prograde up. As your jets starve, GRADUALLY reduce AoA to 0. Once you do, engage hold prograde and see where you wind up. If you went suborbital, you need a harder pitch-up. If you overshoot, you can relax it a little. You want to keep Whiplash engines to 16-17 km while accelerating. That\u0027s about their optimal power range. 1200 m/s is also fast for them. You want to start pitch-up before they lose their thrust (you need that thrust to aid the trajectory change)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tseitsei","CreatedById":139058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T07:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlshain,\u003Cp\u003E If there is even one person here who is making low TWR spaceplanes, then they are by definition not \u0022broken\u0022, but rather simply more difficult than they were before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And of course, there are several of us who \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E doing this.
