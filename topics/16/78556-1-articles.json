Given enough delta v, you can get just about anywhere by leaving at any time that you like. But the launch windows are calculating when the most efficient time to perform a transfer is. This doesn\u0027t matter much within the Kerbin system, you can usually eyeball going to the Mun and Minmus if you know what you\u0027re doing, but in order to launch yourself on a transfer to another planet, the location of Kerbin in relation to your target, as well as your position in orbit around Kerbin makes a huge difference in efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T01:36:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose are the points in time when things are set up for the lowest delta-v requirements for direct transfers ... they may have a certain amount of give to them for minimal additional delta-v, but they\u0027re what to aim for for \u0022cheap\u0022 transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T01:41:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough we call them \u0022launch windows\u0022, note they would more accurately be called \u0022the manoeuvre node that you make to get from Kerbin to planet x\u0022.

This means that over the course of time, the inner planets lap the outer planets, so their positions relative to each other are constantly (if sometimes slowly) changing. The relative positions are defined by \u0022phase angles\u0022, which is the angle between a line drawn 1st from the starting planet to the sun, then from the sun to the target planet. If you make the transfer burn (in the right direction, see below), when the phase angle is correct, then your ship will encounter the target planet and will spend the least delta-v doing so. Otherwise, it will miss and will require 1 or more extra burns to intercept the target planet, plus perhaps a long time (years maybe, depending on how bad you missed) waiting to do these correction burns. Thus, the \u0022launch\u0022 or transfer window is the point in time when the correct phase angle exists between the starting and target planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s phase angle. The other angle is called \u0022ejection angle\u0022, which is about burning in the correct direction. This is the point around your orbit, measured from the direction your starting planet is heading, where you place the maneuver node for the transfer burn. For going to Duna, Dres, Jool, and Eeloo, the ejection angle is positive, meaning it will be somewhere on the night side of Kerbin. When going to the inner planets, the ejection angle is negative so it will be somewhere on the day side of Kerbin. Placing the node at the correct ejection angle is essential to using the minimum amount of delta-v for the trip as shown by the calculator. If you\u0027re a little bit off, then your velocity vector after the burn won\u0027t quite be in the right direction, so you\u0027ll have to do another burn later to correct your path.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T03:47:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Hohmann_transfer_orbit.svg/750px-Hohmann_transfer_orbit.svg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022750px-Hohmann_transfer_orbit.svg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a Hohmann transfer, which is generally the most fuel-efficient transfer without using gravity assists.

There\u0027s some leeway before you get a noticeable impact, so that\u0027s your transfer window.
