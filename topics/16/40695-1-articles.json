Problem is, it doesn\u0027t have enough places to attach all the parachutes that the Parachute Calculator says I need for it, so doing a parachute-only landing isn\u0027t an option. Thus, I have the choices of doing rocket-assisted parachute or rocket-only. However, I don\u0027t know how much rocket I need for their option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, about what TWR do I need for a rocket-only landing on Duna?

I would go with a TWR of two or three to leave room for error. As far as the drogue chutes are concerned, they are not intended to slow your craft down to a safe velocity. Their purpose is to reduce the g-loading of main parachute deployment. In other words, their there to help stop your ship from ripping itself apart. I would go with two or three for redundancy. Just make sure you strut them on to prevent them from being torn off by their own deployment (I\u0027ve had that happen before.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T19:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDrogue chutes are mostly to slow you down before opening the main chutes to prevent ripping your craft apart. On a 20t ship, only one with a rocket assist slowdown would be enough if you plan using regular chutes too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd since you are using KER, just have whatever TWR you are comfortable with to land usually. It\u0027s not very different from other planets/moons, if you usually prefer landing on the Mun with a TWR of 2, try to get that TWR on Duna, just make sure it\u0027s above 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027d strap a drogue and four radials and finish this with a rocket assisted landing at ~2,5TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, be very careful while going down on Duna if you plan to use chutes. The atmospheric density is so low parachutes half deploy at only 12km and you\u0027re going nearly 800m/s by then. The shallower you come in, the more you allow the very thin atmosphere to slow you down. Else, you\u0027Re gonna drop like a stone and rip your chutes off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T20:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChutes half-deploying at 800 m/s is a lot slower than what happens on Kerbin or Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T21:10:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022numerobis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022numerobis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EChutes half-deploying at 800 m/s is a lot slower than what happens on Kerbin or Eve.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is they can\u0027t deploy before, unlike on Kerbin and Eve, and that leaves very little time to slow down before full deployment. 800m/s at 10km when going down is fast. That gives you about 20 secs to slow down before drogue deployment. Duna is just very capricious about parachutes. Like Mars, it doesn\u0027t have enough atmosphere to slow you down correctly, but just enough so that you can\u0027t ignore it :l\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T22:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo take off/land on a body, you always need a TWR \u0026gt;= 1.
