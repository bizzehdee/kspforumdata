Actually six missions, one for Jool and one for each of its moons. Additionally, R\u0026amp;D has determined that it would be really great to get surface and ocean samples, so they\u0027ve requested two Laythe landers as well. The ocean probe is pretty simple, but I\u0027ve decided that I want a rover for the land. The problem I\u0027m running into is that I don\u0027t have large solar panels unlocked yet, nor RTGs or fuel cells. So my question is, are solar panels feasible sources of power all the way out at Jool with the nerfed solar panel curve? Or should I hold off on the rover until I can find a better source of power?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T02:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve done most of my Jool missions with just solar.

If you don\u0027t have the RTG, the one absolutely vital thing is you have to make sure that whatever position your craft find themselves in relative to the sun, they have to get enough power to cover probe core usage and charge batteries.

You can\u0027t leave solar panels deployed as you come though the atmosphere, so for safety you need to make sure that your craft is aerodynamically stable (no need to use power to hold retrograde or whatever) and/or your engines have an alternator (so if you use the aerospike [doubtful, considering what you\u0027ve unlocked...], you need to be sure that batteries have enough charge to last the whole time you\u0027re moving in the atmosphere) and/or you have large battery reserves and/or you add a couple of static panels and/or you pilot manually without a probe core. Once down on the ground, you can afford to take breaks to let the rover recharge, so again it\u0027s just a question of optimal battery size to do what you think you\u0027ll want to do with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-07T03:01:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2016 03:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ruiluth","CreatedById":60427,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T07:31:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222566418\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139184\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462589582\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153264\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Plusck\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Plusck said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve done most of my Jool missions with just solar.
