It\u0027s the clipping. If you use the \u0022move\u0022 tool to clip a part so that it is behind another part, it will be partially blocked from the airstream. Only cargo bays and fairings offer 100% protection. But if you clip a wheel into a fuel tank and observe the drag using\u00A0the aero GUI and context menus, it will be less. If you do the same thing with a structural fuselage, I\u0027m sure the exact same thing happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
