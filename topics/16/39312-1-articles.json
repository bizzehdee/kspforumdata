This way, each booster is two orange tanks, one small \u0022pancake\u0022 tank an a mainsail. You should get much more delta V from this. The best answer to get further is rarely more boosters, but more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robot256","CreatedById":67902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T04:48:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat stupid_chris said. My heavy-lift designs don\u0027t have more than five or seven engines on the first stage, but rely on 3.75m sized rockets and fuel tanks from K.W. Rocketry or NovaPunch to pack enough thrust and fuel. A really neat trick I learned from a stock craft is to have radially-staged liquid boosters drop in pairs, where the first tank/engine pair dropped has a fuel line feeding the second tank/engine pair that gets dropped, that has a fuel line feeding the third tank/engine pair that gets dropped, that has a fuel line feeding the central tank. Then the radial stages drop faster, and the remaining tanks are full after you drop each pair, so you expend less fuel lugging half-empty tanks around. Sometimes if I\u0027m really short on thrust right at launch I have to add radial engines, and toggle them at certain times depending on overheating and gravity turns. I\u0027ve used these techniques to get ~80 ton payloads into orbit consistently, with launch weights only 5 or 6 times that of the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually I have a first stage that has a giant engine and a bunch of boosters like that, with about 2-3000 m/s in it. Then the second stage is about 1/4 the size, but with a pretty big engine still, and giving another 3000 m/s is enough to get into orbit and circularize. Then the payload has a transfer stage with nuclear engines, and a lander on top with its own fuel reserve. My big interplanetary flights, though, almost always need refueling before the depart Kerbin orbit, and sometimes I even refuel them en route from a tanker in the same convoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fishoo","CreatedById":76197,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T04:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, both of you =D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be testing this tomorrow as I\u0027m not in my house today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut thanks for the tips.
