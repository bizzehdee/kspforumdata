I have been working hard to try to make a space plane that can reach Minmus but I am having multiple problems and am looking for some suggestions. Optionally, if someone has a working space plane that can reach Minmus LKO, dock with a station to deliver crew\u00A0and return to Kerbin and land I would appreciate the opportunity to see it so I can better understand what I am doing wrong in my own designs. Basically the issues I am having are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The aircraft can get into Kerbin LKO, however, it has no where near enough Delta V to get to Minmus, let alone back. For a rocket I\u0027d add more fuel and engines, however, I feel like the plane really starts losing any semblance of \u0022looking good\u0022, not to mention its flight characteristics begin to suffer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Landing is another issue, every attempt to de-orbit the current design I\u0027ve been working on has resulted in the the plane exploding in the atmosphere due to heat.
