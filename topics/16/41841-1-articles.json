That takes about 4500 delta-V per module of the interplanetary ship. If all you\u0027re doing is sending 1 to 3 Kerbals to plant a flag and come home, you can get this off the ground fairly easily. If you want to do more, then you pretty much have to assemble your interplanetary ship in orbit from 2-3 modules, so it\u0027s like a mobile space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in orbit, you need enough delta-V to 1) transfer to the target planet and 2) get captured. The usual way of providing this delta-V is with nuclear engines because they need less fuel, so getting them to Kerbin orbit is easier. The amount of delta-V the transfer stage/tug needs IN GENERAL is shown on the delta-V map on the Wiki, here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_Sheet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_Sheet\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make sure your rocket, and each stage thereof, has enough delta-V to do its intended job and enough TWR and burn time to land and take off from the destination, you should probably get the mod Kerbal Engineer Redux, here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kerbal-engineer-redux-v0-5/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kerbal-engineer-redux-v0-5/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you need to launch when Kerbin is at the proper phasing angle to your destination.
