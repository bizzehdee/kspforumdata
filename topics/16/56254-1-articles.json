My typical launches take about 3200-3500 delta-v, and that includes asparagus staged launchers. I\u0027ve put landers/rovers on top of rockets that were by far the widest point of the craft, and never had one take more than it would in stock KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, it\u0027s very easy to create craft that are a royal pain to get into orbit with FAR, though they still probably won\u0027t take more delta-v than they would in stock.
