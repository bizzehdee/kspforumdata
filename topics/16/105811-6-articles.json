I\u0027m finding them to be quite slow, personally, as I\u0027m not spamming them at the game then time warping a year or 2 ahead. I\u0027ve got them out there orbiting Kerbin, Mun, and Minimus, slowly generating science, while I do more interesting things, like exploring, contracts, etc. I rarely warp more than a day or 2 ahead at a time. For missions that take weeks or months, I launch those, set an alarm, and do other missions while they slowly proceed. With that play style, any nerf to the labs would make them unbearably slow to the point of not being worth the launch cost and fuel to take them somewhere.\n\u003E Basically, I\u0027m playing the game in fast real time, not 10 minutes of stuff then warp massively ahead for the next 10 minutes of stuff, and the lab seems slow but very balanced for that. I\u0027ve got a couple of solar orbit missions that are something like 100-ish game time days into the future for their next alarm, it may be several real weeks before those alarms are reached, or certainly a good few days, and I\u0027m doing lots of local missions and planning and setting up other remote missions while those slowly plod ahead.\n\nSounds great, but KSP makes your life harder when you want to do that:\n\n- No incentive to do parallel missions (just having some maitnenance cost would make sense)\n\n- No stock \u0022alarm\u0022\n\n- No more than 7 Kerbals in level 1 and 2\n\n- No flight planning tool that would help you to decide when to launch a mission to some given planet in order to minimize time or fuel.\n\n- And the worst : strong incentive in using always the same Kerbals: XP points.\n\nSo theway the gameplay has been though is to do missions one by one. And if you do missions one by one, it is likely that every mission to Jool or Moho or wherever is far away will bring you much less science points that your Minmus orbital lab with a one star scientist just during the time of the mission. Therefore I still think MPL is overpowered.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T21:59:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 09:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by haltux**"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T22:19:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sounds great, but KSP makes your life harder when you want to do that:\n\u003E - No incentive to do parallel missions (just having some maitnenance cost would make sense)\n\u003E \n\u003E - No stock \u0022alarm\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E - No more than 7 Kerbals in level 1 and 2\n\u003E \n\u003E - And the worst : strong incentive in using always the same Kerbals: XP points.\n\u003E \n\u003E So theway the gameplay has been though is to do missions one by one.

Therefore I still think MPL is overpowered.\n\nWho needs an incentive to do parallel missions? It\u0027s an obvious thing to do, and much more fun and interesting than single mission at a time. The game should not have to give you any incentive to running parallel missions.\n\nWhile the game absolutely should have a stock alarm, your argument that the lack of one preventing you doing anything else over 100\u002B day trips to other planets is nonsense and entirely invalid. Long missions like that don\u0027t even need an alarm. You can just check on them in the tracking station occasionally, it only takes a couple of seconds, then back to playing around with local missions, experimenting with different craft designs, planning and launching more remote missions. Apart from all that, the mod alarm is simple, reliable, and there\u0027s just no good reason not to have it installed. When one of your long range missions gets close to destination, stop doing other stuff in an orderly fashion, and warp ahead just a few hours or a day, so you don\u0027t miss an important moment with it.\n\nBy the time you\u0027re ready to send off missions outside the local system, you should have basic probe cores available, so the limit on kerbals isn\u0027t a problem. It\u0027s also not 7 in levels 1 and 2; level 2 is 12. If you\u0027re flying plenty of the better local contract missions, cash isn\u0027t a problem to upgrade the astronaut complex anyway.\n\nXP points are not a problem, you can get to level 3 without really leaving Kerbin. Mun, Minimus, and very briefly popping out into solar orbit before immediately dropping back into Kerbin\u0027s SoI gets you that. You don\u0027t actually need more than level 3 for anything important, just a little extra science bonus. To be honest, the only kerbals that it\u0027s important to skill up are the engineers. Low skill pilots can be supplemented by a probe core, all they really need is basic level 1 SAS, and the extra functions are not hard to do by hand. Most simple contract missions don\u0027t get any benefit or advantage from having a higher skilled engineer. Low skill scientists, no big deal really (but yeah, preferable to upgrade them when opportunity becomes available). And, apart from all that, the greater majority of my local missions are flown by a probe core with 0 crew at launch. You\u0027re claiming that\u0027s the \u0022worst\u0022 issue, I actually see it as the most ridiculously irrelevant issue, to be honest.\n\nSo, to sum it up, I do not see a single valid argument in your case that it\u0027s not reasonable to do many other things while your long missions slowly plod through solar orbit, and to have many different missions flying in solar orbit simultaneously (with a little sensible planning to ensure that there\u0027s reasonable gaps between arrival times at destinations).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T22:22:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murph**"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T22:23:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you don\u0027t want to bother doing science the interesting way, just don\u0027t do it.

But judging from my current career, it should be possible to get 1000-1500 science points from a lab before the first transfer window to Duna comes up. That equals, what? Strip-mining two or three Munar biomes, or something on that order.

I don\u0027t understand why it is so hard to admit.\n\nIf you focussed solely on your Jool mission, ignoring the lab, then the lab would generate a maximum of 500 science during that mission, and you should be bringing far more than that back from Jool.\n\nIt\u0027s hard to admit, because I think that you are completely wrong about it. The lab is well balanced right now; if it was changed to fit your scenario, it would be unusable and irrelevant to many people. It is absolutely not overpowered because it is slow to generate science unless you quite deliberately and artificially fast forward for years at a time, but very deliberately stopping at reasonably optimal intervals to swap to the lab to transmit generated science and load more data. I literally would abandon use of the lab as completely useless and broken, if it was significantly lower yield per game day than it is right now, at least until late game, where I might then put one up for the hell of it. It simply would no longer be worth the resources used to launch it if nerfed significantly below the current level.\n\nIn terms of balancing the lab, your suggested play style is quite unreasonable. Playing in fast real time, only fast forwarding a max of about 1\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u01532 days, maybe a week occasionally, between doing significant things (i.e. not just lab button pressing) is the obvious reasonable play style to balance it against. The lab needs to generate science during time warp, even during fast time warp, and the existing controls of diminishing research rate and capped output unless actively managed are more than sufficient.\n\nIf there\u0027s to be any change here, it should only be to penalise your unreasonable play style.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E And by the way, you say you use mainly probe cores, do you think as well that the ridiculous amount of science points that probe cores can generate is fairly balanced as well ?\n\nYes, I don\u0027t see any problem at all with science points generated via probes. There\u0027s no balance problem with science and probes.\n\nIn many ways, you\u0027re talking about science points as if they are the entire game. Unlocking the tech tree is the start of the game only, it\u0027s something to get out of the way before moving on to the real main game of exploring the Kerbol solar system. During the main game, science points are just a side activity to generate a little extra cash. To me, the game is a case of getting past the initial hurdles of learning how to travel in space, then unlocking the tech tree mostly from within the local Kerbin system, then exploring the larger Kerbol solar system, but without exact boundaries between those phases. It\u0027s quite reasonable for them to overlap, but fundamentally unlocking the tech tree comes before you\u0027ve done significant exploration.\n\nTo me, the balance of science between Kerbin system orbital labs and a Jool mission is entirely irrelevant, as the entire tech tree is unlocked long before you reach Jool. Following the game\u0027s hinted progression (hinted via contracts offered), you\u0027ll be finishing the tech tree via the Duna system, if you don\u0027t choose to mostly focus on Mun and Minimus in the early game. Jool won\u0027t be relevant until much later in the game."},{"CreatedByName":"haltux","CreatedById":29407,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T13:37:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If there\u0027s to be any change here, it should only be to penalise your unreasonable play style.\n\nIt is not about my play style it is about the play style that can be expected, with a little bit of common sense, from people who do career mode for the first time. KSP is a trial and error game, I can\u0027t imagine people sending ten rockets at the same time before realizing they forgot power source or communication device in all of them.\n\nAnyway, you won\u0027t be convinced anyway and that is not a major problem.\n\nWhat I would suggest would not be to make MPL slower or even less efficient, but that some kind of support would be required for the MPL to work during long periods. For example, scientists should be replaced after a given amount of time spent in space, for example one year, just like in real life. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yes, I don\u0027t see any problem at all with science points generated via probes. There\u0027s no balance problem with science and probes.\n\nIn real life, 1 $ invested in space exploration with probes brings you way more \u0022science points\u0022 than 1$ invested in space exploration with human being.
