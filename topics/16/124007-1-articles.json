At least few that fly more than once. This is true of conventional configurations, canards, and flying wings. The reason is that the moment of a wing increases with AoA. For symmetrical airfoils, including flat plate, it is 0 at 0 AoA (along with total lift) and so with a symmetrical airfoil, you can place CG at CL and have a neutrally stable (neither stable nor unstable) aircraft. This is popular in high-alpha aerobatics where you really don\u0027t want the plane to right itself. For any stable configuration, since the moment of the wing would tend to lift the nose relative to the CG, moving the CG forward slightly is a good way to offset that moment. If your CG moves aft of the CL, then when your craft pitches up, the increasing AoA will mean that the pitching moment is increasing with AoA and is causing AoA to increase - kind of a viscious cycle, often resulting in death for pilots, passengers, and aircraft. Usually, the ideal CG position is between 1/4 and 1/3 of the mean aerodynamic chord ahead of the CL. This configuration produces an aircraft with positive longitudinal stability in normal flight attitudes. A few aircraft have intentionally flown with negative longitudinal stability, but these require complex fly-by-wire systems to interpret the pilot\u0027s input and produce the correct control surface movements to keep the aircraft from tumbling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m sure there is someone who doesn\u0027t believe this, so I\u0027m going to tell you how to prove that what I have said is true. Go pick up a cheap balsa or foam glider at the hobby shop or toy store - something that flies well before you modify it. Measure its CG and figure out it CL. Now slowly move the CG back and record how far, how long, and how true it flies with each change. Observe how it tries to fly backwards when the CG moves behind the CL... There ya go. Same thing, BTW, happens here in KSP. Check the successful designs being put out there - All the ones that I\u0027ve seen that fly well have the CG just in front of the CL and when they burn fuel off it does not move behind CL. If it does, I recommend not trying it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanny\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T21:52:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the front or back landing gear is even slightly shorter, when the craft is generated on the runway and gravity is applied, it falls slightly until all the gear are in contact with the ground.
