Assuming that you don\u0027t have any lateral speed, you would need to use 1110m/s of delta-v to raise your periapsis to 35km. But kerbin is rotating at 174m/s, so assuming that you only burned straight upwards you only need 936m/s. So after you have burned the 450m/s you have still left 486 m/s to go. You have unlimited dV by simply going out and pushing(don\u0027t forget to go back into the capsule to refill), so there should be no problem with that. It will still take some time and you will need to refuel multiple times, but it\u0027s definitely possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
