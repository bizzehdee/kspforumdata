It probably does not say \u0022orbit\u0022. But it may say that you need to stage or test the fairing. And the altitude range is only 1000m? That\u0027s going to be very tricky if you try to get the craft into orbit as well as meet the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James M","CreatedById":167171,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-25T07:19:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the fine print does in fact say 53km - 54km orbit, then try accelerating to orbital speed really friggin fast as soon as you hit like 52km maybe then detach and really quickly click the test part function on the heat shield? Thats the only thing I can think of. Otherwise you may have to ditch that contract.

It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve accepted that kind of contract. I suspect that you can fulfill this contract simply by taking a normal trajectory into orbit, and during your regular gravity turn towards \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E, you stage the fairing when passing 53km altitude. Then circularize at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E to also get the orbit requirement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it really expects you to be orbital \u003Cem\u003Eat the same time\u003C/em\u003E as being between 53-54km, then you\u0027ll have to make sure you have accelerated to orbital speed when you reach that altitude. KSP considers you orbital when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E is anything over 25km, if I recall correctly - this is when the camera switches from atmospheric to orbital mode. In that case, take a shallow gravity turn, shallower than you would normally take to get to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, aiming to circularize when you get to 53-54km. Then either stage the fairing right then if you have time, or simply boost \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E on the opposite side to give yourself more time. The remaining drag at that altitude will slowly drop \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and a good portion of your orbit back into your target band even if you overshoot. At 53km the atmosphere gets very thin already and you shouldn\u0027t have to worry about overheating, but this way you can take your time to stage the fairing at the right moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would not give you a \u003Cem\u003Estable\u003C/em\u003E orbit due to drag, obviously, but I do think for the KSP mission system this is considered orbital and would fulfill the requirements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-26T10:25:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223809824\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194867\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593166162\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152460\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022swjr-swis\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, swjr-swis said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP considers you orbital when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E is anything over 25km, if I recall correctly\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure if that is the case either.
