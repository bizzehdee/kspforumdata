However, I\u0027m stuck still using the keyboard for anything but spaceplanes--while planes use pitch and roll as their primary axes in flight and the joystick maps these to left/right and fore/aft stick, rockets use pitch and \u003Cem\u003Eyaw \u003C/em\u003Eas their primary axes in flight, and using fore/aft and twisting-of the stick doesn\u0027t make for a very ergonomic experience.\u00A0On orbit, the intuitive \u0022stick left to swing left\u0022 movement just initiates a spin around the long axis. Twisting the stick would be perfectly intuitive, however, for rolling a spacecraft. I guess I probably \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E get used to it, but considering how much of my flight time is spent on orbit vs. in atmosphere, I\u0027d really like to have a way to toggle \u0022swap yaw/roll inputs.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes the \u0022plane mode\u0022 mod work for joystick users?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n...Side note, does anyone know how the control inputs were mapped for the Space Shuttle on orbit? I\u0027ve never thought of it until now.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-21T02:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy own stick setup is twist for roll and left-right for yaw, since picked I up my habits in the WingCommander tradition.

This is backwards from what you\u0027re going to want to do because you\u0027ll want to be able to stage while in \u0022rocket mode\u0022 and are less likely to need to do so in \u0022plane mode\u0022 (space bar is stage in staging but switches between rotation and translation in docking mode), but this is how you\u0027d be able to switch on the fly using only the in-game options available to everybody.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MitchS","CreatedById":163568,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-21T15:26:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrike\u003EBueller?\u003C/strike\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor some reason I was never notified of these replies!
