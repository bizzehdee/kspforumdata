I am not here talking about aircraft physics in a purely fictional world where reality has no bearing. I am here asking what caused this behavior and how to stop it. which I have received an answer for. in my experience KSP flight physics are far from ideal, but with some recent mods I loaded FAR was required, and now if that is indeed the culprit ( I have not tested this yet) then I have received an answer for how to disable that behavior.
