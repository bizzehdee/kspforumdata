You have a lot of control surface on a very light craft, every time they move they add some forward thrust (this is definitely a glitch with the physics that will likely be addressed when aerodynamics get reworked in a later version). The SAS is actuating them to try to keep the nose pointed upward as the ship falls and tries to turn nose down. If you turn off SAS your craft will start to fall and point nose down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can minimize the effect by right clicking the control surfaces and disabling pitch, yaw, and roll control. They will just work as fixed fins then, but your ship has enough reaction wheels that it should still be controllable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an aside, the basic jet engine used in the craft has its maximum thrust at zero airspeed, the turbojet is the one that will increase in thrust up until 1000m/s, then it will start to drop off again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfmoyen","CreatedById":126457,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T14:04:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, Red Iron Crown,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the hint.

With a thrust on the first notch of the dial, so somewhere near 7% if the scale is accurate (which should have given me about 1T of thrust, way below the weight of the craft at any rate !) the vertical speed was fluctuating, roughly around - 1 m/s (between -0.1 and 1.9 or something like that). With no thrust at all (X) it had a V-speed fluctuating around -2 m/s (-4 to -0.5). It was certainly not accelerating downwards, as I would have expected. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow at the same time, the craft was drifting laterally, at some 15-20 m/s : surely, this is not going to yield 3-4 T of lift, with an angle of attack of 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what makes this craft immune to gravity ? ;-) Can the craft infiniglide with no active control surfaces ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T14:16:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EControl surfaces can still apply force when disabled, maybe try the craft again with the surfaces removed for testing?
