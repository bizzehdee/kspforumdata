No matter what I do though, regardless of what SAS I use or don\u0027t use, or how many Yawmaster modules I have, the rocket refuses to bank past 30 degrees from vertical. It banks ok, albeit slowly up until then, and then just decides to bank violently back the other way, despite me doing everything I can think of to stop it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy launches work like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Launch, dropping SRB\u0027s when they empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Continue vertically to around 10Km (I\u0027ve tried this everywhere from 10Km to 40Km, same problem regardless of altitude)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Bank towards the east, as though I was preparing to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Quit and relaunch because I\u0027ve lost control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a completely vertical launch, the rocket is perfectly stable, and reaches around 15.5Km/s at burnout, around 3000Km up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve included the rocket, which uses Nova Silisko\u0027s and Sunday Punches packs in this post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-11T03:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah it doesn\u0027t even get to 30 degrees as you have it in the craft file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats just a lot of dang mass (and thus inertia) to try and move, and while you might think having the torque way out in the end would act like a lever, the center of gravity is dropping lower.. and nothing can move it. I bet it just gets worse the more fuel you use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour best bet would probably be finding a way to get some SAS modules down on the lower end - perhaps an edited one that allows fuel passthrough and put them near that center main engine?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goraine","CreatedById":14914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T12:54:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing only an ASAS, Solid Rocket Boosters and the old MK1 Pod, I\u0027ve managed to get into an escape trajectory. You have to get a high orbit, and burn horizontally at the periapsis in order to raise your apoapsis high enough to escape into solar orbit.
