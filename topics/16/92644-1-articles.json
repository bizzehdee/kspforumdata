I\u0027ve found the most tedious part of gameplay now to be the Kerbin-ejection interplanetary burns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hate burns that take more than 5 minutes, even with forced 4x acceleration. Mostly because I generally start in a 100km orbit and the time it takes to perform a 9 minute burn with 2 LV-Ns on a big orange tank \u002B payload can significantly alter the true trajectory, if not accidentally enter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and get destroyed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my latest flotilla, I used the \u0027multiple burn\u0027 approach, dividing the total Joolian transfer delta-v of about 2000m/s into several smaller burns at periapsis. But each time this raises the apoapsis and throws off your transfer window by delaying the final ejection burn (admittedly, not a big deal for Jool, but may be for other destinations), and you have to be careful that you don\u0027t raise your apoapsis so much that you exit Kerbin\u0027s SOI. All told, this is a MASSIVE pain to execute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s a good solution to get the 2km/s burn done in one short, blissful burn?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution I\u0027ve come up with is to use an \u0027interplanetary booster\u0027 that consists of a large docking port, an orange tank, and a Mainsail that I connect to the main ship and use to give me that 2km/s ejection burn. Once I achieve a Jool transfer orbit, I immediately undock the ship, turn the booster 180 degrees and burn back into a Kerbin orbit (with aerobraking assistance) so that I can use it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone else use this method? It takes a lot of fuel, but gives you a quick and painless interplanetary burn. But then you also have to take the time to bring the booster back into a Kerbin orbit, so probably the overall time savings are minimal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torquemadus","CreatedById":97777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T20:25:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy current method for departure burns it to stage part way through the burn. The stage used to begin the burn is left behind in a highly elliptical orbit around Kerbin, I then aerobrake it back into LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T20:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve considered a similar approach as well. I think that it\u0027s more of a cost-savings issue than a time-savings issue since as you said, you need to bring things back (and re-fuel it, and dock it, etc.). I think the thing I\u0027d do differently is that I\u0027d use this engine just for raising the AP but still within Kerbin\u0027s SOI. This way I don\u0027t have to turn around and burn -- I can just wait for AP and put myself in the atmosphere for aerobraking using very little delta-V. Otherwise, you\u0027d have to slow down quite a bit (~1000 m/s) if you\u0027re going somewhere like Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that long burns will get a bit better in the next version, since we\u0027ll have the piloting assists that do things like point your craft toward the maneuver node, so you can just do a 4x warp and not have to keep doing corrections.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-12T20:48:09Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2014 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Empiro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
