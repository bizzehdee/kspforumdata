Air resistance is why there\\\u0027s an optimal thrust to weight ratio. The force do to air resistance is proportional to velocity to the second power. If you want to double your velocity, you need to quadruple your power (not including power to overcome gravity). You would probably agree that going too fast chews up a lot of power, while having a very small marginal return of velocity gain. You would also agree that not using enough power to leave the launchpad (because of gravity) is also very bad on your fuel economy. There has to be somewhere between the two that fuel economy is maximized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Goddard Problem is finding the most fuel efficient way to vertically ascend through an atmosphere.
