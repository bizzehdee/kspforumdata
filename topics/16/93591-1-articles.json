So, Beta crashed right into my learning phase. So far, I like it, but now I got a mission which seemingly can\u0027t finish:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission ist to \u0022Position satellite in specific orbit of the Mun\u0022. I\u0027ve got two of the three criteria checked: launching a new probe and maintaining stability for ten seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat doesn\u0027t check is: \u0022Reach the designated orbit around the Mun with minimal deviation\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done everything to come as close to the orbit as possible: Apoapsis is 1,509,130m vs 1,509,845m target. Periapsis is 1,417,300m vs. 1,417,845 target. Inclination is as far matched as possible, if there\u0027s any deviation left, it\u0027s not visible on the map. Periapsis and Apoapsis are with in 3 Minutes of target, while the whole orbit takes 2d, 2h, 40m. Thats about 0.35% deviation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that large an orbit I can\u0027t get any closer, even the shortest, slightest burn makes apoapsis or periapsis jump by about 1km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, all in all I\u0027m lost. The only explanation I can come up with is, that the orbit tolerance of the mission must be defined in absolute and not in relative terms, so it becomes unplayable with large numbers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other ideas?

Your AN and DN relative to the target orbit are where your orbit crosses the plane of the target orbit. So rotate the view in 1 direction until the target orbit shows up as a line instead of an ellipse. Then rotate the view at an angle along the same line as the target orbit, so the target orbit remains displayed as a line while you turn your existing orbit into a line as well. When you get there, the AN and DN are lined up directly in the center of the screen, where the lines of the 2 orbits intersect. Create a node there and burn as needed to make the 2 lines be drawn atop each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: It\u0027s generally a good idea to get your Pe and Ap lined up with the target Pe and Ap, and at about the correct distance, before doing the inclination burn. Makes it easier to line up the view and is usually cheaper on fuel, too. And, of course, make sure you check which way the dots of light are moving before you launch \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as to the tolerance of how close you have to get, it appears to look for some total amount of error in all parameters instead of requiring each parameter to be within some tolerance individually.
