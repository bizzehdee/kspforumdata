The station starts turning in any direction very slowly. This was a pain to dock. SAS help a little to reduce this. Even with every torque disables I had this drift.

Your debug log will have a null reference exception. The bug is mostly experienced if you are using claws. A certain part will keep their speed vector, resulting in deorbiting or tearing the craft apart in physics timewarp. It usually won\u0027t let you non-phys timewarp saying that the craft is under acceleration, or if it does let you timewarp, the craft will fall apart explosively after slowing down again, due to that one part keeping the old speed vector, while the rest of the craft transitions to a new one. \n\nThe bug can sometimes be counteracted by undock, save, reload, redock, but it can take a few tries. Sonetimes a simple quicksave quickload also fixes the problem, but not always.\n\nEdit: After 1.0.2 this bug can also happen if you pack a utility bay with too many parts, especially physicsless parts. If they overlap, there is a chance they cause a small weight-proportionate spinning effect due to bumping into each other. It is not really noticable in the atmisphere, where all other forces are much larger.\n\nNote - I am aware there are no more massless/physicsless parts, as they transfer their weight and applicable forces to the parent part, but therein lies the problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T13:12:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 01:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Borsek**"},{"CreatedByName":"Holyvision","CreatedById":100532,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T15:36:53Z","Content":"If you are using a mod such a mechjeb\u0027s autopilot or smart A.S.S., it will fight any pilot-driven SAS commands they are using (eg, telling Jeb to hold ship prograde and telling mechjeb to hold you retro). Behavior like this can also trigger from certain part clipping -- be wary of the storage bays and clipping wherever possible.

They suddenly started to yaw to the right for no obvious reason. Torque?\n\nFor that specific problem I\u0027ve figured out the reason why. It\u0027s due to the intakes being placed using symmetry mode. For some odd reason it causes the mirrored part to take in less air than the root part, which in turn also causes unequal drag and engine thrust. I\u0027ve solved it by changing how I design planed by first for example, placing an intake on the left side, followed by a jet engine.
