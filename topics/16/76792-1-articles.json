Launch up, but this time, don\u0027t go beyond the 45 degree mark, in fact make your turn pretty small, like to the edge of the little circle on the top of the NavBall. Launch up to 6 million meters.

I suggest having MechJeb installed and on your launcher or satellite to tell you the orbital period. Once your orbital period is up to 6 hours, CONGRATS! Now you have a KerboStationrary satellite that will stay in line with mission control and, due to the fact that it takes 6 hours for Kerbin to spin completely on it\u0027s axis and it will take 6 hours for you to orbit, you won\u0027t lose contact with MC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3.) Wash, rather, rinse, repeat with the second satellite, HOWEVER, only make your orbital period to 5 hours 55 minutes, meaning that Kerbin(and the first satellite as well) will spin faster than you. Time warp until the line of communication is just above the surface of Kerbin. Once at that point, burn to 6 hours orbital period. The dark side of the Mun will still have a comm blackout, but you can always send satellites there to clear that up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere you go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T06:04:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do you launch an unmanned sattelite delivery vehicle without satellites in orbit when using RemoteTech 2?
