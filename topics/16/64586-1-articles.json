The faster time passes the less exact physics calculation will be. When your computer can\u0027t keep it up (indicated by a yellow or red time display) it will skip some stuff so it can keep up. This can result in phantom forces and more instability as the intervalls between calculations are getting larger.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JonoRig","CreatedById":57882,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T07:29:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok.

However, it doesn\u0027t seem like it\u0027s just skipping physics frames. It seems more like it multiplies some of the values by the warp speed. So you end up with things like broken couplers or parachutes that rip off, when at 1x they don\u0027t do that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
