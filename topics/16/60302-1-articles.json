Tried posting this before but it never showed up. Not sure if it was under moderator review or something so I posted again. Delete the extra as necessary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was trying to dock my kethane miner/tanker back with my orbital refinery station tonight and upon my first attempt at docking to the port the magnets kicked in but I was a little off so it was a ton of swing around and dancing as the magnets played with each other and both bodies tried to adjust to compensate ( I had no SAS on during docking on the approach vehicle.) I decided to abort docking back up a few meters and realign for a better approach. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point after reversing away from the target docking port by about .3 m/s I quick saved. I started adjusting my new alignment and poof the docking port on the station disappeared. I thought it was a bug so hit my F9 and reloaded, same thing. Tried about 20 different times, trying different things and all have the same result, the docking port magically disappears. I checked the F3 logs from each ship and there is nothing to say why its disappearing (no damage at least).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes damage sometimes take time to remove a part? If so it may have been before I quick saved. Although there was no explosion or anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some screen shots to show you what I mean, they are from my multiple attempts so they are most likely not in any order but maybe they can help.
