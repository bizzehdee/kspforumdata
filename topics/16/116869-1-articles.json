What you need to do is make a new sandbox game and match its time with your current career. Then, find in career persistence file your vessels and copy all of them into sandbox persistence ( I recommend creating one ship in sandbox to know where in save file to put vessels from career), same with your kerbals. This should !PROBABLY! work. I have done it in 0.25 and it worked like a sharm.\n\nGood luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"gogozerg","CreatedById":127301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T18:24:16Z","Content":"I\u0027ll try again.\n\nStock conversion from career to sandbox, or to science, is something that should be possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T18:45:57Z","Content":"I would tend to agree with the \u0022start a new sandbox and copy over the vessels\u0022 if you aren\u0027t very familiar with save games. There are a lot of subtle differences, and even though KSP can be quite buggy, it\u0027s often pretty good at spotting inconsistencies (or choking on them...). So if not everything is lined up properly, it often doesn\u0027t work.\n\n- So yeah, I would start a new Sandbox save, then exit it back to the main menu.\n- Make a copy of that new persistence, and name it so it\u0027s easy to find as a quicksave. (Consider making a second copy and naming it something like \u0022Start\u0022 in case things go bad, you don\u0027t have to create a new sandbox game.)\n- Open that one and your old game with a plain text editor.\n- Copy the entire FLIGHTSTATE and ROSTER sections. I\u0027ve pasted the headers below. These sections appear below the SCENARIO blocks in a sandbox game.\n\n(Also, there\u0027s no need to fastforward your new save to the same time if you copy the flight state block, which I highly recommend.)\n\n    \tFLIGHTSTATE\t{\t\tversion = 1.0.4\t\tUT = 68.6800000000039\t\tactiveVessel = 1\t\tmapViewFiltering = -1026\t\tVESSEL...bunch of vessels, parts, etc...\t}\tROSTER\t{\t\tKERBAL\t\t{\t\t\tname = Jebediah Kerman...and a bunch of kerbals with their flight logs...\t\t}\t}\n\nOnce you do that, now you have a viable quicksave.
