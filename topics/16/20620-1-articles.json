The LPA is calculated based on the previous launch. It also only works equatorial plane and I think only eastward at that.

It breaks your relative speed into forward, vertical and horizontal components (ORDA has this too, but it\u0027s in a harder-to-read form). Once I was within a few km, I made the rendezvous by thrusting forward a few seconds with RCS, then thrusting sideways to eliminate the vertical and horizontal velocities. Doing it this way made it my easiest approach ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get close in the first place, here\u0027s what I did: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETarget was in a 100 km equatorial Kerbin orbit. I let MechJeb try to time the launch, but had no LPA and just assumed the computer\u0027d miss. So I set my orbit for 95km instead of 100.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as the circularizing burn was finished, I checked the map to see how far off we were, and in which direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the target\u0027s ahead of me in orbit, I\u0027ll catch up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the target had been behind me in orbit, I\u0027d need to slow down so would have immediately thrust prograde to increase my apo to 105 km, wait for apo, then circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I waited, letting the distance close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had previously used the rendezvous spreadsheet here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/8915-Orbital-Rendezvous-Made-Easy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/8915-Orbital-Rendezvous-Made-Easy\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto calculate when to burn to reach rendezvous from my standard orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, from my 95km orbit, when distance to target reached 12.5km I boosted prograde until my apo reached 100km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027d been at 105km, I\u0027d have boosted retrograde at 13.1km to reduce my apo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I arrived at 100km, I circularized yet again. It was tempting to try to dock instead since I was only a few hundred meters away. But I\u0027ve learned what happens when I get impatient during orbital maneuvers, as I\u0027m sure we all have. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I switched to RCS and precision control, zeroed out my relative velocities, and thrust forward at 1m/s. Because the orbit isn\u0027t a straight line, vertical and horizontal velocities keep creeping in and have to be frequently zeroed out. It was slow, but put me dead on-target without ever losing control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and one silly tool that was quite helpful in the final stages: First, note how to tell which side of your orbital stage is \u0022up\u0022, so that when viewed from behind, the I,J,K,L RCS translation keys push you in the proper direction visually. Next, take a PostIt note, draw a big plus-sign in the middle, and label the ends with the I,J,K,L directions. Mark \u0022top\u0022 on the note to match the rear view of your rocket. Now you have a visual reference you can stick on the screen, oriented the same way as your craft. No matter how you happen to be rolled, look at it from behind and you\u0027ll know which key to press to move in the direction you want. Trying to translate the rotations in my head was making me crazy,and ORDA insists on a specific orientation to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually I imagine we\u0027ll be able to roll our camera view independent of the craft, but until then this helps me a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T02:58:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have found that doing rendezvous in IVA can help with the orientation thing.
