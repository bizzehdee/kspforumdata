The issue comes from the compounding variables involved. If we don\u0027t enter a parking orbit around Jool, we\u0027re tethered to Laythes orbital period. We need to perform a minimum magnitude of a maneuver to encounter Tylo with enough energy so that when we eject solar retrograde out of the Joolian system, we end up with a low enough periapsis that we can encounter Kerbin.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nThe problem begins to compound here. We have to encounter Tylo such that our ejection angle if we were to lower our periapsis of Tylo to around 10,000 or slightly higher (for greatest affect) results in a solar retrograde ejection. In order to do this, we have to change our magnitude and maneuver time in order to adjust this. But we cannot go below a certain magnitude.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nAs you can see, this has resulted in me (over the course of a few months) spending hours and hours (sometimes 8 in a day during the summer) fiddling with maneuvers and getting what is basically chance encounters with Kerbin. I have been searching for a way to make this consistent, but have not been able to. Mainly, I end up restarting and eventually I end up choosing a good enough place and amount of orbits to start my encounter and things go smoothly. If I restart, I can\u0027t usually replicate it for a while. This maneuver will take me more than an hour to plan because of this, if I\u0027m lucky, I might get it in half hour.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nI thought maybe a parking orbit would make things easier, but that adds extra Delta V to the requirements of the maneuver and results in me getting less Oberth effect bonus. (But you can lower your orbital period to add more opportunities/more accuracy)\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nThis is all before, by the way, lining up the maneuver duration to actually make the transfer window. This is complex and adds to the issues, but I feel this can be optimized once a consistent method for planning the maneuver setup can be achieved.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nSome people have said to me this is too specific to even be possible. But others have casually mentioned the ease of execution of a Tylo\u0026gt;Kerbin. I am at a loss. I spent another 4 hours yesterday after work trying some different methods, and I found Bradley Whistance\u0027s video on Gravity Assists. He states that step 2 is to achieve the magnitude required to \u0022place your apoapsis\u0022 by adding prograde and then moving the maneuver forward in time to continuously add energy into the maneuver. But this hits diminishing returns with Tylo (since it seems I need an apoapsis between Tylo and the next moon Bop\u00A0in order to get to Kerbin) and I haven\u0027t been able to even get close with his method (he used the Kerbin system for this demonstration)\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nIf anyone else can provide some help on the issue, that would be greatly appreciated.

When you get enough speed to get low enough to Duna, you\u0027re not anywhere near it because you\u0027re no longer ejecting towards solar retrograde. Then, when you manage solar retrograde, you don\u0027t have enough energy. So you try again. Now you manage to get both down, and you don\u0027t end up making the window and now you can intercept. Now it\u0027s been 1 hour and 45 minutes and you\u0027ve basically done nothing.

Going there costed me some 300 m/s, mostly for the retrograde burn from jool orbit, with an extra bit spent for orbital plane matching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthen, 25 days later, tylo and my elliptic orbit were aligned well enough that burning prograde at periapsis would end with me leaving jool at an optimal angle. and with 200 m/s I could get to duna. but duna was in the completely wrong part of the orbit; I\u0027d have to make a\u00A0 200 m/s retrograde burn at solar periapsis to syncronize my orbit to hit duna on the next solar periapsis. form there it was 700 m/s for capture, for a total of 1600 m/s (including the cost of getting to tylo, and including an additional plane change in solar orbit), total travel time 8 years. A direct transfer from my original Jool orbit would cost 1000 m/s to reach Duna and 1000 for capture. as my ship had 1700 m/s available, it\u0027s an important reduction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen i found an even better solution. A 300 m/s burn at tylo periapsis would get me a kerbin intercept. kerbin is also in the wrong part of the orbit, but not too far, so it\u0027s not too hard to get there. I had to move a bit my burn; i discovered that if i burned slightly before periapsis, i would subtly change my angle of exit from jool so that i would get a higher apoapsis. this wastes a bit of energy (took me 50 m/s more for the same kerbin intercept) but it makes me lose time to find kerbin at my solar periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use a kerbin gravity assist to lower my solar apoapsis. I do not intercept duna with this - would have been too much to ask - but i can make a small 70 m/s course correction in my next solar apoapsis to reach duna the next year, with 700 m/s intercept. It\u0027s still close to 1600 m/s, but i reach duna in 5 years instead of 8. I could also aim for a second kerbin flyby, to better match my solar apoapsis with duna, it would certainly save some fuel if done correctly, but it\u0027s probably not worth the extra time.

I never thought of something like that. A flyby where you get captured? Does that even result in the same effect? It\u0027s really interesting, because you still gain the speed from being captured, but you\u0027re storing it for a later date. This is actually really cool and something I haven\u0027t even thought of. Honestly, this just might be crazy enough to work. You still gain the speed of the secondary body when you\u0027re captured I believe, so that means you must still gain an assist when you leave it. Or maybe this is wrong, and being captured doesn\u0027t actually result in an assist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, if you look at the example of explaining a gravity assist with the Train method, i.e What happens to a ball thrown by a person standing next to an oncoming train? If the person throws the ball at 20 km/h, and the ball hits the front of the train and bounces off at 20km/h, what happens to the ball? Does it still go 20km/h? or does it go whatever the train was going plus 20km/h?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn that example, if we take what you mentioned, I think it would still be true. It\u0027s just that instead of the ball bouncing off at 20km/h, it sticks to the train until the ball leaves later. The problem is the ball loses it\u0027s momentum, so maybe the energy comes from the person throwing, and that would be lost (getting captured instead of flying by). Or maybe the energy comes from the train, and spending a little to leave the train (just enough to burn back and get uncaptured again) it results in postponing the \u0022bounce off the train.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is really cool, and something to think about.

It ended up even cheaper than planned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou may already know this, but you can estimate the cost of a capture burn without making a node, by looking at how much the trajectory curves around the planet. the more it curves, the less it will cost to get captured. the closer\u00A0 you are to making a full circle around the planet, the closer to capture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OcLHxe9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/OcLHxe9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis is the manuever after leaving jool. first the red manuever on top, it\u0027s a plane change. a kerbin flyby at 3 years 197 days send me on the red orbit. this does not reach duna immediately, but i take care of that with the purple manuever at apoapsis (4 years 130 days) and for only 70 m/s i can reach duna at year 5 day 250. with the gravity assist i can control my new kerbol apoapsis, so it\u0027s not too difficult to set up a second kerbin flyby if i need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rgWXnJN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/rgWXnJN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhere is the manuever where i leave tylo. notice how i put it slightly before periapsis to go in a bit of different direction. of course, if i overdo this, i lose all the energy i have in the elliptic orbit. that ellipse is like 800 m/s already spent to raise a tylo periapsis, but it only works if i burn prograde at periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis is actually the main limitation of this manuever: you must burn according to your ellipse, and your ellipse stays fixed. so the direction at which you enter tylo orbit makes a big difference. in my case i was lucky to find a way to enter there. if i had my tylo apoapsis pointing away from kerbol, the whole manuever would be impossible. you\u0027d have to circularize and raise apoapsis in another direction, and that would cost 1500 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PkyUoxi.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/PkyUoxi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis is the full trajectory. you can see the kerbol apoapsis is slightly higher than jool, and this sets my kerbin encounter right. if i had not done it, i would have crossed kerbin orbit 50 days earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni also have a life support mod, but i have food for at least 10 years. food and water are light, better to stock extra\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-07T07:10:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve used the capture-and-go technique to get to Moho via Eve.
