Almost nothing besides engines generates heat, most engines don\u0027t produce enough heat to significantly heat up the tanks they\u0027re attached to, and all parts are unrealistically good at radiating heat by default. The one exception is using multiple LV-N nuclear engines on extended burns. While you can still build ships that can handle it fine without radiators, you\u0027ll probably find that they make it easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for antennas, the system is being reworked for 1.1.
