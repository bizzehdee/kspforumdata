Did re entry successfully, check. Landed successfully, check. Broken wheels? Check!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I went EVA, being an engineer kerbal, and went to fix the wheels. However, instantly when I fixed one and went to the other to fix it, it broke.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis kept going on and on till I gave up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCould this be fixed / is there any advice on this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-07T19:22:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs this isn\u0027t a suggestion, I\u0027m going to move this over to GamePlay Q\u0027s for now, and see how the thread goes, might move it to Tech support.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-07T19:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like the rover might be just too heavy for the wheels you\u0027re using. More wheels or less mass could help. Got a pic of the craft?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-07T21:57:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI saw the problem you describe in an older version of the game, but it got fixed. What version are you using?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you post the craft file (if it\u0027s stock)? What CB are you landed on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
