That\u0027s where the biome counts. So I do it with a pilot in orbit. You can hit every biome other than polar on an equatorial orbit of Kerbin and the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, and all except for polar and highlands on Minmus. That way you can get a lot of science easily in a single orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for doing contracts sending you to a specific location, just do what others have said and use a high-arcing suborbital trajectory. Even just going 50km across the surface, you can save a lot of fuel by reaching at least 25km altitude on your arc.
