The transfer window planner told me that I need around 3500m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E to get there with insertion burn. However, as I dont want to wait for two years for optimal transfer window (I also dont wish to warp for that much as I dont want to miss other transfer windows and funs stuff to do) I picked a transfer that is around 6200m/s which is basically ASAP. Anyway, I managed to build a transfer/capture stage for the probe with required \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E but bad \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for most of the part.

If ions are not an option, I use nuclear. All things you won\u0027t do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you want to build ships with lots of deltaV with only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E, the only thing you can do is build a huge ship with multiple stages. No other way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket equation states that \u003Cstrong\u003EdeltaV=ln(M\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E/M\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003E)*V\u003Csub\u003Eex\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E: that is, the deltaV is equal to the logaritm of the ration between the wet mass (M\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E) and the dry mass (M\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003E) of your ship, times the velocity of your exhaust gases (V\u003Csub\u003Eex\u003C/sub\u003E) - which is equal to Isp*g.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to increase deltaV, there are only two things you can do: increase Isp, or increase the Mw/Md ratio. You don\u0027t want to increase Isp, so you\u0027ve got to increase the Mw/Md. Which goes threefold:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na) reduce the weight of the payload. self-explaining\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nb) increase the amount of fuel. again, self-explaining\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nc) use multiple stages. As the amount of fuel you bring increases, the mass of dry fuel tanks increases too. And of course, to lift all that stuff, you need a big heavy engine. So after you burned most of your fuel, you want to ditch all those empty, useless, heavy spent fuel tanks. And you want to ditch that big powerful engine that\u0027s no longer needed, and use something smaller and lighter instead. Drop tanks are also an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, you can\u0027t prevent the mass from skyrocketing fast as you increase deltaV. Say your probe weights 1 ton, and you want 2 ton of fuel to give it 3 km/s. then if you want to add 3 more km/s, you need to make another stage with the same 3:1 ratio between dry and wet mass, so you need 9 tons. An additional 3 km/s will again require three times more mass than before, so 27 tons. Three more km/3, to bring the total to 12 km/s, and you\u0027re at 81 tons. And then 240, and so on. Past a certain size, rockets become hugely impractical. Which is why people prefer to use orbital mechanics to reduce deltaV requirememnts as much as possible, and to use more efficient engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis game lets you \u0022cheat\u0022 by mining new fuel everywhere cheaply. that also reduces the deltaV required. of course, if you\u0027re using kerbalism, then you\u0027re not supposed to use that - or you\u0027re supposed to use the kerbalism \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E functionalities, which make refueling less practical than the alternatives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) it\u0027s not exactly required that high deltaV=low thrust; the rocket equation has nothing on thrust.

Try to find an encounter with the biggest moon you can so that its gravity will slow you down relative to Gateway itself and so will help you brake into orbit. The alternative is going for a really low periapsis and using Gateway\u2019s atmosphere to aerobrake, but this is a high risk strategy as you could a) burn up, b) overdo it and fall into the planet or c) get wrecked by radiation, assuming Beyond Home has magnetosphere configs for Kerbalism and you\u2019re using the radiation system.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOrbital assembly will allow you to build something larger and heavier than your biggest launch rocket can handle in one flight.

So what I will do (no idea if this will help) make insertion burn by going retrograde in relation to the Gateway, going against its spin if you know what I mean. My biggest issue with kerbalism is habitation/stress management. To get 20m3 per Kerbal I need loads of hitchikers. I almost sent Kerbals to another planet but aborted mission as I could not provision them with habitat for 3\u002B year mission (mostly due waiting the transfer window to get back home) as craft was to heavy for the engines that I had unlocked at that moment. Now I am aiming to unlock a tech node where I get that gravity ring part (I think it comes with kerbalism) has almost 100m3 of habitation and provides loads of habitation bonuses. That and radiation management, this time I play with radiation resets whenever they land home, I tried once with lifetime radiation but I was roasting them way to fast even with full shielding going to the Mum/Minmus in stock solar system. In no time I would get 25% of lifetime radiation and if I send them like that interplanetary they are very close to dying from radiation poisoning by the time I get them back. \u003Cem\u003ENote I play on Hard.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere is radiation detox unit and how I can operate that one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204876-king-of-nowhere/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022204876\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204876-king-of-nowhere/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@king of nowhere\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224070148\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206118\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221640706134\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) i don\u0027t.

If ions are not an option, I use nuclear. All things you won\u0027t do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you want to build ships with lots of deltaV with only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, the only thing you can do is build a huge ship with multiple stages. No other way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket equation states that \u003Cstrong\u003EdeltaV=ln(M\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E/M\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003E)*V\u003Csub\u003Eex\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E: that is, the deltaV is equal to the logaritm of the ration between the wet mass (M\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E) and the dry mass (M\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003E) of your ship, times the velocity of your exhaust gases (V\u003Csub\u003Eex\u003C/sub\u003E) - which is equal to Isp*g.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to increase deltaV, there are only two things you can do: increase Isp, or increase the Mw/Md ratio. You don\u0027t want to increase Isp, so you\u0027ve got to increase the Mw/Md. Which goes threefold:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na) reduce the weight of the payload. self-explaining\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nb) increase the amount of fuel. again, self-explaining\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nc) use multiple stages. As the amount of fuel you bring increases, the mass of dry fuel tanks increases too. And of course, to lift all that stuff, you need a big heavy engine. So after you burned most of your fuel, you want to ditch all those empty, useless, heavy spent fuel tanks. And you want to ditch that big powerful engine that\u0027s no longer needed, and use something smaller and lighter instead. Drop tanks are also an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, you can\u0027t prevent the mass from skyrocketing fast as you increase deltaV. Say your probe weights 1 ton, and you want 2 ton of fuel to give it 3 km/s. then if you want to add 3 more km/s, you need to make another stage with the same 3:1 ratio between dry and wet mass, so you need 9 tons. An additional 3 km/s will again require three times more mass than before, so 27 tons. Three more km/3, to bring the total to 12 km/s, and you\u0027re at 81 tons. And then 240, and so on. Past a certain size, rockets become hugely impractical. Which is why people prefer to use orbital mechanics to reduce deltaV requirememnts as much as possible, and to use more efficient engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis game lets you \u0022cheat\u0022 by mining new fuel everywhere cheaply. that also reduces the deltaV required. of course, if you\u0027re using kerbalism, then you\u0027re not supposed to use that - or you\u0027re supposed to use the kerbalism \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E functionalities, which make refueling less practical than the alternatives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) it\u0027s not exactly required that high deltaV=low thrust; the rocket equation has nothing on thrust. However, there are two practical factors that link high deltaV to low thrust:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na) to maximize deltaV you want an engine optimized for efficiency. those tend to have lower thrust\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nb) to reduce your dry mass you want a smaller engine. and of course this means less thrust than with a bigger engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, nothing to do there. you want to maximize your deltaV, you can do it by sacrificing thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding your concerns with kerbalism, yes, it requires a lot of additional life support resources, but not too much. in the end, the mass of the food and water and oxygen is still a pittance compared to that of the living space. My suggestion there is that it\u0027s still a lot more convenient to add more supplies for a longer trip, than it is to add more fuel to travel faster. One kerbal can live one year with less than 100 kg of resources. To shorten the trip by one year, you could easily need to double the mass of your ship. Put three redundant units for everything essential, and you\u0027ll be fine regarding malfunctions, too. you can easily last 20\u002B years that way if your ship is well made. Again, it\u0027s a lot cheaper than making a ship three times bigger to have a shorter trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) you can take a look at my kerbalism grand tours linked in my signature; but the short answer is, with a BIG ship.

Water is rare, a lot of planets don\u0027t have it, others only have it in one or two biomes. Carbon dioxide can be extracted cheaply by the atmosphere of Duna, or by that of Eve (but Eve has no water, so you can\u0027t do anything with it). Otherwise you need to extract it from ore, which is a process so energy intensive that I needed 500 tons of concert-o-trons and 20000 electricity/second to produce no more than 1 ton of fuel/day. I had to get nuclear power plants from near future to get enough energy, and that added the additional requirement that the landing zone would also have uranium.

Be aware that all those decouplers and fuel lines (and struts) add dry mass, so it may make sense to use fewer, larger/longer tanks, especially as you get down to the smaller diameters.
