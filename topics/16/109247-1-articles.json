You can also right click on the monoprop tank in the small ship and click the small green triangle to disable that tank, ensuring it won\u0027t be used during ascent.\n\nEdit: Ninja\u0027d"},{"CreatedByName":"wobatt","CreatedById":144013,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T19:55:16Z","Content":"Thanks both!
