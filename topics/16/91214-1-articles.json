If I have to design a different space plane for every single part, it might be better to just launch a few at once with a bigger rocket.

Building a plane around a cargo isn\u0027t the right way for me. Because i want a plane witch i can use whenever i want and don\u0027t have one risticted only for one mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had the some problems, when i first tried to build a sort of space shuttle with the new parts. The first plane sucked really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen i had an idea for getting the payload bays in the vincinety of the CoW/CoM. Pairing them beside the fueselage of the craft. The result is the Excalibur:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the payload bays are smaller (shorter) then i wanted them (they consist one big and one small one).

The outter tanks are usually empty, but can be used in to have the max fuel ammount availible - the craft weights then 60t (normal weight 50t, dry 29t). With sutch an configuration i flew to Duna, using up all that fuel (i barely made it).

He had a pretty comprehensive guide on the subject going for v0.24.2, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/223333-ksp-space-plane-construction-and-operation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elocated here\u003C/a\u003E. The guide focuses on the use of the RAPIER engine (largely to keep part count and mass/drag down) in stock aero. So far the only thing I\u0027ve seen that\u0027s undergone major changes between 0.24.2 and 0.25 is that the new Wing Connectors are functionally equivalent to Delta Wings, Shock Cone Intakes are equivalent to 1.2 Ram Intakes and 4 of the new Structural Intakes are roughly equivalent to a single Shock Cone Intake. I have heard that the RAPIER was nerfed as well but I do not know how. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Doc utilizes approach number 2 - designing around the spaceplane. His guide includes numbers you can utilize based on the number of engines in the design; from there you have a \u0022maximum take off weight\u0022 for which you can set the rest of the plane\u0027s general attributes. In his guide he builds a three engine craft - he knows his maximum takeoff weight will be 39 tonnes simply based on that general design premise (13 tonnes per RAPIER is the guideline he gives) and he designs the rest of the plane based on the assumption that it\u0027ll be 39 tonnes when it\u0027s done. His final plane winds up with an unloaded weight of 27.39 tonnes, leaving 11.61 tonnes for payload. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe does have a design capable of lifting a 27 tonne space station core, if you\u0027re curious. Biiiig plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the big issue is making sure the CoM of the payload aligns with the CoM of the plane - shifting CoM in flight can (and occasionally has) rendered aircraft unflyable in mid-air in RL, with the expected outcome. RCS Build Aid is a powerful mod tool when it comes to spaceplane design for this very reason (I would consider it an essential mod for anybody who spaceplanes frequently, much like I\u0027d recommend Docking Alignment Indicator, KER or KAC).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T14:24:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-post\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a good guide.
