Space stations have a tendency to grow organically when they are in active use. Eventually even the best designed and most maneuverable station will grow into an ugly wobbling mess, where the last free docking ports are surrounded by all kinds of obstacles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis discussion inspired me to move my LKO station from a 120 km orbit to a 160 km orbit to reduce lag.
