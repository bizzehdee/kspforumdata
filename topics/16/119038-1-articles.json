Quite honestly though it\u0027s irrelevant. Accept the first couple of contracts (Usually launch a vessel and collect science data) and you will get the altitude and speed records automatically as you progress.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FTWG4M3RS","CreatedById":125265,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T05:52:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei mean like what are the fastest people have gone on land and in air\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T11:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want to check the Challenges section of the forum for things like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fastest surface vehicle I know of was about 450m/s, I think that was in a Scott Manley video though (and may have been before 1.0).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for in air, it depends what rules you\u0027re setting. Is re-entry allowed, or are you talking about planes below a certain altitude? Re-entry could be up to any speed really, including speeds higher than lightspeed. Atmo-only aircraft will be limited by thrust:drag ratio and obviously too much speed would result in orbit. The fastest I\u0027ve personally ever flown on jets only was 1800m/s but that was back in alpha.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
