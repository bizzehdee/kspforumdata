So I started working on the reaction system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think what I\u0027m going to do is re-build the design starting with a small probe core in the middle, maybe that will eliminate all the odd issues I\u0027m getting in the VAB with this build.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T15:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could add empty command pods, they give off much more torque\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T19:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYa, ever since I downloaded this escape pod mod (awesome mod btw) I\u0027ve been thinking about a \u0022Multiple launch Escape Pod System\u0022. The \u0022mod pod\u0022 is a single seater, but includes all its own systems (RCS, engines, etc). So maybe this will be my excuse to come up with that \u0022MLEPS\u0022 and tack it on for control of my trucks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did take the time today to rebuild the truck from scratch and I am much happier with the results. Thanks to Temstar, I picked up his pack of launchers and tacked on his Zenith VII. I\u0027m still working out the kinks though because the zenith VII and my 2nd stage are not getting along (ie the rocket explodes upon leaving Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere (always fails at the same decoupler no matter how many struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have a little work to do on it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T03:17:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SpaceTech escape pod is nice indeed. Glad to know you\u0027re making progress! If you wanna learn, you can try taking aparpt Temstar\u0027S rockets.
