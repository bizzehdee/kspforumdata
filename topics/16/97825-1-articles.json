Can I remove this text to make the cinema look nicer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMrred1\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steelsunoa","CreatedById":135938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T07:15:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, I don\u0027t think so. You could try using / to remove everything off the screen before switching crafts, but I don\u0027t think it will recognize [ when the HUD is removed. Worth a shot, but I think you will just need to edit it out after recording. Best of luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mrred1","CreatedById":114193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T02:48:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you so much \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
