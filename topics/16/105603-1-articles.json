I fiddled with the fairing for like 20 minutes now and wasn\u0027t able to build one.\n\nI know i have to move the cursor so i get the green \u0022Close Fairing\u0022 - But either the text is red or i get only the intersect option.\n\nIs there some limitation to which parts can be shielded or what has to be on the upper side of the fairing that it is possible to be closed?\n\nI already did one in the VAB but after a click on \u0022Edit fairing\u0022 i wasn\u0027t even able to rebuild the exact same fairing with the exact same craft.\n\nAm i doing something wrong?\n\nThank you in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T13:16:12Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been able to make an interstage fairing sometimes, but not reliably (even when encasing the exact same module). Sometimes it seems to allow a \u0022tube\u0022 like structure, then other times it won\u0027t let you. Kinda frustrating, so I\u0027d also like some help/tips with this.\n\nThis is one interstage I\u0027ve managed to make;\n\n[![ZvKfeXcl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZvKfeXcl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/ZvKfeXc)[![96ZlpEGl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/96ZlpEGl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/96ZlpEG)\n\nBut I can\u0027t reliably re-make it. Note; the top part of that fairing clips into the headshield module (and sometimes get stuck there on separation). I don\u0027t really want the top part of the fairing but if I try and remake it, I\u0027m unable to get it to work at all. Nothing inside the fairing clips with the fairing so I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it\u0027s issue.\n\nThis is one that I\u0027d like to make but cannot find any way of getting it to work;\n\n[![wLpOh4Gl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wLpOh4Gl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/wLpOh4G)\n\n[![sUThw74l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sUThw74l.jpg)](http://imgur.com/sUThw74)\n\nIn the second image im just showing what I want, I can\u0027t actually make it create."},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T13:55:44Z","Content":"update - having reloaded the craft I was then able to build the lower interstage fairing just as I wanted. still can\u0027t successfully remake the upper one though. So I was able to make an interstage fairing, but still have no idea what the \u0022rules\u0022 are for doing it reliably."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T03:11:52Z","Content":"I find that sometimes I need to pull the mouse slightly away from the piece I\u0027m connecting to, horizontally. So the mouse isn\u0027t quite touching the part. It seems to depend a bit on what the part is that you\u0027re connecting to.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
