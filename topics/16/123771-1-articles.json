If you can aerobrake, that would help a lot. Jool itself is notoriously unfriendly for aerobraking in 1.04, but Laythe may be an option, depending on your speed and your ship design. Can you give more details about your ship?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 1, land on Laythe. Adjust course for Laythe intercept long before entering Jool system, this will take trivial amounts of dV. Just before hitting Laythe atmosphere, retro-burn all of your fuel, both to soften the aerobraking blow and to lighten the load. Aerocapture, then land with parachutes. Or if you don\u0027t have chutes, save a little fuel for slowing down to a safe speed just before landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis option assumes your ship is tough enough to handle aerobraking, and either has chutes or else enough TWR to do a powered landing on Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 2. While still well outside Jool\u0027s SoI, adjust Jool periapsis down to just above atmosphere. Right at periapsis, do a big retro-burn to capture to Jool. Hope you have enough dV to lower your Ap down to a Pol or Bop intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis option assumes that your Jool-relative velocity is low enough for 1600 m/s to achieve capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 3. Reverse Tylo slingshot. Similar to option 2, but instead of low Jool periapsis, you set up a low Tylo periapsis, on the LEADING side of Tylo. Periapsis should be as toe-scorchingly low as you can manage without lithobraking. This takes advantage of Tylo\u0027s orbital motion to slow you down, in addition to getting Oberth effect from the burn at low periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe elephant in the room here, no matter what you try, is how fast you\u0027re moving relative to Jool when you enter its SoI.

By setting up a maneuver node near your ship while you are in interplanetary space, you can adjust your trajectory until it interacts with Tylo (or Laythe, or even Vall).

Not sure if I can land on Pol, I got an accidental encounter. Anyone tell me \u0022how\u0022 to set up the Tylo encounter?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPol is orbiting slowly around Jool, so you may need more dV to go directly there. I usually do a Pol refuelling but I\u0027ve enough fuel for that brake. You must tweak your manoeuvre node to encounter Tylo (it\u0027s much easier than encounter Pol...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would do it that way (but I\u0027m not an expert...) :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If planes are too different, try to align to cross Tylo orbital plane in a flattest angle (it\u0027s the same as Laythe and Vall)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Then try to find Tylo encounter buy tweaking the node. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Set your trajectory to cross Tylo SOI in _front_ of it (so you\u0027ll be slowed). Get a 10km PE to Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Check you resulting orbit, you may tweak to get descent inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you need to slowdown, the Tylo PE is the best location. You can evaluate this burn by setting it in advance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Try to get you resulting orbit up to Pol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course you must avoid ending in a retrograde orbit around Jool\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS : even if set, I suggest you recheck projected orbits when entering Jool SOI, then when entering Tylo SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Precise node\u0022 mod help quite a lot with node tweaking. MJ also has a \u0022node editor\u0022 to do the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T15:46:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENew problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am stuck in a super eccentric orbit with only 1.3 km/s of delta-v.

Make a maneuver node a few minutes away from your current position. Give it -5.3 prograde, 72.5 normal, and -18 radial. That should set you up with your ascending node out at your apoapsis, and a Jool periapsis of 530 km or so. Then a burn out at your apo to correct your inclination should cost under 100 m/s.
