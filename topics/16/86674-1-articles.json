The SRBs are cheap and get the lifter up to speed off the pad while the LFO core sustains the launch, picking up speed slowly as it climbs. I usually get the lifter to around a 75 km Pe and stage at ~ 2 km/s velocity so the lifter re-enters. I use the upper stage engine to complete the orbital insertion (I consider \u0022Upper stages\u0022 to be part of the payload).

A Mk-1 lander can with sixteen radial chutes, 4 Z-100 batts, 4 big lander legs, a Jumbo-64, an X200-32 and a Mainsail could make Kerbin orbit (4622 m/s delta-V assuming constant seal level Isp with a launch TWR of 2.45), deorbit and land safely at elevations below 5000 meters. Any of the lighter sci instruments attached wouldn\u0027t affect the delta-V all that much and the lifter has more than sufficient thrust for the job. You could easily launch an assembly like that, make LKO and return to Kerbin with the whole thing intact. Set your periapsis to 44-45k meters above KSC prior to re-entry, and you can even do a complete return to sender. Whole thing costs a little over 30,000 funds. The trick is flying it - from the get-go the Mainsail provides you waaaay more thrust than you need and it\u0027ll only get worse as the ascent progresses. Start by following the terminal velocity curve to 10,000 meters (benchmarks are 100 m/s at 1000 meters, 130 at 3000, 160 at 5000, 210 and 8000 and 260 and 10,000).

Pitch down will be completed at like 16000 meters. Slowly climb and accelerate, with the goal of hitting about 1400 m/s at like 23000 or 24000 meters. Peak TWR is over 2.5. Eventually, the rocket will autoswitch to closed cycle, but that usually happens due to a thrust asymmetry developing due to the thin air (causing the craft to yaw, further reducing engine air supply and triggering the autoswitch), so you should have an action group to switch to closed cycle when either you\u0027re ready, or the moment a thrust asymmetry begins to develop (you\u0027ll save a bit on efficiency). Now, you pitch up at like 45 degrees, maybe 50 degrees and burn closed cycle until the apoapsis is above the atmosphere. Once that is done, you just cut off the engines and wait for the circularization burn, which should only be 400 m/s or 500 m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel payload fraction (mass of fuel delivered to orbit/mass of fuel on pad) is around 60%, I believe. I never added it up and checked though. It\u0027s a remarkably high number, FAR better than I EVER got from a traditional space plane. The spacecraft can deliver a full Jumbo64 tank to a waiting spacecraft or orbital fuel depot in LKO, while requiring slightly less than that (I think) to put it up there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I don\u0027t know exactly how much it takes is because the RAPIER engines are located on \u0022nacelles\u0022 that are fuel tanks themselves.
