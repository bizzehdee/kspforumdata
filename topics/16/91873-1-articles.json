This will lead to poor framerates on the menu screen and when flying low part count ships. KSP\u0027s not super-demanding in this respect but it is a 3D game. Solution is to reduce graphical detail and/or resolution, or get a better graphics card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoor graphics drivers. Same symptoms, solution is to get better drivers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Water lag\u0022, which I think is a particular case of lack of GPU power. This will lead to poor performance when looking at Kerbin but good performance when looking at the sky. Solution is to create a custom terrain detail preset in settings.cfg and reduce the detail values for the oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysics lag. This will lead to slowdown with high part-count ships. Framerate will actually be OK until the part count gets extreme but the timer will be yellow and the \u0022Physics Time Ratio\u0022 in the debug stats will be less than 1x. Solution is to get a faster processor or use lower part-count ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re video editing, there is one more option: fix the slowdown in editing. Depending on the exact issue this might work more or less well; a recording affected by physics lag can be simply sped up but one affected by lacking graphical power not so much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Th3F3aR","CreatedById":124827,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T15:04:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell it might not be the best setup for this task but it should work with acceptable framerates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI expect your graphics card to be the major issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut im afraid you need to tune some settings down and stick to rockets with less parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe code is \u0022possibly\u0022 not optimized but the loads of stuff KSP itself got to render, calculate etc. is performance hungry.
