However, this rocket shakes itself apart constantly and despite the fuel lines feeding symmetrically through the bottom stage, the fuel does not, which sends my rocket into an insane spin when one of the final mainsails suddenly has half a tank of fuel left and the other doesn\u0027t. The connected large fuel tanks also like to sometimes fail. No idea why it\u0027s only sometimes though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done what I can, but it\u0027s now beyond what I\u0027m capable of fixing.

Also after testing your launcher I did a few parachute tests on the way down, might want to swap the mk16-xl chutes for mk25s and possibly also move some of the radial parachutes onto the main lander body. I had a few RCS tanks/parachutes come off (even after a couple extra struts) during testing.
