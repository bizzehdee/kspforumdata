Decide which part on the rover is going to attach to the rocket. Switch to the reroot gizmo and click that part twice. Then make it a subassembly. Build your rocket, load up the rover subassembly, and attach it.\n\nAs for where to put the rover, you have a few options:\n\nOn top of the lander. Add small rockets on the rover and a little fuel so it can fly itself clear after the lander has touched down. Alternatively add a big ramp down the side of the lander.\n\nOn the side of the lander. Add a balance load on the other side - maybe a second rover, maybe some static science equipment. Alternatively, make a lander with more than one engine and use thrust limiters to keep it in line.\n\nUnderneath the lander.

Duh. There\u0027s almost no justification for *not* making the rover and the lander the same thing, not when wheels are so lightweight. I can\u0027t understand why so few people to do this. It\u0027s *by far* better than making a separate detachable lander, except for like, Eve (where such a thing is impossible) and *maybe* Tylo (though I\u0027ve made single stage lander/rovers for Tylo even), because you simplify your lander so much by doing so, and the lander and rover system becomes 100% reusable. ADDITIONALLY, your rover gains the ability to simply *fly* over impassible terrain, because except on Tylo, you\u0027ll have enough extra DV to make multiple landings. It\u0027s a win-win-win design.\n\nThis is an old Duna rover I made a year back. It was capable of landing on Duna and returning to orbit all by itself. Oh and would also work on the Mun, Ike, etc. The lander in the screenshot was an over-designed (it was actually better than I needed) single stage to-ground-and-back-to-orbit Tylo/Kerbin lander, I was just testing it out on Duna.\n\n![FS26ji1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FS26ji1.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T18:13:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 06:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T01:23:49Z","Content":"![3E2FB6AED4AF3BD2BE9B76CE68F20428CEA32400](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531745346243235481/3E2FB6AED4AF3BD2BE9B76CE68F20428CEA32400/)\n\n![D3640CF3B0D336942549C532E3A626A6A4F7DAC9](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531748876017389197/D3640CF3B0D336942549C532E3A626A6A4F7DAC9/)\n\nI sure miss Tarsier tech.\n\n![40DBB83848CD49D6C5A7E0F5E68064FCF22F42C6](http://cloud-2.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531745346204331810/40DBB83848CD49D6C5A7E0F5E68064FCF22F42C6/)\n\nOn the way to Moho.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-03T01:27:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2015 01:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aethon**"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T01:46:43Z","Content":"You can put half of your rover on each side of your lander\n\n![RTElFN6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RTElFN6.jpg)\n\nAnd then assemble it when you arrive\n\n![HP4yfSk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HP4yfSk.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T02:28:01Z","Content":"Lots of good suggestions here.
