I had to ACTIVATE the engine when all the ticks were green. Ended up creating a empty stage below my engine one, and manually activating the engine, then pressing spacebar once all was green.

It doesn\u0027t operate any differently to staging to the engine under normal conditions, the contract specification is basically \u0022stage to this engine when the conditions are met\u0022.
