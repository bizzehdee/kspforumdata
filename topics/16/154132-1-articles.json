When you\u0027re plotting the Hohmann transfer, is it more efficient to aim at the L1 point (just at the very inner edge of the Mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E) or as close to the Mun\u0027s orbital distance as you can? In other words, is it better to do the capture burn from the edge of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E or from as close as possible to the Mun\u0027s surface?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy inclination (no pun intended) is to think a close burn is more efficient, thanks to Oberth. But I\u0027m not sure how the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E patched conics really affect things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-28T20:09:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs low as possible for your capture burn, but inclination changes are best done as slow (i.e. high) as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-28T20:42:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsevenperforce,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it your intention to enter low munar orbit?
