If they had mass, they would be very tricky to use outside of atmospheres because of the CoM issues they would cause. They will likely be given mass (though perhaps less than they currently have) in some future update, when part balancing and tweaking is performed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T00:08:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey haven\u0027t had mass in a very long time, so don\u0027t hold your breath waiting for them to acquire mass.
