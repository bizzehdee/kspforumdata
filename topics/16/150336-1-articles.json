Best bet is to make a savegame, disable all the mods, hop a meter off the ground, land again, and see what the contracts do. If they all get updated properly then add one\u00A0mod\u00A0back at a time, reload the savegame, and try the hop trick again -- until it fails. Then you know that the last mod you added was the culprit.
