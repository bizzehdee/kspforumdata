The problem is almost certainly coming from the lost fuel mass. If your radial tanks are 3/4 empty then instead of your engines spnding most of their energy speeding up the own fuel tanks, they are tranferring more force to the main rocket. This extra force can often break connections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also help avoid this by reducing throttle as the tanks have less fuel and by keeping your ascent on the slower side of terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes a \u0022crush\u0022 can occur even in a single column. To avoid this I turn off the tank at the bottom of the rocket and pull fuel from the top instead.
