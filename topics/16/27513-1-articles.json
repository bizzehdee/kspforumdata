With enough tweaking though you can devise a plan to manage your center of mass for better RCS design and docking. Consider different ways you can manage fuel flow to drain the tanks in an order that starts on the outside, top and bottom, and moves toward the center. Also consider control groups for toggleable RCS thrusters at the extremeties, in the event you need to deal with a shifted load, or a staged rendezvous module.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dortmunder","CreatedById":66018,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T15:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to check this out when I have some more spare time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETag \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
