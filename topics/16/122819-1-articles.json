What I\u0027m essentially doing is attaching a spacecraft on top of a plane through a series of radial decouplers for a high-altitude launch/separation. I have one TT-38k Radial Decoupler attaching the two craft, but attaching any more seem impossible, and so the spacecraft just collapses into the plane on the runway with only one infrastructural attachment inbetween. The other TT-38k Radial Decouplers are there, but won\u0027t make surface to surface connection because the part is already \u0022attached\u0022, without sacrificing the part\u0027s node connection with the rest of the craft to make this surface to surface connection. I\u0027m in science mode and haven\u0027t advanced that far into part acquisition, so there may be a part I haven\u0027t unlocked yet that does this very function (but I haven\u0027t found anything on wikis that indicate as such) I\u0027ve tried every kind of work around I can think of and have looked around the internet for answers, but it just isn\u0027t happening. Basically I need a surface to surface attachment with pre-existing node attachments (with stage detachment), which honestly should be a feature in this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know of some work-around/mod/part/something else I\u0027m possibly missing for this?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-11T23:24:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2015 11:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cruendithas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T22:53:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, that\u0027s correct.
