I\u0027m trying to move from orbital mechanics and the occasional docking maneuver to planetary outposts, but the methods of doing so are evading me. Specifically, I can\u0027t for the life of me figure out how to build structures designed to dock on the ground. I mean yeah, it\u0027s easy enough to just have horizontal cylinders with landing struts center-mounted, but what about vehicles? And how the heck do you dock something on the ground anyway? I think I\u0027ve managed it once... and that was practically by accident while over-correcting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest problem is getting docking ports line up on anything other than practically-identical structures. It\u0027s not exactly practical to test them by launching one on the launch pad, and then the rover from the runway and spending 5 minutes driving over every time I want to tweak the alignment of something. Heck, I can\u0027t even eyeball it, since landing struts can\u0027t be extended in the building interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny rule-of-thumb tips, maybe?
