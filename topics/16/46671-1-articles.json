I\u0027ve tried messing with the resolution, I saw some posts on reddit and the steam forums, that the game supports multiple monitors. However when ever I try setting a 5760x1080, the game itself dosn\u0027t change, however in the settings menu in-game, it sets it to 1024x768 but only in the displayed text the actual resolution is 1920x1080.

Sometimes it misbehaves in ways it didn\u0027t used to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I had a pair of side tanks attached with decouplers to a center tank, placed with two-way symmetry on. Then it\u0027s just a simple matter of running a fuel line from one of the side tanks to the center one, and the other tank gets the same hookup. But lately I\u0027ve seen cases where the fuel line thinks the symmetry is centered on the one tank I\u0027m working with, and places a fuel line on both sides of it. The only way I can make it behave is by attaching it, then detaching and trying again. Then the symmetry works properly. Weird!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
