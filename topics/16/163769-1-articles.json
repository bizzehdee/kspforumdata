Gilly and Minmus aren\u0027t. A tidally locked moon rotates around itself in the same time it rotates around its planet, this means that it is always showing the same face to its planet. The Moon IRL is tidally locked to the Earth: we only see one side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile a moon may be tidally locked to its planet, it doesn\u0027t mean that it doesn\u0027t have a night and day cycle. The \u0022dark side of the Moon\u0022 is not always dark, it has a day/night cycle as long as its rotation period (which is the same as its orbital period since it\u0027s tidally locked): the \u0022dark\u0022 side of the Moon is fully lighted by the Sun during new moons.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s the same for all the moons in KSP: they have a day/night cycle where each day lasts one rotation period, whether or not they are tidally locked. When standing on a tidally locked moon, the planet it is orbiting will appear not to move at all even if days and nights happen (it would move north and south in the sky if the moon has a non-zero inclination, like Bop and Pol).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a body to not have any day/night cycle it would need to have a rotation period equal to its orbital period \u003Cem\u003Earound the

orbit is eccentric.\u00A0 This is because the moon\u0027s orbital angular velocity is variable (faster at perispsis and slower at apoapsis), but its rotational angular velocity is constant.\u00A0 So for a tidally locked moon in both an inclined* and eccentric orbit, the parent planet in the moon\u0027s sky will oscillate in both north-south and east-west directions, resulting in the planet tracing out a small figure 8 pattern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also means that even for a tidally locked moon, it\u0027s possible to observe more than half its surface from the parent planet.\u00A0 At times in a moon\u0027s orbit, parts along the moon\u0027s limb that were previously hidden from view will rotate into view, while parts on the opposite side will rotate out of view.\u00A0 This is called \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libration\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elibration\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 From Earth we can, over time, see about 59% of our moon\u0027s surface.\u00A0 Of course we can never see more than 50% at any one time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(edit)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Technically it\u0027s not the inclination of the orbit that matters, but the inclination of the moon\u0027s rotational axis relative to its orbital plane.\u00A0 In KSP, however, it\u0027s one in the same.\u00A0 All bodies in KSP have axes that are normal to the ecliptic plane.\u00A0 So if we incline the orbit relative to the ecliptic, we also incline the axis relative to the orbital plane normal by the same amount.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime

tidally locked moons do have day-night cycles, the days and nights can last a long time.\u00A0 Pol, for instance, has an orbital period and day with a duration equal to about 42 Kerbin days.\u00A0 This means you will have 21 days of sunlight followed by 21 days of darkness.\u00A0 The long nights is something you have to take into consideration when planning something like a moon base.\u00A0 Even Mun, with is relatively short period, still has night that lasts nearly 20 hours, compared to only 3 hours on Kerbin.\u00A0 If you are using solar panels for power, you must be certain to provide
