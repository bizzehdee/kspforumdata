I was running low on fuel, so I decided to just put it down on the flat poles, ( and TBH, i was not in any type of mood to fly this rust bucket back for another 2 1/2 hours). I was curios as to what the the local temp was, and lo and behold, a scorching 456 degrees ferenheight! I though it might have been just some heat build up from my descent, but the fastest speed i ever hit was just over 105 m/s, not even close to fast enough to build up so much heat. I also double checked with 2 other pairs of thermometers, all giving me this same number. \n\nIs this just a bug? or is there some other explanation for this high temp?\n\n-Sky\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T02:52:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Skylid**"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T05:41:23Z","Content":"Four points:\n\n1. The thermometer measures in degrees Kelvin, so a reading of 456 = 183 degrees Celsius or 361 degrees Fahrenheit;\n2. The thermometer measures its own temperature, which is not necessarily the same as that of its surroundings;\n3. The \u0022surroundings\u0022 include the body of the aircraft, thus including heat production both from air friction and from engines;\n4. SR-71 Blackbirds, for example, had canopy temperatures approaching 300 degrees Celsius when landing after a mission.\n\nSo such \u0022high\u0022 temperatures are not entirely out of the realms of sanity."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T07:21:32Z","Content":"Yes, all of what DeMatt says definitely holds true.\n\nAdditionally the game should give you reasonable readings (in Kelvin) at the poles. However, it\u0027s also possible that the game is still generating numbers that are a bit off from what you would expect in \u0022reality\u0022 since it\u0027s all coming from a series of formulas.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"aleis","CreatedById":62823,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:24:28Z","Content":"Well aside from the fact it doesn\u0027t take account for the temperature in space or on a planet with no atmosphere being heavily influenced on sun light. \n\nTemps.
