You know, basic.\n\nI want to reach an apoapsis of 2868.7km - but I need to time my Hoffman transfer burn so that I\u0027m right over KSC when reaching the desired apoapsis.\n\nI still got a calculator, that I\u0027ve made some times ago:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuhR8b-OEB0OdDVORnh5ZHVtQmp1NTdBUE85OGtZV2c#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuhR8b-OEB0OdDVORnh5ZHVtQmp1NTdBUE85OGtZV2c#gid=0)\n\nIt gives me an Hoffman Transfer time from 100km to 2868km of 1h23m50s - give or take, 85 minutes.\n\nGiven that Kerbin rotates at 1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 per minutes, to me, I need to burn right when I\u0027m over the 159\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0W point on Kerbin - that is, 74\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (KSC Location) \u002B 85\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (Kerbin rotation during the Hoffman Transfer).\n\nBut....I\u0027m ending over the 64/65\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0W point. I know there are some approximations, but any way I try, either manual or with Mechjeb, I\u0027m always in this ballpark, 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 away from my intended destination.\n\nSo...I\u0027m missing something. There is a parameter somewhere that I\u0027m forgetting.\n\nAny of you have an idea?\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T12:46:23Z","Content":"Unless you burn instantly, the burn itself takes time.

So I tried to burn 50/50 around the \u0022burn time\u0022. I gave it a few tries. I tried burning more \u0022before\u0022. I tried burning more \u0022after\u0022\n\nI even relaunched another probe, this one with a 3.5 TWR - cutting the burn time to a few seconds. Again, did some tests.\n\nAnd I\u0027m always short. It seems I need to burn over the 170\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0W point , not the 160\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0W point (again, all things considered equal)\n\nAnd I don\u0027t understand why, and I won\u0027t be able to sleep.\n\nYes, there is always the possibilities that approximations and burn time are playing a role - but I\u0027m 90%, if not 99%, sure it doesn\u0027t equal to a 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 difference."},{"CreatedByName":"Redhaze","CreatedById":137633,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T13:08:34Z","Content":"be aware - kerbin\u0027s surface gravity may have changed since then, throwing off your calculations exponentionally."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T13:15:45Z","Content":"ikehaiku,\n\n Funny, I just did this very thing yesterday for a challenge [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121635-KASA-Preferred-Vendor-challenge-1)\n\n Because there\u0027s a challenge on, I can\u0027t just come out and tell you...![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n I think what you\u0027re missing is that you don\u0027t need to start your transfer at KSC\u002Btransfer time, but rather the opposite.\n\nYour periapsis needs to be at where KSC\u0027s antipode will be 85 minutes after the burn.\n\nApologies,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"ikehaiku","CreatedById":74589,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T13:25:58Z","Content":"I think you\u0027re right - I\u0027m just messing up things in my head...so, back to the drawing board - and I may enter your challenge then ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
