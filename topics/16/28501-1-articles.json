Unless you have absolute confidence in your ability to \u0022suicide burn,\u0022 don\u0027t try to come in for a landing straight from your Mun intercept. Circularize into a low orbit first, usually somewhere between 5 and 10 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. From your low orbit, you basically want to do a reverse gravity turn -- start killing your horizontal velocity, then follow your retrograde marker as it approaches vertical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If, during your final descent, you start to find yourself drifting, don\u0027t turn all the way to the retrograde marker; a slight nudge in its general direction is usually enough to correct for any lateral movement and is much less likely to result in a situation where you\u0027ll need to \u0022panic burn\u0022 to get control over your descent back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Jedi Master","CreatedById":57348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T18:51:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, they don\u0027t have nearly enough fuel to return, but:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S3sSRDS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S3sSRDS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T18:51:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuicksave, quicksave, quicksave. Just try different approach burns and see if they end in fiery death or not. As for your Mun launcher, simply aim for about 7500 m/s total.
