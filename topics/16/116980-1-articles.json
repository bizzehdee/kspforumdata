Much increased mass, it\u0027s 3 tons now. So watch out if your design has several LV-N\u0027s on it. You may want to get by with a lower TWR than previously (i.e. put fewer LV-N\u0027s on). Otherwise, the increased mass of the engines could offset much of the benefit from having higher Isp.\n\n2. The need for LF-only, instead of LFO, means making new decisions about fuel tanks. Mk3 has some decent LF-only tanks, or you could go with an approach like Red Iron Crown\u0027s above."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T15:25:34Z","Content":"As weird and totally boring as it might sound, I actually use ion tugs, but only for Hydrogen delivery units."},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T15:26:30Z","Content":"If it only tugs between planets/moons, I don\u0027t see how anything but the most simple designs would be of any benefit. Slap on as many engines as you can bear (the more, the less burn time), enough fuel for the intended destination and payload, and RCS that\u0027s balanced for the tug itself.\n\nNow if the tug was used to perform orbital construction or any other kind of maneuvers, then you have a bigger challenge - your RCS would need to be balanced with the extra payload mass in mind, and that\u0027s no easy feat. In those cases, the way I usually do it, is the tug\u0027s RCS is balanced for itself, and then when I design the payload in the VAB, I load up the tug as a subassembly and attach their docking ports - then I add RCS on the payload in such a way as to balance them together. The payload does not need any RCS fuel, only the RCS thrusters. That way when they are docked in space, they are balanced for maneuvers. And if you don\u0027t want the RCS left over after construction is done, you can place them on pylons or octagonal struts attached to small decouplers that you can jettison at the end of construction."},{"CreatedByName":"spudman2","CreatedById":84199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T20:03:56Z","Content":"Ahh, I see, these are good ideas.

The \u0027nozzle\u0027 is actually a light, presumably there for assistance when docking.\n\nFrom my calculations, the delta-v a full tug would have is roughly 5700 m/s, and with a 20t payload, just shy of 3000 m/s.

Your part clipping is messing with my idealized equations! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nSome helpful tips:\n\nDesign your tug to be propulsion only with a docking port. You can use the port to attach any extras. My standby SSTO cargo (for when I fly crew missions) is a dockable claw with chutes. Works great for recovery contract and limits the potential harm of claw use.\n\n800 units of LF an engine is the break even point for mass efficiency vs chemical rockets. Design to at least that tankage and run light until you need that dV if possible.\n\nUse more than one tug design. My current work horse is 2 Mk1 tanks, 1 engine, airbrakes, RCS, and a docking port. Can accelerate my RCS scan sats by about 4 km/s and has enough power for every recovery contact. My Minmus habitation ring OTOH is being delivered by a tug that has 4 times the engines (and fuel) with some extra fuel stored in the ring\u0027s structure. My true interstellar tugs will be multi section behemoths so I can get 80\u002B t accelerated by 4-5 km/s with \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 initial TWR.
