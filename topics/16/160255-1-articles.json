It makes your chopper even more uncontrollable. The rotor is what provides you thrust. In basic, the rotor must be placed directly on the center of mass. During takeoff, do not use full throttle, start slow, steadily raise your throttle until your chopper visibly lifting off. To move forward tilt your chopper slightly downward (slowly press W) so the rotor that provides lifting force can push your chopper forward. To move backward, tilt your chopper slightly upward (slowly press S) this will allow the rotor to \u0022brake\u0022 your forward speed until it begin to push your chopper backward. Turn your chopper around with A or D before performing the same process to move forward or backward to change your heading. Adding jet engine makes your problem even more complicated since it means there\u0027s 2 source of thrust on your chopper that leads to different vector, making it more difficult to control. The main rotor is your lifting engine and your main engine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: to show center of mass, thrust and lift, there\u0027s 3 buttons on the lower left screen during the construction of your craft (near symmetry option) the center of mass is yellow-black sphere.

The thing is, it\u0027s very difficult to control your chopper to hover and then lower it to the ground slowly. Take note of how much throttle needed at minimum to lift your chopper, this can save you when you try to land. Landing can be done by slowing your chopper first until horizontal velocity becomes as low as possible before cutting of throttle (don\u0027t turn off the engine) when your vertical velocity start to drop, raise the throttle (don\u0027t forget to deploy your landing gear beforehand) if you think you are going down too fast, don\u0027t be shy to throttle higher until you regain some vertical velocity and your rate of descent begin slows down during which you can lower the throttle again (Repeat until you touch the ground, for small chopper, recommended safe landing speed is same like small aircraft (depend on your landing gear))\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhere\u0027s an example of chopper design (I\u0027m using coaxial rotor because it makes the chopper looks like KA-50):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UiUk3M8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UiUk3M8.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022e8PPZ1e.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e8PPZ1e.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223G0e4xM.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3G0e4xM.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote the position of center of thrust with center of mass\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you mastered how to control the basic chopper design, you can start making your tandem rotor chopper or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E chopper or even...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022649AjUh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/649AjUh.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quadrotor \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jackstech","CreatedById":176761,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-06T03:26:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntake out the jet engines and manover in a \u0022gentle way\u0022 solve the most of the problems. but now i have another question; there is a way to hoover\u00A0 or know a mod that have a rotor that have that option?\u00A0 and THX FOR THE HELP i been working 3 weeks without luck on this project !you save me\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyour second post with the adices give me a better ideas, thx again for the help you rocks !!!!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-06T03:28:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2017 03:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by jackstech\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-06T03:32:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a mod for controlling \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E craft. it\u0027s called Throttle Controlled Avionics.
