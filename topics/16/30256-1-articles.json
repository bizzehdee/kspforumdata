I\u0027m trying to land a small, lightweight rover on the Mun, Apollo style. The rover is just some structural pieces with some small rover wheels, an RTG, and a kerbal seat on it. What I can\u0027t figure out is how to get the darn thing to the Munar surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current design has a 3-kerbal CSM and a 2-kerbal lander module. The idea is to slap the rover on the LM, but I can\u0027t figure out where to put the thing. I considered placing it between the LM and the CSM or below the LM, but then I worry about the structural stresses of launch. The alternative is to put it on the very top of the whole thing, but the rover has no docking port on it. In fact, it only has one attachment point (the flat part of an OKTO strut). I\u0027ve tried just sticking it on the side of the LM, but that throws my Centre of Mass \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E off. Besides, when I detached it on Kerbin during a test, it fell on its side and I couldn\u0027t right it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the problem in the design of my rover, or am I overlooking some stupidly simple solution? Any help is appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, I couldn\u0027t find a tutorial on designing/landing rovers. If there isn\u0027t one already, someone should write it.
