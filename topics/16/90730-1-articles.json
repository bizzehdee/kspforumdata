You get more delta V from the same amount of propellant with a higher Isp. I understand that it says nothing about thrust, you may have to burn far longer for the same delta V with a different engine, but bottom line is how much fuel do I need for a given delta V? Higher Isp = less fuel. All the rest just complicates a simple concept and is only necessary if you\u0027re going to actually calculate how much delta V your design will give you. Like most of us I use a mod for this (KER.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the gravity thing still escapes my understanding, I don\u0027t get why it\u0027s used as a conversion.
