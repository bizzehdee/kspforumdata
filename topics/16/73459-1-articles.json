According to the wiki, if you go more than 206 Gm from the Sun, your solar panels will cease generating power. Thus, if you want to establish a wider orbit you will need to \u0022hibernate\u0022 your probe, by right-clicking at least one battery and disabling it. I suggest disabling all the batteries this way to give yourself more to work with.
