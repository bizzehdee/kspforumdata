So if you make an SSTO that can get up from Kerbin, you can be pretty confident it will also work on Laythe in terms of delta-V, intake air, fuel ratio, etc. You run out of air lower down at Laythe but OTOH the gravity is less and the atmosphere doesn\u0027t go as high so this sort of balances out. Getting the thing to and from Laythe is the same as for any other ship: you just need a transfer stage, or tug, or something. Some folks use ion engines for the transfer although burn times are huge that way. Better to dock to a transfer tug IMHO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe major fly in the ointment with planes on Laythe is finding a place to land. Laythe doesn\u0027t have much land to begin with, what it does have it divided up into tiny islands, few of these islands are on or near the equator, and most of the ones that are are pretty hilly. So basically, short runways. Thus, you have to give your plane a lot of wing for its size, so it can fly very slowly (especially considering the thinner air) to land in short distances. Also, the further from the equator you stray, the more delta-V you need, which makes the plane bigger, which means it needs even more wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that\u0027s stock. You can make life a lot easier for yourself if you put some Firespitter pontoons on the plane so it can land in the water. Then you have the entire circumference of Laythe as a runway and don\u0027t have to worry about STOL performance. You could also, I suppose, make stock pontoons out of like radial intakes but I\u0027ve found these to be way too bouncy to be safe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John Crichton","CreatedById":102565,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T15:37:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, possible: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57653-Carpathia-Ultra-Long-Range-SSTO-VTOL-Cruiser\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELINK\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot easy though, especially without part clipping.
