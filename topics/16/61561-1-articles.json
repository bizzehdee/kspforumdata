It wasn\u0027t powerful enough, so I surrounded it with a ring of asparagus. It still wasn\u0027t powerful enough, but it was very close. It couldn\u0027t quite get up to orbital velocity so my nuclear engines could take over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I started on the next ring of asparagus, adding engines and fuel in pairs to stay balanced. The first pair wasn\u0027t enough, but the second pair \u003Cem\u003Ejuuuuust\u003C/em\u003E let me get into orbit, but without enough fuel left for my mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I figured, why not, let\u0027s add another pair of asparagus engines to the outer ring. It now has 3 pairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe asparagus works in two spirals out from the center, so at each stage a pair of engines are dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow things have suddenly gotten weird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the spirals is consuming fuel faster than the other one. At first, my rocket seems to be doing all right. Then after a few seconds, it starts to tilt a little bit (since one side is heavier, with more remaining fuel). I can start to see the difference in the fuel bars next to the engine icons. Another 10 or 20 seconds, and my rocket is in an uncontrollable tumble, one end of its asparagus out of fuel and the other still burning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t figure it out. I know how to make asparagus -- after all, they\u0027ve been working properly up to this point. I\u0027ve double and triple checked that the fuel lines are all pointed the right way. I\u0027ve double and triple checked that all of them are using the same engines, and that all the tanks are starting full of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat else could be causing this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T04:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve got a misplaced fuel line some where.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T05:03:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA pic of the craft would help, bu it sounds like you have one fuel line attached to a tank, and it\u0027s partner line attached to a different tank (Common if you are using stacks of tanks.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"relin","CreatedById":89684,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T05:13:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother option: you\u0027ve stacked tanks radially, but the tanks aren\u0027t actually stacked. I\u0027ve had it happen a couple times that, after stacking a pair of Jumbo tanks using radial decouplers, they wind up being separate tanks instead of one large tank.

When one of the tanks breaks, it can cause the engine burn out of control and the fuel to be unbalanced depending on your design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can try adding more struts, reducing your throttle or simplifying the design.
