One delta-deluxe tilted 60 degrees (tilt it 12 times in the SPH) provides you nearly 30 kN of lift when you\u0027re going down the runway at 50 m/s, and continues to improve as you pitch up to a max angle of attack of 30 degrees (so the wing is at 90 degrees angle of attack). The lift is substantially the same until about 10km on a normal climb trajectory, then starts to fall off exactly when your engines start to really pick up speed.
