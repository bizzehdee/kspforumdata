In the read me it says 0.90.0 beta. It has a warning about the instability of the 64 bit version. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask this because I was running the .24 version and it was a little buggy but still very playable. I had Deadly reentry and FAR on there and was very happy. So one day I ran the patcher thinking that there might be updates and improvements that I was missing out on. It upgraded me to .25. All of a student I get a warning on start up that it is not compatible with Deadly reentry and FAR? So I deleted those mods hoping that they would be upgraded to .25. Now I\u0027m trying to upgrade to .90 I\u0027m going through the mods from scratch to download the latest versions. It\u0027s saying on a lot of them that they work only on the 32 bit version. How can I tell what I\u0027m running? Did the patcher change me from 32 to 64 when it upgraded me from .24 to .25? How can I tell if this .90 is 32 or 64? Is it available in 32 bit. All of these mods are listed as being .90 compatible. If I\u0027m playing a 64 bit version of the game, first how can I tell, second how can I get a hold of a 32 bit version so that I can once again play with some of these mods I like?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as you can tell I\u0027m not very computer savvy so please try to speak slowly in small words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T04:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you start KSP?

They instead refer to the fact that KSP\u0027s version went from 0.24 to 0.25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, when KSP gets updated, mods need to be recompiled for the new version of KSP. There are exceptions, but DRE and FAR (as they make substantial changes to KSP mechanics and internals) are not among them. Think of KSP as being an apartment building, with various bits and pieces of its workings in particular apartments. Mods are built expecting certain bits to be in particular apartments, and given keys to those apartments so they can tinker with them. When KSP gets updated, maybe the locks change, maybe this component gets moved to that apartment, etc. etc. So a mod that worked on version 0.24 of KSP is likely not to work with 0.25, and even more likely not to work with 0.90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when KSP gets a major version update, get updated copies of your favorite mods. It may take a week or two for the modmaker to finish getting his mod ready for the new version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T05:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re still having doubts, just drop \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/wbmfl23ot8km3sp/VersionChecker.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E .dll (MIT license) into your GameData folder, it\u0027ll tell you instantly as the game starts which version you\u0027re running from and if it\u0027s 64bit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-15T06:35:13Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2015 06:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stupid_chris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI know exactly what I did and this is exactly the kind of petty stuff you guys should not take a bother about.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T14:01:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are 2 exe\u0027s in the KSP folder (actually 3, but 2 called KSP)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is KSP.exe, and KSP_x64.exe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBY default, if you start through steam, it will use the KSP.exe, which is 32 bit.
