I was recently testing new aircraft, and I oddly noticed that the \u0022Wheesley\u0022 jet engine was pretty much *static* at 100kn thrust. This was vital (and way off compared to actual turbofans,) and it was apparently possible to push the thrust up all the way to 167.994, but I had no idea how.\n\nI had engine precoolers, and the intake air supply was adequate as far as I could tell.\n\nHere are some images of the aircraft (and if you\u0027re wondering, yes it is indeed a Boeing 737 replica)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

All engines have an optimal speed at which they deliver a thrust above and beyond their static (stationary) output. In the case of turbos and rapiers, 2-3x static thrust is viable with a good run up, with a theoretical maximum of 1000kN. But you\u0027d burn up if you actually managed it, since it requires low altitude at hypersonic speeds ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBest speeds:\n\n- Basic jet, mach 1.7\n\n- Turbo jet, mach 3 (3.5?)\n\n- Rapier, mach 3.7\n\nThe flight ceilings are pretty much artificial and don\u0027t relate to your intake air at all anymore.\n\nInterestingly, the power curves also differ. While rapiers deliver far more power by mach 3 than a turbojet, the turbo will be 50% better at mach 1; which is making mixed-engine spaceplanes exceedingly powerful right now.\n\nI doubt any of it relates to reality however ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:49:59Z","Content":"\u003E I doubt any of it relates to reality however ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nTake the Rapier out, and the basic Jet resembles a high bypass turbofan and the turbo RAMjet resembles a P\u0026W J58 pretty well. However, the atmosphere of Kerbin is weird. It is similar to Earth up to 15.000 or so, and then it falls off much quicker. However, the gravity is the same, but the diameter is WAAAY less. There are many comparisons to be found in the internet.\n\nIf Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere was up to scale, you would run out of air with the basic Jet engine at 1500 metres. However, the Kerbin atmosphere is about 1/2 that of earth, which means your Jet engine should run out of power at about 7000 metres (which it doesn\u0027t). This means: The atmosphere scaling compared to earth is not linear, but it resembles earth\u0027s atmosphere up to about 20.000 metres, and then it starts to fall off dramatically. A real Blackbird SR 71 (with the Kerbal turbo RAMjet equivalent) or the Mig-25 would fly Mach 3.2 at 20.000 to 25.000 metres on earth and would be able to make a ballistic zoom flight to about 35 km. That\u0027s pretty much what we get in KSP. But everything beyond 25.000km on Kerbin is scaled down to make things easier.\n\nWhat\u0027s different: The thrust at sea level is dramatically higher from what i feel. I have no numbers to prove it, though. But being able to zoom up from liftoff, reaching Mach 1.0 in a 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 steep climb and reaching almost Mach 3 before the engine runs out of air feels not right to me. But hey, that\u0027s a game."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:26:11Z","Content":"Nope, Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is a pretty exact 80% Earth atmosphere: the atmosphere (pressure, temperature, density) at 8km on Kerbin equals that at 10km on Earth."},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:48:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The Wheesley can go up to about 13.000m if you construct a craft that has a low stall speed (add more wings, make it look like a glider).
