I can have a design with symmetric strapon boosters and say I want to tweak a strut or fuel crossfeed line. If I miss when trying to select a small part, suddenly all the boosters are off the rocket and have to try to put them back on \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E. This is more frustrating when some of the strap-ons have been individualized. If only I could just press Esc and everything goes back to how it was. Is there a button I just haven\u0027t found yet or can the feature please be added in future update? I shouldn\u0027t have to save it after every single change but that (reloading) sometimes seems to be the easiest way to correct for when I accidentally remove parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T19:34:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Controls\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EControl \u002B Z\u003C/a\u003E, much like other programs.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T23:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, that was weird.

What the OP describes is the Single. Most. Frustrating. Thing. about KSP. I\u0027ve decided that it happens more to me on this computer than on my old one because this one isn\u0027t as fast. I think it occurs when you click something and then move the mouse before the click registers. Most of the time, when you\u0027re not running a memory- and processing-intensive app, such as a web browser or word processor, the time between click and action is much smaller. But in KSP, particularly in the VAB and SPH, there is an appreciable delay. When I take my time and hover my mouse over what I\u0027m clicking for a moment until I see that the click has registered, it doesn\u0027t do that. Perhaps when I\u0027ve upgraded my machine it won\u0027t be as bad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T13:42:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StrandedonEarth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022StrandedonEarth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, that was weird.
