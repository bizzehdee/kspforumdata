So far I have scanned the munar surface and plopped a rover on a nice pool of Kethane to mark it for my base of operations. However I\u0027m completely lost on how I should mine the Kethane and then return it to my space station around Kerbin. I was wondering if you guys could provide me with ideas (and maybe pictures) of how your Kethane mining operations operate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"triffid_hunter","CreatedById":61814,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T03:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually mine from minmus and have a fuel station in minmus orbit.

I use lots of different mods, but I think the only mod parts aside from Kethane is B9 for the nose-part of the rover and KWparts for the crew compartment of the lander...oh I also use CBM docking ports, I think the new large stock docking port is the same size as the 2.5m CBM one that I use, I may switch over if it holds well.
