If correctly made, I rocket can go pretty fast without too much drag in atmosphere. Maybe MechJeb is just not receiving a sufficient amount of drag from air resistance to slow you down. And FAR changing terminal velocity probably makes it that what would be so fast you would have re-entry effects in vanilla KSP becomes normal, but the game still sends the effects. This would also be logical that MechJeb calculates terminal velocity this way because I highly doubt it has the terminal velocities per altitude stored for Kerbin, Eve, Duna, Laythe AND Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also pretty interested at knowing these things because I\u0027ve been considering getting FAR as I only use rockets and don\u0027t ever really go in the SPH, but I\u0027m kinda unsure if it would make it easier to launch stuff up or completely throw my rockets off course, and I am in the dark for what concerns MechJeb\u0027s relations with FAR and calculating delta V and such.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-27T20:13:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2013 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by stupid_chris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ditchbuster","CreatedById":68012,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T00:52:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell Ill keep playing around with it.

That if you crank hard all of a sudden you will get that flip cause your angle of attack goes nuts. Also because you normally end up with most your weight in the back on rockets and that part wants to be forward (like a dart) they tend to want to flip around. So i think it was a combination of mechjeb not being designed for FAR assent and that I am not used to designing rockets with FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T22:54:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMakes sense.
