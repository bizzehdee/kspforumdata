For three satellites, you\u0027d use a 4-hour orbit. Then, each time your carrier ship reaches apoapsis (i.e., reaches the keosynchronous altitude), you release one satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51098-Ring-of-Keostationary-Satellites\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eused this technique to place six satellites\u003C/a\u003E in such an orbit (using a 5-hour delivery orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit\u003C/strong\u003E: I just realized you want one of the satellites to be \u003Cem\u003Eabove KSC\u003C/em\u003E. That will complicate things a bit. It can still be done by playing with orbital periods and doing some calculations. The geneal idea is the same as I described above, you\u0027ll just need to get the details right to have the first apoapsis above KSC.

Don\u0027t deploy any sats yet. Keep in this orbit and look down every time you get to apoapsis. You\u0027ll see three different views of the planet that will be the same each time. Figure out which third has KSC in it, and about how many degrees east or west of you it is at apoapsis. That\u0027s a critical number. If KSC is east of you then your orbit needs to be temporarily shortened, if it\u0027s west it needs to be lengthened. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf KSC is 12 degrees to your west then burn prograde at apoapsis until your period is 4 hrs and 4 minutes (4 minutes is one third of 12) so three orbits later you\u0027ll be right over KSC. Same for any other number of degrees you need to correct, add one third of the time in minutes to move west, subtract to move east. The designers were very kind to give Kerbin a 6 hour rotation, it rotates 360 degrees in 360 minutes, that makes changing your longitude cake. Once you\u0027re over KSC at apoapsis, burn to bring your orbital period back to four hours then wait three more orbits and check your work, you should be right back above KSC again. From there, drop a sat and circularize its orbit to a 6 hour period each time you get back to apoapsis again, you\u0027ll wind up with a perfect 120 degree spacing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the same technique to fix a sat that drifts out of place. If you can figure out how many degrees off it is, shorten or lengthen its orbital period by that many minutes and it\u0027ll be back in place next apoapsis (although be careful, if you lengthen the orbit to correct west the nodes will flip, make sure that the one you circularize at is the one with the proper altitude.) For big corrections (more than 5 degrees or so) it\u0027s better to do it in multiple orbits to save on Delta-V. None of this requires much fuel, mind. Even a pretty heavy sat won\u0027t need more than one Oscar tank and an ant engine to circularize once it\u0027s off the carrier vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Person012345","CreatedById":33728,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T06:17:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise you can use maneuver nodes and targetting to essentially rendevous with a point 120 degrees from the previous satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T15:08:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEasiest solution to geostationary orbit:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. launch into a low orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. wait for KSC to be 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ahead of you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. raise your apoapsis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. circularize\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. profit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T19:59:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Francesco\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Francesco\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEasiest solution to geostationary orbit:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. launch into a low orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. wait for KSC to be 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ahead of you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. raise your apoapsis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. circularize\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. profit\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not that simple. first of all, what is a \u0022low orbit\u0022? 70km? 100 km? 250 km?

Launch your satellite into an orbit of 475km above Kerbin. From there, continue just as he describes: wait until the KSC is 90 degrees ahead of you (this is assuming that in a reference circle, your satellite would be at 0 degrees.) A handy trick here would be to put a ship on the launch pad then switch back to your satellite. That way, you have a specific point on your map. From there, burn prograde until your apoapsis reaches 2868.75 km. Then circularize when you reach that altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on your accuracy, your ability to estimate when the KSC is 90 degrees ahead of you, and your precision on the controls, the KSC might be a little ahead or behind you. If it is, don\u0027t worry. If it is ahead of you, then decrease your orbit by a few kilometers and wait until the KSC is below you then reestablish the keostationary orbit. If it is behind you, raise your orbit a bit and do the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis maneuver became a staple for me when I started to play with RemoteTech.
