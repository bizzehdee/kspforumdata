Anyways, My orbit catches the very edge of the iced over north pole of kerbin as well as the edge of the south pole. My satellite info says orbiting, apoapsis is 432,732m nd periapsis is 187550m . Imtrying to do an orbital scan with the m-700 scanner.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T02:16:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 02:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fistfullofnails**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T02:01:12Z","Content":"\u0022Polar orbit\u0022 refers to a 90 degree orbital plane.

I\u0027ve not actually looked to see how that lines up with the polar cap graphics, but you can try targeting the Mun and seeing what the AN/DN angles say.\n\nAlso, if you want to take an in-game screenshot, press F1. KSP will dump a screenshot into your Screenshots directory.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"fistfullofnails","CreatedById":144017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T02:16:19Z","Content":"Thanks Claw"}]}
