I would try Duna first, then Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve has a very thick atmosphere so parachutes work well; you can just settle to a landing without having to control your ship. The landing challenge of Eve is because the atmosphere is so thick there\u0027s a more risk of burning up during entry than at Kerbin. Eve landers need good heat shields. The other challenge at Eve is trying to takeoff because that thick atmosphere requires a lot of fuel to get back to orbit. Consider Eve a one-way trip for probes and wait to learn how it works before trying to land Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna has a very thin atmosphere where parachutes barely slow you down. You need to rely on rocket power for landing so the final part of landing at Duna is harder than Eve. If you can land on the Mun with no atmosphere, though, you shouldn\u0027t have much trouble at Duna. Heating and takeoff are much easier at Duna than Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe is much like Kerbin so the actual landing will be very familiar to you with parachutes and not too much heating.
