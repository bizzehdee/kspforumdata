I placed 4 Thuds on the top sides of 4 sets of fuel tanks that surround the the Apollo Style Pod. I use a heavy booster that can get the \u0022Tug\u0022 into orbit without using the Thuds but once there I drop the Standard engines leaving the Thuds as my sole propulsion (except some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters). Maneuvering is slow but otherwise works\u00A0fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I manually control the Thuds I have no issues with control. But if I use MechJeb, when it tries to run the Thuds\u00A0they \u0022Sputter\u0022 with short blasts of thrusts - almost like a real slow machine gun. It seems that MechJeb is trying to use them as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters to control orientation instead of just pushing the Tug. They are unusable in MechJeb. I also noted that when I was designing\u00A0the lift boosters and I was using MechJeb Assent Assist\u00A0that the Thuds were kicking in as the last stage\u00A0during boost the thuds would fire continuously but the Tug would start to Roll and could not be controlled.\u00A0\u00A0 If I launch manually, or disengaged MechJeb beore the Thud stage fired, the Thuds they worked find in the last stage of launch - except for not having enough power to get the PE into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there an issue with MechJeb and the Thuds?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-08T15:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223985943\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202929\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221623162087\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201835\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jbdenney\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, jbdenney said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there an issue with MechJeb and the Thuds?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may be that MechJeb is expecting the Thuds to be behind the centre of mass.\u00A0 You might try testing with an otherwise-identical vessel with Thuds at the back and seeing whether MechJeb has a problem with it.\u00A0 If you know how to use the cheat menu, then you can put the test rocket in orbit without needing to figure out the aerodynamics and just see whether it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camacju","CreatedById":207172,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-09T03:28:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have differential throttle enabled?
