Crew reports, temp readings, pressure readings, EVA reports, etc. When you do an experiment, you get a \u0022results\u0022 window. On that window will be an extra yellow button called \u0022Process\u0022. Click the button. The experiment is destroyed and converted into \u0022data\u0022 inside the MPL. You can fill the MPL with up to 750 points of data, AFAIK. The more data it has, the faster the MPL converts the data into science points, via \u0022research\u0022. That final conversion process takes a lot of time, unless you timewarp. The process happens in the background -- that is, you do not have to continuously watch the craft, you can go pilot other ships. When you feel like it, you come back and visit the MPL. You check how much science is available, and you transmit it back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.
