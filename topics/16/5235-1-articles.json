Its behaviour is rather strange - both lagging and predictive. Jumping time warp around in an elliptic orbit can readily show this; at the apses, it\\\u0027s easy to see that there\\\u0027s a slight delay to its height reading, coming to show the apsis altitude less time before the apsis is reached than it takes to move away after leaving the apsis behind. Jumping the warp down while ascending or descending, it can be observed to jump back a few units, before carrying on as it was. The only explanation I can come up with for the reversal is that the altimeter is moving ahead, trying to be predictive with these high velocities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can\\\u0027t exactly be proven systematic, but is much more likely to be than the other obvious source of error, which is the limited (1 second) time resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022closette\u0022 data-cite=\u0022closette\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the sea-level densities I provided above apparently had an extraneous factor of 2. Assuming that Harv\\\u0027s drag model already includes that factor (which I saw on an old thread it does), the \u0027correct\u0027 sea-level density for Kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere is about 0.0051 Kerbal Mass Units per meter\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, where the command module has a mass of 1 Kerbal Mass Unit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf as I suspect (based on old discussions about Kerbal fuel densities compared to Earth\\\u0027s), 1 Kerbal Mass Unit = 1000 kg, that means their sea-level atmospheric density is 5.1 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s what one would expect for SF\u003Csub\u003E6\u003C/sub\u003E!!! (Molecular mass 146 as opposed to 29 for air).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe speed of sound in a gas (see the Wikipedia article) is given by sqrt (gamma * Pressure / density), where gamma is that pesky ratio of specific heats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince gamma = 1.04 for SF\u003Csub\u003E6\u003C/sub\u003E and 1.4 for air, that would make the sea-level sound speed at standard temperature and pressure equal to... wait for it... 340 m/s * sqrt(1.04/1.4 * 29/146) = 131 m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that low enough for ya?

For this I used the equation in my early post, with a slight modification of being / 2, like the real drag equation is. ( In full, F\u003Csub\u003ED\u003C/sub\u003E = ( ? * v^2 * m * [tt]maximum_drag[/tt] ) /2 )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEquated to mg and rearranged, the equation I\\\u0027m working with is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E? = (2 * g) / (v\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E * [tt]maximum_drag[/tt])\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor v = 90, g=9.81, and drag = 0.2, this works out at 12.1 kgm^-3, again assuming the standard unit is 1 ton, as makes sense thus far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for that calculation of speed of sound, while that possibly gives a good value for drag divergence with respect to gameplay, a ? that low results in an utterly pitiful stagnation temperature. Reentry is boring now? Adding realistic heating for that value will be almost as boring. Stagnation temperature is proportional to M\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, which that value of \u003Cem\u003Ea\u003C/em\u003E makes slightly less than that on earth, and also proportional to the value of (? - 1). Reducing ? from 1.4 to 1.04 means bringing stagnation temperature, and thus reentry heating, to a tenth of what it would be on Earth for the same mach. While that does still mean a fairly high peak flow temperature, at least compared to ambient, and assuming said ambient is about comparable to Earth, peak flow temperature is far, far higher than the heating experienced by a reentering vehicle, due to the sparsity of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference assuming ambient in both cases to be 250K, temperature ratio on Kerbin, with a reentry Mach of 20 (velocity 2600 m/s) would be 9, for peak flow of 2,250 K. On Earth, with a reentry Mach of 25 (typical estimate), temperature ratio is 126, for peak flow temperature of 31,500 K. While there will be some inaccuracy in these values due to gamma reducing with temperature, and peak temperature not being reached near vehicle skin, this demonstrates the disparity between the two situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESummary: It\\\u0027s kinda hard to make Kerbin fit realistic properties. It\\\u0027s already significantly more than twice the density of lead. This has lead to the theories of Kerbin being an inverted dyson shell around a neutron star, which could also explain the lack of tidal locking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Slight correction to temperature ratios, which were 1 less than they should\\\u0027ve been.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thorfinn","CreatedById":8349,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-03T19:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst things first: yeah, Kerbin IS a pretty impossible planet.
