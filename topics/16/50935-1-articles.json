Use action groups to toggle the motor and the steering on the back wheels. You can always toggle it back on again whenever you need 4-wheel drive. Also, set up the \u0022Brakes\u0022 action group to only engage the brakes on the back wheels. This will allow you to come to a quick stop without flipping over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also experimented with making 6-wheel rovers where the middle set of wheels (with motors and steering off) is set up a bit higher than the other four so that the wheels don\u0027t actually touch the ground. They just serve as outriggers to keep you from rolling over and to bear some the the weight of the landing. I like to use ruggedized rover wheels instead of landing struts whenever possible because they make such great landing gear. They allow you to land with some horizontal velocity without the craft tipping over, and you can easily send a Kerbal out on an EVA to repair the broken wheels. Also, if you are trying to land near another craft on the planet, it is way easier to just drive your wheeled lander the final distance to the rendezvous point instead of nailing a perfect landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallace","CreatedById":77574,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T00:09:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy way of deciding which wheels to use is simple, I just try the different types and pick the one that doesn\u0027t look ridiculously under or oversized. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dinkiest wheels are best kept for very small rovers, although 6 or 8 on a rovemax body is quite a good set up, very grippy. the teeny wheels on just a probecore and battery make a very good teeny rover, not fast, but very good at climbing if it doesn\u0027t run out of power too quickly. I dropped 8 micro rovers with the teeny wheels all over the mun to search for anomalies and they could climb any hill they came across, even up out of very steep craters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merlinux","CreatedById":83117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T02:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find myself using the rovemax model 1 and 2 a lot more than ruggedized wheels for small rovers.
