I was just curious about how to replicate the mun landing that\u0027s done in the tutorial, but in the actual game. I\u0027m trying to figure out how to get a landing craft on top of a large rocket with a separate command module. I have everything assembled, but when it comes to staging I want them to be two separate craft. Do I simply set up the stages so everything that happens on the landing craft is at the very lowest stages? Or is there a way to give them entirely separate trees, and only show the \u0022commanding\u0022 craft? Tahnks kindly,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApplemush\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T19:11:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not done the tutorial, but yes. Set up your lander in the last few stages. When a craft separates, it\u0027s staging is filtered out based on where the parts end up. That is true for decoupling as well as undocking. There is no way to have separate staging trees, the game considers it 1 craft when docked, the second craft is \u0022created\u0022 when they separate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exception to that rule is when re-docking. Some information about both crafts is retained, such as it\u0027s name, so when undocking again everything goes back to the way it was. However everything straight out of the VAB/SPH is one craft, even if it contains two mated docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-02T19:15:51Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2015 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T19:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re wanting to do an Apollo-style Mun mission, eh?
