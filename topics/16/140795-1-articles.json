dollar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSnarfing up science requires 3\u00A0related things. \u00A0First, you need to pack as many different experiments on your ship as possible, so it can get the most science possible from a single biome. \u00A0The 2nd is to hit a lot of biomes in quick succession, :\u0022a lot\u0022 meaning 6 or more. \u00A0And finally, you need to get the from the ship to KSC as fast as possible so you can put it to use. \u00A0As an option, you can also play with the difficulty sliders when you start a new game, so that you get like 200% the normal amount of science. \u00A0But whether you do that or not, the 3 main things are what you focus on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, 1st off, maximizing experiments. \u00A0Stock gives you 9: \u00A0crew report, EVA report, surface sample, and the 6 stock instruments. \u00A0However, not all of these work in all places, some of them require expensive building upgrades, and some experiments are fairly far up the tech tree. \u00A0The result is that if you stay stock, you won\u0027t have all these available for much of the game, which slows down science acquisition. \u00A0The solution to that is to use mods like DMagic Orbital Science, which give you many new experiments early in the tech tree. \u00A0Also, many of these experiments can be transmitted for full value which goes into the speed factor discussed later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHitting many biomes quickly is only really possible at Kerbin, Minmus, and Mun. \u00A0These are the only planets with scads of biomes, the rest all having only a handful. \u00A0Of these 3, the best candidate is Minmus because it\u0027s small, which means most biomes are very close together, and it has little gravity so it\u0027s easy to get from one to the next. \u00A0Minmus has 9 surface\u00A0biomes plus \u0022space high above\u0022 and \u0022space just above\u0022, all of which you can hit in a single trip by a lander with 3500m/s. \u00A0The \u0022space just above\u0022 is special because some experiments can get separate\u00A0\u0022just above\u0022 results at every surface biome, while others can only do it once for the whole planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMun and Kerbin have even more biomes. \u00A0However, Kerbin\u0027s don\u0027t pay very much and are time-consuming to visit in low-tech airplanes so I usually ignore them. \u00A0Mun has enough gravity that you can\u0027t hit many biomes per trip unless you refuel, which increases the time, cost, and complexity of the mission. \u00A0So pillage Minmus first, then use its science to unlock parts to make doing Mun and/or Kerbin easier. \u00A0Or skip them an head off to Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to returning science to KSC quickly, a clean sweep of Minmus takes about 30 days of gametime, nearly all of which is spent getting there an back. \u00A0With DMOS\u0027s extra experiments, this trip will bring back 3000-4000 science points with the default 100% return slider, and obviously more if you jack this up. \u00A0You can get to Mun and back in just a few days\u00A0but you can\u0027t do much while there with low technology and small budgets. \u00A0Transmitting data saves you the time of having to bring it back, but with stock experiments, only crew reports and EVA reports can be transmitted at full value. \u00A0As mentioned above, however, many of the DMSO experiments can be transmitted at full value, however, so be sure to take advantage of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne other thing.... \u00A0Biome-hopping requires access to a biome map so you know where to go. \u00A0The only way to see a biome map in stock is to use the Alt-F12 menu. \u00A0To get something that you can actually use in-game, and that you have to make yourself, use SCANsat. \u00A0Besides, making the map with SCANsat counts as a science experiment so you get a few hundred points for that as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mk1980","CreatedById":163203,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T16:51:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote
