Each time you buy the next building, you get more tiers. It can be expensive though.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m having trouble raising the kind of funds needed to finish upgrading everything!\n\nMany people have this problem, most due to the fact that the game calls the settings when you start a new game \u0022difficulty\u0022 settings when what they really mean is \u0022level of grind needed to get anything done.\u0022 I personally find \u0022Normal\u0022 to be an acceptable and even rewarding amount of grind. However I personally think that \u0022Easy\u0022 mode is far better suited to most people, **even those who are really good at the game**.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is it possible that I made a dumb move in the admin building????\n\u003E \n\u003E Or do I just need to keep cranking out the contracts?\n\nWithout knowing your specifics, I can\u0027t tell. However you should currently be taking the Admin strategies that convert science into money at the highest rate you can, because that\u0027s your bottleneck. Look for lucrative contracts that you can do (Satellites and Minmus surveys - I\u0027ve found - are the easiest to do for the higher paying contracts. Also bases. Get a \u0022Put a base for 5 kerbals around the sun\u0022 contract and just launch the bare minimum, empty base with a probe core on it and fling it past Mun out into interplanetary space. Easy money. You can double up on those contracts too if you take a \u0022get a 5-kerbal base in Kerbin orbit\u0022 contract at the same time, the simple act of getting that base out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI to complete the Sun contract will also complete the Kerbin contract. Two for the price of One!\n\nI personally wouldn\u0027t fault you - though - for just giving yourself some free cash to unlock the R\u0026D building."},{"CreatedByName":"Gent Harris","CreatedById":135317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T03:32:48Z","Content":"Thanks for the quick reply!!\n\nThe R\u0026D center is fully upgraded to the tune of 3180000 ouch, as is mission control, launch pad and admin bldng\n\nI did a strategy early to convert some funds into science STUPID cause now I cant go the other way??\n\nGuess I\u0027ll know what not to do when 1.0 comes out LOL\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nSorry, old school, even reverting a flight feels like a failure and cheating to me..\n\nBut I\u0027ve tried to live with it LOL"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T03:35:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for the quick reply!!\n\u003E The R\u0026D center is fully upgraded to the tune of 3180000 ouch, as is mission control, launch pad and admin bldng\n\u003E \n\u003E I did a strategy early to convert some funds into science STUPID cause now I cant go the other way??\n\u003E \n\u003E Guess I\u0027ll know what not to do when 1.0 comes out LOL\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E Sorry, old school, even reverting a flight feels like a failure and cheating to me..\n\u003E \n\u003E But I\u0027ve tried to live with it LOL\n\nIf the R\u0026D building is fully upgraded then you\u0027ve unlocked everything. You can cancel a strategy by selecting it (it\u0027s in the bottom box) and clicking the X. Then, you can take the other strategy.\n\nAlso, if the R\u0026D building is fully upgraded then you\u0027ve obviously got the tools to unlock every single other building. I don\u0027t know the exact numbers but I\u0027m pretty sure the cost of EVERY OTHER BUILDING ADDED TOGETHER is less than the cost of R\u0026D."},{"CreatedByName":"Gent Harris","CreatedById":135317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T03:47:40Z","Content":"Thanx!!\n\nNow if I didnt have that pesky 40 hr a week job....."}]}
