Can I get this framerate by editing the config file?

With physical cameras, objects in motion naturally have a bit of blur to them because the shutter speed is finite. With video games, the effective shutter speed is instant: you have no blur baked into it, so the illusion of movement can be broken by running at low framerates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I don\u0027t have experience in video rendering, I suspect the ideal thing to do would be to run at a higher framerate and then post-process, interpolating multiple frames captured from KSP into a single video frame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
