I was also wanting to see what 25% of the wing area for the tail looked like with a relatively short aspect ratio (wound up going 3:1) and 10% of the wing area for the fin.\n\nCame up with this, the Phoenix 7c:\n\n![VCzyCip.png](http://i.imgur.com/VCzyCip.png)\n\nFlew pretty well - takeoff speed was low, around 95 m/s, and yes it did have issues at 30k with getting above Mach 4. FAR greenlit everything except N\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u00B8\u003C/sub\u003E at 30/4 and that was unstable, but the plane flew straight and true the whole time. Didn\u0027t even oscillate much until I got up above 20k and began leveling out to gain speed. Had about 18% rocket fuel reserve after orbital insertion. Same 6.1 tonne probe the 7b took to orbit. I\u0027d have SPH screenies for y\u0027all, but the game crashed on me prior to the actual flight and LoadOnDemand didn\u0027t want to work right away after I fired the game back up, so all my parts were purple and grey until about midway through the flight...\n\nI\u0027m thinking I probably could stand to up the wing loading a hair - the Concorde, Tu-144 and SR-71 had loadings up around 0.45-0.5 or thereabouts. 25% also seems a bit much for the tail still but it\u0027s hard to judge. I might try this design again as a tail-less delta with canards just to see what that\u0027s like. 10% definitely seems to be too much for the fin (and yet I\u0027ve got a yaw instability, which in general you\u0027re supposed to correct with *more* fin, right?). I\u0027m guessing the fin root chord needs to be longer than I\u0027ve got it so I don\u0027t need so much span-wise, but then I run into the issue of insufficient mounting surface for where I\u0027ve got it; I\u0027ve already got issues with the design there as is. I\u0027ve also noted that the fins on the SR-71, Concorde and Concordski are maybe 1.5 times the height of the fuselage and the fin tip chord is maybe half to two-thirds the length of the fin root. Shorter aspect ratio there too. \n\nI need to figure out a good way to build a cranked delta wing too; just cuz. One of y\u0027all mentioned I should be looking at fourth-generation fighters and that particular planform is used in a lot of the ones I\u0027ve looked at.

I added a bit of dihedral to the wings and the CoL indicator jumped over half the plane. FAR is not perfect but usually makes more sense than this.\n\n\\* With FAR you can tweak the control surface deflection which is quite nice.\n\n\\* FAR has the analysis gui.

It\u0027s just \u0022make sure the area of the cross section doesn\u0027t change over the length of the plane\u0022, right? And since the wing contributes x amount of area, the area of the fuselage needs to be reduced by the same amount to ensure it stays stable in the trans-sonic range, right? Assuming that\u0027s right, my question was going to be one of how do you that with stock parts, and is it necessary to do so?"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T14:11:34Z","Content":"It\u0027s not \u0022make sure area doesn\u0027t change\u0022, it\u0027s \u0022make sure that any changes in area happen smoothly\u0022. One way to do this is to have a featureless tube, sure, but it\u0027s not the only way. And the key point of area rule is that the distribution of area within a given bit of cross section doesn\u0027t matter; you can get away with big wings so long as the fuselage narrows a touch at that point.\n\nYou can massively reduce or increase supersonic drag just by tiny adjustments to the position of parts; there\u0027s scope for endless fiddling. Fun for those who like tweaking their designs, huge PITA for those who don\u0027t enjoy such things. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSee here for example:\n\n![prNG4TB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/prNG4TB.jpg)\n\nThe thing that you\u0027re actually targeting is the Mach 1 Wave-Drag area; you want it as low as possible. The green and yellow lines give you clues as to where to concentrate your efforts. This one is fairly good already (although the yellow line is wiggly, the amplitude of the wiggles is low), but you could smooth it a bit further by adding a bit of bulge to the fuselage between the canards and wings (for example). I expect that tricks like \u0022stack of empty Oscar-B\u0027s with a mini nosecone on the front, partially sunk into the fuselage\u0022 are going to see a lot of use.\n\n![f-22-raptor_006.jpg](http://images.military.com/media/equipment/military-aircraft/f-22-raptor/f-22-raptor_006.jpg)\n\nArea ruling is part of why fighter jet fuselages tend to flatten at the rear of the aircraft; they\u0027re thinning the fuselage to compensate for the cross-sectional area of the wings. See how the cockpit canopy gives way to the intakes, then the fuselage flattens at the wings? And how the vertical stabilisers kind of fill the gap between the wings and the stabilators? Even though the distribution of area changes sharply, the change in total area flows smoothly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T14:20:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 02:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T14:51:15Z","Content":"@Wanderfound: Yes, you got it right about the area rule, but jet fighters are a different beast.\n\nThere is transonic area rule, but there is also supersonic area rule, where things change.\n\nSo, yes, they follow an area rule, but it\u0027s not the same as transonic, supersonic area rule is an average of the area rule of planes from different mach angles.\n\nSame principle, just a bit more complex, you may notice that these supersonic fighters look very different from transonic airplanes like the Dassault Mirage.\n\nThey have enough thrust to overcome the transonic barrier, thus their main concern is being efficient at their supersonic cruise speeds, so their shape is different from transonic airplanes.\n\nBut don\u0027t worry too much about it right now, FAR still does not implement supersonic area ruling, it will probably do on the future, but that may take a while.\n\nAnyway, good catch on the vertical stabilizers \u0022filling the gap\u0022 between the main wings and horizontal stabilizers, that is also a good transonic aircraft practice.\n\nYou can also use the vertical stabilizer to smoothen out the main wings transition on delta-wing aircraft.\n\nThe stock FAR planes use many tricks for area-ruling, learning with them can help a lot, I recommend moving the ballasts around to see what happens.\n\nAlso: [http://i.imgur.com/RPEKlW3.png](http://i.imgur.com/RPEKlW3.png)\n\nEdit: and ah, yes, with supersonic area rule comes \u0022speed nicheing\u0022, when it\u0027s implemented you will have to focus on a more specific mach number to be efficient at, making trade-offs, the airplane can\u0027t be good at everything.\n\nEdit2: I am posting it here and not on the main FAR thread to not scare everybody ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nIt\u0027s not that much of a beast, but more like a spicy flavor.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T15:00:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tetryds**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T15:17:14Z","Content":"Tetryds understands this much better than I do, Tetryds is wise.
