It ONLY uses the Intake integrated into the engine itself, and it\u0027s set up...really badly. It LOSES efficiency as speed increases, and it\u0027s set up so the primary driver of Kintakeair production is... throttle.

Including if you activated it on the runway with too low of a throttle setting. And since the kintakeair production is primarily linked to throttle rather than speed, it\u0027s EXTREMELY difficult to get it to restart if it flames out (Flameout = no throttle = very little kintakeair = flameout).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d want to test it again to see if he\u0027s fixed it (There have been a LOT of new Kethane releases and a KSP version or two since then), but if it was still like that...I\u0027d probably just hack the normal intakes to also produce kintakeair.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T12:06:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John FX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022John FX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMust again admit I was speaking from assumption rather than calculation, I just thought air drag might account for the difference between what you got and what you expected.
