I build a VERY powerful ship called super moon for a rescue mission to save a stranded kerbal, and made a manuever. I got a Mun encounter, Warped time, then i was in the suns (kerbol) orbit. Does this happen to anyone else, or do I just suck at this game.

The Mun\u0027s gravity probably slingshotted you out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI and you ended up on a solar orbit.
