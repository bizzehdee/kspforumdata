The logic is similar, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin rotates every six hours, approximately. The exact number is in the Wiki. Also in the Wiki is the altitude you want for a stationary orbit. So from low Kerbin orbit, figure out how long your craft will rise from the start of your manoeuvre to stationary altitude; the projected Kerbin AP should have a \u0022time to\u0022 value, but subtract the time before your manouevre from that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDivide six hours into that \u0022time-to\u0022 value to get a percentage, and multiply that by 360 degrees to get some angle value. Aim your projected Kerbin AP that many degrees counter-clockwise from your target on the ground right before you start your burn. This will likely mean many postponements of your burn until you get close enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen close your stationary orbit at AP. If you hit the altitude just right, you could try burning retrograde in surface mode until you get 0 m/s.
