I\u0027ve set orbital periods to what the sidereal day was \u003Cem\u003Esupposed\u003C/em\u003E to be, but the satellite sped up in orbit, advancing ~ 30 deg longitude over several game months. This has been confirmed by other players, and the Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Esidereal \u003C/strong\u003Erotation appears to remain 6 hrs. The wiki entry still lists the sidereal day as 6 hrs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, it looks like the devs screwed up: they announced the change, even though its \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also had a question about synchonous orbits around Tylo and Laythe in a rep comment (Thanks! I appreciate it!). According to the wiki, neither is possible, since the orbital altitude for synchronous orbits lie outside the moons\u0027 spheres of influence. Laythe\u0027s circular synchonous orbit altitude is ~4.7 Mm, but it\u0027s SoI only extends to 3.7 Mm. Tylo\u0027s circular synchronous orbit is \u0026gt; 14 Mm, but it\u0027s SoI extends \u0026lt; 11 Mm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept for Minmus and, shockingly, Gilly, all the moons in the game are tidally locked to their parent. Tidally locked bodies have \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E slow rotation, requiring much higher orbital altitudes for synchronous orbits.
