If I put jets on something I use them to their fullest extent. To the extent that I only get 1kn of thrust from the last firing engine at 65km trying to get that PE up as high as I can before I have to switch to the LFO engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a couple of my earlier hybrid designs, had posted them on the spacecraft exchange. They are 100% re useable designs, meant for bringing payloads up and down from Laythe\u0027s surface \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/28431-I-Present-the-Firebat?highlight=Firebat\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/28431-I-Present-the-Firebat?highlight=Firebat\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first post describes the ascent profile, which is still pretty much how I do it now, tho a little less sloppy now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-11T05:22:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2013 05:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by HoY\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T05:36:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds like what I\u0027m trying to do, Hoy, but I\u0027m using the 3-man capsule because I want it for crew rotations in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T07:41:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe firebat I linked there was just a 1 man capsule, but it can easily carry another 10-12 tonnes into orbit, I only used a lighter payload because it needed the dV to make it to Laythe without refueling. A larger version like the Marauder (a crude attempt at a 45t ssto but effective) can bring up a small station in one launch lol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint is, yes it\u0027s quite feasible to use jets to get almost completely into orbit with even heavy payloads. I\u0027ve seen some that can carry more to the order of 80t into orbit, tho those are more complex and time consuming to fly that is worth it IMHO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven the 45t marauder was slow to fly due to the massive part count incurred by spamming air intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
