I\u0027ve found that my Eve lander consistently disintigrates because of heat issues. Struts and full fuel tanks overheat - despite having heat shield on the bottom (forward facing) end of the lander\u0027s stacks. I\u0027ve aerobraked several passes, but even getting my orbit down to 1500km ap (which took a month, because of shallow pe, also because of heat issues), I feel that there\u0027s no way I can get the thing down. I see lots of very large and rapid fluctuations on the heat bars, so I suspect the engine can\u0027t handle the heat transfers quick enough. Even so, after turning ignore max temp on, I found that several parts, even un-heatshieldable parts like struts, goes to red (ie. exploded due to heat if not for cheat) heat all through the descent. Despite all this, the heat shields have plenty of ablator left? So apart from burning a crapton of fuel all the way down, how do you do it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T17:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWrong forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need heat shields to land on Eve, you need Airbrakes.
