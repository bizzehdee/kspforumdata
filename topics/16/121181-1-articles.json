Then go rendezvous your ship with the tourist vessel, grab it with the claw, and hey presto you have one new ship with solar panels on it and the batteries charging. When the batteries are charged you can detach the klaw and continue with the mission, or keep the klaw attached but CoM will probably be way off centre now.
