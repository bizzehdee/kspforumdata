Does RCS get throttled automatically? What I mean is if i have two thrusters at the front of a craft and two at the backbut the CoM is closer to the front will the rear thrusters be throttled so that the center of thrust is on the CoM or will I just spin out of control? I\u0027m asking because I\u0027m building a spaceplane and it would be hard to get four thrusters around the CoM\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-02T07:50:44Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2014 07:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by dharak1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T07:42:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn normal mode they won\u0027t and your ship will start rotating unless you have enough reaction wheels to compensate for it. Of course as soon as you release the button, SAS function will take over RCS thrusters and use them to compensate for the rotation too so it is possible to translate even with very unbalanced RCS and no torque if you let SAS work in between translation burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn precision mode (using Caps Lock key), they\u0027re supposed to do that, i.e. no (or very little) torque should be needed.
