The APAS-69, from CBBP\u0027s Soyuz Pack, has never worked correctly. I used them myself for awhile but got sick and tired of the issues, it was literally 90% of the time that they wouldn\u0027t work. Just switch back to stock docking ports, they don\u0027t look as nice but modded docking ports usually have problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) If you\u0027re getting stuck at a certain attitude, make sure ASAS is off.

When im trying to dock it makes it next to impossible because because rcs thinks im trying to do something when im not. Its done it usually when I disengaged the sas. Only fix seems to be return to space centre and reload the flight, which sets it to a different oosition to where I left it thus taking much longer to dock deoending how often this occurs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M5000","CreatedById":57096,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T03:24:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Neodyme\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Neodyme\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I\u0027m trying to dock my solar panels, buut its not doing it.
