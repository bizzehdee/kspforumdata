I think it\u0027s a bit ridiculous, as these chutes are much needed in the early career, when flying planes around Kerbin, doing contracts, long before any space exploration. Is it possible to disable that level requirement? I couldn\u0027t find anything in new game settings, nor in debug menu, nor any mod that does this. Maybe someone in config files?
