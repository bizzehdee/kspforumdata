I\u0027m currently just playing around with the demo version trying to determine if i want to buy this game or not, and I\u0027m having a bit of trouble getting off the ground. Or rather, staying off the ground. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I launch a rocket, the parachute deploys at the same time. I tried adding a second stage, and the first stage fires and detaches just fine, but when I fire the rockets for the last stage, the parachute deploys again. What am I doing wrong?

On the very right of your screen in the Vehicle Assembly Building, or on the very left of your screen in-flight, you\u0027ll see a bunch of square icons grouped into tabs with orange labels. Look for one that depicts a parachute. Now mouse over them, and look for a plus anywhere. Click it, then drag the empty stage that you just created all the way to the top. Then grab the parachute icon and drag it into that new, top stage. That will make the parachute the very last stage to deploy, and so it shouldn\u0027t interfere with your rocket anymore :-).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, KSP is awesome. Quite unique.
