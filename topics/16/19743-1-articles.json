Because you burn east to achieve orbit, you continually burn east to extend it eastward but to move it up or down you need to angle it by burning north or south. This will extend your orbit somewhat though so you have to account for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-21T19:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key to changing your orbit plane is burning perpendicular to your plane on the direction you wish your orbit to move. Remember your orbit pivots by your current location and will always have an axis passing through the orbit body. (Kerbol when trying to capture planet, your planet when trying to capture moon, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo sum up, first you want to have your orbital axis relative to you aligned with the orbit path you are trying to capture. Imagine an infinitely long line going from your ship to the sun extending forever out in both directions. When this line also crosses the orbit path you are trying to match, that is when you want to begin your burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do your burn, You need to align yourself perpendicular heading to your travel direction but still aligned to the horizon. Atm, computer trouble so all I unfortunately am getting is red x for images so cannot reference yours specific (on my end, not yours I don\u0027t think) So if you have a 90 degree heading and need to have the direction you are orbiting to be on a downward plane, you burn south or 180 degrees. 90 degrees perpendicular. The orbit will pivot along the previous imaginary line, keep your perpendicular burn until plane is aligned. For extreme angles, you will need to adjust your heading as you go, but always keep aligned to horizon. Hope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pebble_garden","CreatedById":30150,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T13:11:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at your two orbits (Eve\u0027s and yours) from the side, you\u0027ll see two points where they cross. They\u0027ll be on opposite sides of your orbit. They\u0027re called the Crossing Nodes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter one of the nodes, your orbit will begin sink below Eve\u0027s; that\u0027s called the Descending Node. If you thrust UP at this point, you\u0027ll tilt your entire orbit into closer alignment Eve\u0027s. Or, thrust downward at the Ascending Node. It\u0027s best to do your plane-change burns at the farther, slower part of your orbit, to save fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI show how to do this at the end of my\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=UUnex_wag6pcSOGmGpTnXR0g\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E, which was made in KSP 0.16, but should still work fine in 0.17.
