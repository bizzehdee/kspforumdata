pretty good Pe from the Mun or Minmus, assuming that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nyou have a heatshield\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nyou don\u0027t have a super-massive ship hiding behind that heatshield\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n...i.e. for a typical Mun-return science lander.\u00A0 This Pe will be perfectly safe with a heatshield, and will take you down to the surface in one pass (no multiple-pass aerobraking).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main thing is to make sure you have enough stability and/or torque and/or control ability to keep yourself pointed retrograde, with the heatshield between your dainty bits and the blowtorch.\u00A0 If you\u0027ve got that Science Jr. slung underneath the command pod, then your ship may be prone to flipping, because you\u0027ve got the lightweight Science Jr. in front of the relatively heavy command pod.\u00A0 You\u0027ll probably be fine, if you\u0027ve got at least level-1 SAS (i.e. a HECS-or-better probe core, or a level-1-or-better pilot).\u00A0 If you set your SAS to \u0022hold retrograde\u0022 then you\u0027ll probably be fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA safer way, less prone to instability, would be to put the heatshield directly below the command pod, and jettison the Science Jr. before coming home.\u00A0 That will be a nice, aerodynamically stable ship for reentry.\u00A0 But you should be okay in the above-described configuration, as long as you are careful to stick religiously close to retrograde as you reenter.\u00A0 (Note that you want to be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esurface\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E retrograde, not \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eorbit\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E retrograde, so put your navball into surface mode before

basically you want to wait as late as you can get away with so that you can burn all the fuel before overheating.\u00A0 Engines are fairly heat-resistant-- you can actually bring a ship home from the Mun without a heatshield, if it\u0027s lightweight and you make good use of body lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you wait until Pe, that may be a bit too late with a 30-35 km Pe.\u00A0 (My suggestion of 30-35 km is for ships with no retro-burn ability.)\u00A0 So, a couple of options:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSet your Pe to something a bit higher, like 45 km.\u00A0 Normally that would not be low enough to go down in one pass, if you\u0027re coming back from the Mun.\u00A0 However, that\u0027s high enough that it ought to be survivable for the Terrier.\u00A0 So you could do that, wait until Pe, burn all your fuel, jettison.\u00A0 You\u0027ll probably coast up to a low Ap one time, then reenter fairly easily.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse the 30-35km Pe I suggest, but start your retro-burn when you\u0027re at around 50 km.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T01:11:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote
