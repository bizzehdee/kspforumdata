I encountered a few issues along the way, such as the solar pannels I put on the lander not retracting for my aerobrake maneuver due to the pannel update, but my biggest concern is fuel. Currently I have a refuel stage headed to duna to give a little extra fuel to the transport stage\u00A0(even though I have plenty) but it\u0027s also hauling a battery pack and retractable solar pannels to go down with the lander. I was curious if, over all, the lander has enough fuel to make it to orbit and meet the transport stage, which is at about 105-110k meters. It\u0027s a lander can with a senior port, a quarter 2.5m tank of fuel, a poodle engine, two solid rocket boosters (thumper) for takeoff that have decouplers to seperate, 8 parachutes (better safe than sorry), and the heaviest landing legs (4).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncluding the additional stuff, will this be good or should I consider more fuel to be taken by the refuel vessel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should add this is by memory.

Again, this is a save from .24, which is nearing 2 years old. Which means it was not outfitted properly whatsoever. My biggest worry is, since this was pre deadly reentry, is that the lander will burn up because of the lack of heat dispersers. The entire shuttle survived the aerobrake maneuver (I stayed a bit higher than normal and used a bit of fuel to get out of the escape trajectory) but landing is another story. I know that Duna has a weak atmosphere so if I enter low enough can I look to avoid massive overheating?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T21:02:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222457116\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134170\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457988212\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160319\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bncrock\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, bncrock said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that Duna has a weak atmosphere so if I enter low enough can I look to avoid massive overheating?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom my experiences with Duna, you don\u0027t really need any heat shielding at all if you\u0027re coming in from low orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bncrock","CreatedById":160319,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T21:08:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222457142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134170\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457989329\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150330\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cubinator\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, cubinator said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom my experiences with Duna, you don\u0027t really need any heat shielding at all if you\u0027re coming in from low orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T22:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy last time at Duna was an interplanetary air brake at 15 km.
