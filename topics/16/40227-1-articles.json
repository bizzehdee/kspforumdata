This will ensure that any point on Kerbin\u0027s equatorish region and equatorial orbits will have coverage. However, since geosynchronous orbit is reaaaaaally high, you will experience signal delays.

In such a strategy, you launch more satellites into a low orbit around Kerbin. This way, even though any one satellite is not stationed over top of KSC at all times, at least one is, and as such you still have contact. You can refer to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Satellite_Coverage\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E tutorial if you want to know precise numbers for your LKO network, but I always like to overestimate the number of sats I put up there to compensate for improper orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMECHJEB ALERT!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E If you\u0027re so inclined, you can use MechJeb to place your sats into absolutely perfect orbits, whether synchronous or not. I did not do this for my network, and it is entirely optional. However, if your geosynchronous orbit is not perfect, over time it will drift relative to the other satellites and the point on the planet\u0027s surface it is supposed to be hovering over. (for example: if you timewarp for ~500 days transferring to Eeloo, your satellites will not be in the positions you left them at). A low Kerbin orbit, especially with many satellites is better for this scenario, as there is more room for error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, antennas \u0026amp; dishes. This is \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E important; my first relay satellite had only one satellite dish, and was useless. You want all your ships to have antennas, as they do not require you to manually point them at a target, plus they can send \u0026amp; receive signals. You only want to use dishes to transmit signals farther away than your relay network. If you have a sat farther out than antennas can manage, then you will want to place at least two dishes onto it, one to receive signals from your Kerbin relay network, and one to transmit them further out, for example to the aforementioned Eeloo probe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to recap (or TL;DR):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn low Kerbin orbit or synchronous orbit, you want to have a network of small satellites. These will all include antennas and at least one satellite dish. The purpose of these is to take the commanding signal from KSC and be able to transmit it to any craft that goes beyond the horizon (or Sphere of Influence). The craft that flies outward \u003Cstrong\u003EMUST\u003C/strong\u003E have a satellite dish, which should be pointed at the nearest satellite with a connection to KSC. This will enable the unmanned exploration of Eeloo to continue unabated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thought: an alternative to the two Kerbin relay networks might be to pepper the equator of Kerbin with \u0027Relay Stations\u0027 which include crew and a RemoteCommand module.

In such a strategy, you launch more satellites into a low orbit around Kerbin. This way, even though any one satellite is not stationed over top of KSC at all times, at least one is, and as such you still have contact. You can refer to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Satellite_Coverage\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E tutorial if you want to know precise numbers for your LKO network, but I always like to overestimate the number of sats I put up there to compensate for improper orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMECHJEB ALERT!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E If you\u0027re so inclined, you can use MechJeb to place your sats into absolutely perfect orbits, whether synchronous or not. I did not do this for my network, and it is entirely optional. However, if your geosynchronous orbit is not perfect, over time it will drift relative to the other satellites and the point on the planet\u0027s surface it is supposed to be hovering over. (for example: if you timewarp for ~500 days transferring to Eeloo, your satellites will not be in the positions you left them at). A low Kerbin orbit, especially with many satellites is better for this scenario, as there is more room for error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, antennas \u0026amp; dishes. This is \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E important; my first relay satellite had only one satellite dish, and was useless. You want all your ships to have antennas, as they do not require you to manually point them at a target, plus they can send \u0026amp; receive signals. You only want to use dishes to transmit signals farther away than your relay network. If you have a sat farther out than antennas can manage, then you will want to place at least two dishes onto it, one to receive signals from your Kerbin relay network, and one to transmit them further out, for example to the aforementioned Eeloo probe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to recap (or TL;DR):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn low Kerbin orbit or synchronous orbit, you want to have a network of small satellites. These will all include antennas and at least one satellite dish. The purpose of these is to take the commanding signal from KSC and be able to transmit it to any craft that goes beyond the horizon (or Sphere of Influence). The craft that flies outward \u003Cstrong\u003EMUST\u003C/strong\u003E have a satellite dish, which should be pointed at the nearest satellite with a connection to KSC. This will enable the unmanned exploration of Eeloo to continue unabated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thought: an alternative to the two Kerbin relay networks might be to pepper the equator of Kerbin with \u0027Relay Stations\u0027 which include crew and a RemoteCommand module. This will act like another Kerbal Space Centre, providing control to craft within range of its antennas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother last thought: RemoteTech 2 is nearing completion and will likely change the way relay networks and other techniques work. As such, this guide won\u0027t be very applicable anymore. Just keep that in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helped, and good luck in creating your vast interplanetary networks of satellites! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank You so much for the explanation you really pointed out a lot of questions i had.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xeomatrix00","CreatedById":76888,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T22:58:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Commander Zoom\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Commander Zoom\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA slightly cheaty way (but only slightly, and used only to make up for not being able to set navigational waypoints within the orbital map system) that someone else suggested to me:\u003Cp\u003EFirst, do your math (see all of the above) to determine where your satellite needs to end up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake a very simple target satellite, even just a probe core with nothing attached, and put it on the pad.
