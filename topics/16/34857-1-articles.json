For the most part it functions really well with some good throttle control. My boosters get my up to around 45,000 meters, but thats where things start to fall apart. As soon as the boosters cut off I try and do a MECO as well to stop the ship from flipping forward continuously until eventually it just rips itself apart. But that doesn\u0027t always work. I want to try and limit the use of RCS when balancing it out, just some good throttle control on my part. But any touch of power when the boosters are gone and the ship starts to flip end over end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome help would be appreciated.

The vehicle is not designed for massive inclination shifts or extra-orbital travel. The space shuttle main engine is vectored quite significantly to offset the weight of the main tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could have, say, 3 engines though, 2 being ascent engines that are tilted, and a third one in-line with the vehicle itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the space shuttle design itself was pretty flawed. It\u0027s a cargo hauler design that is very unsafe in practice. NASA is going back to the old, disposable, vertical launch vehicles. And they are going to use the much safer dual launch system with orbital cargo rendezvous. It\u0027s easier to abort a launch when you can just decouple a capsule and hit the ejection tower SRBs. Instead of needing to move the shuttle crew on two decks to the hatch so they can bail out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steffen_anywhere","CreatedById":64915,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T16:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk so I\u0027ve quite recently started playing KSP and once I got good at all the basics, I just wanted to build a Space Shuttle \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I simply love the design and fact that it is/was \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E the only \u0022reusable\u0022 spacecraft ever flown (true for the most part...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigning a working shuttle in KSP is extremely hard compared to a conventional rocket. The only way you can counteract the non-symmetrical design is by asymmetric thrust by the orbiter\u0027s (a.k.a. Shuttle\u0027s) main engines so that overall the centre of thrust generated by the SRBs and the Shuttle\u0027s main engines intersects with the centre of mass of the whole thing with external tank and SRBs, etc... Then, after booster separation, this has to be true as well!!! I found this the hardest part in my design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my attempt at a reasonably realistic shuttle using KW Rocketry only in orbit (well suborbit cuz I kinda ran out of fuel during the test launch \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) (for the big SRBs mostly) (i\u0027ll add pics on the pad and during ascent later if u like, but so far I don\u0027t have any cuz the thing is so hard to fly that it keeps me occupied and unable to take screenshots \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HJ2HylM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HJ2HylM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle\u0027s main engines are tilted up by 10 degrees for the reasons I explained earlier.

(The super gimbal engine solution won\u0027t work that well trust me unless you maybe use mechjeb. I don\u0027t use it myself, so I don\u0027t know...
