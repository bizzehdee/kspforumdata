I lock the brake, hardly any effect. I even increase the brake torque to maximum, nothing. It was not like this for me pre-1.0. Is anyone else noticing this?"},{"CreatedByName":"X-SR71","CreatedById":108775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T22:57:18Z","Content":"I find it funny that you can actually brake harder if you go in reverse with powered rover wheels. Brakes are a joke.\n\nWhat you need for plane wheels is air brakes to go along with them. Works ok then."},{"CreatedByName":"SalehRam","CreatedById":138066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T22:59:57Z","Content":"This is happening to me as well, and I started to put 2 radial chutes on the back of any large plane I have to slow it down before the end of the runway (if I did not make my landing in the beginning of the runway)...\n\nHowever, since 1.0 I started to use the aerodynamics and the physics of real planes, I usually touch the runway with my speed below 80m/s and I use flaps to allow the plane to fly on such low speeds (below 100m/s)\n\nIf everything goes well, and I am aligned to the runway, I usually touch it in the first quarter, and I take my time then slowing down until I fully stop... the 2 radial chutes on the back are for emergency only, so I don\u0027t usually deploy them unless I doubt I\u0027ll stop before the end of the runway...\n\nAlso, the airbrakes are very useful now, since they help my control my speed during the landing process."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T23:29:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I find it funny that you can actually brake harder if you go in reverse with powered rover wheels. Brakes are a joke.\n\nThat\u0027s because there\u0027s a bug with the tweakables for rover wheels. If you right click on the wheel, you\u0027ve basically ruined it\u0027s braking action.\n\n* * *\n\nAs for airplane wheels, their brakes seem to be more effective. So I\u0027m not sure specifically which wheels and/or how much mass you\u0027re trying to stop. Keep in mind that high speed landings can also impact the braking action quite a bit. If you have a picture or .craft that might help us out.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T00:58:00Z","Content":"Try setting up spoilers. The elevons have a \u0022Normal\u0022 and a \u0022Deployed\u0022 state, and an option to flip the direction. Make it so they deploy upwards for spoilers, and then bind it to the brakes action group. That will hopefully reduce your lift when you touch the brakes, increasing the weight on the wheels and therefore increasing braking effectiveness."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T01:11:25Z","Content":"The biggest problem with this is people try to find new ways to slow down after landing, while that does work and many designs (including the NASA STS) use that kind of idea, your best bet in KSP is to find ways to slow down while in the air. The simplest way is to configure Flaps. Basically the same process cantab described but they should deploy down. This puts more lift under the wings and allows you to reduce your speed without nose diving for a nice smooth low speed touchdown.\n\nYou can do spoilers as well but a lot of people don\u0027t understand spoilers will do almost nothing if placed on the trailing edge of the wing like flaps and elevons. The idea is to remove lift to keep you on the ground and also create drag. If you put them on the back of the wing, they will create drag but do very little for lift. Real spoilers are placed [in the rear ~1/3 of the top of the wing](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanflyers.net%2Faviationlibrary%2Fpilots_handbook%2Fimages%2Fchapter_4_img_28.jpg\u0026f=1) typically. What they do is create a stall over part of the wing to reduce lift, but if there is no wing behind them to stall, it doesn\u0027t do anything. As lift dumpers, spoilers are typically only deployed on the ground to keep you firmly on the ground.\n\nIn 1.0 you can use airbrakes to create drag similar to spoilers, even on the ground. Airbrakes are typically distributed in such a way as they do NOT dump lift, unlike spoilers.\n\nIn 1.0, you will find parachutes can be used as drag chutes to be deployed after touchdown (again, like the NASA STS). Personally I think this is the most visibly pleasing option.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T01:17:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 01:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vegvisir","CreatedById":148279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T02:17:32Z","Content":"Great pointers here, interesting to read.

A proper landing would see you at near stalling speed when touching down. In fact, the final touch down should be a stall, but that\u0027s actually pretty hard to accomplish in KSP, so just try to go as slow as possible, but be sure you\u0027re well lined to the runway, because you won\u0027t be able to do much maneuvering at low speeds.\n\nAnd then add drag-chutes ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
