If you can build a plane that uses much more than that to get to orbit you have my respect\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nDid some quick math and figured 16k LFO mix to orbit isn\u0027t actaully that much but still, if you add the cost of tanks, fins decouplers and engines the amount of LFO mix you can buy for one stage, never mind a 3 stage rocket with external boosters, becomes ridiculous."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T21:06:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wouldn\u0027t there be a point where the cost of fuel spent would be more than the cost of disposing of rocket stages?\n\nTechnically yes, practically no.\n\nMost the cost in fuel is the container (50% or more). Recovery refunds that. Additionally, you have the lifter engines, which pushes the wet to dry cost ratio lower.\n\nStaging also has dead weight in the form of unused engines and decouplers that a SSTO doesn\u0027t need."},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T22:17:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\*sigh\\* Do you mean SSTO, or spaceplane?\n\u003E I\u0027ve made SSTOs that can get several hundred tonnes to orbit, rockets are easier to build and fly than spaceplanes.\n\nSorry, I had assumed SSTOs naturally meant spaceplanes.
