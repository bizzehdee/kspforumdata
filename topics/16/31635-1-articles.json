Aerobraking should save about 2500dv. You might want some of that to raise your Pe after your aerobraking though, so I would use 2000dv saving in your design to be on the safe side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did it at 120Km, which I think would have taken 2 orbits but I got a lucky encounter for Laythe so went straight in (you can aerobrake there too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest to aim too high (do another orbit) than too low (fiery death). Quick save and try a few different heights.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"creator1629","CreatedById":61446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T23:30:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoh ok, wow 2000 delta v is a lot. youre right, ill give it a go at 120 km and see if that is enough to stop me, thats what quick save is for. i agree, better a few extra orbits than a fiery crash\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
