I have a very niche need with a video series I\u0027m doing, and would like to know if there is any mod, or really just any way in general, to have all part costs hidden in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E when building crafts. I want the costs to still count towards the total and everything, but I\u0027d like to hide the cost of the parts as I\u0027m hovering over them and seeing new information.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way to get the game to omit that information?
