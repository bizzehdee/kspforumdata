It survived a 2400 m/s unpowered\u00A0insertion just fine, but when I landed in the ocean I could not get it back in the air. My extensive testing on Kerbin did not account for the lower atmospheric pressure at sea level on Laythe. The plane was only able to reach about 60% of the liftoff speed due to reduced jet engine thrust, and in the reduced atmosphere it did not have enough lift. I\u0027ve already planned a more extensive testing regime, but it occurs to me I might be able to make my original design that I a quite proud of work if I simply add rocket engines to the belly and use them to lift it out of the water. They\u0027d be action grouped to turn off with the press of a button. Ideally they wouldn\u0027t be staged, but we don\u0027t have that option in game yet. Has anyone else ever used rockets to grant a jet aircraft \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003Evtol\u003C/abbr\u003E capability? Any pointers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, do the relay antenna parts generate a noticeable amount of drag? My bases always have to include at least 3 antennas: One high gain antenna per science lab (at least 2), and one relay antenna. But because the base i have to redesign is also a plane, I need to know if drag from the relay antenna has to be accounted for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-25T21:18:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, plenty of people make \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003Evtol\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplanes or rato ones.

Anyway I\u0027ve built a version of the base with a larger wing and two more engines, and tested it with the 60% thrust I can expect in Laythe\u0027s lighter atmosphere. It seems promising, more so than the previous heartbreaking failure. A few more changes and it should be ready for a Laythe test. And i\u0027ve reshaped the plane to put the relay antenna in fully in the shadow of the wider parts of the fuselage. Keeping a relay antenna on the thing is really more about principle than need. Anyway I like this version so much that if it fails to lift off Laythe\u0027s ocean, I\u0027ll probably add aerosppikes to its belly and show gravity who\u0027s the boss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
