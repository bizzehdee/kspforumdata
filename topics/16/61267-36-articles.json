The first thing I don\u0027t like is clutter.\u00A0 For a long time, I cursed KSP because occasionally when I returned to the Tracking View, it would light up ALL the various craft types by default and show LOTS of clutter, especially relays buzzing everywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would turn them all off except the type I was particularly looking for.\u00A0 Occasionally, when exiting the Tracking View (via the exit door) rather than e.g. switching to a ship, I would turn off that last type selection I had lit, so that everything was clean \u0026amp; tidy for the next use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, that was the problem: KSP figures it is useless (and perhaps confusing) to have no types lit, so it helpfully? then lights them all for you.\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003ECurses, KSP!!\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now I just leave something like EVAs lit, because there are very few of those in progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.
