It won\u0027t have the fuel to get out there from low Eve orbit so I\u0027ll need to drop it out far enough then lower the main ship\u0027s orbit down so I can drop a lander and rover onto Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater I\u0027ll take the main ship and the recovered lander can back out to Gilly to refuel with the lander left out there for the trip back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to alter the warp altitude limit for Gilly?

Make sure this apoapsis is approximately in Gilly\u0027s orbital plane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- coast to that apoapsis and either leave your lander there to raise the periapsis and catch up with Gilly (about 300 m/s dv needed) or perform that maneuver with the ship, intercept Gilly, and release the lander within Gilly\u0027s SOI\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T21:32:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d follow Kashua\u0027s advice.

All velocities within Gilly\u0027s tiny SOI are so low that you can literally die of old age waiting for your lander to fall to Gilly\u0027s surface. Having vertical RCS jets to push you toward the ground therefore recommended. In the alternative, you can point the lander towards the ground and thrust that way with the main engine. Your choice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T23:32:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh, landing on Gilly conventionally isn\u0027t *that* time-consuming.
