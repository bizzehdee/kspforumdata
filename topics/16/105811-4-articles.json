Science is not really infinite because at some point you fill out the tech tree and that\u0027s it. The numbers might go up still if you visit the labs and collect the science but why would you?\n\nI\u0027ve just about finished the tech tree in a new science game for 1.0. It didn\u0027t make much difference to how long it took using MPLs doing continuous research compared to if I\u0027d collected and returned the data. The craft were bigger and the missions more complicated with MPLs. I put 8 at different biomes on the Mun and one on Minmus with all the science experiments onboard. I then did a Duna mission and after that all the MPLs were full with 500 science. Harvesting that fleshed out anything else useful on the tech tree. Another round and it will likely be finished.\n\nSo, this feature doesn\u0027t really make MPLs a reason to have bases beyond the mid-term. They are useless once the tech tree is done with. Unless I suppose you were playing a contract game and wanted to convert the science into cash. It did make an interesting change to do the science this way though."},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T13:53:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They are useless once the tech tree is done with.

That\u0027s exactly the reason most of us long-time players use KAC to manage multiple simultaneous missions in parallel. Of course, if you run any kind of half-way efficient program, you\u0027ll have maxed out your Tech Tree long before your mission to Eeloo even arrives - by the time it gets there you\u0027ll find it\u0027s hopelessly obsolete and you\u0027ll have forgotten how to fly efficiently with the more primitive parts. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) And of course any new Science!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 you recover will be useless unless you have a Strategy that converts Science!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 to Funds or something."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:02:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The main problem with Eeloo though is that it takes YEARS to get there.\n\nI doubt that it\u0027s even worthwhile. The multiplier *in space high* around Kerbin already is quite good. I found that a brief tour of the Kerbin system was sufficient to fill the lab to it\u0027s 500 point maximum, just with data collected from orbit around Kerbin and the Mun.\n\nThe problem is on the other end: With one-star scientists, a load of 500 Data will yield less than one point/day and last several years. That\u0027s totally underwhelming.\n\nAs the experience system requires you to return your scientists from faraway places in order to gain more stars, Labs seem to be a *very* late-game feature. Only really useful after you\u0027ve already been to most places, or maybe not even then.

This means that you need to periodically transmit to empty it out and also to add in a little more data (keep the data as high as possible). It\u0027s a very slow trickle of science which means that in all likelihood you will only check on the lab between time warps. Using better scientists increased the rate at which you gain science, but not the capacity of the lab, so that means you need to check the lab more often to transmit a full \u0022tank\u0022 of science points. But since you are likely using time warp anyway, what is the difference between time warping a few days more or less to get the full science?\n\nPerhaps scientists should also increase the storage capacity for the science collected through research.\n\nMy personal use of the lab so far has been on a journey out to a planet and then back to land at Kerbin, so I was able to use the lab to research and transmit science while I time warped from maneuver to maneuver. I did not leave a lab in space though, I brought it back home. I easily added 1000\u002B science to my mission by doing it this way though, so I guess that was handy."},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:40:31Z","Content":"With the appropriate strategies in management science points equal money so even late in the game science points have a use, even those from Eeloo.\n\nBut bringing experiments to Eeloo from Kerbin, Mun etc. makes no roleplaying/realistic sense to me.\n\nThe slow trickle of science really is only a problem because of the lack of info on labs processing status.\n\nFor modders to provide such info - e.g. KAC - it would be helpful to know when the calculations are made.\n\nIs the conversion calculated retroactively when returning to the lab as active vessel or constantly in the background?\n\nDoes the amount of data influence the conversion speed only when starting the processing or is the science/day rate getting lower again over time?"},{"CreatedByName":"Silpion","CreatedById":90797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:11:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E - You can put an experiment in as many labs as you like ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nHow does this work?
