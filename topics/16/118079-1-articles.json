I build a rocket with a lander, SRBs, lots of fuel etc. but when I do my gravity turn my rocket spins out of control and either a) crashes or ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) messes up the orbit. I have tried adding more ASAS modules throughout the rocket but they don\u0027t work. The Kerbal 5 works, but it doesn\u0027t have landing legs nor enough fuel to get to the Mun.

Practice, be patient with yourself. You\u0027ll get it and, once you do, messing about in space is comparatively easy.

From the sound of it, though, your rocket might not be balanced symmetrically - if it\u0027s pulling to one side as you fly, that\u0027s likely the cause. \n\n[Here\u0027s a pic of mine from my 0.18 demo days.](http://www.wcnews.com/chatzone/attachments/screenshot27-png.6276/) That\u0027s what folks around here call an \u0022onion-staged\u0022 rocket; the boosters come off in layers. I used to fly that straight up to 10k, then pitch to 45 degrees on a easterly heading, and hold that until the Ap was at 100k; that\u0027s not the best way to fly that craft, even in the demo, but it worked for the early going.\n\nThese days (i.e. 1.0.x), that same flight profile would be suicidal, of course...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T13:41:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 01:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T13:49:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...from my 0.18 demo days...\n\nDoh!
