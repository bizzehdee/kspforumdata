I\u0027m sure there\u0027s no set in stone rules but I was wondering what the most used sizes are for various things? Or is it completely mission-dependant and there\u0027s no general consensus at all?\n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T12:20:31Z","Content":"Generally speaking a stage is only as large as it needs to be. Just sending a 1 man capsule to orbit? Use a 1.25m stack. Sending a 3 man capsule to that awesome space station of yours? 2.5m Stack, but short. Full on apollo mission with an accurate recreation of the Lunar Lander with structural panels and panel fairings? Better break out the big guns and use 3.75m parts.\n\nWorry less about part size and more about dV, form follows function with rockets."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T16:44:18Z","Content":"In general only use the larger parts to reduce part-count. 2.5m is useful for large vehicles assembled in orbit, by docking, because the large \u0027senior\u0027 docking port causes less wobble than the smaller ones. Otherwise the trick, as Taki117 said, is \u0027only as large as it needs to be\u0027.\n\nDesign small and, especially, light. Less is more and all that stuff.

You can do a Munshot with 1.25m tech, 2.5 is only required if you have a 2 or 3 man pod, and 3.75 is unnecessary. Rockets in KSP can be pencils; exactly as wide at the top as they are at the bottom. Though you\u0027ll probably want to strap solid fuel boosters on the aft-end ^^\n\nThe tech tree is a little clumpy, but you don\u0027t go too wrong if you unlock it in vertical stripes, rather than trying to race down one branch or another.\n\nAs others have said above; minimise, minimise, minimise - the three keys to profiting in your career game!"}]}
