There is no in game update option. The readme text it says to use Patcher.Exe which I can\u0027t find, its supposed to be in the main install directory.\n\nI purchased 1.0 and the download section shows a version 1.02 is available. Do I just download the Zip and extract over the existing install?\n\nUnless I\u0027m missing something really obvious I\u0027m really surprised that the update process is not more straightforward."},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:29:16Z","Content":"I\u0027d lean towards downloading the zip, extracting it separately, and copying any saves/craft over."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:48:34Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111114-A-Complete-Beginner-s-Guide-Induction-To-Construction](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111114-A-Complete-Beginner-s-Guide-Induction-To-Construction)\n\nLauncher.exe is the programme that checks-for and applies updates, for people who find replacing one download with another too complicated. Steam will push the same thing, for those that are using it, which is usually too aggressive an option as updates aren\u0027t under your control any more."},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:11:18Z","Content":"Yes, while if you run Launcher.exe, it will download the Patcher and update your game, I\u0027ve never managed to get it to work properly for me, meaning that the best option I find is just downloading the .zip and copying saves over."}]}
