So, I tried the realism mode and made my descent in IVA, by panning between radar altitude, navball and speedometer(?). When I was sure I was approximately 10m from the ground (from radar altitude) I hit the ground. Thankfully I was only at 7 m/s, hence the ship survived. Which brings me the question;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the Radar Altitude in IVA show the vertical distance from the pod to the ground, or from the BASE of the ship to the ground? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T08:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am pretty sure it\u0027s from the pod to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the best way is to switch to pod momentarily, fix the camera on the altimeter, then whenever you want to look at the altitude, press C and then press C again to exit to see the rest of data. Below certain altitude you don\u0027t really need to know your exact altitude, you can just keep your vertical speed around 6 m/s and wait till it lands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem is with slopes. It\u0027s pretty hard to see the slope below you before you touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T18:11:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am also pretty sure it\u0027s from the pod to the ground, but if you are landing on one of the lakes of minmus as long as you stay below about 10m/s you should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"egnio98","CreatedById":54630,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T00:11:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo if I build an exceptionally tall lander, the radar altitude would be wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s a bummer.
