I do quite well up until I get into the over 300/320 ton area ships, with payloads of generally of at least ~60 tons (the payload is far less heavy once trying to return from my destination, like maybe 15 tons or something).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, I must not fully understand how dV is calculated or works, because when I get to this point (I always avoid this, I try and make my crafts as minimal in all aspects as Kerbally possible) it comes to a head, and no matter what I do, I can\u0027t increase my dV any further...generally not past 3k for the lower stages. My upper stages are fine, just very heavy.

Total mass without fuel: 1465 kg (if I got it right); total mass with fuel: 2465 kg. The LV909 has an I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0in vacuum of 345 (and 85 at 1 atm pressure which is why you don\u0027t want to use it in the atmosphere). Plugging in gives you: DV = 345\u00D79.81\u00D7\u003Cem\u003Eln\u003C/em\u003E1.68 = 1755 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, let\u0027s put that on top of two FLT-800 tanks and a LVT-45 swivel (and let\u0027s not forget the stack decoupler). Empty mass of the first stage: 2250 kg\u2014but wait, we need to add the top stage (full mass) to that as well. That puts the total empty mass at 5015 kg (but it does have a DV of 1755 m/s out of the box). Each FLT-800 holds 4000kg of propellant, so your full mass is 13015 kg. At ground level the Swivel has an I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0of 270, and 320 in vacuum. Let\u0027s for argument sake assume that it averages out at 300 for our launch. DV of the bottom stack is then: 300\u00D79.81\u00D7\u003Cem\u003Eln(\u003C/em\u003E13015/5015\u003Cem\u003E) =\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E1428 m/s. Note that you get\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0DV from this second stage despite having 8\u00D7 as much fuel! That\u0027s because the dry/wet ratio improved only a little bit, and the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0of the bottom stage is actually less.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo your total DV for the entire stack is 1428 \u002B 1755 = 3183 m/s which will, sadly, not get you into orbit. This is where you can add two SRB\u0027s, but now things rapidly get complicated. You\u0027ll have to treat the your second stage \u0022with boosters\u0022 as one stage (where only a little bit of fuel of the FLT-800\u0027s get uses) and then, once the SRB\u0027s are gone,use the amount of fuel in your second stage at\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0point for the calculation of your DV. But I\u0027ll leave that as an exercise to the student. This is why most of us resort to Mechjeb or KER for these things.

I am able to do both contracts in the same mission, but bringing 7 Kerbals just wasn\u0027t possible. The first contract was essentially landing on Minmus with a space station consisting of antenna, docking port, power generation, room for at least 5 Kerbals, 1000 mono propellant, and 4000 liquid fuel. It\u0027s pretty much impossible to have that enormous amount of fuel after all the dV needed to land on Minmus from Kerbin, so an ISRU and drills were necessary.

If you have a ship with a Poodle (Isp = 350) and a mass ratio of 2.7, you can get 350 * 9.81 * 1 delta-v = 3433 m/s. But even if you add infinite fuel it\u0027ll never exceed 3.50 * 9.81 * e = 9300 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reasoning behind this is simply that if you add fuel, you have to lift that same fuel. You get diminishing returns for every additional bit of fuel, and the mathematical definition of \u0022diminishing returns\u0022 is the natural logarithm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for the second part of your question, about adding weight: any weight added will reduce the dv of the stage where it is added and all lower stages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo maximise dv, you want to minimise what you are carrying, and maximise the amount of fuel in that carried weight. This is why drop tanks and asparagus staging are by far the best way of maximising efficiency: you need tanks and engines to carry the fuel load, but you want to get rid of the weight of the tanks when they are empty, and get rid of the engines when you no longer need so much thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, you add drop tanks (I often add drop tanks to my SRBs) and route fuel to the engines so that they use that first. You put a number of 2x radial stages around your rocket and route fuel from one to the next and then to the core, so that when each set of tanks (and engine, needed to carry them) is empt, then you abandon them leaving the rest of the rocket fully fueled with the optimum level of thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course, you use vertical staging so that a large lower stage (with a mass ratio of 2 or 3 or so) carries a smaller upper stage (again with a mass ratio of 2 or 3 or so) and so on - giving each stage an optimal amount of delta-V before it drops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you add mass to the final stage, it\u0027ll severely reduce the final stage\u0027s dv, significantly reduce the dv of the stage below it, and slightly reduce the dv of the stage before that...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-21T21:59:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2016 09:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-21T22:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome tips:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
