If the gap is bigger, you need more wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWing Placement = Always place so Center of Mass is overlapping Center of Lift, just forward of it (the two spheres should touch, with the CoM in front) - when you get better at design you can loosen this rule up a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding Gear Placement = Place the rear wheel set centered on the center of mass so the back wheel is just barely behind the CoM. If the plane tips over backward on the runway, bump the rear gears backward just a hair in the SPH and try again. Shania gave another great tip about the forward gear placement.
