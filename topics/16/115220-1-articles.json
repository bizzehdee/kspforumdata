The wiki isn\u0027t very help. I understand it has something to do with how KSP computes trajectories. Can someone enlighten me on what the term means, and what I need to know about how it applies to real situations in KSP? \n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T23:14:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ibanix**"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T19:10:45Z","Content":"It basically means that the elpse representing your orbit will account for escape velocities and therefore other bodies as well. Without patched conics you will only have a grey elipse describing your orbit. With it, on the other hand, you can see an estimate of how you will move through several encounters."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T19:23:42Z","Content":"First, conic curve is a line you obtain by intersecting a cone with a plane - depending on angle of the plane and the cone, this can be a circle, an ellipse, or a parabola, which are all shapes of possible orbits or fly-bys. Now, the \u0022Patched\u0022 part means they are glued together as the ship exits SOI of one body and enters another - that\u0027s KSP\u0027s simplification vs real life where the other body still acts upon the ship, meaning the real orbits aren\u0027t pure ellipses or parabolas, but modelling n-body gravity would be far too much, so KSP uses the concept of \u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022 meaning if you\u0027re in Minmus orbit, Kerbin doesn\u0027t act upon you at all. So, patching (pasting end-to-end) the conic curves across multiple SOIs creates a \u0022patched conic\u0022.\n\nA side result of this simplification is that KSP has no Lagrangian Points."},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T19:24:31Z","Content":"Behold [the great wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patched_conic_approximation).\n\nIn short, patched conics is how KSP models gravity calculations - by splitting up each body into a sphere of influence and making an N-body problem into a much simple two-body problem.\n\nYou may also hear talk about the \u0022conic patch limit\u0022, which is a setting that says how many sphere of influence changes KSP will display/calculate your trajectory for.\n\nIn-game you\u0027ll see that upgrading the tracking station unlocks \u0022patched conics\u0022, which is nonsense if you read the wiki article I linked to. What it\u0027s really unlocking is a conic patch limit greater than 1 (ie. showing what happens when you change SOIs).\n\nEDIT: I guess it\u0027s not complete non-sense reading Sharpy\u0027s post above - although it\u0027s still modelling things using patched conics, it\u0027s not \u0022patching\u0022 any conic sections together (ie not showing accross SOI changes)... so the tracking station unlocking \u0022patched conics\u0022 actually does make sense.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T19:26:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nightingale**"},{"CreatedByName":"ibanix","CreatedById":147140,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T23:14:44Z","Content":"Thank you!"}]}
