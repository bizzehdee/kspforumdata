I can easily burn to fix that, but I end up wasting fuel. I\u0027m just wondering how I can make that decision during my initial transfer burn, or during transit with a course correction. I\u0027ve played around with it, but I haven\u0027t found a consistent procedure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if someone could let me know what terms I should use I\u0027d appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T04:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsually I wait until just after I leave Kerbin\u0027s low orbit (say, 300-500k in height) and play with a maneuver node radially to translate what side I\u0027m coming in on.

That will show your path through the Minmus SOI (assuming you\u0027re intercepting it) in Minmus\u0027s frame of reference, so you\u0027ll know which direction you\u0027re coming into Minmus long before you get there, and can fix the things if necessaryfor cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T04:36:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe tab key works too, to change focus, and it doesn\u0027t deselect the maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ronin688","CreatedById":95315,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T05:48:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOhh!
