You may need to orbit a few times before you and your target are in good positions to allow a Hohmann transfer.\n\nMechJeb is good for demonstrating this.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T01:36:36Z","Content":"You may also need to go forward an orbit or two to get a good intercept if you follow the tutorial directions so try clicking on the \u002B symbol on the node after you\u0027ve raised the apoapsis."},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T02:27:47Z","Content":"I try to set an orbit that goes ever so slightly past the target orbit, with two crossings, then drag the node (white circle) around until I\u0027m close.

How you can check that out is to select your target in your map, set it as your target. You will see a yellow ring with the letters AN and DN. AN = ascending node, DN = Descending node. What does that mean? It means that at that orbit you are on, you will cross it and either head ABOVE it or BELOW it. Ascending means you\u0027ll be going ABOVE your targets orbit after that point and visa versa with the DN.\n\n3) What you want is to make the AN and DN = 0 degrees. How to do this is to create a maneuver node at the AN or DN (it doesnt matter at all which one) that burns either UP or DoWN relative to the perpindicular of kerbins equator. This is called burning normal or antinormal. Just play with the maneuver node normal and antinormal until you see the AN AND DN get closer to 0 or NaN. \n\n4) Once you match inclination, you should fast forward timewarp and watch your craft approach your target. Being on a LOWER orbit means you\u0027re moving FASTER relative to your targets orbit. This is because you are travelling in a smaller circle which means LESS distance you need to cover in comparison to your target. \n\n5) Once you are RIGHT NEXT to your target, point your craft PROGRADE and do a very low level thrust burn until you see your map orbits CRISS CROSS, showing you those 2 symbol thingys, one is purple and the other is orange. This shows you your 2 closest approaches to your target ( you see 2 because you are in an ORBIT aka a CIRCLE, If you draw 2 circles that overlap you see 2 points where the circles intersect that is what those 2 arrows (purple and orange) represent). \n\n6) KEEP CHECKING your closest approach numbers on either the purple or orange arrows until you get it as close to 0 km as possible. The means that at that point you will be 0 km away from your target. \n\n7) Burn very slowly please. Make very fine adjustments, you don;t need to go full blast up in orbit to make a homan transfer. \n\n8) Once you get 0 km ish seperation, wait until JUST before you reach that closest approach point on your map.\n\n9) this is a part that is tricky. You need to make your RELATIVE speed to your target 0. On your navball you will see number on the top that have the words orbital and the number in m/s. CLICK this indicator until you see TARGET and a number in m/s, THAT is your relative speed to your target currently. That is what we want to make 0 m/s. \n\n10) When you\u0027ve clicked on the indicator and see target, your prograde and retrograde indicators MOVE to new spots on the navball. The shows you your HEADING in comparison to your target. Since you have a target relative velocity now AND your heading relative to your target, you can now match your orbit.\n\n11) Point your craft retrograde and start burning SLOWLY as you get closer and closer to your closest approach. You\u0027ll notice that your relative target speed is DROPPING and that your orbit is starting to match your targets. DO NOT SWITCH your speed indicator to orbital or surface! Keep it on target!!\n\n12) You\u0027ll also notice that your closest approach indicator is MOVING AWAY from you now. Whenever that happens, CUT your engine and wait until you get CLOSE again then burn. Keep doing this until your target speed indicator shows 0 m/s. \n\n13) Congrats, you\u0027ve rendezvoused. \n\n14) Get out of map view.\n\n15) Point your ships nose to your target. If you have SAS you can just click Target. TURN OFF your main engine. Turn ON your RCS and thrust FORWARD until you see the target indicator go UP to about 2 m/s. KEEP THE YELLOW PROGRADE marker IN the purple target marker. If you see it drift out, adjust with RCS to bring it back in.\n\n16) As you get closer to your target, start to slow down to 1m/s then reach 0 m/s when you are about 12 meters away. \n\n17) Docking is a skill you need to master on your own. My only advice to you is to make sure you are in LOCKED camera mode and try to orient your craft parallel to your target docking port OR switch to your target, take control of it, then point its docking port to your newly arriving ship. \n\n18) Dock via RCS."},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T11:09:38Z","Content":"Let me explain the intersect with images. Others have already explained it pretty well but I think with screenshots you\u0027ll probably have an easier time understanding their instructions.

View full album](//imgur.com/a/15VPI)\n\nPicture 1: Create a maneuvre node (fire prograde) that increases your orbit to just about touches the target orbit in one spot. As you can see your target will be ahead of you quite a bit at the closest intersect. This is exactly how you want it when approaching from a lower orbit. (If you approach from a higher orbit you want it to be a bit behind you at closest intersect).\n\nPic 2: Execute that node, then warp to *just after* the closest approach.\n\nPic 3: You now see the next closest approach. As you can see at the next closest approach you would be very far ahead of your target. Thus you have to increase your orbit. The best spot to do this is your current contact point between your orbit and the target orbit. So you point prograde and fire your rockets to increase your orbit. \n\n(Note: The tutorial bugged out on me because I did this manually, without a maneuvre node. You should probably do this with a maneuvre node designed so the outcome looks like in Pic 4, but I usually do this step without a node when not using mod auto pilots.)\n\nPic 4: This is how your next closest approach (or maneuvre node) should look. You can still fine-tune it but arriving at roughly 2 km is okay. You can then fast-forward to about a minute or so before the closest approach. (Note: Sometimes the closest approach still shifts but if it does it\u0027ll just mean you\u0027ll have to do more correction burns later. For the beginning this will suffice.)\n\nPic 5: This is taken near the closest approach. Note that the navball\u0027s mode is switched to target. The direction the ship is pointing in is set to retrograde. You can now fire your rockets until your relative velocity to the target is close to 0 (power down slowly when close to end). Technically, this already counts as a rendezvous for career mode quests but you\u0027ll have to still get closer before actually starting to use RCS.\n\nInstructions for small ships (doesn\u0027t work that well for large ships):\n\nSo you\u0027ll be moving at roughly 0 m/s relative to the target and you\u0027ll be ~300 m - 2.5 km away. You then point your ship towards the target (on the navball, not by sight!) and accelerate towards it (green marker should be close to or inside pink marker) until your relative velocity is 8-12 m/s. Then you point your ship back to retrograde (so you can again eliminate relative velocity once needed). Wait a bit (you can do a slow warp but be prepared to abort it) and watch the distance to your target carefully. It should decrease. The instant your distance starts increasing again you gently activate your engine and eliminate relative velocity. Repeat these steps until you are just about 300 m or so from the target and moving at roughly 0 m/s relative velocity.\n\nThen it is time to switch to RCS and the actual docking.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T11:12:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 11:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rofltehcat**"},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T20:38:39Z","Content":"Remember you can drag your maneuver around your orbit. Move it around and check intersection distances. You may need to add a very small amount of burn time or radial burn to get a crossing interesection depending on what part of your orbit you burn from of the target is not circularized.\n\nMove it around till you see a close approach. If you dont see a close approach then you need to wait another orbit in the phased orbits to get closer. Note the plus button on a maneuver node when right clicking allows you to delay the node an extra orbit, however this is canceled if you drag the node.\n\nSo usually I get into the phased orbit, make a node that intersects, drag it around and tweak burn times to find the closest intersection.\n\nI can usually get an intersection within 200m or 0.2km. Note the two orbits are very different, so what will happen is as I approach the target is use the navball in target mode to start burning retrograde but slowly enough that I\u0027m letting the target still approach. You can burn angled out slightly from retrograde and you\u0027ll see the retrograde marker \u0022pushed\u0022 towards the target marker. If you get retrograde marker lined up with target marker then it is coming straight at you. I usually dont line them completely because I dont want a collision.\n\nIf done right these two burns, first to create intersection, second to match target\u0027s speed (which will read 0m/s on target navball), will together get you on target\u0027s orbit ready for docking.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T20:40:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 08:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AaronLS**"}]}
