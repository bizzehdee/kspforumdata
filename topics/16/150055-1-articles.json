Adjusting that is a matter of ticking the box in the settings menu on the title screen in the graphics tab. You can also adjust the fade amount with the slider.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-15T20:38:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecifically, Reactordrone means the\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Emain\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0settings screen -- the one you get to my exiting to the Main Menu, then hitting Back once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sarogahtyp","CreatedById":170294,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-17T07:59:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhey guys,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks for your answers. Sadley they didnt help. I think I ve to be more precise with my question...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy problem is not the adjustment of the main orbital lines. what I cant adjust are the predicted course lines when you adjust a maneuver node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the behavior I d like to have:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022b87dw2id.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022424\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/KSA/Skyvents/b87dw2id.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022width:738px;\u0022 width=\u0022936\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see here the lines are dotted and have no alpha blending.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt my PC these maneuver lines are not dotted and they are\u00A0faded out too much\u00A0so I cant see them nearly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Im at work now I cant post a screenshot of the behavior of such lines at my PC but it is weird because I cant find any picture in the internet which shows that.
