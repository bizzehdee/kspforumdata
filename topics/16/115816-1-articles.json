I am not advanced enough in the tech tree to have solar panels, but have two batteries. The batteries, plus the onboard charge of the crew capsules have been enough for previous missions if I am careful an gentle in maneuvering. Without maneuvering, the current drain is normally 0, and the charge state does not change.\n\nHowever, after completing a midcourse correction, the electrical usage eventually settled at .01, instead of 0, and now the charge continually decreases. All engines are off. Turning the SAS off does not help. Toggling the torque Off does not help. I tried minor maneuvers, but the current still settles to .01 instead of 0. \n\nWhen I recalled an earlier save of the same mission, the passive current was 0, as expected, but became .01 again after ejecting from Mun orbit.\n\nWhat has changed to cause the continual slight discharge? On a long mission, it has a troublesome impact, and prevents things like transmitting science. One mission was lost from this problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T22:04:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 10:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DennyC**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T20:15:24Z","Content":"Do you have a probe on there?"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T20:24:30Z","Content":"Are the thermometers active?

The cockpit and capsule reaction wheels will drain the batteries.

How about capsul lights? Those things drain way more than you would think...

The fact that you can activate/deactivate batteries, the same way you can do for fuel tanks, is really handy.\n\nA convenient VAB design technique: put one extra battery on your craft somewhere, and disable it (or you could disable the electricity supply on the command pod itself). That\u0027s your \u0022reserve\u0022; it\u0027s safe and can\u0027t be drained by anything until you activate it. If you ever run out of power, just wait until you need it (for maneuvering, landing, etc.) and then enable the battery."},{"CreatedByName":"bonyetty","CreatedById":57769,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T09:09:15Z","Content":"Yep sleep mode works a treat.
