This means you have to encounter it on the right side of Jool. If you do the Tylo intercept burn after you\u0027ve encountered Jool this can cost several 100 m/s in deltaV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFocusing on Jool will allow you to check this. You can see if you will get an encounter with any of the moons, and you can see the encounter and escape nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis allows you to make minute course corrections way before you encounter Jool so that you will intercept the moon correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
