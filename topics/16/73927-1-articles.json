That would make all pFairings parts have no textures (no memory used there) and unable to use them. However, for a vessel in flight, you don\u0027t need to change the size or whatever, you just need the part (see: in Manley\u0027s Interstellar Quest, he removed the RT2 plugin but kept the parts and the craft loaded fine). I don\u0027t use pFairings, but I imagine the part you\u0027re currently using has a decouple module on the top - make sure that\u0027s in the cfg, remove all modules related to pFairings so you\u0027re left with basically a structural element in the shape of the fairing base. Once that\u0027s gone, you can safely delete the entire pFairings folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least, I think that should work. Make a backup of your persistent.sfs and the pFairings folder first, to be safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way is to delete everything from pFairings except the part you\u0027re using and the plugin as well, though that would use more memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it stands, if you remove pFairings entirely while that ship in orbit, it will be permanently removed from your savegame.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blind Dead McJones","CreatedById":109600,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T18:30:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThese probes all have that part in the transfer stage, which I can eject with a decoupler.
