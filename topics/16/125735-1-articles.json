This way you don;t apply an unnecessary, and potentially catastrophic, roll when you try to turn. Stock really does have all the parts you need for building a base, but if you\u0026#39;re looking for something that\u0026#39;s more than a singe module I point you to the following:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the actual building of the base: [url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50685-Modular-Base-Creation-Kit[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor precision landing: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38IYZUizX3E[/url]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T23:50:37Z","Content":"\nRovers are controlled using the wasd keys, and b to brake.(be gentle) Unless the base is massive, a 1 piece base is the way to go.

There are elements about it that are tricky to learn, but once you\u0026#39;ve got it, it helps tremendously. (Note: I would still not call myself a master of KAS/KIS. There are still things I\u0026#39;m working out about them.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I did was to design multiple modules that I landed independently, then hooked them together with pipes. The biggest challenge was landing them all close enough together without landing on top of each other.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically, this was my process:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Survey mission to choose base site. In my case, I was looking for an equatorial location with a good Ore concentration and a large flat area. Once I found my spot, I marked it with a flag to serve as a landing target.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Module construction. In essence, I have one \u0022command\u0022 module with a cupola and a hitchhiker can, a \u0022science\u0022 module with a lab and antenna, an \u0022extraction\u0022 module with drills, an ore tank, and another hitchhiker can, and a \u0022service\u0022 module with batteries, cargo space, and whatnot. (I also have a refinery module and two tanker modules for the ore processing.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Land them all within easy reach of each other. In my case, I found that landing with MechJeb\u0026#39;s landing guidance usually worked; I\u0026#39;d aim for my flag and then offset by a little bit to try to avoid coming down on top of existing modules. There\u0026#39;s a bit of variation in the actual landing, though, so be sure to save before each landing attempt, lest you end up with a set of explosions that will put you in mind of the \u0022Space: 1999\u0022 opening. A good skill to master (I can\u0026#39;t pretend to have mastered it yet, but I\u0026#39;m trying) is to be able to lift off again, move laterally, and set down again, in order to fine-tune the arrangement.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Hook them all together with KAS pipes. Voila... functioning Munar base!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI do have a few mods with other parts (Stockalike Station Parts, Surface Lights, etc.) but this should be doable with just vanilla, MechJeb, KAS, and KIS.\n"}]}
