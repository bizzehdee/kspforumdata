Everytime i launch 0.23 MK16 is black. I thought that they changed it in 0.23 because in 0.22 it was white. I have tho copies of 0.23 on my PC (one is for KMP and one is vanilla). In both of them MK16 is black. I\u0027ve also copied it\u0027s model from 0.22 and it\u0027s still black.

Do you happen to know if there is a way to sort parts in editors? I feel that tabs in current versions are quite unsorted not to say it\u0027s a mess there. I think that if parts were organized so that eg decopuplers and separators are next to each other from smallest to biggest, same with adapters and fuel tanks, it would be easier to find some of them. Right now when I\u0027m looking for example for 3m decoupler, or radioisotopic generator i need to remember where they are exactly. Is there a plugin allowing sorting or filtering parts?
