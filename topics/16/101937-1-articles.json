To maintain symmetry while attaching varying numbers of SRMs would require additional or moveable attachment points.\n\n *(edited to add the following)*\n\nTo illustrate this point, if 0^o^ is always the attachment point of the first SRM, then the following points would be needed to provide symmetry for 1 to 5 SRMs:\n\n1 SRM - 0^o^\n\n2 SRM - 0^o^, 180^o^\n\n3 SRM - 0^o^, 120^o^, 240^o^\n\n4 SRM - 0^o^, 90^o^, 180^o^, 270^o^\n\n5 SRM - 0^o^, 72^o^, 144^o^, 216^o^, 288^o^\n\nThat\u0027s a total of ten attachment points. Plus you would need a service gantry that provides access to all those points. Instead they provide five permanent attachment points and always attach the SRMs in some arrangement to those five points. The arrangement of the points, 2 on one side and 3 on the other, also makes for easier gantry access.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T17:48:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob**"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T16:30:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It my understanding that they gimbal the RD-180 main engine to compensate for the asymmetry.\n\nExactly, like the most of real engine, the RD-180 has a thrust vectoring of various degree, in this case 8\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. \n\nNow you will have a question \u0022Why on KSP this kind of thing doesn\u0027t works?\u0022\n\nSimply because the actual gimballing ( [As i\u0027ve said in this suggestion thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112613-Increased-engine-gimballing) ) is silly, image that for the S3 KS-25x4 is ONLY 0.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. which is crazy. \n\nAlso IRL in the case of Atlas-V helps the gimbal of the SRB.
