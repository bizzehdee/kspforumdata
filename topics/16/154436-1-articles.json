OK two points: What is your current KSP version? Was this contract begun in ver 1.2.2? Do you have a savegame from before you grabbed the vessel to recover it? This is clearly a bug, and I\u0027d like to report it if I can duplicate it from a savegame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint 2: You did the work, so you deserve the credit. So go into the Debug menu, under contracts, and mark this one complete. That\u0027ll get you full credit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
