If you check what the stuff costs and how much thrust you get out of it, even a Poodle at sea level will be more cost-efficient. What makes them worthwhile (sometimes at least) is the cheap case -- discarding a spent booster is much cheaper than the equivalent amount of Poodle and liquid fuel tanks.

Liquid engines not too expensive, and liquid fuel is pretty cheap, but liquid fuel tanks are extremely expensive in KSP.
