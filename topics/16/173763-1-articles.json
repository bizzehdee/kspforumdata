If i switch to the target (station) and plot a maneuver from that (dropping my orbit to rendezvous with the ship), the closest point marker stays on what will be the periapsis of the new orbit.\u00A0 It makes it so i can rendezvous, because i can set the new periapsis to the orbital radius of the ship... but its still not working right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn both cases the closest point markers are sticking to the periapsis of any new orbit (which is the maneuver marker in the first case, since i\u0027m increasing apoapsis).\u00A0 I tested this by making a highly non-circular orbit and plotting a maneuver from a non-periapsis point.\u00A0 the closest point marker was stuck to the periapsis (like in the secodn case).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has been occuring to me on 3 different flights, with 2 different designs and 2 different pilots.\u00A0 I can not get it to work \u0022right\u0022.\u00A0 One of the designs worked 2 days ago, but then after loading a save, no longer works.\u00A0 I changed no mods during that exit and reload.\u00A0 The only mods i use are Mech jeb, alarm clock, Docking alignment, and the mod manager which came with the docking alignment mod.\u00A0 Did i mistakingly change a setting?\u00A0 \u0026lt;edit\u0026gt;\u00A0 I did a brand new sandbox game... same exact problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy campaign mode is effectively ruined if i can\u0027t fix this.\u00A0 Thank you in advance, I hope this is something that will just make me feel very stupid, which KSP has a way of doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-11T06:19:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2018 06:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by icarustours\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-11T06:56:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums.

few weeks ago to start playing again, and I checked that steam was set to auto-update, so i believe the most recent edition, but I will check tonight and edit here.\u00A0 The mod manager does yell at me that i\u0027m not 1.4.1, which leads me to believe I\u0027m 1.4.2.\u00A0 the save I am playing on was started after the reinstall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will create a few screenshots tonight and link them here.\u00A0 I was hoping that someone would chime in quickly with whatever I was screwing up, before going through all that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes I have adjusted the maneuver enough to have it cross the orbit of the target twice (an Apoapsis of ~10,000m more than the target\u0027s orbit), then i move the maneuver along my own trajectory in order to find the closest point... but the closest point never moves from periapsis (which is\u00A0the manuever node in this situation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news is that whatever the problem is, it seems to be affecting the whole game, not just my career save.\u00A0 So its either, something I\u0027m doing wrong, some setting I changed and don\u0027t understand, or some type of bug/corrupted file.\u00A0 All fixable.\u00A0 I can\u0027t find any other people with a similar problem (although my internet searches, have not been exhaustive).\u00A0 I suspect that if i just reinstalled without trashing my saves, the problem would correct itself, but i will grab the screenshots and do my best to document the issue.\u00A0 In case I\u0027m doing something wrong, I\u0027d rather learn that than end up repeating it in the future.\u00A0 If it is some type of bug, then obviously getting it fixed would be ideal for everyone.\u00A0 Tonight I\u0027m going to try removing mech-jeb and alarm clock, because i don\u0027t ever\u00A0use them (yet), and it seems like a possible culprit.\u00A0 Docking alignment I use all the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5thhorseman: I understand what you are pointing out, and thought exactly that at first, or was simply convinced that there was some strange circumstance I didn\u0027t understand at play.\u00A0 However, the situations you describe would only be valid at very specific times... the problem is no matter where i move the maneuver node and no matter what speed adjustment I make... the closest point never moves from periapsis.\u00A0 For example, when in a non-circular orbit and plotting a manuever, the fact that the closest point marker is ALWAYS stuck at the periapsis, seems quite suspicious.\u00A0 Similarly, I\u0027ve launched an entirely new game in sandbox, launched two\u00A0totally new ships and still get the same problem.\u00A0 Regarding your last paragraph, in this situation, knowing when the \u003Cem\u003Eships\u003C/em\u003E will be closest is exactly what I want, but am not getting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUPDATE: I got home today from work, loaded the sandbox save started last night (to test the problem on other saves) and everything worked exactly how i expected it to.\u00A0 I then loaded my career save and relaunched a rocket... again everything exactly like i would expect.\u00A0 The problem had previously persisted through multiple program closures and reloads.\u00A0 The sandbox save was literally in the exact spot that I was experiencing the issue\u00A0last night.\u00A0 I had made absolutely no changes at all to the program or mods.\u00A0\u00A0I can\u0027t explain it at all.\u00A0 Last night i did manage to take 1 screen shot, which all alone doesn\u0027t tell much of a story but here it is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/F57rmg7\u0022 rel=\u0022external

approach point never moved from the maneuver node itself (which is periapsis of that particular orbit).\u00A0 I noticed in the picture that my\u00A0speed readout was set to target, which I\u0027m sure was part of my trouble shooting, but obviously looks suspicious.\u00A0 I went back into my sandbox save and tried to replicate the problem with that set to target... still worked fine.\u00A0 I\u0027m glad its fixed, but still can\u0027t explain what was going on.\u00A0 If the problem returns, I\u0027ll come back here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium
