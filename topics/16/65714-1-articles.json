Surface mode shows you your velocity relative to the surface of the body you are orbiting, while orbit mode calculates it relative to the center of the body you are orbiting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause all the planets and moons rotate, you have a non-zero orbital velocity when you are stationary on the surface. On the surface of Kerbin, you are moving about 175 m/s relative to the center. If you switch the mode from surface to orbit while on the launch pad, it\u0027ll show you that velocity. Because that eastward motion shows up in orbit mode but not in surface mode, the markers showing your heading will change slightly when switching between the modes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETarget mode does something similar, it just sets your target as the reference point for calculating velocity. And if you forget to switch from orbit to surface when landing, you\u0027re gonna have a bad time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T00:12:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrue, you can have a few bad seconds when you notice the navball is telling you there\u0027s not much horizontal velocity, but looking at the ground says otherwise ... worse if you\u0027re using the IVA or map view, you don\u0027t see that little detail!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
