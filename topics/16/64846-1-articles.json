While in one piece, right clicking on either gives the usual options of decouple and control from here/fuel crossfeed on the docking port, but when I decouple using either the decoupler or the docking port, craft separates in the sense that struts disappear and the lower stage becomes marked as debris, but it sticks on to the ship!

Assuming your ships are in orbit, you can try the following: turn the ship so the part to be separated points away from ground, and enter time warp. If they are really detached, they will behave as if they are on different orbits. Let the two ships pass through each other and only exit time warp when they are safely separated.
