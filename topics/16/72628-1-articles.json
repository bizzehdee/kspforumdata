I was thinking for a new series I want to do of making use of rovers and unmanned missions first, and maybe use the manned missions to recover some of the science left on the probes and rovers that could not be sent (more by personal restrictions than in game mechanics). I would also be moving the larger parts into their own tech lines, if it is possible of course, to force more use of probes and rovers. I have a bit of time before I am going to do this but I am getting a head start on getting the information I can get prepared ahead of time.

Just be aware that this is fairly tedious and you\u0027ll probably want to back up the .cfgs in case you want to switch back to the default tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-17T18:10:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, either mods or modify the part themselves to change in what node they apear\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
