I put some elevons on the back of the wing so I can control it. So far so good. When I want to put them on, they always try and go on perpendicular or whatever and I have to rotate them in place. And swept wings or worse. They are deterined to embed themselves in the wing part and it looks I have to use the rotate and offset functions to move them carefully in place?\n\nIs it suppose to be this hard?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T01:21:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 01:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by davidpsummers**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T03:21:55Z","Content":"You get used to it.

They decide up or down by themselves.\n\nAre you sure they are supposed to be going the other direction? If you place them in front of the center of mass, they will turn in the opposite direction from those placed behind the center of mass, because that is what they should do.\n\nHere is an example from a much earlier conversation in picture form. The Blue arrows represent airflow, the yellow arrows represent pitch action.\n\n![airflow.jpg](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v445/Alshain/KSP/airflow.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T01:19:35Z","Content":"They definitely go the wrong way.
