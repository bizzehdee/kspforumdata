Yes I can get them aligned and in same orbit, I have even attempted to use the KAS Mod Kerbal Attachment Systems with Crane and everything which doesn\u0027t appear to assist. I was thinking possibly I would need to Dock the modules and then use Cranes maybe ?. Just wondering how other players are doing this or is this only through mods. However if anyone could assist me in finding a AUTO Docking mod this would be beyond belief and can start kolonizing far planets. I use Mechjeb etc but not great at landing I dont think it does anything but put a marker and the most useful thing the height from ground not visible especially when landing on dark side of moon.... I also can land on Mun and return to earth with some of my ships but I would still say 8 out of 10 of my attempts end in less than happy circumstances, still only able to land small crafts, Soo if anyone has great mod or way to land larger ships be great. Which would lead me to next Question.. 2) Landings As mentioned above I can do Moon landing and haven\u0027t attempted much further out as yet, so I would assume the outer body also would have atmospheres but is there anything different than land on home planet or do they all not have atmospheres ?. I have some ships on way with fuel recharger on board like propellants so never run out of fuel but takes time to orbit recharge. Hate to get this far and fail. So with the mining mods and remote drone to mine etc, I would like to effectively hit the same spot so some type of landing assistance mods would be beyond helpful.

These moments are lessened in significance when you have to give in and install a helper mod to finally get it. You can do it, everything you need to dock and land on foreign bodies is available in the stock game, you just need to get your head around what needs to be done and what you\u0027ve done wrong so far. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few pointers to help you succeed at docking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Practice first. Before trying to launch a full mission that requires docking, launch 2 identical craft with plenty of RCS and well balanced RCS thrusters (use 2 sets of 4 blocks equi-distance from the center of mass on the craft) and just practice docking and undocking and redocking for a while. Don\u0027t forget to use caps lock to turn on fine controls as needed! Also I recommend ignoring docking mode and just learn to switch between the WASD keys for rotational control of your vessel (pointing it in the right direction) and the IJKL and HN keys for translational control (basically strafing your ship while maintaining they same pointing direction)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Go slowly, VERY slowly while you are learning. It sounds from your post that you are able to rendezvous just fine so here is what you need to be able to do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a. use target mode on your Navball to cancel out velocity COMPLETELY when you are near the target, before switching to RCS controls. This is done by thrusting towards the yellow retrograde marker while in target mode until speed is 0.0m\\s. This will give you a baseline to work from and ensure you can take your time and go slow. Remember that if you get going too fast in one direction you can always reverse your key presses to cancel out what you\u0027ve done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E b. Control the vessels from the chosen docking ports and target each one. You can switch between vessels quickly with the [ \u0026amp; ] keys and then control from the docking ports and target the other port with right clicks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E c. Orient vessels. This means point the two ports at one another, but also orient each craft so that your RCS controls make visual sense. This means rotate the craft until, as your camera is looking forward towards your target, pushing A turns left and pushing D turns right, and pushing J slides you left and pushing L slides you right. This will help immensely if you make a mistake and want to correct it, as you will be able to use your eyes first rather than having to think about what button will move it what way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E d. Use the Navball. It is good to be able to use visual cues to dock when possible but when you are moving very slowly at like 0.2m/s it can be hard to tell exactly what direction a craft is actually moving in relation to its target. On the Navball, your velocity vector (yellow circle) shows your relational movement to the target. If it is to the right of the target marker, you are going to pass to the right of the port. if it is above it, you will pass above the port. Use the IJKL keys to adjust it so that both your pointing and vector are on your target. It may start drifting over time, just keep correcting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E e. Move forward slowly with everything lined up, and DOCK! Hopefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I wrote way too much about docking I\u0027ll be brief about moons. If you have trouble getting back you either need to add more fuel or take of weight or use a more efficient engine or all of the above possibly. The Atmospheric Trajectories mod will help with landing near a target, since that is something that the game actually doesn\u0027t help you enough with. It\u0027s very difficult to predict an exact landing spot with atmosphere, but that mod will help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Higgs","CreatedById":121852,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T22:07:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@the yellow dart, while what you wrote is excellent, there is absolutely no substitute for using mechjeb. In our OP\u0027s case as a teaching tool. Your essay on docking while good cannot show our OP how his ship will behave, and this is what mechjeb can do. It will fly for him as long as he uses the right sequencers as he goes stating what it is that it is doing, and as its doing it he can watch in real time as it happens. No tutorial can do this. I hear you saying but Higgs videos do this. I counter with, no they in fact do not. They show what SOMEONE ELSE\u0027S ship does, not the OPs. This is why I suggest mechjeb.

Rendezvous is getting close to the target going the same speed in the same direction, which means you are in almost the same orbit. This is useful by itself as you can then fly kerbals across by EVA. Rendezvous is generally carried out using your main engines, with RCS optional for fine tuning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking is, once you\u0027re rendezvoused, actually joining the two ships. To practice docking without needing to worry about rendezvous, launch a ship that\u0027s actually a couple of ships docked together. Undock them in orbit, fly one gently around a bit the other, then redock them. Docking is generally carried out with RCS, so make sure your ships have a well-balanced arrangement of thrusters and enough monopropellant. (With practice you\u0027ll be able to do it on the command pod amount alone, but for starting I suggest one or two sensible-sized monopropellant tanks.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for landing, well all vacuum bodies are basically the same, but the larger the body the quicker everything will go and the more capable the lander needs to be in both thrust-to-weight ratio and delta-V. A mod such as Engineer that displays the surface altitude is incredibly helpful; in the stock game you can only see this info in the IVA view. Try not to land on the dark side! If you must, pack powerful lights pointing down and extra fuel to fly with if your first landing zone is bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe atmo bodies are more varied. Eve is pretty easy to land on, you just need parachutes, but do be sure your landing gear is solid because of its high gravity. Eve is \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E hard to get back into orbit again from though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna is more challenging to land on, the air is very thin and parachutes alone usually aren\u0027t enough, be prepared to use your engines to cushion your landing. Also try and aim for somewhere low. Taking off again isn\u0027t too hard, requiring a bit more delta-V than a Mun landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on Laythe is almost exactly like landing on Kerbin, the air is slightly thinner so you might add a couple of extra parachutes. But it\u0027s mostly ocean, so I suggest planning for a water landing. It\u0027s relatively hard to get back into orbit, though easier than a Kerbin launch. Alternatively, jet engines work on Laythe so you can take a spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDescending through Jool\u0027s atmosphere is fairly simple. There is no solid surface to land on, your craft will be destroyed when it descends below the 0 m mark. Returning to orbit from its depths is just about the hardest thing you can attempt in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T00:22:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Yellow Dart\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Yellow Dart\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESorry to go against the last 2 posts, but I find that one of the best moments you\u0027ll ever have in KSP are moments when you accomplish something you couldn\u0027t do before.

However just to clarify a few thing its not that I am unable to Dock and after 3 long days I have this down pat, however I mostly play in the sandbox mode and this has limitation and no quests available but with learning it invaluable for all the training and testing you need to do. I mostly like the game play for Building Rockets Lander, Rovers etc and planetary exploration and now getting into all the MODS. I do use about 25 different ones now working fairly stable only issue is in building hanger sometimes crash when you go way to big. I do like the new mods like Kolonization Mod and the new Massive B9 Part for building which are too big to get off the ground in one piece. So with playing with some new part and looking into sending out Ships with Lander etc to all the planet take a look at the Mining Mod after the colonies established on all the worlds, however due to the new power requirements I need about 40 flights to build it all together. This is where my problem starts, 1) When I am docking I like to transfer between the two ships to aligning easier for docking procedure, however when you are about to dock the Space map makes it almost impossible to select the correct ship as you are almost met in space. A second delay and your blown up, so this is why I was looking into a Docking Mod, its not that I carnt do it its so time consuming and when I want to launch over 400 parts in total this will drive me nuts. 2) No matter how aligned you will be there no less than 20-30 min pressing H and N waiting for Lock. What the its perfectly aligned too.... 3) Also when traveling now I have my space station combined I can not tell if this will break apart as for the Docking ports appears to flex and bend in space when setting new orbits and only taking it slow. These are not the Massive Docks which appear to lock without issue so far about 4 Electric Engines now combined to drive the new 50,000 thrust wanting to see this Warp Thing and what it does really. So do the smaller Docking port fall apart ?, I am trying this Crane Mod thing but beats me how to make it work in space doesn\u0027t appear to lock to anything. I will send a docking port into Orbit later once main vessel is assembled to see if that make any difference but shouldn\u0027t as different mods. From forum i can see people talk about building in space with containers to send parts up which I have in orbit just carnt use them in space is all. Trying to stick on Struts after my space station docked to more secure so i can send it out further in space. Either way I have the docking down even massive parts with no issue just the time it takes is exhaustive and selecting between ships is annoying. I guess my first problems was due to the massive Size of the parts I was docking. I will update this post later when I test these auto Take Off Resource Drones from Davin Mod, I will use TAC to test so will need to fly out massive food water and waste and Life Support Tanks to test this may take some time as have 5 massive part in orbit awaiting docking. To summarize I MechJeb and use the \u0022Hoffman Intercept Maneuver\u0022 when I am close I turn it of and manually drive it in with H and N keys and A,S,D,W. I am just finding it limiting in exploration and it may take a few months real life to assemble and with no save feature on mission whole thing could be waste of time.

When you know what step comes next, you can begin to increase confidence.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
