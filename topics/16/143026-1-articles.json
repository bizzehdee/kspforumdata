I spent all my research on the first aerodynamics package (MK1 parts), and all my money on a better runway. However, I never once got close to making a plane that can take off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve looked over many posts on this forum and others, adjusted the landing gear, aligned center of lift with center of mass, installed control surfaces for YPR, and it\u0027s still either incredibly unstable and explodes at 30 m/s, or never takes off and explodes at the end of the runway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat can I do at this point?

It doesn\u0027t look like you have much room to rotate on takeoff. I don\u0027t know if this is a thing but your center of lift bubble is very small? I don\u0027t know what that means; whenever I make planes the center of lift bubble doesn\u0027t change size. Also for the nosewheel, disable the steering when going fast. The slightest nosewheel movement at high speeds is not good for the safety of the crew if you get what I\u0027m saying. The A-10 Warthog has a special button on the joystick itself to disable the nosewheel\u0027s steering during takeoff.
