I wake up this morning to notifications that it crashed into the surface! I had all engines shutdown, so there\u0027s no chance it was caused by errant throttle, and Mun has no atmosphere (even if it did, I would have parked well above it); so what caused my craft to lose orbit? I\u0027ve left crafts in Kerbin orbit overnight, and not lost them, so is this just a bug with the Mun, or a general bug that needs fixing?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb\u0027s dead, baby.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: if it makes a difference, the craft in question was a 2.5m fuel depot (fuel tank, solar panels, batteries, monopropellant\u2014all the necessities to resupply in orbit) with a smaller SSTO docked to one side, so the controlling module was not directly in line with the cG, though it was parallel on all axis; see attachment for pic (sorry it\u0027s dark, Kerbin was eclipsing the sun, and we were about to head behind the Mun)\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://scontent-dfw1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-12/fr/cp0/e15/q65/13161580_10153584527250777_702918926_o.png.jpg?efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9\u0026amp;oh=d9fe81e0796aa0528b682bef118ec878\u0026amp;oe=57300506\u0022 alt=\u002213161580_10153584527250777_702918926_o.p\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods running (though I don\u0027t see how they\u0027d cause this) include:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechjeb, KW redux, B9, FAR, KSPI, RPM, KJR, Chatterer, Hangar Extender, and RCS Aid.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-07T14:58:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2016 02:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kiwinanday\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T14:57:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a general bug where orbits in flight aren\u0027t entirely stable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/9619\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/9619\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, 300 km over the Mun shouldn\u0027t have degraded quite that quickly, and have no illumination if MJ may have done something while you were away....\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeave your craft on rails via warp out at KSC scene, and it should behave better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwinanday","CreatedById":163757,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T16:08:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57317-purpletarget/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002257317\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57317-purpletarget/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@purpletarget\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EThanks, I\u0027ll go back to KSC until the bug is patched; I used to leave 0.25 running overnight, as Chatterer helps me sleep.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EI don\u0027t suspect mechjeb directly, as I don\u0027t know why having it hold prograde vs having SAS hold prograde would make a difference, but I can\u0027t know, as I wasn\u0027t awake at the time.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T17:29:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, I was doing an orbit last night, and my 16km Ap was changing by 100m/s.
