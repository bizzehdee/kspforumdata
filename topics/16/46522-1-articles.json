They always seem to have a fraction of a degree of deflection 1 way or the other. And they sit this way not moving for several seconds, then SAS gives them a tiny flick to maintain the set attitude, repeat. The net result is that, over long flights, the plane retains the desired pitch angle but gradually drifts off in yaw and/or roll, almost always to the right, even at normal time speed. This seems an unavoidable part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have made planes that compensate for this, however. My usual solution is to put 1 asymmetrical radial air scoop on the left side of the fuselage. The drag from this pulls the nose left, the unavoidable slight control deflections pull the plane right, and the result is that the plane maintains the desired heading although flying at a slight angle in yaw. This is fine with me because on long flights, I\u0027m interested in the heading, not so much the attitude of the plane. I\u0027d rather have the plane crab a bit as it flies along, staying on course forever so I can use time warp, than drifting off course and me having to correct it every few minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s another tip that might not be applicable to your situation but which is pretty useful anyway.
