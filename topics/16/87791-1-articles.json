When building spaceplanes to fly in FAR/NEAR, how much dV and launch TWR do you shoot for for your LFO stage? Of course the ultimate answer for dV is \u0027as much as costs allow\u0027, but I mean generally how much do you expect to use to get to LKO, assuming you\u0027ve already flown up on jets as high as you like to?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figure it\u0027s partially a matter of taste, but I\u0027m curious to see what different baselines people use, and in what range those rules of thumb fall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start off, I generally like a TWR of ~0.8 or higher, or else I find the plane fighting to fall back down. (This obviously depends on lift, as well.) As for dV, I\u0027m not yet clear, but so far it seems packing ~2500m/s works pretty decently, though sometimes I\u0027m useless once I get up there - only enough fuel to come back down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T22:25:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been experimenting with lifter spaceplanes quite a bit lately. I\u0027ve found that you can get away with a fairly low TWR for jet engines as long as you\u0027re patient. Unless you\u0027re in a stall, if you have trouble pulling your nose up, that\u0027s more to do with the CoM to CoL relation, and having enough control surfaces. In FAR, you should also try to shift your CoM back as your get above Mach 1 since it models mach tuck. For the rocket stage, I think having a TWR about 1.2-1.5 is nice, but you can probably get away with lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy general rule in FAR is to switch to rocket engines no sooner than 1500 m/s at 25km. I find that it takes about 1500 m/s at that point to get into orbit. If you need significantly more than that, you probably aren\u0027t getting fast enough before you switch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T22:56:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.24 \u002B FAR, I could get a small spaceplane into orbit with a TWR around 0.8 for both air-breathing and LFO stages.
