Is monoprop consumed equally from all the tanks (like if 1 unit spent from one tank, 1 unit spent from another even though they are different), or it is consumed proportionally (like 1 unit from 50 liter tank for each 2 units from 100 liter tank)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Do fuel lines have any effect on monoprop? I know that both RCS thrusters and monoprop engines consume it from all the tanks of the craft, so this is a serious question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If I loop two tanks with fuel lines, 1 --\u0026gt; 2 and 1 \u0026lt;-- 2, what will be the result in fuel consumption? This question consider both LFO and monoprop tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe core of design is to make a tug with lateral docking port and with central and lateral (opposite to lateral docking port) tanks, with resource dumped from central to lateral tank to balance craft. The end question is, can this resource be a useful one (preferably monoprop) to save resulting weight, so I need to know fuel line behavior - and as a result, know how will it affect balancing of craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-29T13:05:49Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2015 01:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nothingSpecial\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T12:56:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMonoprop is always consumed equally, fuel ducts don\u0027t work on them.
