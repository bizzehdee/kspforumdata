It was incredibly inefficient and I was faced with a kraken attack at the end of it. Now, since then, I have not gone back to Dres, as I consider it at least somewhat cursed. However, what with .25 coming soon, I realized what I must do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to try to send a kerbal to Dres and bring him safely back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can imagine, I\u0027m gonna need some help here.

It\u0027s small, in an inclined orbit, and airless. Its smallness means maneuver nodes have to be just so in order to intercept, and you\u0027ll still have to do some adjustments when you get close to SOI to get the trajectory and periapsis you want. The inclined orbit will suck dv both ways on the trip. The lack of air means no aerobrake, so there goes more dv. The good news is the same craft you can get to and from Layethe should get you to Dres and back. So if you have already done a Layethe return, just use that craft. Conversely, if you haven\u0027t done a Layethe return, the Dres return craft will do that job, tho you may need to upgrade the lander for Layethe. Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
