Then I found the forums. This is my problem: I wanted to make a Spaceplane with the new, large MK3 parts, but No MK3 parts show up whatsoever. None at all. I re-installed and the problem was there. How do I fix this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI updated from KSP .25 to 0.90.0 and my installer for KSP is for .25, so that may be part of the problem.

If in carreer, are you sure you researched the approriate tech? If you did, try going back to the R\u0026amp;D building and clicking on the relevant node. Sometimes parts dissapear and clicking them in the techtree can bring them back. It\u0027s more common with modded parts but I\u0027ve had it happen with stock parts as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf none of that fixes it... Try a verify game cache if on steam, or do a complete un-instal re-instal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and on a side note... I\u0027ve got interstellar as well and you\u0027d be better off installing the 0.90 version that has been maintained by the community. It\u0027s not bug free but it has fixed a bunch of 0.90 related bugs.
