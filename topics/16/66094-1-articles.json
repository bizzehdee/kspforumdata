However, it utilizes the MK1 Lander Can as it\u0027s primary command module and I was wondering if it is feasible to use the can as a return pod granted I strap enough parachutes to it? I\u0027m sure it would be fine in the game but it doesn\u0027t look very aerodynamic in RL. Is it used for reentry?
