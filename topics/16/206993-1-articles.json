Have the two DLCs. but otherwise unmoded. I\u0027ve been looking at some videos on youtube and noticed something called autostrut that seems to help with craft stability. I started looking into it, searched the forum even and saw that you have to turn on a setting to use them. I turned on the advanced tweakables option and I can see the other option, rigid attachment, but the autostrut doesn\u0027t show up. Any idea why I can\u0027t see it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kynnath","CreatedById":162734,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-20T23:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, nevermind, now it\u0027s showing up.
