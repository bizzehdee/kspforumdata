I launched both the orbiter and the lander into orbit around Kerbin and docked them nose to nose, so that the lander is connected to the top of the orbiter bu facing in the opposite direction. The first problem I\u0027m having is a minor one and that is the way the two ships engines are combined in the stages when I dock the ships together. It seems to automatically combine the both final stages together, both 2nd stages together and so on. I\u0027ve got an OK work around for this but I was wondering if there was a way to prevent it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next problem is really the one I need help with. As I said I\u0027ve got the two ships docked nose to nose, and I fire up the rockets on the orbiter ship and the coupler fails and the orbiter drives itself into the lander, followed by and explosion and 5 dead Kerbanauts. What am I missing why wont my ships stay together and fly as one?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho0124","CreatedById":61118,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T06:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes you\u0027re going to be forced to rearrange your stages when you dock two ships.

What was happening was that even though I moved the engines from the lander ship out of the current stage they still fired when I fired up the engines of the orbiter. I\u0027m not sure why this would happen even after I move them to a different stage (and I still don\u0027t see why I can\u0027t put them in the order I\u0027d like), but I guess they massive explosion and needless loss of Kerbal life was due to the two ship trying to accelerate into one another. De-activating the lander\u0027s engines solved this. Tomorrow I\u0027m going to take her out to Jool and see what happens. I\u0027ve got a Kerbanaut stranded on Lyathe I want to rescue, and on the way back I\u0027m hoping to pick up another Kerbal waiting patiently on Dres. Fuel (and orbits) permitting I might also try to pick up another stranded traveler who\u0027s orbiting the sun after running out of fuel on the way back from Duna. That would take care of all my stranded Kerbanauts and clear my conscience for the start of new adventures in v.20. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the pic to my 2 stage craft, I welcome opinions feedback and criticism:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/ouscooby/screenshot23_zpsa9895668.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot23_zpsa9895668.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PaleoGamer","CreatedById":66992,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T11:21:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf that doesn\u0027t completely solve your problem you might look at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/quantum-strut/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EQuantum Struts\u003C/a\u003E.
