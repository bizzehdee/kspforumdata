For that, you need to right-click on the storage bay you put them in and take out the science modules and then manually place them on the ground. If you cant reach ground from your current location, just put it in your kerbals inventory and take it down with you\u00A0And if your talking about something else, please go into detail on what you\u0027re trying to place down.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am pretty sure the backpack if I remember right, is the kerbals parachute. If you need more inventory slots, you can always put that inside the storage container you brought and place down your equipment, and then put it back on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-12T19:31:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2021 07:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Vanadiumn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-12T19:32:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDeploying science\u003C/strong\u003E: you keep each experiment, controller and power sources in an inventory (either ship or container).

When I choose it from my personal inventory, it turns all storage areas on the ship blue, as if I want to put it away in storage.\u00A0 If I right click on the exp mod in my personal inventory, nothing. If I left click it selects it as if I am going to store it somewhere. That\u0027s the problem. I cannot get it to put the exp mod in my hand so that I can lay it next to the PV. It wants to put it in a storage bin or back into my inventory only.
