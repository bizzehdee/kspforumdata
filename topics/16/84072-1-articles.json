I want to attach big long solid boosters () to the side, staged with radial decouplers (trying TT-70 decoupler). I have only been able to attach a booster to a decoupler at the booster\u0027s midpoint. The long boosters then flop around in flight. I want to have decouplers at the top and bottom of the booster, but I can\u0027t get the UI to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy experience of the UI is, while moving the booster, if I point the mouse right at the decoupler, it attaches the booster midpoint, no matter where I \u0022grabbed\u0022 the booster. If I do not point at the decoupler, the booster gets attached to the hull, instead. If I have two, vertically aligned decouplers, the booster only gets attached to the one I point at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that makes some sense, but I just can\u0027t figure out how to do a 2-point, decoupling attachment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. I am able to ride this garbage into orbit, with the thrust vector moving all over as the boosters flop about. (Sometimes.)
