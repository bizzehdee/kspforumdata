Just looking at the cfg files tells you that his is the easiest to interact with from a part creator\u0027s perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, PowerTech has two big things: Animations, and more realistic/accurate calculations of solar panel power generation. (I usually hate the \u0022R\u0022 word coming into a game too much, but variable power generation of solar panels is a decent gameplay mechanic.) And on the upside, it plays well already with Kreuz\u0027s plugin, as they both are using the same resource ID, \u0022Energy\u0022 (and probably other reasons I don\u0027t know about I\u0027m sure).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t even touched ZOX yet so can\u0027t speak to that, but for those wondering, I gladly suggest mixing EEP and PowerTech parts. They work, or at least, I haven\u0027t found a time where they don\u0027t work together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPurely from the perspective of someone creating a new part, EEP has a much easier format to use for engines. That and a single part is able to fulfill multiple roles easily: A power generator can also be a battery, a battery can be strapped to an engine, and so on. That\u0027s a \u003Cstrong\u003Ebig\u003C/strong\u003E plus in my books, because the end result is fewer parts required for the same function on a spacecraft. Whatever modders can do to reduce the hit on the player\u0027s part budget is a good thing, since the physics is the most computationally taxing part of KSP. For some, asking them to add 12 new parts to a spacecraft just to get your pieces to all work together, might not be in the cards if they want to get off the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Kosmos panels: With a simple bit of copypasta from MMI.S\u0027 panel config, to a Kosmos panel, it\u0027s fairly easy to get it to generate power for EEP\u0027s batteries (using the SolarPanels_PowerTech_MucMech).

Any part that is already using PowerTech for animations is trivially easy to update to use any/all of the features of the SolarPanels_adv_PowerTech module (or SolarPanels_PowerTech_MuMech module if they need to be compatible with MuMechVariableTanks...for some reason; there really isn\u0027t a good one I can think of though). After reading a bit of the documentation, and using the MMI solar panel\u0027s panelCenter value as a guide to where to place new values for the different Kosmos models, I was able to update all the Kosmos panels to generate power within maybe half-an-hour of editing and testing. The longest part of the process was reloading the game to test. Since they produce the Energy resource, that can be fed into any of EEP\u0027s battery parts.
