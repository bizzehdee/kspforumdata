Each part is processed in what is essentially the order in which it was placed. The game runs through this list and runs each piece of code associated with the part. So for intakes, they generate air. For engines, they consume resources and generate thrust. At some point, the engines are asking for more air than what\u0027s available. One engine will ask for air and the entire ship will be depleted. No more air is available until the next time an intake is processed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you place all your intakes first, then the engines, you are guaranteed to starve the last engine of air because no more air is generated before the engines down the line are processed. However, if you place some intakes, then an engine, then more intakes, then an engine, the air generation/consumption process is interwoven. So the first set of intakes generate some air, then the first engine consumes it all. The second set of intakes generate air, then the second engine consumes it, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction groups do not reorder parts. You can assign action groups during build, or after you\u0027re done. It doesn\u0027t alter part order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say it\u0027s possible that on your run where the engines were on a higher action group, the game just happen to be in a position where the intake air resources were different than on your other runs. In that case, it might have just been coincidental that you got asymmetric flameout. All that being said, I also wouldn\u0027t completely discount that this is possible (as weird things do happen in this game).
