Z1-k batteries can provide 1000 EC\u00A0each, which gives an ion engine almost 2 minutes of burn time. Adding 5 or so batteries would provide an ion engine for almost 10 minutes, which should be plenty of time to do an insertion burn (but It depends on how heavy your probe is). On top of that, the batteries are very lightweight; the previously mentioned Z1-k batteries have a mass of 0.05 tons, which is far less massive than a single gigantor solar panel.
