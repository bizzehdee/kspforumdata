I bought the game on steam and now it\u0027s trying to automatically update the game to the new version. I don\u0027t want to do that yet because I want to keep playing the career that I started already. But I can\u0027t figure out how to stop steam from updating the game and just let me play it! I can pause the download but if I try to play it just starts the download again.

That will make steam revert to that version.
