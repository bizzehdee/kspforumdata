I use some RCS to get the timing as close as possible to perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the orbit changes, without any delta V change on the craft! The periapsis and apoapsis will slowly increase or decrease, usually by a few meters to a dozen meters per second. The effect is even more clear when one is watching the orbital period, as it will go up or down from the desired value without any changes at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s going on here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T10:10:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave seen that occasionally. My take - I often make semi-major axis near a whole number. Say my Duna network wants a 1.5Mm, then I\u0027ll first make it close to 1.5Mm, now it flucuates at 1.5Mm \u002B- 10m, and it may or may not gradually increase/decrease as you say. Doesn\u0027t matter. I just keep pressing escape to pause the game (while letting KER show my semi-major axis). When I saw a whole 1.5Mm, I go to space station and never touch that satellite again. This can give me 1.5Mm\u002B-0.5m semi-major axis on rail, and I don\u0027t need to worry about out-of-sync ever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T11:06:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason for this is physics inaccuracies. As your orbit vets closer and closer to circular floating point errors add up and cause your AP and PE to jump around, often times by up to as much as several hundred meters. This is normal and you don\u0027t need to worry about your satellite getting out of synch. AP and PE values for a synchronous orbit matter much less than orbital period. As long as your orbital period is 6hrs your satellite shouldnt drift out of position.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hendrack","CreatedById":142754,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T13:40:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI stopped bothering with keosynchronous orbits and made a network with many kolniya orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F4hZiz6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F4hZiz6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T14:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also use a mix of dedicated Molniya orbits and supplementing contract satellites with remotetech relay capabilities for my Kerbin system relays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, achieving circular orbits is a pretty big pain. For synchronous stuff you\u0027re better off going with a slight eccentricity.

For the first few games I played with it, I was conscientious about making carefully-tuned constellations of keosynchronous satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat can still be fun, if you take that as a challenge in itself. However, it\u0027s not really necessary, and eventually I just stopped bothering.

Just put up a bunch of little relay satellites and it takes minimal time, fuss, and bother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA minimal satellite with a 2500km omni antenna (or, slightly later in the tech tree, a 5000km omni) and a couple of solar panels is dirt cheap to launch and quick to put up. Stick a half-dozen or so in equatorial orbits at an altitude of 1000km or thereabouts, plus a couple in polar orbits (perpendicular planes) up higher around 2000km, and you\u0027ll pretty much always have connectivity to KSC from anywhere in near-Kerbin space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re ready to explore Mun and Minmus, just add a satellite or two with a DTS-M1 in a high polar orbit, and you\u0027re good to go. When you venture out into the solar system, add a relay satellite with the bigger dish antennas and put it in a high polar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this requires minimal planning, very little cash, not much of your time, and no fidgeting with fine-tuning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
