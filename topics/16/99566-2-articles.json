Furthermore, probe exploration of the Eve and Duna areas (sending a ship with two probes to each planet) was done on the cheap using that tech for the interplanetary transit and then IONs on each probe for the final adjustments around the planets and the moons. While nuclear engines would\u0027ve given me some peace of mind (not much Dv left in the 48-7S-powered interplanetary transit ship after aerobreaking), they would\u0027ve meant almost doubling the weight of the whole thing and going up one or two tiers of launcher instead of the \u0022small pile of entry level boosters plus one 909\u0022 that I used.
