Once you know that, you can change your orbital period such that after n orbital revolutions you\u0027ll be very close. If you are in front of the lander you want to rendezvous with, you have to increase your orbital period so the lander will catch up with you. If you are behind, you have to decrease it so you\u0027ll move faster and catch up with it. You can do it in small steps and wait, but what\u0027s the point of playing Kerbal Space Program if you\u0027re not putting your knowledge of orbital mechanics to good use? All you need to know is how to calculate your orbital period from your orbit, and the other way around, how to calculate your orbit from your orbital period, and you can do it in a single pass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, let\u0027s say you you are in a 40km circular orbit around the Mun, you\u0027re in front of the lander, and your angle of separation is 77\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. With that orbit, you have an orbital period of 2894 seconds. Divide that by 360 and you have around 8 seconds/degree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If your angle of separation is 77\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, you need to increase your orbital period by 77*8=616 seconds, or to 3510 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. To have an orbital period of 3510 seconds around the Mun you need a Semi Major of 272.92km. With a 40km periapsis that means you need to raise your apoapsis to 105.84.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. So, raise your apoapsis to 105.84, and after one revolution, you should be very close to the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When you are closest to your lander, target it, point to the target velocity prograde marker and match velocities by burning until the relative velocity is near 0m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. To rendezvous, point to the target prograde marker and burn until you get a few m/s relative velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. When you are at the closest approach, point to the velocity retrograde marker and match velocity again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. If you are within 100m or less, you can fire up RCS and dock.
