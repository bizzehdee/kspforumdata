I did this when I had somewhere close to 600 rep. I know the actual rep rewards are logarithmic so you never actually reach 1000. The rep cost for this lowered my rep to\u00A0540.

He\u0027s simply trading too much Rep, I think. He has to constantly complete contracts just to break even. I think the only thing you\u0027re meant to trade that much of is Science. Once the tree is unlocked, I think we all trade it for cash. And as you said, getting to 800 Rep is pretty easy. Even 900 isn\u0027t difficult. But I couldn\u0027t get past about 910. Even though the contracts were great, it takes so long to complete them (they\u0027re all outer planet and multi-planet missions by that point), that I couldn\u0027t get any higher. And this was with 6 or 7 going at once. But you still have to warp a few months ahead to get to a maneuver or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E change. So I couldn\u0027t advance. Finally, since I didn\u0027t really need money anymore, I started trading Science for Rep instead.
