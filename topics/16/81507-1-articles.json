However it looks like something else is going on as your getting wobble before you even start thrusting. Make sure MJ is compleatly off, no SmartASS, no other utilities or tweeks active. heck disable every reaction wheel on the ship and do the timewarp trick and see if the wobble starts up agian.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing you could try is enable just the reaction wheel on the lander (the advanced module) and controll from the docking port on top of it.

However generaly what I do is stick the payload on the underside like you and just mount a 2.5m tank on the front docking port of apropreate size for the trip. the fuel lines feeding the drive take from the furthest tank first, in this case the front drop tank. When its empty I just decouple it and let it float away. tad more tricky if it needs to be decoupled halfway through a significant burn but normaly it can be planed for, cut drive for a few moments, decouple, possibly with a bit of rotation, get out from behidn the tank and resume the burn. This also has the advantage of makeing the tug reuseable for a later mission. once back in LKO just send up a pair of orange tanks, 1 to fill the tug and 1 to be a droptank for the next mission. Heck most likely I\u0027d have several full orange tanks hanging off a fuel depot in LKO just waiting to be plucked off by a tug when needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also favor shorter fuel tanks on the engien pods and a longer core. Big risk of your design is accidently bumping an engien while docking/undocking the payload. I dont like them extending back far enough to bump the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jean Deaux","CreatedById":59842,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-13T04:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor all those worried about Bill, you\u0027ll be happy to know he and his rickety rocket successfully completed their trip to Gilly and back.

That is, SAS torque is applied directly to the center of mass of the craft, rather than on the actual torque part. So, SAS parts on the wobbly section wont stabilize it unless the CoM is in the wobbly section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m curious about how SAS works WRT control surfaces, RCS, and gimbals on craft that can flex. Does SAS recognize when the control part has been moved relative to the CoM, and adjust input accordingly? Or do control parts move based on where they are in the craft file?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
