The jump from doing landings in Minmus\u0027 low gravity to that of the Mun certainly was a bit of a hurdle for me - it took me a long time to judge Munar landings well, plus I\u0027d been getting away with rather inefficient designs at Minmus, so when I tried the Mun, well I needed some help (which I then received, hereabouts. :-) ). Anyway, nowadays - yes, I can do things pretty efficently at Minmus, but as noted earlier, I quite like doing things like starting a base going and then exploring across the surface, rather than hopping about (which I can do, and occasionally do do, but only when I get really impatient). I can even land on the Mun (generally). But it\u0027s durned frustrating not being able to take a rover with me, and irritating that I don\u0027t have the option early on to send probes (lighter, and so easier to send places). As for \u0027misunderstanding game mechanics\u0027 - possibly - it was a while before I realised that one can collect more than one EVA report per mission (because you can only do one crew report, I simply assumed you can only do one EVA report. Finding out that isn\u0027t so has helped!). Just in case anyone\u0027s wondering - I do understand the physics involved perfectly well, but judging the appropriate point to start ones burn to slow your descent in heavier gravity - that, I\u0027m not so good at judging, but it IS slowly improving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPosting pictures wouldn\u0027t be informative in this instance, breakthrough. In essence, I\u0027m wanting to find a tech tree that better suits my expectations/the way that I want to play so that I have more choice early on, eg: Send a probe or a manned ship? Create a \u0027hopper\u0027 to visit several biomes or take a rover? When it comes to the Mun, I have a definite preference for wanting to be able to take a rover, yet with the tech trees I\u0027ve tried so far, there seems almost no point to rovers, as by the time you can build them, you can probably get by without them.

Rover wheels are one of them. Real world had rovers in late Apollo missions and just assuming for a moment that Apollo equivalents are 1.25m parts, Rovers are way too far back there. There are other things as well. I\u0027m thinking the tree will get refined by Squad over time. Eventually as early access approaches it\u0027s end they will likely add many many more parts and they will have to take a much closer look.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T17:34:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely Alshain - I wrote my tutorial campaign for sandbox simply so the structure could follow the more logical sequence of driving, flying, unmanned-space, manned-space.
