Is there any way that I can set the struts that hold it together to not release/explode. I thought of just putting them in a higher (lower number) stage, but I\u0027m afraid that it will just fall apart later. Any advice?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serratus","CreatedById":12069,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-26T21:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t matter what stage struts are in.
