Especially, neglecting the [localization issues](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92231-The-Linux-Thread#linuxthread02) of the Unity engine will likely lead to a messed up configuration file if your locale is using another character than the period as decimal separator.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T09:14:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 09:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by soulsource**"},{"CreatedByName":"ebigunso","CreatedById":113229,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T06:38:09Z","Content":"cool, so how do I find out if my language replaces the decimal separator or not?
