Granted, the subset of designs capable of breaching atmosphere but having insufficient TWR to circularize is very narrow, but it can happen, especially if, say, you used a crapton of air-breathing engines to get above atmo and only have a single puny rocket engine (or Kod help you, an ion,) for out-atmo thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractically speaking, though, anything that has an LFO rocket at all on it and can break atmo should be able to circularize - should be!
