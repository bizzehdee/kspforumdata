Second, I have a pretty tall order in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods planned on using: IR, KOS, IR Sequencer (alternative to KOS). I am not at all very experienced with any of them although I have some experience with the first 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoals:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- A biped walker capable of crossing uneven terrain up to about 20-ish degree slope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Must be capable of turning using servos and KOS alone. Also capable of walking backwards (\u002B turning).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Stability provided by the IR servos and KOS/Sequencer alone without any need for reaction wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Mass kept to a minimum but there must be a one man pod (lander can?) as part of the design. Power and solar panels to drive continously during daylight hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is where I need all the help and guiding I can get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I\u0027ll go with servos on the feet to allow for tilting in all directions for max stability on slopes. Is there any way KOS or any other mod can \u0022sense\u0022 the correct tilt angle as the foot moves forward? Any mod that offers pressure/stress sensors?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any KOS/Sequencer scripts for walkers anyone would want to share for me to learn from?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnything that leaps to mind you think I need to know about or take into consideration (apart from this being madness to begin with).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-27T18:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreetings...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWatch some inspiration...\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/20Y2SX6UIr4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/20Y2SX6UIr4\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-27T19:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223181450\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165919\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221506537890\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137508\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mikki\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n37 minutes ago, Mikki said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWatch some inspiration...\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/20Y2SX6UIr4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/20Y2SX6UIr4\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat thing is crazy.

As part of the dev program, I have created a quad walker that doesn\u0027t fall over and that does move forward. It took a bit of planning the leg movements. The movement is an 8 part cycle for something that could pass as a limp animal with its leg in cast. Directional control is not there and it turns to the left by quite a lot for no reason I can figure out right away other that it can be traced to the fact that each leg has 2 servos only. One for moving the leg back and forth, another to lift it as it moves in front position. Due to the circular motion of the back/forth movement, there is a bit of skidding but I can\u0027t tell\u00A0why there is a strict left turn tendency and not left and right alternating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain lesson I suppose is to think of leg movement in terms of frames, like making an animation (which it really is).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
