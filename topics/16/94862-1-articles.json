If you have limited contract slots available (2 or 7 depending on building level) it won\u0027t help if you\u0027ve filled them all up with contracts that you later decide are \u0022impossible\u0022 to satisfy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor craft contracts (Satellite, base, orbital station) once the contract has been satisfied, you\u0027re free to do anything you wish with the craft. The craft could be used to satisfy multiple contracts (provided it meets all requirements) or it could be de-orbited (provided you\u0027ve planned ahead for this) so that it can be recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESatellite\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA satellite contract will show the desired orbit in the tracking station (and in the map view, for accepted contracts). The most common mistake people seem to make is to get the \u0022right\u0022 orbit but in the wrong direction. The orbit that you\u0027re shown includes a set of bright dots that rotate in the same direction as your vessel should. Alternately, check the required inclination of the orbit - if it\u0027s between 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 then your orbit should be prograde. If it\u0027s between 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 it should be retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll satellites require power, which in this case means something that can generate power - so (one or more) solar panels and/or RTGs. The \u0022Launch Stability Enhancer\u0022 also generates power but since you can\u0027t take those into space, don\u0027t rely on that (a known bug, as at 0.90, is that the Launch Stability Enhancer unlocks satellite contracts). Batteries alone will not do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a general rule, if your satellite is sat on the launch pad then it should already satisfy all of the contract sub-elements except the \u0022Reach the designated orbit\u0022 one (and, if you\u0027re impatient, \u0022Maintain stability for 10 seconds\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen trying to match the orbit, as stated above the map view will show the required orbit with Apoapsis and Periapsis as well as the Ascending and Descending nodes - these nodes are shown on the target orbit rather than on your own vessel\u0027s orbit and so to use them for aligning your own orbit you should burn Normal when your vessel is aligned with the Ascending node or burn Anti-Normal when aligned with the Descending node. Unlike when targeting another object, no dashed lines are shown between these nodes and your own orbit so you have to rely on judgement to decide when your vessel is aligned with the node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESurveys\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurvey contracts will always require you to perform some form of action at particular locations. When a contract is offered, the locations will show up as small markers in the tracking view. Once the contract is accepted, these markers will also show up in Map view. Clicking a marker in map view will offer an \u0022Activate Navigation\u0022 option which will cause the marker\u0027s symbol to appear on the Navball - however, the direction shown is the straight-line direction to the marker - no matter how much planet may be between your vessel and the target so until you\u0027re close to the target, don\u0027t try to aim straight for the marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor any multi-location contract, you do not have to complete all locations in a single flight/mission. You can also visit locations belonging to multiple contracts in a single flight/mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you enter any (accepted) contract location, you\u0027ll receive an on screen message. If that\u0027s also the location you\u0027re currently navigating towards, it\u0027s icon will flash in the Navball. If you exit the location, you\u0027ll have another on screen message to tell you so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the requirement for a location is \u0022in flight\u0022 then there will be an altitude requirement. If the requirement is \u0022below xxx metres\u0022 then anywhere above the surface and below that altitude is acceptable. If the requirement is \u0022above xxx metres\u0022 then there is no (general) upper limit - you can in theory do these from space but at most orbital velocities, you will require precise timing to trigger the required action at the right time. However, if the action required involves a science instrument (pressure reading, temperature reading, etc) then that instrument may not work in space or upper atmosphere, say, and so may impose its own upper limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor \u0022on the surface\u0022 requirements your vessel needs to be on the surface but your Kerbals need not be - being on EVA whilst holding the hatch of the cockpit is good enough\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003E for you to generate an EVA report \u0022on the surface\u0022 - except when they actually require a surface sample.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrbital Station/Base\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis contract requires you to \u0022Have a facility supporting at least xxx Kerbals\u0022. This means that there needs to be enough space for that many Kerbals. It doesn\u0027t mean you have to either launch with that many on board or ever have that many on board (it can even be completely un-Kerballed if you decide to stick a probe core in there). All modules which Kerbals can enter count towards this - so a Mobile Processing Lab adds support for 2 Kerbals but external command chairs do not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the base contract requires it to \u0022Be Mobile\u0022 then it needs to have rover wheels of some sort. Landing bay wheels do not count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible to complete these contracts through multiple launches and assembly in space/at the location - but mixed results have been reported when you try to combine newly launched parts and pre-existing parts. Sometimes the use of pre-existing parts causes the \u0022launch a new vessel\u0022 element of the contract to fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EParts Tests\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts must either be activated through the staging sequence or be tested by right-clicking the part and choosing \u0022Run test\u0022. The contract will state which of these options should be used. All sub-elements of the contract must be satisfied (green ticks when viewing from top-right menu) at the same time as you activate/test the part. It\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E enough that you\u0027ve satisfied all of the requirements at different times during your flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor engine/booster tests, the only requirement is that the part be activated in the correct manner - there is no need for the engine to have access to any of the resources (fuel, oxidizer, air, electricity, xenon) which it would require to actually provide thrust. SRBs can be tested with no fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if the contract requires that a part be activated through the staging sequence, this doesn\u0027t prevent you from having already used the part in an earlier part of your mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf you have already activated the part manually then it will still \u0022activate\u0022 to satisfy the contract when its stage is activated.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf the part has already been staged, you can edit the staging sequence during your mission and place the part in a new stage and then activate that stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor tests requiring low altitudes and high velocities, it can be helpful to launch a rocket at an angle - in the VAB, add Launch Stability Enhancers, then select the root of the craft and use Shift \u002B the rotation keys to set the launch angle. The correct angle to use depends on thrust/weight/desired altitude/desired velocity so may require experimentation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Splashed down\u0022 tests require you to be in a body of liquid - it doesn\u0027t matter how you got there so for some tests it can be easier to slap some rover wheels onto the objects and drive them into the sea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Landed\u0022 tests require your vessel to be on land. For \u0022Landed on Kerbal\u0022 tests, this includes the launch pad before you first activate your vessel so placing the parts to test in the first stage to activate will be enough to satisfy the contract (if its a staging sequence one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003EI\u0027ve had a few people disagree with this one but I\u0027ve definitely done it on a regular basis.
