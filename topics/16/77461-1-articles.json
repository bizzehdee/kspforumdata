Increasing AoA will generally pass through three stages, in increasing amounts of AoA: 1) increase lift, 2) increase lift and drag, 3) stall the wing, massive decrease in lift, increase in drag. Long answer short: yes, you can fly more slowly unless your flap/brake max setting is too high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShould the tailplanes have flaps and/or spoilers activated?

If your flaps are behind you center of lift and they then create more lift, your plane will tend to pitch down. So flaps on the tailplane can cause your plane to nosedive. Spoilers on the tail will tend to do the opposite and pitch the nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Flaps/Brake M...\u0022 is Flaps/Brake Max angle. Flaps get set in four settings. At flap 0, AoA is 0. At flap 3, AoA is Flaps/Brake Max angle. Flap 1 and flap 2 provide intermediate values. For simple aircraft, a good starting place for flaps is 40. If you use the FAR analysis tools you can tweak these values to get the performance you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a starting point I only use flaps on the wings unless I\u0027m doing something special. An example of this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes my spaceplanes will have the Center of Mass shift very far forward when they are low on fuel. This can make keeping the nose up difficult. To solve this, I sometimes add positive value flaps to canards or negative value flaps to my tail plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T14:57:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never set any flap settings to my tail section. And no longer use them on any true delta wing designs I have been making lately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ideal flap placement should be near your CoM. So if your CoL is where it should be, right behind your CoM you should have no problem placing your flaps on the trailing edge of the wings. I also have my flaps set to 9 and 0 and it works fine. I use one notch of flaps for take off on many of my craft, and 2 for landing and 3 once on the ground to increase drag. Kind of like a Boeing 747 on landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use TAC Fuel Balancer for my fuel shifting issues. But I also use it for moving the CoM on some of my more unstable aircraft, that go hypersonic to get out of the atmosphere. One of my designs, the CoM can be shifted almost 2m from front to back with the fuel. This helps because when it is flying subsonic its CoM is a hair in front of the CoL. When supersonic the CoL moves way back making the nose extremely heavy, so I shift the fuel back towards the tail and it puts everything back inline. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is amazing what you can learn by watching Youtube......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for spoilers, I really don\u0027t use the ones in the FAR settings. I use the B9 air brakes most of the time, just easier to set the to brakes and not worry about the additional settings. But that is just pure laziness on my part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do highly suggest you set your control surfaces to match that of most real aircraft. There is a reason why they are setup the way they are. If unable to find a real aircraft to look at either on a video, or in a flight sim (a good one), find a window and watch a bird fly, hawks, eagles, vultures, seaguls and crows are some of the best to watch as they have large wings and often are just gliding on the wind and fine tuning their flight with their flight feathers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-13T15:05:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2014 03:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T15:25:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPositive flap settings do three things: increase lift, drag, and pitch down moment. With your main wing set so far back you will almost certainly need to counter balance the flaps with increased pitch up authority. An easy solution is negative flaps* on the tail, which simulates pulling up without changing your control authority. In the picture below, I have similar settings with canard foreplanes. The canards pitch up at the same time as the flaps pitch down, and I\u0027ve tweaked them all so that the nose stays level at all flap settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, Hodo, Ferram \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/ferram4/Ferram-Aerospace-Research/blob/master/GameData/FerramAerospaceResearch/FerramAerospaceResearch.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eis reducing the air brake drag to 1/5\u003C/a\u003E because they\u0027re currently a little over powered.
