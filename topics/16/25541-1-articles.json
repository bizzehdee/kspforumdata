For High (2.0\u002B) TWR ships anything between 35% and 50% is fine. For ships with lower TWR\u0027s you need to ascend at a steeper angle more like 60-70%. This doesn\u0027t always hold true but low thrust (talking about below 1.3 TWR) ships have a tendency of flipping end over end if you angle over too much at lower altitudes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout end turn altitude and angle. 9 times out of 10 setting turn end angle to 0 is optimal, and if your only aiming for a standard LKO launch and orbit your end altitude should be 65,000 or 70,000 meters. I sometimes use even lower altitudes because I have the deltaV to spare to lose another 10points to drag. What this does in the end is increases your orbital speed sooner, raising your pariapsis faster. Which in turn means that once your apoapsis hits your target you will have a much shorter burn to make to make it circular.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T15:56:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lyndonguitar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lyndonguitar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother question, If I want to escape kerbin SOI right directly from launch, do I tell it to fly straight up and input orbit as 85000km?

So you want to do that turn. Pre-purge there was a challenge of how fast could you reach the moon (and go splat); I burned vertically with giant rockets, and got edged out by a much smaller rocket that did a turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way is to get a very low orbit, maybe as low as 70km. Then do a transfer burn from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe harder but slightly more efficient way into launch at just the right time and just keep burning at full throttle -- set the apoapsis super high and take manual control once you\u0027re burning below the horizon. Then turn the rockets back on at full throttle and keep going prograde. MechJeb has some help with timing this, but it\u0027s limited (it\u0027s intended for a rendezvous, which would get you to an orbiting station or a moon, but isn\u0027t quite what you need for interplanetary).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeathalMeatball","CreatedById":31982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T23:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should really try and learn to fly into an orbit without mechjeb first, it can easily become a crutch\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lyndonguitar","CreatedById":61194,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T15:21:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LeathalMeatball\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LeathalMeatball\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou should really try and learn to fly into an orbit without mechjeb first, it can easily become a crutch\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know how to, I just want to do it automatically, so I can launch and watch, nOW I\u0027ve perfected the mechjeb ascent guidance, I can launch it and leave the pc, eat some snacks and when I return I get a nice good orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
