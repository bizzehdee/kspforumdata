The cool thing is that I was able to complete construction and launch of my simple orbital rocket as though nothing was amiss. I even exited out of the game and went back in and it worked the same way. Here\u0027s what it looks like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe construction works just like normal displaying 6 symmetry on the panel, but the rocket builds in 7 symmetry. Not only was I able to add 7 perfectly symmetrical rockets, but parachutes, RCS, batteries and winglets as well. It launched and flew perfectly - notice all seven SRB\u0027s displaying on the staging panel. I was able to achieve an 80 by 100Km orbit with enough fuel to make a re-entry burn. I probably waited a bit too long to jettison the booster, but I wanted it to land close by so I could see the parachutes. All 7 parachutes deployed just fine :-) for splashdown! Both craft landed safely and were recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how would you use the craft file to make a 7-symmetry design of your own? Simple, just load it into the VAB set the symmetry to 6, grab a tank or something, and connect it to the SRB\u0027s. The game will adjust your 6 symmetry to 7, and you can continue to add and remove all the parts you want parts and the 7 point symmetry will be maintained just as if it was a game feature. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJR\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-15T18:10:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2015 06:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jolly_Roger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pondafarr","CreatedById":99169,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T11:21:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven easier would be to use Editor Extensions, and get up to 99x symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Michaelo90","CreatedById":98783,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T11:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a little trick I can use to get any symmetry I want, the biggest symmetry I\u0027ve tried is 53 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Maybe I should make a tutorial video?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T15:21:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYa, I\u0027m sure you could to symmetry manually as well.
