Ive got it to where I hit 17km, but at that stage, it ALWAYS loses control, as in I cant pitch down or even hold my current pitch even with rcs on, as such I always end up flipping out and losing control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I dont have ASAS but I do have the avionics package, as I find it easier easier during the ascent wheni dont have to keep toggling sas.

I suggest spending as much time as you can in the atmosphere, and save your oxidizer for when you\u0027ll really need it (circularizing your burn). While still in the atmosphere, concentrate on getting your speed up to as close to orbital velocity as you can. I\u0027ve found that around 20 km, you can get around 1.2 km/s of speed, while orbital velocity is about 2.2km/s. Whether you have this \u0026gt;1km/s of delta-v depends on your aircraft. However, if you find yourself lacking in delta-v, I suggest going higher. Simply strap on more air intakes, and try for a higher orbit, keeping an eye on your intake air by right-clicking the resources tab to keep it up. When you reach ~1.7 km/s or higher, that would be a good time to light the main engine and circularize your orbit. The less time spent burning your main engine, the better, as it leaves you with more fuel for exoatmospheric maneuvering.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neodyme","CreatedById":57481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T16:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool thanks.
