I was using the Stock Learstar shuttle to fly some supplies up to my LKO station. The flight went fine and I got into docking range and started working to dock. I had kept the external fuel tank connected since it had a fair amount of fuel left and I wanted to transfer that to the LKO station. things just weren\u0027t working as I had expected, until I realized that the only RCS ports that were working were the Vernor engines on the external fuel tank. None of the other RCS engines were firing.\n\nI know they had fired during launch as I was down about 50 monoprop, but in docking mode only the vernors would fire. I do have KIS installed so I EVA\u0027d my engineer and removed all the Vernor engines, but the regular RCS engines still will not fire. Is there something special I need to do when there are both Verner and monoprop based engines on a craft?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T14:11:17Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 02:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by goldenpsp**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T13:54:37Z","Content":"It sounds a bit like your monoprop tank or RCS ports are disabled.

Although since it is the stock ship and not something I built maybe there is more than one RCS tank and the other one is disabled...\n\nBingo. More than one monoprop tank and it was disabled. Lesson learned. When flying a craft you didnt make, double check you know how all the parts are setup so you don\u0027t end up looking like a noob on the forums.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T14:09:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 02:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by goldenpsp**"}]}
