A well-designed spaceplane practically flies itself on the descent. The key is to make it stable ... but not [I][U]too[/U][/I] stable, because then you can get locked in to a nose-straight-prograde attitude that doesn\u0026#39;t let you nose-up to generate lift so you can keep at high altitude until the worst of the speed has bled off.

Used to use one Big S tail fin, but my last design used three smaller fins - one on the fuselage, and one on the delta wing root at the trailing edge. Basically all 3 were extremely close together and would have interfered with each other horribly IRL, but with stock aerodynamics made a plane with less tendency to dutch roll and wander when SAS was left to fly the plane\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Make sure you have a reasonable amount of roll authority from your ailerons, to compensate for roll that the vertical stabilizer induces.

I usually mount huge rudders and elevators and the smallest ailerons i can get, halfway along the span, turn my joystick snesitivity as low as possible on the roll axis, and i still find myself inadvertently rolling the plane every time i make a manual pitch adjustment. Possibly, centre of mas affects roll rate. My engines are on rear of fuselage or in pods either side, but if you have mass further outboard there will be more roll inertia[quote]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote] \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Your pitch authority should be coming primarily from control surfaces at the [I][U]rear[/U][/I] of the plane, behind the CoM.

I made some very nice handling planes with canards only. For me, the holy grail is a centre of mass well forward of centre of lift (lawn dart tendencies) but VERY powerful canards to overcome that - swept wing with big - s elevons hanging off the back edge. Something which needs a huge amount of lift to bring the nose up, and is capable of doing that very thing. That way on re-entry the canards are adding lots of lift to the wing as you pitch up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh btw has anyone mentioned Reaction Wheels yet? They are better than .... So the missus tells me. No drag. No propellant. Get a couple of the biggest ones that\u0026#39;ll fit and stick em in your cargo bay.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for overheating , two things will help - lift and drag. The problem with drag is that it is your enemy on the way up, and airbrakes are made of chocolate, but lowering the landing gear can shorten the re-entry ordeal. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLift, the more you have the slower you will be by the time you drop into the thick atmosphere where heating is worst. Max lift occurs at 30 deg above prograde and falls off rapidly after, i normally aim for 20-30. I brought in a mark 1 cockpit spacelane like this after 1.05 patch, so extreme measures aren\u0026#39;t needed for Kerbin so long as your plane has enough lift.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese days, I consider one Big S Delta, three pairs of Big - S strakes (one for leading and trailing edge, one to go on fuselage ahead of the main wing), and a pair of swept wings to clip onto the tips of the delta (i usually add 15 degrees of dihedral to these swept wings and leave the rest flat, in a gull-wing design) to be the starting point for my type 1 or 2 designs.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwbrase","CreatedById":150131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-27T01:04:00Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027AeroGav\u0027]As for overheating , two things will help - lift and drag.

At this point I adjust pitch according to whether I am heading long or short of this target point: pitch up if I\u0026#39;m long, pitch down if I\u0026#39;m short. I tend to hover around 30-35 degrees, up to 45 if I need to brake harder, down to about 20 if I need to extend.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-27T02:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ni9N3/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first two are wet mass, the second dry mass.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe has about 3k more oxidizer and ~1500 LF than she needs on the ascent.
