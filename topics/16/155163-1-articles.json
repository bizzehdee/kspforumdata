I\u0027ve been ticking off the World\u0027s Firsts Record contracts. Gather Kerbin data, Launch first vessel, Escape atmosphere, Orbit Kerbin... and up pops the first level Explore Minmus/flyby. I\u0027ve never noticed that happening before, skipping all the Mun exploration missions I mean. Anyone else see this happen? Did I maybe miss something? Will I still get the bonus rewards for the Mun flyby/orbit/etc. as I complete them? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-18T04:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, you will still get all the bonuses for the Mun. And there is supposed to be a random element in choosing targets for the Explore contracts.
