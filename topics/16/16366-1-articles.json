Face your ship in the direction it\u0027s currently travelling (the prograde marker), rotate 90 degrees in the direction that you want to be orbiting, turn the engine on low and watch how your orbit changes on the map screen. The best times to do it are the two points where your current orbit is passing through the plane of the orbit you want. This will mess with your orbital speed too though, and you\u0027ll need to correct for that by slowing down later. It helps if you keep the nose of your ship aimed at the horizon the whole time, because then more of your thrust is changing your direction rather than your altitude. Play with that until you get an intuitive feel for what\u0027s going on, and then read some of the fancy and scientific methods that helpful people post here. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-08T17:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I understand correctly, it sounds like you\u0027re talking about a plane-change maneuver.
