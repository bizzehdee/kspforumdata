They are all typically super small crafts. Any larger, and I find that they die out at around 38km, and then use all the fuel burning rockets to get to orbit. Is there some trick to going bigger? More wings = more lift? Or more wings = more weight?

If you want to make the ship ten times bigger, you just add ten times more engines, intakes, and fuel. At some point, the designs start looking ridiculous, because there are no size-2 jet engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably enough to add ten times more wings and control surfaces as well, assuming that you can still make the plane balanced and reasonably rigid. Alternatively, add even more engines, intakes, and fuel to compensate for the lack of lift.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monger","CreatedById":4143,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T17:33:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the problems with big SSTOs is that you need increasingly bigger wings, and therefore a bigger body to attach them. Making the aircraft a lot longer or wider makes it increasingly more difficult to fly. Also, wing parts have pretty weak junctions, i.e. you can\u0027t stack a lot of them without breaking them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point, you need some kind of sturdy frame. Just using the fuel tanks as skeleton won\u0027t suffice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, this is a real world problem as well. Bigger planes are usually much more cost-efficient than small ones, and still they didn\u0027t grow very much in the last 50 years. The Airbus A380 is the biggest civilian plane ever built, and it \u0022just\u0022 has a length of 79m.

To get a high apoapsis you just need to go up as fast as possible but that\u0027ll leave you with a big circularisation burn on rockets. 38km is definitely high for jets but - somewhat lower than that, before you need to cut the throttle right back - you should be flying more or less \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Elevel\u003C/span\u003E, which means your apoapsis might only be a kilometre or two higher than you, As your speed increases in the thin air there though your periapsis will rise then, eventually, you nose-up and add rockets to raise apoapsis, coast there and do a small circularisation burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4rt14n","CreatedById":101179,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T13:48:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need multiple wings.
