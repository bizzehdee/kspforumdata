Maybe check your action groups before flight? The \u0022RCS\u0022 action group should automatically add RCS nozzle toggle actions (you can also use this feature to do things like make the \u0022lights\u0022 button only turn on certain lights etc), and maybe they aren\u0027t getting added due to a bug or something."},{"CreatedByName":"spikes2020","CreatedById":67406,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T18:25:48Z","Content":"I\u0027ll check this when i get home thanks!

(caps lock) It is designed to throttle RCS so you translate without applying torque, but for all but the most meticulously balanced craft it just runs them all at less than 1%. Make sure to turn it off before orbital maneuvers.
