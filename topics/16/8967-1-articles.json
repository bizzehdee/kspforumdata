Well, because that puts you hundreds of KMs from the moon and you don\\\u0027t get that Apollo 13 style view, I decided to play around with orbital mechanics and get a free return trajectory that took me about 27KM above the lunar surface and back to Kerbin with only two course corrections after TLI. (My TLI end point is always 14,000KM and about 1/3rd of the way to the Mun, I make a burn that drops that down to 12,000KM.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should first have a Trans Lunar Injection end point of 12,000KM with a good trajectory so that you will be pulled in by the Mun\\\u0027s sphere of influence. With 12,000KM, you\\\u0027ll notice that when you enter the Mun\\\u0027s gravity, you are on a collision course with its surface and your parabolic trajectory extends far into space. After this happens, you will make a course correction burn. Begin burning PRO GRADE until that collision course gets higher and higher so that it is just a sling shot around the Mun. Your escape velocity lines should intersect the Mun\\\u0027s orbital rail at 30 degrees. You\\\u0027ll notice that your green line now puts you on a good trajectory back to Kerbin and your Apoapsis is only about 30KM (That\\\u0027s what it\\\u0027s been every time I\\\u0027ve done it now.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime warp a little bit until you start to see the Earth sink behind the Lunar horizon, time warp zero and watch the Mun pass you by as if you were Jim Lovell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend this while you\\\u0027re flying past it, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCHjhsoUJdA#\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EApollo 13 OST 17 The Dark Side Of The Moon\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\\\u0027s that.
