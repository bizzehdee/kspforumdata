a self-sufficient flying base to stave off fuel shortages is evidence of a solution in search of a problem--by that I mean to say that if the original issue is bad piloting which dips too far into the lander fuel reserves, then isn\u0027t it a lot cheaper to learn better piloting skills?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fairness, I make use of the permanent on-station lander method, but I also use reduced science gains in a modded tech tree to make it a lot more difficult to acquire science in the first place.\u00A0 I also use LS, and the advantage of needing to take only small amounts of LS supplies to the surface while the transfer vehicle carries the supplies needed to keep everyone fed for a few weeks is a worthy one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, I\u0027ll say that it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0useful, but that it is perhaps more a novelty in stock.\u00A0 It definitely has a place when exploring the Mun (it is a cousin to the popular \u0027biome-hopper\u0027 styles of landers) because of the Mun\u0027s variety of biomes, but for explorations of the polar regions where you need a polar orbit, it\u0027s both cheaper and easier to get a polar orbit on transfer rather than after arrival--but a polar orbit\u00A0can interfere with your mission planning in a number of ways, not the least of which is that it compounds the transfer window problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, if you want to visit a number of places on multiple trips, a different-but-equally-viable method is to take a rover, land it once, and then ensure that it is parked somewhere relatively flat.\u00A0 Then you can take your lander to it, rove wherever you wish to go, and return.\u00A0 If you want to be really creative, you can land\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eon\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the rover and take your lander with you, or attach wheels to the lander and let it be a rover as well.\u00A0 Unless you\u0027re using fuel cells (which is a valid method) or an engine alternator (which is also a valid method, but it\u0027s expensive), it doesn\u0027t cost delta-V to run electric rover wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo more

the\u00A0measure of engine efficiency available in the game (it\u0027s given in seconds), and v\u003Csub\u003Eexh\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0is exhaust velocity, a different measure of engine efficiency (given in metres per second) that is more directly useful to the comparison.\u00A0 For double-checking purposes, v\u003Csub\u003Eexh\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0is calculated by multiplying I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0by g\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0(one standard gravity, set in-game and real-life\u00A0as 9.80665 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E), though in reality, I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0is calculated from v\u003Csub\u003Eexh\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and not the other way round.\u00A0 Thrust is measured in kilonewtons, a measure of force (one newton is equal to 1 kg*m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E), and is equal to exhaust velocity times fuel flow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the most part, the differences are\u00A0in the engine design (one could, for example, configure a monopropellant engine that uses .00001 kg/s of fuel--it\u0027s just a number in a computer file) but it is meant to reflect reality:\u00A0 monopropellant, in general, cannot effectively store or release so much energy as a bipropellant system.\u00A0 The chief advantages of monopropellant are in the simplicity of the fuel delivery system (no mixing ratios), reliability of the engine (run it over a catalyst and it blows up; there are no ignition problems), and stability of the fuel (most bipropellants have at least one cryogenic component; most monopropropellants are stable at high temperature).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn-game, monopropellant is less effective because it is less dense:\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and O have the same density) is 5 kg/L; monopropellant is 4 kg/L.\u00A0 Therefore, in addition to the mass of fuel being dribbled out of the engine at lower velocity (which reduces efficiency), it takes more units of that fuel to reach that mass.\u00A0 Translating to units of fuel consumed per second (which is what you see on the resource tab), the Twitch takes 1.13 units/s (.51 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and .62 O), the Spark takes 1.27 units/s (.57 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and .70 O), and the Puff takes 2.04 units/s (all 2.04 Mono).\u00A0 Part of what you see is an illusion; the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engines consume fuel from two bars on the resource tab, so each bar drops at approximately half the total rate (45%\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and 55% O), but\u00A0the monopropellant engine still takes\u00A0almost twice as much fuel after accounting for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we were to create an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engine with the exact same efficiency as the Puff, it would also have a fuel flow of 8.16 kg/s, but that would translate to 1.63 units/s (.73 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and .90 O) solely because of the 25% greater fuel density than monopropellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll taken together, this means that to get the same effect from monopropellant, you need to take more of it.\u00A0 The main advantages to using monopropellant are that you don\u0027t need to be concerned with tank arrangement, placement, and plumbing,\u00A0that the tanks available (especially the radial tanks) can be fit into many small or otherwise wasted spaces on a vessel, and that (especially if you already need it for docking)\u00A0you can save on complexity by using only one fuel for everything.\u00A0 The main disadvantages are that it is less effective, more expensive (.3 Funds/kg versus .2 Funds/kg for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E), and lacks good high-volume tankage solutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

Wide base is great for lander stability, but people tend to avoid it because it\u0027s harder to pull up from kerbin.

Have it at decent height so that phasing from low parking orbit does not take forewer and you can use higher warps. About 30km worked well for me at Mun.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLab is not strictly needed if you have scientist in crew to reset experiments, but I have it anyway.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDo not go overboard with spare fuel - hauling in more is easier then flying in modules. Be generous with docking ports - in long term, mun/minmus station needs one for fuel tanker, one for crew rotation vehicle, at least two spares for future expansion and of course something for the lander. Be careful where you put them, they will see a lot of traffic, so putting them close to delicate equipment is not a good idea.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHave a relay antena or pilot on station.
