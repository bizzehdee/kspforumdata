However, the basic principle is still valid with stock parts. You want a low center of mass and a wide stance, so that you don\u0027t risk tipping over on landing. Thus I put the lander can in the bottom middle and used quad side-mounted fuel tanks. They have little engines at the bottom, which takes less space than one central engine below the lander can. Up top I put the materials bay and the goo canister. That latter one requires some tinkering, because it unbalances the craft. I ended up using the life support canister as a counterweight on the other side, but if you play without mods than you\u0027ll need to find a different solution for the off-center weight (possibly work with the parachute placement). Obviously if you only have one lander you can put the goo canister on top, but with stacked landers you need that spot for a decoupler. Notice how the decoupler is flipped upside down, so that it sticks to the underside instead of to the top and thus contributes to keeping the center of mass low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy landing legs look a little funny because I needed to fit them inside the diameter of the fairing. With stock parts you don\u0027t have that problem and can mount them however you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using two mini-RTGs for power; without mods, put solar panels there. One on each side is plenty, as the only thing that consumes power on this thing is the reaction wheel of the lander can. The antenna can be used to transmit crew/EVA reports so you don\u0027t have to wait for the return, but ultimately it\u0027s optional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor engines, I think that lander has a grand total of either 20 or 24 kN of thrust; I forget if each engine was 5 or 6. But the point is, you can work with the Rockomax 48-7S here and easily get away with only using two engines (even that will give you 60 kN, almost three times what my lander has). Mount them diagonally and use fuel lines to feed fuel from those tanks that don\u0027t have engines into those that do. It will still be symmetric.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the fuel tanks can get somewhat annoying with stock parts because you don\u0027t have a proper elongated 0.625m tank. You\u0027ll have to stack Oscar-B\u0027s. Also try and make use of the toroidal tanks on the ends, they have less dry mass per fuel, meaning you get more dV. As for how much fuel you\u0027ll need in total, you need to experiment as the mass ratio and engine Isp will be different from my configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most important part to save fuel though: don\u0027t bother with a 35km orbit, that costs too much fuel. The highest elevation on the Mun is 7km high, so an orbit between 8km and 10km is perfectly sufficient (and maximizes what little Oberth effect the low gravity can give you). Then comes knowing how to return to Kerbin in the most efficient fashion: circularize at that altitude in an orbit that intersects the points where the Mun\u0027s own orbit lines hit the surface. In most cases, that works by launching towards the 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 heading, no matter where you are on the Mun (but practice this). Then make a maneuver node to plan your ejection burn, and eject fully retrograde. This should be the last burn you need to perform, as you can get your Kerbin periapsis to ca. 30km directly from that maneuver node. Moving the node itself around helps you find the position where this costs the least amount of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you just coast home and perform reentry. Two radial parachutes slow the craft down for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice the two little fuel tanks stacked on top of the long ones, though? Yeah, that was necessary after the first trial run revealed that I was short on fuel. This design really is cutting it close for the Mun, and I need to pilot it properly to get it home. Don\u0027t be afraid to throw a little more fuel at the problem just to be safe, you have more engine thrust anyway. On Minmus, this lander works quite comfortably because it needs less fuel to land and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Mods used: RLA Stockalike, RLA Power Generation and TAC Life Support.
