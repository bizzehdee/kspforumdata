Unfortunately, when I take a plane up to there and get within the target range at \u0026gt;18800m, I can\u0027t seem to complete the contract\u0027s requirements. Instead, I get a reading from the \u0022upper atmosphere\u0022. Perhaps it\u0027s because I\u0027m fast enough in clicking it right when I get within that range, but I\u0027m just checking -- is the range for being \u0022in flight\u0022 \u0026lt;19,000 meters? The indicator below the altimeter seems to show you\u0027re in the atmosphere below that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI attached a picture of the contract on here (you can see the description on the bottom right) - another strange element is that the picture on the tracking station for the location, which normally looks like a pressure gauge for pressure readings, is instead something I\u0027m not sure how to describe (middle contract image in the picture).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi65.tinypic.com/fc40fk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fc40fk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m curious if that\u0027s my window so I know... 200 vertical meters?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas on how to get that perfect with it? My spaceplane tech isn\u0027t fully developed yet so it\u0027s hard enough for me to get a plane up there, let alone having to also get there within a 200 meter range.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-28T02:06:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2015 02:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mabarry3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T00:38:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem here is not that you\u0027re not \u0022in flight\u0022.
