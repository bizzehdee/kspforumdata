You need to predict where it\u0027s going to be and then burn towards that point. It\u0027s hard to explain but point your vessel at the target when your relative speed is 0, point your craft more towards the center of the orbit and burn slightly towards that. The more you are pointed towards the center of the orbit, the less you need to burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the MechJeb feature of closest encounter helps a lot.
