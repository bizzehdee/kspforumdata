The problem fixed by them was accidental warping past the desired point, something which was common due to the way that warp ramps up and down, particularly for longer warps or highly eccentric orbits where there is a rapid increase in speed approaching periapsis. They also improved the user interaction by changing the method from an imprecise stream of carefully timed keypresses, to just a simple click.\n\nAre they perfect? Probably not. Could further improvements be made? Undoubtably."},{"CreatedByName":"zhollett","CreatedById":62547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T04:36:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are they perfect? Probably not.
