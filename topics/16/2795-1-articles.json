I know the game isn\\\u0027t persistent, but the satellite was deployed on the same launch, so that shouldn\\\u0027t be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I tried was this. I launched, and banked to the east. I reached a fairly circular orbit with an apogee of 217km and a perigee of 208km. Once in orbit, I turned 90 degrees north, and fired off my satellite.* Note, the satellite was rear-mounted, meaning it went south. I then noted where I was in my orbit on the orbital map, and timewarped to a few minutes before I reached that point again. I carefully watched the skies, but saw no sign of my satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it just not possible with our limited instrumentation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Thought I should clarify. I did this because I wanted to ensure as well as I could that the velocity provided to my satellite by the decoupler did not affect the altitude of the satellite\\\u0027s orbit. It should\\\u0027ve basically been in almost the same orbit as me, except at a slightly different inclination, correct? Further, it should\\\u0027ve intersected (or come damn close) my orbit at the point of release, correct?*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-10T06:38:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnless you were using one of the low-power decouplers, you\\\u0027d have to be aligned perfect not to affect the satellite\\\u0027s orbit.
