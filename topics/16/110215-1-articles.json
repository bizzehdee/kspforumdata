The inclinations of both orbits (of the craft you are piloting and of the craft you\u0027re trying to rendezvous to) should be nearly the same (lie in the same plane). You can assess that by looking at the AN and DN markers (Ascending and Descending node) - they should be within 1 degree difference (the closer to 0 - the better). If not - do a plane change by putting a maneuver node in either AN or DN and try to match the planes as close as you can. (It doesn\u0027t matter for nearly circular orbits but in elliptical ones the dV difference between choosing either AN or DN can be quite significant).\n\n2. Once you have both orbits in the same plane see for the phasing rate (the frequency at which both crafts appear at the closest range to each other). At this point you might consider raising or lowering your orbit to increase the phasing rate (if both orbits are very close to each other and you are completely out of phase with another craft - i.e. it\u0027s on the other side of Kerbin). The closer the orbits are the longer you would have to wait for the correct moment to make a Hohmann\u0027s transfer. I usually set the ratio to 1:1.2 - 1:1.5 (meaning that if your target\u0027s orbit height is 100km yours should be either 120-130 km or 70-80 km). \n\n3. Now, place a maneuver node on your path and adjust it so that your final trajectory was tangential (appear to touch) the target\u0027s one. Two markers will appear displaying the resulting separation. Now slide your maneuver node along your orbit to see how those markers behave. This might take a while or you might even want to wait a few more orbits for the conditions to improve. Once you have successfully aligned your separation markers, execute the maneuver node. Naturally, the less the separation the better. Still, even 20-30 km will be normal.\n\n4. Once your Hohmann\u0027s transfer burn is complete, place your maneuver node on the point your trajectories intersect and adjust your final orbit so that it matched perfectly the orbit of the target. Wait for it and burn.\n\n5. You should be pretty close to your target. Orient your craft to point towards it and switch (click) the speed indicator to be relative to the speed of the target. (should read \u0027Target\u0027, not \u0027Orbit\u0027 or \u0027Surface\u0027). Divide the distance to your target (in m/s) by 1000 and burn towards it so that the relative speed was about that figure (for example, if the distance is 20 km, your approach speed should be about 20 m/s). This ratio is not mandatory byt don\u0027t get too fast. You will need to turn your craft away from the target and burn again as you approach it to minimize the relative speed (ideally it should be 0 m/s). Now switch to your RCS and proceed with docking if necessary."},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T12:04:40Z","Content":"You have to align your orbital plane to match the plane the other orbit is in.

There are two indicators on both orbits, position of your vessel and your target when they are closest next and the next time after that. Your goal is to change your orbit that at some time two indicators of the same color are very close, showing you a distance from your target at ideally under 10km.\n\nNext orbital pass means the next round around the planet/moon, the next time you arrive at a certain point on your orbit again.\n\nThe maneuver node should give you two buttons, they enable you to look into the future, so to speak, and change the time of your burn to the next time you come around to this point. This also gives you the opportunity to see if your vessel comes close to your target in x orbits and how far in the future this will happen, the indicators for the position of your vessel and your target will update to the future orbit. \n\nThe same plane means, both orbits have the same inclination (they are parallel so to speak).
