It uses the same set of parts you used, now that it\u0027s clarified. The only part-change I kept from my previous one is the type B wing in place of the swept wings - that change is rather important for a significant performance improvement. Being in the same tech node as the swept wings, that should not be a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParts have been rearranged to balance the plane so \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E stays put with changing fuel loads. This allowed placing all four radial chutes right above the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. Even with a full fuel load, it needs only two chutes to land safely (along with a drastic change in gear spring strength). They are set to open in two separate pairs for two landings, giving your science trips the option to return to base for full recovery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radial chutes do add drag compared to the previous one I posted, which results in higher take off speed, and lower top speed and cruising altitude, but still better than what you had. It can still make it to the poles and back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E using about 400 units of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E - it just takes a bit longer (about 50-ish mins one-way). Try not to fly too high - optimal cruising with full load is at around 275 m/s and 7000 m (both raising with less fuel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, when you go in for a chute landing, make sure you are at least about 150-200m above the surface when staging the chutes: the plane does make a pretty hefty seesaw motion as the chutes drain horizontal speed. It will settle to near-level attitude pretty quickly and can be corrected easily from that point on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
