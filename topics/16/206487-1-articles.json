I had need of 4 thrusters on a vessel in orbit, so I used an engineer to move 4 thrusters from an adjacent and inactive vessel to the active one. When I used them in a subsequent docking maneuver, the I/J/K/L controls did not work as expected. For example, a \u201Cleft\u201D (J) thrust actually spun the vessel around, forward thrust (H) moved it sideways, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m guessing that the issue is caused due to the thrusters having a default orientation when attached in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and when I moved them from vessel 1 to vessel 2, the fact that the vessels were (possibly) upside down and backwards relative to each other messed up the thruster orientation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, is there a way to do orient the thrusters to the way they would be if I had positioned them in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E? Working with an engineer in space where there\u2019s no up, down, or sideways makes it difficult to figure things out. Trial and error might work, but the permutations of 4 positions on each of 4 thrusters would take way too long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas much appreciated, and thanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Ken\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-18T23:47:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont know much about EVA construction, but have you checked the vessel\u0027s control point to make sure it is oriented properly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-18T23:47:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2022 11:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow71\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-19T00:04:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you apply attitude controls the craft should try to use any thrusters on the ship \u003Cem\u003Eaccording to the orientation of the current control part.\u003C/em\u003E So the thrusters shouldn\u0027t be the cause of the problem you\u0027re seeing unless there\u0027s a mistake with the way the construction works, or I\u0027m misunderstanding what you\u0027re describing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"macbates","CreatedById":212503,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-19T01:59:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, my bad. The target ship has the docking port on the nose (top), while the vessel I\u0027m maneuvering has a docking post down low on the side. Never had a problem with a 90 degree docking like this before, but for some reason I must have gotten disoriented while trying to maneuver.
