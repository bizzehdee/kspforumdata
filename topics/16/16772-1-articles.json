You can easily disable the fuel flow to a tank by right clicking on it and selecting disable. Then you can enable it again when you need it. However, when you add a part with symmetry in the VAB, right clicking on the part in flight will activate all those parts that were applied with symmetry. So in your case, likely all 4 tanks would disable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to get around this, when you build your rocket if you build those drop tanks with the 2x symmetry, and place the 2 sets you need, then you can then disable the 2 sets of tanks separately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there you would just right click and disable the tanks you didn\u0027t want, then right before or after stage separation just right click them and enable them again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for it being beneficial, well I think it would be slightly beneficial for 2 reasons. 1, you get rid of some empty mass sooner. 2, you will lose the aerodynamic drag created by those tanks earlier in the flight.
