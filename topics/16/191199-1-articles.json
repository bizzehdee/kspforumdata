own exhaust velocity (unless you can avoid accelerating the incoming fuel/reaction mass as you collect it).\u00A0 Niven wrote his ramscoops as doing this, at least in \u003Cem\u003EProtector\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EWorld Out of Time\u003C/em\u003E (don\u0027t think he went into detail about the\u00A0 ships in The Leshy Circuit stories or \u003Cem\u003EDestiny\u0027s Road\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EBeowulf\u0027s Children\u003C/em\u003E, certainly not in \u003Cem\u003EBuidling Harlequin\u0027s Moon\u003C/em\u003E).\u00A0 The limit I\u0027ve read for Bussard Ramjets (effectively, the point at which scoop drag equals thrust) is about 12% c.\u00A0 Too slow to be useful for anywhere further than the nearest planets in Known Space (Home, Wunderland, and Jinx, as I recall).\u00A0 And Niven\u0027s handwave method of using the scoop itself to compress the interstellar medium to fusion density just won\u0027t work without accelerating the gas to ship speed.\u00A0 Not to mention the fusion cross section of protium is apparently too low to get useful thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe handwaved, for the most part.\u00A0 He actually did mention in a couple of places that the vessel could not exceed its own exhaust velocity (and he even included a few references to scoop drag), but he tied that velocity to that\u00A0of the oncoming hydrogen--in other words, writing as though the scoop did not accelerate the hydrogen but nevertheless ignoring the fact that in order to bring hydrogen molecules together to fuse, it needed to do just that.\u00A0 In\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EThe Ethics of Madness\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0(which is emphatically \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E Niven\u0027s best scientific work, though I found the ethical debate interesting), the story concludes with two ramscoops chasing one another on autopilot for all eternity at almost the speed of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that Niven\u00A0let the idea of infinite fuel get away from him and interpreted that as implying infinities (or near-infinities) in the other aspects of the ship design.\u00A0 I think that he tended to view ramjets as something akin to streetcars in space:\u00A0 the ramscoop slides along a stream of interstellar hydrogen and uses it for energy in the same way\u00A0that a streetcar gets its energy from the overhead wires, but without considering the equally analogous notion that the streetcar is limited to the capacity of its motor--or, specifically, the ability of that motor to transform the energy into mechanical work--for its overall velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022
