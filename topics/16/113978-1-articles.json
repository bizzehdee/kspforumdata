Perhaps a liquid-fuel-only tank like one of the Mk3 tanks would be better."},{"CreatedByName":"Dildred","CreatedById":146821,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:37:37Z","Content":"Wow, that was quick! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThank you very much, Sir Red Iron Crown, my problem is solved!\n\nIndeed, the Mk3-tank would be a much better choice, half the size, double the fuel.
