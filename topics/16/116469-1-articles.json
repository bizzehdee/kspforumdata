You\u0027ll eventually end up pointy end down, but much slower than before, and chutes will then handle the rest. Strategically placed drogue chutes can help force an oblique angle too."},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T21:08:55Z","Content":"Airbrakes are magnificent.
