Put a decoupler/ separator or docking port inside the cargo bay node. Then put the stuff you want to get inside. Make sure it fits. Reduce ejection force if using decoupler or separator by right clicking it, or add docking port to your cargo when you use docking port so you can separate them later\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The simplest is by (assuming you are in orbit) point your navball at retrograde and fire your thruster until your camera \u0022tilts\u0022 and after that, if you are landing on planet without atmosphere, let the craft fall down and after few km above the ground, fire the thruster or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to slow the descent. Be careful not to overthrust and send your craft back to space, look at the surface speed on navball. If landing on planet with atmosphere, make sure to get the best reentry angle! Shallow reentry angle means your craft subjected to lower overheat temperature, but at longer duration in atmosphere while sharp reentry angle means your craft subjected to higher overheat temperature, but at shorter duration in atmosphere. Sharp reentry also have higher G-force than shallow reentry angle. Once your craft is in safe condition to open the parachute (parachute icon goes white), then open it and let it land bay itself. There are 2 parachute types. Drogue chute (red) is for slowing down (activate at high speed, but can\u0027t slow the craft enough for safe landing) while parachute (blue) is for landing (unsafe to open at high speed, but can slow down to safe landing speed) make sure to open drogue first! You can also fire your thruster for slowing down even further\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Burning means you accelerate to change orbital trajectory of your craft. In orbit, you are tied with the gravity of a celestial object. Burning allows you to change the plane, trajectory and even escape from gravitational force by accelerating to specific direction. On the simplest explanation, yes, it\u0027s basically accelerating, but also burn applies to decelerating when we\u0027re talking about orbit circularization, rendezvous, landing, reentry, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Easy is very subjective, a gigantic space station might be easy for some people, but a nightmare for other. In general, a space station must contain: crew quarter, docking port, battery, solar panels, reaction wheel, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster. Space station is easy to make if you know how to orbit and rendezvous. But if you only know how to orbit, you can basically do it in one launch. Grab the biggest fairing for payload and stuff all necessary station parts inside it. This way you launch all parts in one launch and construct it in orbit, quick and easy. The downside is, you are limited in what you launch. Bigger station needs rendezvous operation to attach more parts from multiple launches than what can be launched in single launch\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UltraLink729","CreatedById":183492,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-14T06:59:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the help, ARS!\u00A0It is proving very useful and I have now sent my first space station into space!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-14T07:00:10Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2017 07:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by UltraLink729\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-14T10:51:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy to help\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-14T12:13:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003EMoved from Tutorials forum.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
