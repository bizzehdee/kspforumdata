I\u0027ve been working on an orbiting fuel depot. Wanted to put it in high Kerbin orbit or M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit to allow smaller ships to come up, refuel then head on to Minmus or one of the planets. I had a good amount of fuel in orbit, managed to dock everything together then tried to use the two engines I thought I had lined up together to push the assembly out to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. As soon as I applied thrust the depot just started flipping. I tried to move the side modules so their engines were pushing along the axis of the main tank but ran out of RCS fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it looks like pulling rather than pushing is the key to the erratic flight. But how can I go about precisely assembling the sections in orbit?

I have a tug that has not been fully tested as I am building the station to pull now. It\u0027s designed like so: (I\u0027m at work or else I\u0027d post pics) center is an orange tank with 4 structural wings(the rectangle ones) going out at 4 symmetry, at the rear. On the end of those, there are a 1440L tank with a skipper engine. On the front of the tug, there are 4 more 1440L tanks attached radially(Rotated 45 degrees from the engines, on hydraulic clamps so that they may be released incase of an emergency) These feed into the 2880L tank, and the engines draw from the 2880L tank. When fully fueled, it holds 14,400L of fuel. There is a large docking clamp on the end of the 2880L tank to attach anything, and a manned pod for torque on the front. (Although it might need more reaction wheels because when it\u0027s full of fuel it gets tough to rotate it) I also designed the launch vehicle to use the fuel from the tug to reach orbit, so you have to refuel it before use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PringleMan","CreatedById":1396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T16:46:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are indeed correct in your thoughts about pulling rather than pushing.

Likewise with rockets, your most massive section needs to be as low as possible to keep a steady and straight trajectory with minimal effort. So with your station, if you put a booster at the \u0022bottom\u0022 of the mass, the natural tendency is going to be to topple end over end uncontrollably. Instead if you put a pulling booster at the top, with the station below it, it will exist already in a stable configuration and be much easier to control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T17:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere seems to be a limit on what length of rocket you can make.

Alternatively, if you send them each on their own window it takes forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Less cost (if you play that way) because rather than having to design a rocket that can bring modules up from Kerbin and then also bring them interplanetary, you can design it to bring the modules to LKO and just tack on a single tug at the end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Less debris in the destination orbit. (Station building is likely to leave some debris in the form of decoupled struts, fairings, stack separators, or possibly entire transfer stages. Leave the debris back home so it\u0027s easier to manage later.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Allows for, possibly, larger payloads per-launch. The extra mass it would take to bring up not only the module to be added on, but the transfer stage, could allow for larger modules in the station. If you build your station in as large of parts as possible, it is likely to be more structurally sound, since you are using less docking/berthing connections. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, those are my arguments FOR building your station in LKO and then simply tacking a tug onto the FRONT of the station and pulling it along to its destination.. So here are some design tips that I\u0027ve seen as valid...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Try using \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/common-berthing-mechanisms-2-5m-docking-ports-2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethese mod parts\u003C/a\u003E. They are Common Berthing Mechanisms that you can use in place of docking ports. They come in the four most common standard sizes, from .625m to 3.75m, and they are incredibly rigid. There is also an active and a passive (male/female, of sorts) for each size. However, this should not matter, and is really just for aesthetics. Also, they should link up with the stock docking ports, but certainly you will want to test this before departing if you are relying on them for a pivotal part of your mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Try designing your non-core modules to all be the same size. Perhaps a module initially turns out to be smaller than some of the other ones...Add a reserve of fuel or maybe some solar panels or structural bits to help even out the size and mass. This will allow you to play with your station like Legos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A generally good design is to use 1.25m CBM (the mod parts up there) ports, placed around a central \u0022core\u0022 or \u0022shaft\u0022 of a station, which can be 2.5 or 3.75m in diameter, depending on application, using said above CBMs to link up the parts. 4x symmetry for the modules you will attach radially is a good idea, remember to make these the same size. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Fuel tanks make a great central core structure, and, they, you know, hold fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-For your propulsion, it is advisable to PULL your station, rather than to push it. When you push a structure of considerable mass, you impart an acceleration upon it, and it becomes similar to if that structure were sitting on the surface of a planet. The gravity of this \u0022invisible planet\u0022 is entirely dependent on your TWR, but the effects can be devastating. To fix this problem, create a propulsion module that can dock on to the front of your station, and point the engines backward, held out on some kind of outrigger, possibly, like a gigantic space train. One more thing that is also very important if you go this route: ENGINE GIMBALS DO NOT WORK PROPERLY WHEN PLACED AHEAD OF THE CENTER OF MASS. So, assign an action group to disable or toggle these gimbals, so you can turn them off when needed. Steer using reaction wheels instead, which should be integrated into your design. When building the modules, try putting a small reaction wheel on each module so that the forces can be distributed more evenly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Plan your RCS thruster placement. Use them efficiently and you won\u0027t need to bring very much RCS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Use struts if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Turn on fine controls\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Symmetry is key. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Plan your station before you build it. Try drawing a sloppy schematic in paint or on paper even, let your imagination run and you\u0027ll find that more often than not, when planned properly, your station will come together beautifully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-And above everything: BE GENTLE. This may be a near or multi-megaton mass station, but it is as delicate as a baby. Be precise. Be gentle. Tread lightly. Baby steps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that noted.. Here\u0027s my first large station design I ever made. Actually, it\u0027s more of an interplanetary ship, designed for a grand tour mission. It\u0027s also an example of what NOT to do: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5PTJiuK.png\u0022 alt=\u00225PTJiuK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was so confident that it would work.
