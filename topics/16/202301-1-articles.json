Landing an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E on laythe is trivial, but if i want to also go multiple biomes, a plane is pretty much a necessity. so here i am, stuck with making planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here\u0027s the deal: I want a plane that I can send inside Eve, coupled with an ascent stage (possibly one that can be detached on the surface if it is too bulky to explore around freely). then the plane goes back to orbit, shedding the ascent stage. then later the same plane descends on laythe; it gets back from laythe all in one piece, and is later reused at tekto, from outer planet mod. I also want the plane to have a good IVA view, this rules out any crew pod without large windows. I actually have a workable design for laythe and tekto, but it does not work on eve and it has other shortcomings, which i was hoping to fix. so here is the attempt\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ocb7ylp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/Ocb7ylp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyes, i know what you are thinking. \u0022omg Mk2 parts! \u003Cem\u003EVade retro! vade retro!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, i know. they are kinda bad. unfortunately, my tried-and-true design with Mk1 parts explodes from heating on Eve, especially the crew capsule. Mk2 parts have better heat resistance, hence this. the in-line cockpit has larger windows, which is why i\u0027m choosing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also have other reasons for this Mk2 design:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- the cargo bay is larger, i can fit more stuff inside. the other version had 3 Mk1 cargo bays, and it had much less room than this one which has a single 250 kg cargo bay. It works a lot better. having the kerbalism mod, i can use it to store more and more redundant life support systems, and i can fit inside reaction wheels in a way that they can be swapped out if they break. something i could not do with the other model\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- the crew pod has 2 places instead of 1, and it is pressurized (again, a thing of kerbalism), which is better for the pilots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, i really would like it if i could use this version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, it has many problems:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- tends to flip\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- difficult to take off, requires 100 m/s to lift\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- poor manueverability\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- heavier\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- huge drag when using rockets\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022heavier\u0022 cannot be avoided.

can get to orbit from Kerbin and Laythe. \u00A0(If it works on Kerbin, It\u0027ll work on Laythe. \u00A0Usually..). \u00A0The best way to do that efficiently is to get

My standard ratio is 1 rapier and 1 nerv per 36 tons of takeoff mass, and 1 wing area per ~5 tons.\u00A0 This typically results in a flight ceiling of about 20 km at 1650 m/s, after which I kick on

Maybe all those wings are not needed, but if I have to land on the side on an hill, then i want my plane to be very manueverable. which means more wings. I will try reducing wings later, but i won\u0027t have the luxury of a flat runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni also want to be able to make water landings. and possibly i would also like to take off from water with a small help from the darts without spending too much fuel. else how do i take surface samples from degrasse sea?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nless wings may certainly be beneficial for a quick trip to orbit, or for a fast rocket plane. but they improve manueverability, especially at low speed. if i have a plane that takes off at 80 m/s on kerbin, it will need over 100 m/s on laythe, and then i won\u0027t be able to land it on mountains without breaking something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the Mk2, one of the first things i said in the opening post is that i\u0027m aware they are heavy and draggy and overall bad. but they have high thermal resistance and the right crew size and the right cargo bay size, and that\u0027s worth the inconvenience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I am trying to juggle a lot of different engineering needs. I like it this way. on the plus side, the plane does not need to be excellent at any of those tasks, merely good enough. the latest design is already there, minus a bit of trimming here and there. Oh, I still have to test if it goes to orbit on two engines alone; if it doesn\u0027t, I\u0027ll have to figure out something or add a third couple of darts. and then check that nothing else broke in the process\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-11T19:54:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204876-king-of-nowhere/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022204876\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204876-king-of-nowhere/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@king of nowhere\u003C/a\u003E, I have a few questions. \u00A0I\u0027m working on a design that meets your criteria, and I\u0027m running into problems. \u00A0MKII, with the aft center node free (with a shielded docking port). \u00A0Right now I\u0027m using two lateral aerospike engines, although I know you would prefer four.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, I can get to orbit on Kerbin. \u00A0But just barely. \u00A0First problem is the propellers only get me to about 7,500m altitude. \u00A0Second problem is the takeoff speed is too high, around 80m/s. \u00A0That\u0027s fine from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway, but a little too fast for Laythe, with few good flat runways. \u00A0I was able to hit 220m/s, but at the maximum altitude (~7,500m) I was down to ~180m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight profile which has worked for me is to get to 7,500m on propellers. \u00A0Then, light the aerospikes, and pitch up to about 75 degrees. \u00A0The aerospikes do not have enough thrust to push the plane through the air, so I point the nose up, and get out of the atmosphere as fast as I can. \u00A0Passing 30km altitude, I let the nose come down to start gaining speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question: \u00A0You mentioned that the aft docking port is to possibly join with an ascent stage?
