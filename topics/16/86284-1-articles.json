There are only so many types of experiments and only so many places to do them. I\u0027ve never reached it but I estimate it to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 50K points, like you do. You can increase this number by using mods like Custom Biomes (which add more places to get free-range science) and DMOrbital Science and Station Science, which add new experiments you can do. So if 50K science points won\u0027t do it for you, you might want to get some of these mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to keep in mind is the \u0022entry costs\u0022 or whatever it\u0027s called on the individual parts. Right now, these do nothing; unlock a node, get all the parts on it. But it\u0027s obviously planned at some point to make you have to 1st unlock the node, then buy each part separately and individually. Who knows? This might even end up being one of the difficulty options in 0.25, although I\u0027d wager it will come later. Still, if you want to do \u0022hardest\u0022 difficulty, at some point this will mean that you\u0027ll need considerably more than 10k science to unlock the whole tree. But hopefully by then Squad will have put more biomes out there, and maybe given us some more ways to get it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
