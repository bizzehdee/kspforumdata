However, I can\u0027t seem to drop the detached part into my inventory to carry it with me... \n\nAny help hugely appreciated. I\u0027m on a Mac.. maybe it\u0027s a bug?\n\nthanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T03:51:16Z","Content":"You can\u0027t drop it into a bin? Is that what you meant by inventory?\n\nBe sure you have enough space, as each available part has it\u0027s own storage variable."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T04:02:23Z","Content":"I think he means the Kerbal\u0027s personal inventory. In that case, yeah... it may not fit. Two hacks around this:\n\n1. start moving at a VERY slow speed down the ship and drop the part. It\u0027ll coast alongside you until you grab it and place it on the ship again.\n\n2. Hopscotch your way down the ship, repeatedly moving and placing the part. It\u0027ll take longer... but there\u0027s no risk of loosing the part to the abyss."},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T04:07:52Z","Content":"You are probably just clicking, not holding down the buttons.\n\nEquip a wrench on your Engineer. Then hold down the G button, move your mouse over the part you want to move to your inventory, hold down the left mouse button (maybe can now release G, not 100% sure), while holding it still down, drag it into your inventory, then release left mouse and G."},{"CreatedByName":"cwalrus","CreatedById":146367,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T05:20:02Z","Content":"[rofltehcat](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/148858-rofltehcat) you are a ROCKSTAR\n\nstupid key sequence!
