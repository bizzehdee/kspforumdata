Im testing to see of ALL stages work properly before I move on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I launch the rocket about 6 times, needed more struts. The 7th time It was stable, fuel lines going nice. I drop the first stage, and I notice that one of the rocket tanks is depleting much faster than the other one across from it. That rocket runs out of fuel, and Im spinning out of control. I\u0027ve went so far to rebuild the entire rocket and I still get the same effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst time trying to post a pic. I\u0027m open to all suggestions.

Make sure they\u0027re all making contact between the proper set of fuel tanks; if one\u0027s connect to something like a wing or a side tank, you\u0027ll get un-even fuel drain. Also make sure they aren\u0027t being connected \u0022through\u0022 another part; I had this problem happened to me once and I was able to trace it back to me trying to run a fuel line through the center of a Hydraulic Detachment Manifold (game counted it as attached to the Mainfold when it looked like it was attached to the tank).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImgur ain\u0027t all that bad, just sayin\u0027.
