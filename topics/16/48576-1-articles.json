I want to better understand how to work with maneuver nodes, and while the visual dotted lines do help, I\u0027m also a numbers guy. I\u0027d care to know what a projected orbit\u0027s inclination, semimajor axis, rotational period, or perhaps even corresponding-ground-location data would be on a new orbit prior to a burn. The existing node system allows me to manually modify input variables on a m/s basis, but it won\u0027t tell me anything about the \u003Cem\u003Eresults\u003C/em\u003E of my input changes other than visually. For example, which this function, I can imagine that it would be a lot less enticing to use MJ\u0027s circularize functions, especially seeing as working with semimajor axis values and rotational periods in mind would very quickly allow me to surpass MJ\u0027s abilities entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T05:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s anything that has \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E what you\u0027re looking for, but there are a number of plugins that allow you to fine-tune maneuver nodes by adding values incrementally, like the PreciseNode plugin.
