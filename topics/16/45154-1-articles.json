The mission will have six Kerbals on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I know how much dv I need to get there. What is a range I could expect to get my Kerbals back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I\u0027m using ioncross crew support. The craft contains one recycler (may be up-ed to two for simulated redundancy.) I know it has a 67% return. How much O2 should I take with me to support my Kerbals. The ship will not attempt to \u0022land\u0022 on Jool because FAR would tear it apart on the way down. Basically, I am not taking O2 from anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lumpman2","CreatedById":77718,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T23:19:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure about crew support, I\u0027ve never used that before.

I know it gives me the dv needed to get there. Do I just keep adding dv onto it for the return trip? i.e. 1000 dv to get to mun \u002B 100dv to orbit \u002B100dv to break orbit \u002B 1000 dv to return for a total of 2200m/s.

Note however, that the last 1000 m/s for \u0022return\u0022 (in your example) is to get back into LKO, not to get to Kerbin. The 100 dV to break orbit (in your example) should be enough to put you on a path back towards Kerbin. You can then either enter the atmosphere directly or apply the 1000 m/s to circularize your orbit and then land, or do some combination of the two. The figures should be used as estimates, of course. Your mileage may vary depending on how accurate your transfer burns are and how close you get to launching at the proper angles and in the proper windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
