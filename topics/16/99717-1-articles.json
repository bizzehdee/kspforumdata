Next, you need to plan out docking ports. Not only do you need enough to handle the crew ships and interplanetary motherships, but you also need to plan out how you want to replenish station\u0027s necessary resources. Depending on size of ships for refueling refueling, that means several orange or sls 3.75m tanks. As far as lights go, i do not like the white lights; too bright. Instead, i have changed the color to red to make looking at the station easier. Also, i have place a set of 4 lights on each side of each new module. Finally, decide on was orbit type you want. Equitorial is relatively easy to get to, but you have to constantly deal with nighttime periods and eclipses. On the other hand, you can angle the orbit in such a way that your time on the sunlight side is side is maximized and have relatively brief periods in the nighttime side. Hope this helps, and good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T10:21:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no such thing as an ideal station as each will vary depending on what\u0027s required of it. You have already figured that you will need docking ports, fuel and RCS on yours to replenish ships and allow transfer of crew. I also tend to put solar panels on mine to keep the batterie charged and enough habitation modules for any crew planned to stay over. Communications is a good aesthetic, and makes sense. I also tend to include enough escape pods for the maximum number of crew the station can hold. These might just be a small capsule that will stay in orbit to be rescued, or can include engines and parachute for de-orbit burn and return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T10:55:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my old save, I built a station starting with a central core- basically a few structural fuselage parts with large docking ports at right angles. You can then bring up whatever modules you want. I\u0027d bring up fuel tanks (which you can then refill when they become empty) crew quarters to hold Kerbonauts while they\u0027re waiting for the next Mun bus, solar power and lots of docking ports and you\u0027ve got a basic station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESite the solar arrays away from any docking ports that you want to use to avoid accidental destruction. It\u0027s also quite useful to have a little RCS-powered tug you can use during station assembly and for docking heavy fuel tankers. If you use more than one type of docking port, having a couple of port adapters (I use the thinner \u0027dustbin lid\u0027 connector with a medium and large port either side) adds flexibility.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T11:17:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a working hub it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not very efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried it, I had this lovely science fiction painting in my mind, with my space station, and a wide variety of interplanetary tugs and landers, all arriving, and leaving, and working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practice, it didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t quite work that way. After using up the initial supplies, resupplying the space station was very problematic. Trying to send a huge tanker up to it, the tanker would consume huge amounts of fuel in orbital maneuvering and docking. Similarly, but to a lesser extent, thirsty interplanetary tugs would arrive in orbit, and run out of fuel and/or monoprop before docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I started using smaller \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfuel ferries \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to carry fuel from the space station to a larger ship.
