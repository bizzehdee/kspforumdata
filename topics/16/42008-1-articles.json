One I expected it be that bad, its a cargo and retrieval plane. The other is a hypersonic high alt test plane, I was testing to see if I could build a SSTO aircraft. The SSTO side failed but I build a plane that can fly at 25km at 6.5mach and be completely stable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe three things I learned with plane building in game is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- Center of lift should be on or slightly behind, but not far behind the Center of Balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- Having control surfaces or stabilizers behind engine exhaust is bad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- Center of Thrust should always be in line with the Center of Balance. To high or to low will lead to the plane spinning nose down or up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith those thrust vectoring engines, it is best to lock the gimbles on take off. And have them set to an action group. I highly suggest the variable geometry intakes with them. Otherwise you will lose to much intake air and stall one engine or the other causing a flat spin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly good luck, and have fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
