I manage to get in to a coplanar orbit and plan the rendez-vous at less than 5km. But somehow my burns are apparently not efficient, because when I start my brake when nearing the target I run out of fuel. I have tried it now at least 10 times and same thing keeps happening.\n\nAny ideas as of how to make my burns more efficient?\n\nThanx"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T09:59:16Z","Content":"Well - you\u0027re not going to be able to do much to a Hohmann transfer to make it more efficient (unless you\u0027re doing something that really isn\u0027t a Hohmann transfer) - my guess would be that if you\u0027re having to do an inclination change in LKO, that\u0027ll be taking up most of your fuel - that or your launch is very inefficient.\n\nOnce you\u0027re in a circular, co-planar orbit, moving from it to the orbit of your target, and then matching velocities/orbit with it shouldn\u0027t really cost a lot of fuel at all.

The ship in the docking tutorial comes with 1562 m/s of DV to start with.\n\nIf you follow the tutorial, you\u0027ll be doing the following burns:\n\n- plane alignment (do at the AN, not the DN), for a cost of 335.1 m/s (29s burn duration);\n\n- raise apoapsis to intercept the target, for a cost of 285.6 m/s (23s burn duration);\n\n- zero the relative speed at the closest approach , for a cost of 226.7 m/s (19s).\n\nAfter zeroing relative speed, you would still have 715 m/s of DV, of course you need only RCS from there to dock.\n\nHowever, Wemb is right that the tutorial isn\u0027t giving the most efficient procedure. If you do the following instead (without caring for the tutorial text):\n\n- raise apoapsis to intercept target, at a cost of 280.5 m/s (25s burn duration);\n\n- plane alignment then costs much less, only 260.5 m/s (22s);\n\n- another burn to match the R/V position (or even some correction burns), that took me 91.4 m/s;\n\n- zero relative speed at closest approach, for 145.7 m/s (11s);\n\nresulting in 786 m/s of DV still available (quite close to the amount saved by making the plane alignment maneuver at a higher altitude).\n\nCan\u0027t say from what you wrote why those maneuvers cost you so much more. You may not be keeping the maneuver node centered on the navball at all times (get help from the autopilot) or you may be burning not at the node, but too early or too late. For greater efficiency, each burn has to be done starting at \u0022Burn\\_duration\u0022/2 seconds before the node. And definitely, don\u0027t overburn, when you come close to 10m/s DV left with the current burn, cut throttle and proceed only with very small adjustments.\n\nEdit: if it could come useful, [few pics](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9yac197xfn57tgz/Docking.zip?dl=0) showing some of the maneuvers I did (and the mandatory end result= docked).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T11:36:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 11:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by diomedea**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T11:39:53Z","Content":"Hello again - had a quick look at the tutorial, and while I\u0027ve not played it all the way through, I can tell you my Hohmann transfer cost me 170 dV - if yours is costing 700 then whatever it is you\u0027re doing isn\u0027t a Hohmann transfer... \n\nYou aim with those is the end up - at the point of closest approach - to be in teh same orbit as the target. You won\u0027t be going at the same speed - (if you were you wouldn\u0027t need to match velocities) - but your orbit should be tangential to the targets when you meet. \n\nFor instance, after you\u0027ve completed your transfer burn, but before your circularise when you meet the target, your orbit should be eliptical and look something vaguely like this. \n\n![687474703a2f2f7777772e74726176656c696e737572616e63652e6f72672f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323030392f31302f686f686d616e6e2e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/86da40ccc1aee455649d9d7629ea972acb680043/687474703a2f2f7777772e74726176656c696e737572616e63652e6f72672f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323030392f31302f686f686d616e6e2e6a7067)\n\nHere the target is Mars from the Earth\u0027s orbit around the Sun. If your Hohmann trasnfer doesn\u0027t look like this, it\u0027s not a Hohmann transfer, and that\u0027s where you\u0027re spending all your fuel.\n\nA point to note about them is that while they\u0027re efficient, they\u0027re not the quickest way to get somewhere - usually you have to time them just right with respent to where you and your target are in relation to each other. The timing is everything - the shape of the trajectory, though, will always look like the above.\n\nWemb\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T11:42:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 11:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wemb**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T11:44:08Z","Content":"The tutorial tells you to use RCS for all rendez-vous maneuvers - do it.

Instead of throttle, use \u0022H\u0022, \u0022N\u0022 for braking and accelerating when in range of the target.\n\nAlso, just like in Wemb\u0027s picture - the more similar your transfer orbit to the target\u0027s, the less dV it costs to match orbits. Your transfer should end with a tangent - the purple and orange markers should be really close together. If you\u0027re crossing the target orbit at a wide angle, there will be a lot of speed change needed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T11:49:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 11:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T14:46:52Z","Content":"Why do a plane alignment?

You don\u0027t need to come to a full stop at 50km. As you start to understand what the craft does and the navball looks like while performing maneuvers, you will realize you can move the markers around without coming to a full stop till you are nose to nose with the docking port.\n\nIt\u0027s simply a matter of \u0022pushing\u0022 your retrograde, and \u0022pulling\u0022 your prograde. If you burn slightly ahead of your prograde marker, it will come to you. Likewise, the retrograde will move away from you. All you have to do to rendezvous is either pull the prograde to the target prograde (pink circle) or push the retrograde to the target retrograde. The latter is usually the choice because burning retrograde will also slow you down which you will eventually need to do anyway.\n\nComing to a full stop and then burning toward the target and then coming to another stop and then burning toward the target again is just a waste of energy.
