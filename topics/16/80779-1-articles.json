In order to do this properly, I need to do my GTO burn such that my Ap ends up on an equatorial AN or DN. The circularization burn is then done at the same time as the plane change burn, (theoretically) putting the satellite in a perfect Geo-Stationary Orbit using less Dv than doing the two burns separately. Since the map view doesn\u0027t show equatorial AN/DN, this is somewhat complicated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody know the best way to accomplish this? I\u0027ve come up with a couple of possibilities:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Do the burn to bring my Ap up to GTO altitude at an equatorial AN/DN. Since it\u0027s just a Hohmann transfer, I should end up at the opposite AN/DN. The problem is that the Ap of my suborbital launch trajectory is still fairly close to the atmosphere and if it isn\u0027t timed correctly, I\u0027ll find myself descending back into the atmosphere before the 6\u002B minute burn is complete, so unless I\u0027m really lucky, I may not have that flexibility. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Use a parking orbit. Realistically speaking, this isn\u0027t the perfect answer because I should be able to skip this step but for the fact that I\u0027m missing the information about equatorial AN/DN in the manoeuvre planner. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other ideas or anything I\u0027m missing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T11:15:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince Mun is orbitin Kerbin above the latter\u0027s equator, using it as a target should work for the AN/DN.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ninjaweasel","CreatedById":100296,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T15:11:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is a good solution I hadn\u0027t considered for a stock solar system.

Your best bet is to raise your AP to the desired altitude, then do the plane change there and slowly bring up your Pe over a number of orbits. This will also allow you to position the satellite exactly where you want it (especially if you want them spaced a certain amount). You can calculate your required orbital period to phase into the desired spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ninjaweasel","CreatedById":100296,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T21:47:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, I don\u0027t even care where the satellite ends up, other than over the equator in a circular orbit at 35786km. Figuring out a launch window is a later problem! My priority right now is figuring out how to plan the GTO burn such the Ap ends up at 0 degrees latitude. As far as I\u0027ve determined, Mr Shifty has then best plan. Since I\u0027ll eventually have a few satellites in Geo-Stationary Orbits, I fake it by making one of them the target during the GTO burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hoping I can convince somebody to build a mod or MechJeb module that handles equatorial AN/DN better, and provides orbital parameter data for orbits post-manoeuvre node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
