I\u0027m curious if anyone can provide some specific numbers on an Eve return vehicle. More specifically, is there a minimum TWR I should be aiming for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current, untested return vehicle masses some 15 tons and uses two turbofans as the first stage, each with four intakes and a single mark 1 fuel tank, having a total TWR of @ 2.5. The second and third stages consist of pure rocket parts with a combined delta-V of @ 4,400 with a TWR of or greater than 1.75. My thinking is that the vehicle will use the turbofans to ascend as far out of the atmosphere as possible before igniting the rocket staging to get into a low orbit (and my action groups are set up to support this). From there I can bring in another vehicle for rendezvous and rescuing the crew (this one is purely for getting into orbit, nothing beyond that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else had success with the turbojets?

And this number goes up if your TWR is not very good. Divide your TWR on Kerbin by 1.7 and that\u0027s what it\u0027ll feel like. Unless you have efficient Kerbin ascent vehicles that have TWR of only 1.2, I wouldn\u0027t try ascending from Eve with a TWR below 2 (relative to Kerbin). More like 2.5 at the start of each stage, and hitting terminal velocity just before the end of each stage will reduce the delta-V you need, though you\u0027ll need more engines to get a higher TWR which will reduce the delta-V capacity of your design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor future reference when you\u0027re using jet engines on Kerbin or Laythe, the turbojets only generate half their rated thrust when stationary.
