Like tomf says, it\u0027s best to wait (warp) until the planets are in the right alignment before you launch. This can be calculated by hand, with \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/protractor-for-ksp-0-18/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emods\u003C/a\u003E, or with \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eonline calculators\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to get Jeb to Eve now, is to move that ship to a different orbit, and test to see if you can get an encounter using a maneuver node. If you\u0027re in the same orbit now, it should be simple to make a node that goes from your new orbit to meet Eve\u0027s at the periapsis or apoapsis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet Eve as your target, and drag the node around to see if you get a close approach. If you don\u0027t, you\u0027ll have to do another orbit (or let Eve do another orbit), then try again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, only will work if your ship has the fuel to move to a lower or higher orbit, and then perform the transfer. And then, enough to get into an aerocapture trajectory at Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck! Hope Jeb likes it at Eve, once something\u0027s on Eve, it tends to stay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
