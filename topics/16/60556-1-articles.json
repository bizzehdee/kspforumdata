I think I beams are the best method, but I can\u0027t quite figure out a good solution for a wide wheel base that keeps the center of gravity somewhat low so that the base/big rover won\u0027t tip over, and so that it doesn\u0027t look too awkward.

That also seems like a lot of engine for simply landing on Duna. You just need to slow down, not land completely, let the parachutes do most of the work. Figure out when the chutes deploy and begin slowing down there, then right before they open completely burn again, and then burn whatever is left right before impact. I landed a rover with the ruggedized wheels on Laythe and hit dirt about 23m/s broke all the wheels, but nothing fell off. Sent a kerbal over and fixed them right up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XOIIO","CreatedById":100854,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T07:52:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy previous experience with duna lends me to think that chutes won\u0027t do much, and I am sending this unmanned.
