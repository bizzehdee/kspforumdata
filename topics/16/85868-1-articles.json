This is with the help of throttle balancers, tweakscale and spaceplane parts plus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow whilst i can get into orbit reliably and bring it down to the right ball park or approach (with atmospheric trajectories) i cannot for the life of me manage to get it to set down on the runway nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow i have quicksaved and reloaded the approach about 50 times over the past two days and i, honest to god, have only landed 2 perfectly. The rest have been catastrophic failures. I get down to about 150 m/s speed and flare up, i fight a slight roll during the flare but usually manage to keep it level. Now as soon as my two main landing gear touch the runway they force the front down and then the craft begins to roll over onto the wings and into the ground, destroying everything inbetween. At first i thought this was because i have the wheels too close and no drogue chute, so i added them (realchutes mod). I have tweakscaled the rear gears so they have good clearance aswell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow i am at a loss as to how to prevent myself from crashing every time. I basically need touchdown to be more forgiving. I try to minimize vertical speed as much as i can but it almost never seems to be enough, then if i do it squirms on the runway. I guess my main question is that can i edit the suspension values to give myself a softer landing on the gears to reduce the load and cushion myself slightly? Also are there any mods that can autoland a glider onto the runway taking into account the parameters from when you turn the autopilot on. Mechjeb always nosedives me into the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help on this would be massive as i have read many thread trying to solve my problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using FAR as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T22:15:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELanding at 150m/s is usually a great way to make explosions.

Of course, this depends to some extent on the design of your ship, whether you\u0027re using FAR, have airbrakes, etc. But in stock air, it\u0027s very hard to stall at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I always do is put my main landing gear as far outboard as possible, directly under the wingtips. If the wingtips are forward of maingear on the rear of the fuselage, that\u0027s OK because they\u0027ll still keep the wingtips from digging dirt should the plane try to roll over. The stock airplane wheels are massless so no problems putting them anywhere you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T22:23:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA stock(ish) space shuttle?

Using Trajectories, I target that grassy area between KSC and the mountain range. Spaceplanes have a lot of cross-range capability, so there\u0027s a lot of breathing room. Then, I get down to ~250-200 m/s in the lower atmosphere, a few kilometres from KSC. Finally, I line up the flag\u0027s pink target marker with the 90 degree line. This ensures that I\u0027m coming in due east. After that, it\u0027s simply a matter of bleeding off velocity and coming in quite low. This ensures that even if I come in at high speeds, the landing gear are able to take it because there\u0027s not a lot of vertical velocity involved. After that, it\u0027s a matter of braking hard and hoping I don\u0027t run out of runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively (if your landing profile is good), you may just have landing gear issues. If the standard three wheels aren\u0027t sufficient, you may want to add more. Try starting the shuttle itself on the runway, then using its engines to pick up speed. It will likely wobble and break apart at some point, but that data will be good, as it lets you know where the issues are. It sounds like that single front wheel isn\u0027t enough, so you may want to add a couple of auxiliary gears on the wingtips (to prevent a complete rollover), or just double up the placement on the front, if your body is wide enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Progressm","CreatedById":80659,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T22:29:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou probably know this but ensure the landing gear is straight, not on a sideways angle (no camber angle \u0026amp; wheels straight to the direction you\u0027re going).

Make sure the gear are straight and not tilted inward or outward. One other adjustment you can try is tilt them slightly back, so that the gear strut extends slightly backward rather than straight down.

Try moving them forward so that the craft can balance for awhile on its rear gear before the nose comes down. Real aircraft have the rear gear reasonably close to the center of mass, not all the way at the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, consider using an action group key to disable all your torque modules and maybe all your aerodynamic flaps except the outer-most ailerons the moment you touch down on the runway. It\u0027s possible all your control surfaces and torque actuators are contributing some sort of weird roll moment coupling that becomes problematic after the gear hit the ground. Your efforts to correct post-touchdown wobbles may be exacerbating the problem rather than making it better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope these help, and good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cadaverific","CreatedById":110619,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T23:24:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith FAR landing speeds anywhere between 100-200 km/s are normal and certainly doable.
