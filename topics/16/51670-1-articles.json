For instance, I had a design where I had some landing legs which, when extended, got in the way of the exhaust of the lander\u0027s rocket engine. So when I extended the landing legs, the lander would just plummet even when I was applying full thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is: do RCS thrusters have the same thing? Should I be as careful with RCS placement as I am with main engine placement?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T07:07:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERCS thrust does not get blocked, and as far as I know, no engine with exhaust damage disabled gets blocked either - try stacking ion engines on top of each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeFudge","CreatedById":74270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T07:08:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Supernovy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Supernovy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Etry stacking ion engines on top of each other.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do that??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T07:57:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Nevermind...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-03T08:17:24Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2013 08:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
