At-least everything that survives. Some engines and other small parts might get damaged or broken off once the part actually impacts the surface. However, I did not try this with the elevations and distances you have outlined, so I will try again with some more extreme measures. With the control module attached, the part is counted as a probe or individual craft and can be switched to, tracked and even controlled to some degree. I\u0027ll build something with more stages and try again from medium and high altitude and something even from sub orbit to see if it makes a difference. Granted, even if I can prove this theory, the addition of radial chutes, control modules and perhaps even batteries is going to increase your ship\u0027s cost, not to mention it\u0027s mass.
