I havent seen the base building contracts since 1.0.5 release, but i know in 1.0.4, the contract parameter syntax was a little screwy, and that usually in this case, that would mean something in the sub paragraph of that line counts as that part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEx:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Have part on vessel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_____Part: solar panel\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T14:48:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KeeblerKerbin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KeeblerKerbin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve got a contract to build a base on the Mun through the new contract system.
