First off, as noted above you need 4 copies of Goo and Material experiments from the same biome to get all the points. Capsules can only hold 1 of each, but the MSL can hold them all. Second, the MSL allows you to rearm the Goos and Materials after use. If you can\u0027t do that, then you can only use them once, whether you transmit or return them. So anyway, you have the MSL which will be what actually lands on Kerbin with all the data in it. You have a lander with 4x Goos, 4x Materials, and 1x everything else. The lander goes to Biome A, gets everything, comes back to the lab. You put all the data in the MSL, you rearm the Goos and Materials, then send the lander to Biome B. Repeat until you run out of lander fuel, then land the MSL and profit. Repeat as necessary until all biomes have been looted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to how you physically move data around, you EVA the Kerbal, have him get right next to the experiment, and right-click on the experiment. One of the options on the menu will be \u0022take data\u0022, or \u0022download data\u0022, or something similar (varies with experiment). The Kerbal now has the data in his pocket. When he enters any pod, the data gets stored in the pod. But you can also EVA from the pod, right-click on the pod, and take the data back out of it. This is how you move surface samples from the lander to the MSL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals can only have 1x of any type of data in their pockets at once. So if you have 4x Goos, you have to make 4x EVA trips to collect all the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: it helps to put a short ladder section next to or even on the experiment.

You have to return samples to get the remaining 60% of the points. If you process with the MSL before transmitting, the buff from the MSL will sometimes let you exceed the 40% cap by a little, but you still can\u0027t get it all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransmitting is thus a total waste of time, because it means you have to make a 2nd trip to the same place.

You can keep all the samples and EVA reports in one pod. Crew reports (ones from inside the pod) are a different story. Same goes for experiments as a rule; most of them can only store the data from a single run. You can either transmit that away and get another sample (generally bad idea) or just carry around more experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Transmitting screws you over in the long run; there\u0027s a cap of about 40% of the total possible value that you can get from transmission, and that\u0027s assuming you carry around multiple instances of the same instruments (so ultimately you either have to return an experiment from there anyway, or settle for 40%).

Using your example of a given experiment worth 30 points. If you do that experiment and transmit the science, you would get the 10 points.
