In KSP 1.0 the drag physics were updated, is it now worth it to add for example the FL-A10 adapter between 0.625m parts and 1.25m parts where it previously just added more weight and drag?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T02:24:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 02:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Layl**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T01:35:27Z","Content":"Yes, they actually have a point now.\n\nIt\u0027s a pretty simple experiment to do... just launch a little rocket with/without the adapter and see which goes higher."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T01:39:58Z","Content":"Adaptors have always had a point even with the old aero.

So if you start with a 1.25m part, a 2.5m fuel tank directly underneath will have more drag than if an adapter was there, because the adapter has less drag than a fuel tank."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T03:27:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Adaptors have always had a point even with the old aero.

KSP doesn\u0027t appear to me to model \u0022bendiness\u0022 all that well-- the reason why sudden diameter changes make a difference in real life is that real-life objects can bend all along their length. KSP appears (as far as I can tell) to have rigid parts (they squash under stress, but don\u0027t *bend*), and the bending happens only at the joints, which I think is just a function of what the node size is. The more joints you have, the more opportunities to bend. I would say that adding an adapter makes bending *worse* because now there are two joints instead of one (though not a lot worse, since one of the joints is a larger-size node and is stiffer).\n\nIn any case, in pre-1.0 I never bothered with adapters and never had any structural problems from it. (And even if there were, could just use struts, which were massless, which not all adapters were.) The only time I ever used adapters was either cosmetic, or if I needed to physically space things out to make room for radially attached parts and what-not.\n\nIn any case... there\u0027s a lot *more* reason for them now. Flat surfaces perpendicular to the airflow = major bad."}]}
