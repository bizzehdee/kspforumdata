Does the part count on the Vessels play a part in this as well? Or does part count only come into play when the ship is active/within range of an active ship? For example, would 50 ships with 100 parts each degrade the game the same way 50 flags would?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, would saving out copies of just the persistant.sfs file act as a way to restore to a previous point? Or do I need the whole folder? My ships/sub-assemblies are pretty static at this point, but I\u0027m trying new stuff with them that has a high chance of going pear-shape and stranding/killing a bunch of my green friends. If I could just save the .sfs without needing the whole folder it\u0027d save me some precious disk space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-08T02:40:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2014 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ArmchairGravy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T22:39:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe physics engine only simulates objects within 2.3km, so having a lot of ships doesn\u0027t really cause lag. Anything outside that radius is treated as a single point on rails, which takes very little CPU time. Your idea about using the persistent file as a backup works exactly as you said. The ships folder is not needed to do this because the persistence file contains all the information about active ships. You just wouldn\u0027t have anything in the VAB. You can even trade the file with people to do a multiplayer-like thing. Just make sure that you have all the required part files when you load or it will delete any ships that have missing parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T23:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving many ships/debris in your .sfs definitely does decrease performance. I start to notice it around 150 distinct entities and it becomes bothersome around 500-600. Obviously YMMV depending on your system, kinds of debris (I\u0027ve not figured out how it works precisely. Hundreds of debris around kerbin will still give me silky smooth performance around any other celestial, and it\u0027s especially the map view that suffers) and maybe other variables.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yasmy","CreatedById":79995,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T00:21:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI run a little script to watch for changes in quicksave.sfs and persistant.sfs,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand automatically commit the changes to a repository.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt basically runs \u0027git commit -m \u0022autosaving\u0022 in a loop at regular intervals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way I can scroll back in time to pretty much any quicksave or persistence update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould highly recommend.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverchain","CreatedById":83000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T00:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELots of flights and debris decreases performance.
