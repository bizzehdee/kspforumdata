I assume you mean transmitting results then doing the experiment again - that didn\u0027t even occur to me because I always wanted maximize my results rate by recovering the vessel and since subsequent reports overwrite prior reports. I guess I wasn\u0027t maximizing at all! Since I could have been taking the partial results from transmitting then recovering a second result. So the question here is... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I have an experiment that gets 12 science, and I transmit the results for 50% (6 science) then I do the experiment again (assuming that this would be for less science? maybe 4 science) and recover for the full 100%, I would end up with less total science for the trip (10 rather than the original 12). Right? So this would really only be a benefit if I don\u0027t plan on recovering. Or if I\u0027m doing intermediate steps (like doing a crew report during liftoff, transmitting, doing another during 100km orbit, transmit, boost to Mun, crew report on orbit, transmit, LAND ON MUN, and save that crew report until recovery since it will be a biggie).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ciechosz","CreatedById":18882,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T20:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if performing an experiment on a ship that is later destroyed and thus not able to transmit or take it back to Kerbin reduces your gain from future experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oddible","CreatedById":74605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T20:26:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ciechosz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ciechosz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wonder if performing an experiment on a ship that is later destroyed and thus not able to transmit or take it back to Kerbin reduces your gain from future experiments.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the gain is based on the return so if you didn\u0027t transmit or recover you\u0027d get the same pool of science again - definitely something to check though!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ciechosz","CreatedById":18882,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T20:28:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA quick test with discarding results suggests that you\u0027re right \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
