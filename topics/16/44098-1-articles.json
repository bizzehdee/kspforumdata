However I notice that it is nearly impossible to make the rocket that the probe is using to turn. I tried using the same design but with a manned pod, and I was able to maintain a stable orbit and everything, because it would actually turn. Any ideas on what I\u0027m doing wrong? I don\u0027t know if there are certain items that I need to put on the probe to control it or anything of that nature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T04:06:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the stats for the command pods and probe cores in the Vehicle Assembly Building, you should see that there are some values labeled pod torque, or something else to that effect. If I remember right, the manned capsules have values of 10-20, while the probe cores are closer to 1.5. For the torque, a higher number means you have more power to turn, so it helps you to turn faster. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to be able to turn a ship with just a probe core faster, then you should place an SAS/reaction wheel module on your rocket. That will add torque, at the cost of additional electricity use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripzter","CreatedById":75335,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T04:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing you probably are doing wrong is you dont have enough electricity.
