At first I thought it was clipping but here\u0027s where it gets weird. The rockets never once explode if I first \u0027edit\u0027 them in the VAB. Loading the rocket in the VAB and then clicking the VAB launch button makes it so they are 100% safe... but take that same rocket and launch it from the launchpad and Kerbagheddon starts?\n\nI don\u0027t wanna make a bugreport unless at least someone else confirms my hallucinations.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T20:59:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 08:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OddFunction**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T14:41:13Z","Content":"Are you using Kerbal Joint Reinforcement?
