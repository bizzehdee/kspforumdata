Here\u0027s the scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two Orbital station modules around Duna, one core and one fuel. They\u0027re at an altitude of about 575Km, not yet docked. I was thinking of descending them to about 50Km before docking. What I\u0027m using them for is a refuel waypoint for my Duna Surface base while mining kethane on Duna and on Ike. I want a low orbit for simply \u0022dropping\u0022 a ship into the atmosphere after refueling. This would conserve as much fuel as possible that I\u0027m delivering to the surface base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs a 50Km orbit really ideal or do I have something wrong? Also, a 575Km orbit is the most fuel efficient orbit for returning to Kerbin after refueling. Excess fuel can be dumped into a refueler around Kerbin for later use.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-20T05:28:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2014 05:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by 957Chatterton\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T13:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA 50km orbit is good if parachutes play an important role in your landing strategy. Duna\u0027s atmosphere is not only thin but also very shallow (it doesn\u0027t become significant until about 12km), so for parachutes to be most effective, you have to come in with long, flat descent profiles which maximize their time in the air. Starting from 50km is good for this if your LZ is about 1/4 of the way around Duna from where you do the deorbit burn. The problem with this type of landing, however, is that it\u0027s a bit difficult to land closer than a few km to something already on the ground, so you need a way to bring the things together once they\u0027re down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, Duna\u0027s atmosphere is so thin that if you\u0027re landing anything more than about 20 tons, the number of chutes required for them to do any real good is so big that they start really interfering with the rest of the ship\u0027s design. In such cases, it\u0027s a lot simpler just to land on rockets alone, perhaps with a few chutes to save some fuel if you really want to. For this, a higher orbit in the 75-100km area will do and helps improve landing accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T05:52:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to increase the altitude a bit, maybe 80km.

Since the atmosphere is so thin around Duna, it might not be a bad idea to use basic kinematics formulas to figure out the range at any altitude since air resistance will be very little. If you\u0027re not opposed to mech jeb, it has a module that predicts landing sites.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T12:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen landing anywhere, but especially for planets with atmosphere, landing from a high orbit is easier and more accurate, but wastes more delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because from a higher orbit, you ratio of horizontal to vertical movement decreases, making aim easier but braking harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ultimate expression of this difference would be to completely stop your horizontal velocity and drop like a stone to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get your landing accurate to millimeters, at the expense of a small mountain of fuel used.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"957Chatterton","CreatedById":92816,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T00:37:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone for your input!
