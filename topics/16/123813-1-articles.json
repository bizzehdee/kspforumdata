I found that if I am a far off from my target that I can burn a bit to make an elliptical orbit to get a close approach at Pe as opposed to simply time accelerating and play catch up. When I near the target I kill my speed relative to it, getting me back into a similar orbit . The downside is that obviously more fuel needed, but it\u0027s not that much really. Anybody else have any tips for efficient orbital interception?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Retread","CreatedById":89946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T21:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most fool proof method I\u0027ve found is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Match your target\u0027s orbit as closely as possible. At this stage, it doesn\u0027t matter how far out of phase the two vessels are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. At periapsis, burn prograde until you get a close intercept (which should also take place close to periapsis)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. At intercept, burn retrograde to kill relative velocity, fine tuning as necessary to acchienve rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it in terms of orbital periods. For example, both you and the target are in the same orbit, taking 1 hour for a complete circuit of Kerbin. If the target is 15 minutes behind you, you need to lengthen your orbit by 15 minutes in order to arrive at the same place at the same time next time around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your target is ahead of you, you could also decrease your orbital period by making the initial burn retrograde. However, this is not possible in most cases because you will hit the atmosphere or the ground unless the target is very close.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T21:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most efficient orbital rendezvous is to do it when you launch. You don\u0027t establish orbit till you are slowing down your relative velocity. This takes some practice, on KSC wait till your target is just leaving the desert shores area as it circles around. Make sure you set it as the target right away, then launch your craft and do a normal ascent until your Ap crosses paths. You might have to burn just a little further but the closest approach should split into two before you find it. The procedure itself isn\u0027t all that tricky, it\u0027s just guessing when to actually launch. Even if you guess wrong, you can just extend your Ap a little and find an intersect and if that doesn\u0027t work you should be pretty close and you can just use the other method. Best to guess launching early than late. If you launch late, it gets a bit more difficult to find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you approach your target, slow your relative velocity like you always do but be warned, the speed difference will be much larger than using other methods so you need to slow down a lot. This will put you into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do this with your target in any orbit but the dynamic changes if it is not equatorial because you have to wait for the planet to spin under the target\u0027s orbit and it becomes a lot harder.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-26T21:48:31Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2015 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T22:20:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlshane: Yeah, I\u0027ve got pretty good at meeting up with a vessel at launch, but there are times, like doing a multiple rescue, or meeting up from one orbit to another where things are harder to sync.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat technique is nicely displayed here if anyone wants a video version:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1v1ZLXLBMQo?start=17\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERetread: I think you said what I did, only much more coherently \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But yeah, that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been doing and it seems to work out well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T00:00:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Waxing_Kibbous\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Waxing_Kibbous\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlshane: Yeah, I\u0027ve got pretty good at meeting up with a vessel at launch, but there are times, like doing a multiple rescue, or meeting up from one orbit to another where things are harder to sync.\u003Cp\u003EThat technique is nicely displayed here if anyone wants a video version:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1v1ZLXLBMQo?start=17\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERetread: I think you said what I did, only much more coherently \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But yeah, that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been doing and it seems to work out well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, that is it.

Do a small burn to raise your Ap up, say by 50-100 m/s. Coast up to Ap, then when you\u0027re up there, lower your Pe so that it\u0027s slightly lower than the lowest remaining kerbal\u0027s orbit (if it isn\u0027t already).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

Do as many orbits as you need for the next kerbal to have a close approach.

Far more efficient to match the Kerbal\u0027s velocity to your ship than vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Repeat steps 4-5 until all the kerbals are swept up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.
