I\u0027ve tried this dozens of times releasing the parachute between heights of 2200 and 7800 going traveling between 210-270m/s. It doesn\u0027t seem to matter how far or how close to the ground I am, the parachute only decides to open at 400m, but by then it doesn\u0027t give enough time to slow me down. I\u0027ve tried entering the atmosphere at a periapsis between 46km and 35km and it doesn\u0027t seem to matter. What am I doing wrong? Is there some auto parachute open that I can adjust? Why would they set it so low?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T11:32:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you checked the tweakable in VAB to make sure you didn\u0027t accidentaly move it from 1000m to 400m?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight click the chute in VAB and set deployment altitude.

I found the default setting was 500. Increasing the parachute deployment height worked great! If anyone else is having this issue, simply right click the tip of your spaceship and increase the parachute deployment height to 650. I experimented with several different heights. You\u0027ll probably survive using 600, but you\u0027ll be hitting the ground faster than 5m/s. 650 will slow the craft down to 5m/s without leaving you waiting several minutes.
