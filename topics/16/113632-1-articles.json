Aerospike has better ISP than the 30 or 45s, and much more thrust than a 909, though yeah it\u0027s a little heavier. Rapiers are more powerful and operate at higher altitudes than any other airbreathing engine, plus you get a free rocket engine to go with them. You just need to acknowledge that they have an envelope you need to get to before they really shine."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T03:08:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E welp, after much trial and error, I managed to get a spaceplane into orbit, that video helped a lot.\n\u003E basically, I used 3x FL-T800 fuel tanks sandwiched together, 1x LT-30 rocket, 2x Whiplash turbines and 2x ram intakes.\n\u003E \n\u003E take off, 30\\* until 12km, pitched down to 20\\* to gain horizontal speed to 1000m/s until the turbines started to wane, staged the rocket engine, pitched back up to 40\\* and closed the intakes when the jets flamed out.\n\u003E \n\u003E it\u0027s a shame that the RAPIER and Aerospike engines were nerfed the way they were, i\u0027s kinda pointless to use them now.\n\nThe RAPIER is still the basis of the most mass- efficient spaceplanes.
