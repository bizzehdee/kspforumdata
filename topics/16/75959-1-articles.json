Real Solar System, FAR, DRE, Real Fuels...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s fundametally a B9 and Procedural Wings construction, using the Space Shuttle Engines mod for propulsion. It took a bit of balancing to make it aerodynamically stable with the massive load of engines at the back, but with a bit of careful juggling, extremely swept wings and carrying plenty of surplus RCS fuel in the nose I got it there in the end. Not given it payload yet, but the CoM is inside the payload bay so that should be fine. Sussed out the off-centre mass/thrust problem, got the thing into orbit, flexed the robotic arm, was feeling pretty happy with my efforts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the time came to deorbit and everything fell to peices (literally \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E). First attempt, I did what I do with capsules - drop periapsis to about 60km and follow the path down. Trouble. Deceleration was not exceeding 1g. Things started blowing up, control surfaces first and shortly afterwards the rest of the craft (heated to about 1500/1600 degrees at the time. Ok, that didn\u0027t work. Try something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I dropped to the same periapsis as normal, but this time resolved to hold the nose up at about 40 degrees as I went down. Sure enough, I got down to about 70km, lift and drag began to kick in and speed began to very very gradually bleed off. Trouble was, I started going up again! I travelled an entire half-orbit at between 70-100km altitude, but only dropped from Mach 27 to Mach 26. I then got a bit more positive about going down, and then as soon as I got below 60km the stability of my craft in this thicker air meant I could only get the nose up by about 5/10 degrees, deceleration still didn\u0027t hit 1g. Same end result as before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObvious answer seems to be that my craft is too stable and I need to bring the CoM and CoL closer together. Trouble is, I then wouldn\u0027t be able to hold the nose high at all without it flipping out altogether (as happened with a couple of prototypes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you folk get your spaceplanes out of orbit???\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T01:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to do something that bleeds energy.

But I have had a few out of fuel landings where I have had to glide a lot further then I wanted. I usually set my PE target somewhere around 15-25km over the landing site and usually my slowdown through the atmosphere brings my landing down to with in a few kilometers of the runway. When it comes to gliding it is best to have targeted to far then not enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T15:55:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do i accidently post something on the wrong thread!?!??!?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods, please delete.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-26T15:56:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2014 03:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nicholander\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI aciddently posted this on the wrong thread. *Facepalm*\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vigelius","CreatedById":109045,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-28T01:07:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, this is frustrating! I\u0027ve just spent a good few hours running and re-running different approaches, and I reckon I\u0027m going to need a complete redesign. I can get down to about 5.5km/s, then get sucked into an inevitable fiery death. Bleeding off all the fuel lets me hold the nose where I want it for maybe a minute or two more, but eventually the flaps blow up and its all over. One runthrough I was being more aggressive with manouevres and managed to get locked into a stable but completely uncontrolled belly-first descent which pulled enough g to get me down sub-mach, but then the whole thing was completely uncontrollable and came down short over the ocean anyway!
