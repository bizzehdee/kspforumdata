I always do an insertion burn at the mun anyway I never use the free return.

The free return actually costs slightly more delta V than a pure Hohmann transfer, but it\u0027s safer as you\u0027ll just get dumped back into the planet\u0027s atmosphere if your engine doesn\u0027t fire for orbital capture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DChurchill","CreatedById":60282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T20:26:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep.

It was crucial in rescuing Apollo 13 for example.

The difference between a few days and two weeks\u0027 worth of supplies is pretty significant; if you don\u0027t have to put that extra mass in orbit, it can work out to be cheaper overall despite taking more delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
