More area is just more drag. Shock cone is interesting for heating resistance though.\n\nSAS is just more mass. As long as you aren\u0027t making bombers, control surfaces and pod is plenty of authority.\n\nDesign for flight stability. 1 km/s is around the supercruise speed you can maintain for thermal balance. It takes a while to go places so you want to be able to go x4 physics warp. Canards tend to be dangerous because they encourage dynamic instability (plus they tend to be exposed to a lot of heat).\n\nYou want enough lift maintain level flight near prograde at 20\u002B km. While your jets may starve on air, getting your throttle (and thrust) down is how you maintain a good supercruise fuel economy. You need thin air to get rid of that drag.\n\nStruts are draggy. Avoid."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T12:43:29Z","Content":"A RAPIER will get you up to a higher top speed than a Whiplash, assuming you can get it through the sound barrier (usually requires higher altitude).

Those add a lot of drag.\n\nOTOH these suggestions are to optimise the high mach profile. If you actually want to land elsewhere, you need to give some concessions to subsonic performance. Mostly lift and/or control authority. Flying hot dogs also have below average maneuverability."},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T16:29:10Z","Content":"IIRC, I was able to hit ~ 1500 m/s recently with a single turbo at around 20k. Perhaps it could have gone faster - as I was ascending at a 45 degree angle the entire way. The probe core also exploded shortly thereafter, due to all the heat. I relied heavily on pre-coolers for intakes (and fuel). Entire thing was very streamlined (and very light - lacking large fuel reserves and a cockpit)."},{"CreatedByName":"YourEverydayWaffle","CreatedById":83957,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T17:15:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A RAPIER will get you up to a higher top speed than a Whiplash, assuming you can get it through the sound barrier (usually requires higher altitude).\n\nYeah... but the engine sound effect SQUAD made for them is terrible... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T21:31:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 09:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YourEverydayWaffle**"},{"CreatedByName":"antbin","CreatedById":22389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T17:20:06Z","Content":"\u003E getting your throttle (and thrust) down is how you maintain a good supercruise fuel economy. \n\nThis was true in 0.90, but I\u0027m not sure if it is true in 1.x since fuel consumption is now proportional only to thrust (isp is fixed). Max thrust (and therefore fuel consumption) goes down with high altitude. High altitude means lower drag. In my experience, rather than throttling down, you should lower thrust by just flying as high as you can at full throttle (often therefore faster)!\n\nIf you want to test your theories, why not [try them in a turbojet fuel economy / speed challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121799-1-0-2-Kerbal-Parcel-Service-Challenge-fastest-cheapest-to-KSC2-on-one-turbojet-engine%21) that is collecting dust... /plug\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T17:29:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 05:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by antbin**"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T17:42:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u003EIf you want to test your theories, why not [try them in a turbojet fuel economy / speed challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121799-1-0-2-Kerbal-Parcel-Service-Challenge-fastest-cheapest-to-KSC2-on-one-turbojet-engine%21) that is collecting dust... /plug\n\nJust checked your challenge. Why did you forbid the use of rapier engine? Rapier is much more efficient at long range flights at really high altitudes \u002B faster. Also i am really curious about why people don\u0027t like clipping? Without clipping it is really hard to build good looking planes. I say give the people freedom to build the best plane possible however they like without exploits ofc.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T17:45:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"}]}
