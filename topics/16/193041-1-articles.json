The 4k one allows lower part counts if your computer needs that, though, so you could try to swap it out. Although the 4k batteries are much wider.

You can build a new module with a load of bigger and better batteries on it, fly it out to your base and dock/Klaw it to that base, or build a new and bigger base, or possibly use a mod that lets you build parts on-site. The easiest option is probably just building a new power module and attaching that to the existing base, possibly involving brute force and duct tape\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
