When you place a maneuver node and warp to it, the warp ends like a minute or so before the node, for an example T-60 to the node. Let\u0027s say that the node is 30 seconds of burning. When is the exact moment I should start the burn?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt T-0, right in the node?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt T-15, halfway?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt T-60, after warp end?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"amarillo114","CreatedById":201235,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-28T16:11:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think t-15 (halfway to the node)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-28T16:51:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor all intents and purposes t-15 is good enough.

Whether you want half the burn to happen before the initial node you had set depends on what kind of maneuver you are doing. An interplanetary burn is different from a suicide burn. So there\u0027s a button when you are creating the maneuver. It defaults to 50% -- which means the game expects that you want to do half the burn before your node. You can set it from 0 to 100. The timestamp on the maneuver that gets stored includes that 50% burn margin already. So, to get the proper outcome you always want to burn at t=0 now -- assuming that you had the burn percentage set correctly when you set up the maneuver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-29T00:14:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nT-15, so half your burn is before and half after.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe post immediately above this one says the game can calculate exacly when to start.
