It\u0026#39;s easy to do, though: just make a copy of the KSP folder. The game locates everything relative to the directory in which the app is started, so you can have as many copies as you like (and have HDD space for).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis system also allows you to have multiple versions of the base game available. For example, I have a long-running career game (heavily modded) in 1.0.4, and a separate stock 1.0.5 installation.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"matteeeo","CreatedById":89209,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T17:33:52Z","Content":"\nI thought of that, too, unluckily this solution takes memory.

You can do that for most of the KSP folders also, so making a seperate game install isn\u0026#39;t expensive in disk space.
