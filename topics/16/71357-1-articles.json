Go to the second page for details\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve been working on a semi-NASA styled orbiter for the past few hours, and I feel it has a lot of potential. Except the fuel is not draining properly. It should be draining from a specific tank and that specific tank only, but is instead draining from two more tanks. I have repeatedly modified the fuel lines to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I know and what should be happening:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle is made of 5 stages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Orbiter: Has 6 engines with 4 fuel tanks, 2 of them centered and the other two attached to the side. 4 of the engines are attached to the center tanks, the other 2 (which are angled) are attached to the side tanks. Designed to be the final stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn external fuel tank made of 5 fuel tanks, designed to drain from the outer 2 tanks first, then the next 2, then the middle one. Designed to be the second to last stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe twin liquid fueled rocket boosters, made up of 3 fuel tanks each. Designed to be the stage decoupled before the external fuel tank stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe twin solid rocket booster stage, made up of 6 SRBs each with a small fuel tank on top. Detached before the liquid fuel boosters detach\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn extra fuel tank beneath the 5 tanks of the external fuel tank, detaches from the rocket before any of the other stages\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel is supposed to drain (as you can see in the imgur album) from the extra fuel tank and the fuel tank on the SRB stages into the top of the liquid fuel booster stage. Fuel lines then connect the lower tank of the liquid fueled rocket boosters into both the upper and lower tanks of the external fuel tank. Lines then attach the middle of the external fuel tank to wing panels of the orbiter, leading into all 3 sets of fuel tanks. The route is set up so that the ends are, no matter what, the lower fuel tank designed to detach and the fuel tanks on the SRB stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen testing, fuel begins draining from one, not both, of the upper tanks of the liquid rocket booster stage immediately following the depletion of fuel from the fuel tanks on the SRB stage (That stage has not yet detached because the SRBs are still going). It also begins draining from the lower tank of the external fuel tank stage. The detachable lower fuel tank has not been detached at this point, and fuel is still draining from it. However, fuel should be draining from only it at this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the lower tank is detached, fuel seems to flow from the liquid booster stage which has already begun to drain faster than it does from the other one, causing the shuttle to spiral out of control until detached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll fuel lines are bilaterally symetrical. This has been checked\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have one plugin installed: Kerbpaint. However, I highly doubt that a plugin modifying textures is causing the fuel lines to act weirdly. Otherwise, I am mod-free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdits from later tests:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding I-beams between the boosters and decouplers made no difference.
