Docking a payload on the ground would be quite insane, unless you use some mod like Damned Robotics which allows you to build a controlable crane. Your best bet would be to use a radial decoupler to attach the payload to the fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-18T09:30:56Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2013 09:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Crush\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T14:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could always put it on top of the rocket......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deepspacecreeper","CreatedById":84329,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T05:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehow should i upgrade the spaceplane so i have more fuel for getting into geostationary orbit and back?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
