What I mean by this is the icon of the ship in the tracking station. I managed to get it right once, I launched a \u003Cem\u003Espace station\u003C/em\u003E into orbit once and from the Tracking station (I think) I was able to change the icon to \u0022station\u0022 as opposed to satellite/probe. Now I can\u0027t remember how I did this, I must note that when I did this I had recently installed MechJeb 1.9.x or so and the NovaPunch Remix Pack, but I have since removed them and installed other mods and am currently unable to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- X\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MickG","CreatedById":62651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T10:01:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERightclick the controlmodule and select \u0027rename vessel\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T10:31:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight click on the command pod and choose rename ship, a window will come up that also lets you change the icon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Toxicterror","CreatedById":71561,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T10:18:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eand on \u0022ships\u0022 that have no command pod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Econsists out of 1 lab module, 1 small kethane scanner \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewant to change its name and the icon from \u0022ship\u0022 to \u0022debris\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T12:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShips without a command pod are inherently debris and can be neither controlled nor renamed.
