Is it?\n\nAs of 1.x, a Gigantor with 100% sun exposure in the Jool system gives you only about 0.9 EC/sec. This makes it hardly better than an RTG. Smaller solar panels hardly register as working at all. The bottom line is that if you are out beyond Duna, solar panels by themselves are incapable of providing high volume EC/sec, such as to run an ion engine at full power. Thus, you need another approach. Some options:\n\n\\* Run the ion engine at VERY low thrust, just consuming whatever pitiful amount of EC/sec the solar panels provide out there. This will result in burns of epic length, which might make a delicate rendezvous rather difficult.\n\n\\* Have enough battery to store all the power you need for the longest burn you have to do at full power and use a couple of Gigantors to SLOWLY refill the batteries at a bit less than 2 EC/sec. Then you have to hope they can do this in time for the next burn.\n\n\\* Use fuel cells to run ion engines. IIRC, this provides about 1600s Isp, considering both the xenon and the LFO consumption. Not too shabby.\n\n\\* Not use ion engines but just go with nukes."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T12:59:11Z","Content":"For a while I considered running the nuke with a very heavy thrust limit, utilizing its alternator, but it\u0027s really very inferior to fuel cells in efficiency."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T13:13:51Z","Content":"I\u0027m in the \u0022fuel cell to power twin ions\u0022 camp.\n\nSince you\u0027re in a retrograde orbit, you can\u0027t do much with gravity assists to lower your orbit... I mean sure, you can try, but it would be much easier in a prograde orbit.\n\nSo you\u0027re going to need a lot of dV. And unfortunately, some engines (like the Ant) are not going to give you that dV. I mean that literally - the engine is incapable of passing 7000 m/s even with the entire observable universe in fuel. But the Isp of the Dawn is so high that you don\u0027t have to worry about such things.\n\nAlternatively, you can have a multistage rescue vessel. But the resulting vessel will be heavier than the ion craft, and thus more difficult to transport to the Kerbal that needs to be rescued... remember, you need to reverse the orbit direction to initially rendezvous with him too!\n\nNote: if you pack some solar panels as well, you\u0027ll need to carry less liquid fuel for the fuel cell. After reversing your orbit you can leave your periapsis close to the sun, coast down there, and then lower your apoapsis to Kerbin\u0027s orbit on solar power.
