As any particular leg would have to carry the weight of the vehicle if it lands at any significant angle, three legs was the lightest configuration. However, it would be the least stable if one of the legs were damaged during landing. The next landing gear design iteration had five legs and was the most stable configuration for landing on an unknown terrain. That configuration, however, was too heavy and the designers compromised on four landing legs.[7]\n\nedit: in more detail, that\\\u0027s a somewhat heavy lander (~11.2 as shown), and the landing leg attachments aren\\\u0027t very strong.

Coming down on anything other than even terrain is going to put all the weight on relatively few legs anyway, unless you change descent angle and keep lateral velocity zero through extremely tricky RCS burns. \n\nThat said, it may behoove you to land with less fuel, thereby reducing the lander mass and therefore the force the legs have to brake against."},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T14:54:11Z","Content":"Makes me wonder though why the stock lander legs are so flimsy that they can\\\u0027t really support all but the smallest lander craft, and why they are so short that the engine is likely to impact on the surface unless touchdown speed is very low.

I might lose a leg if I came down a bit hard or on a slope, but that was rare. The difficulty was just right to keep it fun without being ridiculously hard.\n\nIn .15 with the exact same lander (ASAS \u002B FL-T500 \u002B LV909 \u002B 8 legs) I almost always seem to crash. It\\\u0027s weird, I touch down and in a fraction of a second the whole thing flips over and explodes. I tried a larger lander very similar to the one Fifflethecat posted (with more legs). It seems to help mitigate the bounce-flip-die problem, but I still lost a couple legs.\n\nI\\\u0027ve also noticed a lot of \\\u0027breaks\\\u0027 in the Mun\\\u0027s terrain tiles, but I honestly can\\\u0027t recall if that was also common in the previous version.

You landed on the Mun with the ability to return. I would call that a success.\n\nHowever, considering the size of your lander, I would recommend an extra set of legs.
