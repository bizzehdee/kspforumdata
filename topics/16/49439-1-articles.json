Some engines will generate electricity, including the lv-30. So transmit data while it is burning, and if you run out give the engine a little throttle to get enough electricity for the turn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T15:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThread moved to Gameplay Question forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a command pod, the only thing that use electricity is to transmit data.

Transmitting data will use a lot of juice, so as has already been mentioned, you want to only transmit while you have a LVT-30 running to recharge the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you decide to work with only a 909 at some point, the engine itself will give you control via the gimbal when it\u0027s running, but there\u0027s no power generation. So it\u0027s critical to minimize you\u0027re use of reaction wheels. Don\u0027t leave SAS on during coast phases, only rotate the craft for burns, turn off reaction wheels during burns so the gimbal can do all the work, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout transmitting, and careful power management, it\u0027s entirely possible to do a direct mun landing and return with just the power provided on a single Mk1 Pod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sc.avci","CreatedById":89041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T17:15:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProblem solved.
