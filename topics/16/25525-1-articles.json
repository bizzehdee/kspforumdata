But can I search the forum for \u0022Eve return\u0022? No. Of course not. Because the forum won\u0027t search for any word less than 4 letters long. If I try searching \u0022eve return\u0022 I simply get the results for \u0022return\u0022 which, as you can well imagine, aren\u0027t nearly as helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that the general consensus is that if you\u0027re planning to put Kerbals on Eve and bring them back, you land at higher altitudes. But the word is that Eve\u0027s oceans will be rich in resources so sooner or later I\u0027m going to want to put boots on the beach. I could land the return craft at higher elevations and drive down and back in a rover, but I\u0027d much rather tackle the greater challenge of a sea-level to orbit launch. Since I can\u0027t really put the search engine to any productive use on the subject, I\u0027m wondering if anyone else has done anything similar or knows of a post or video from someone who has. I\u0027m looking for any and all Eve return missions, even the ones that involve high elevation landings/launches.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T17:26:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a challenge thread for a orbit-capable Eve lander, which had tonnes of entries, and a lot of really good information and tips on how to make them.
