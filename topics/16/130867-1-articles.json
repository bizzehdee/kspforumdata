you keep it angled well above prograde.\u00A0 Not as much as it would if it had wings, but it\u0027s still quite a bit.\u00A0 This is \u0022body lift\u0022 and it is your friend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you\u0027re entering at an angle, not directly prograde, the airflow is hitting the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eside\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of your ship, which means that adding that big, light empty SRB is giving you more lift surface to work with.\u00A0 It\u0027s a net advantage to keep it if the SRB is less dense, on average, than the rest of your ship.\u00A0 Whether it\u0027s less dense or not depends on the makeup of your ship.\u00A0 An empty Hammer, for example, has a mass of 0.75 tons, which makes it less dense than a Mk1 command pod but more dense than a Mk1 crew cabin.\u00A0 So if your reentering ship has any heavy components on it (like a liquid-fuel engine, or a full fuel tank), it\u0027s likely to be a net positive, but if you\u0027ve been really rigorous at keeping the mass down and it\u0027s basically just a command pod with crew cabins, then it may be a negative.\u00A0 Depends on the ship design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway:\u00A0 Heatshield-style reentry becomes \u003Cem\u003Ede rigeur\u003C/em\u003E at very high speeds, e.g. if you\u0027re coming back from an interplanetary mission at 4 km/s or more, you pretty much have to have a heatshield.\u00A0 If you\u0027re coming back from Mun or Minmus, your velocity\u0027s around 3 km/s, and it\u0027s kinda borderline-- you can get away without a heatshield, but you\u0027re skating fairly close to the edge and need to be careful (i.e. don\u0027t set Pe too low, make sure your ship is very light and draggy).\u00A0 For LKO speeds, however (i.e. under 2500 m/s), you can do just fine without a heatshield, if you do an effective spaceplane-style reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, my standard reentry vehicle for \u0022rescue a kerbal from LKO\u0022 is basically a Mk1 command pod, a mostly-empty 2-ton LFO tank, and a Terrier.\u00A0 I enter butt-first with the Terrier but keep the ship angled to maximize body lift.\u00A0 It does just fine without a heatshield.\u00A0 Slows down wonderfully.\u00A0 I can often get down to 10 km and then actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eclimb\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E a kilometer or two before it runs out of steam and falls again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T19:01:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T\u003Cspan

KSP\u0027s problem? \u00A0Well, its default behavior in the VAB is to stick the parachute staging on the same stage as your final ship engines and decouplers. \u00A0This whole thing sounds precisely like you made a ship that goes to space (200km part test), and when you added the chutes in the VAB, they were automatically added to the same staging event as your part test. \u00A0Unbeknownst to you, they \u0022staged\u0022 or entered a armed, ready-to-deploy state. \u00A0Nothing changed externally, and you didn\u0027t notice the sound of the chutes staging because it happened at the same time as a decoupler and engine activation. \u00A0Then when re-entering at terrifying speed, the chute dumbly obeyed its default deploy threshold of 0.05atm, threw\u00A0the chute out, and was

ways to check or change it (forgive me if it sounds like I\u0027m talking down here). \u00A0One - the staging of the parachute (the chute icon on the right side of the screen in the VAB, or the left

them, move whole stages up and down\u00A0- give it a try. \u00A0Second, you can right-click the chute in space and change it to 0.50 and see what happens. \u00A0Third, since the recent 1.0.5 update, when you right-click on chutes that have been accidentally deployed, there will be a button called \u0022disarm chute\u0022 - that will un-stage it and make it ready to deploy again at the appropriate
