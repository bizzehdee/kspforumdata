To finally go interplanetary in a completely legitimate manner (It will have enough delta v to go anywhere. Even now with as big as the rocket is, the three main stages are still reading at over 2.0 TWR). And naturally, my first destination is Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I ask the community for any good tips for the task. Having never really gone interplanetary (or even landed on anything farther out than Minmus) I don\u0027t quite know what to expect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T04:07:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a good tip: look around the Gameplay Questions and Tutorials sub-forums, which this thread now occupies. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"doggie015","CreatedById":51752,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T04:25:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEm5nyZU3a-O2ak6mBYXWPAL\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E should help\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T15:58:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Go back to the VAB and rebuild it with a lower TWR. While it\u0027s good to have \u0027around\u0027 2 averaged over the stage\u0027s lifetime a start TWR of 2 likely means 4 or 5 by the time it burns out - possibly enough to tear the ship apart and certainly enough to give you trouble with \u0027fine\u0027 manoeuvres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Make landers - if you have them - as light as possible and, for Duna, use parachutes on the descent. Duna\u0027s atmosphere is low and thin so set the parachutes to deploy high, giving them more time to slow you down. You will probably still need to use some engine-power, but much less than without.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) A Kerbal on EVA can repack parachutes once near them (right-click on a previously-deployed parachute). Staging does \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Enot\u003C/span\u003E re-deploy such chutes, so set an action group to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Even more deltaV is always better, but means you need to burn more fuel just lugging it around. Use a deltaV map to verify that you really can go where you intend (and back, if you care about your Kerbals).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Make use of aerobraking if you want to conserve deltaV. It may take several orbits, dipping into the atmosphere each time, to bring your apoapsis down where you want it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) If you\u0027re going far out in the system, such as Eeloo, consider that solar panels are less effective that far from the sun. Conversely, for the inner system, you may not need so many.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Moons have a habit of getting in the way of an encounter with their primary. Ike is particularly infamous for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Apart from the extra time it takes interplanetary is no harder to control than going to Mun or, particularly, Minmus. It\u0027s all about matching planes, matching apoapsis (or periapsis) and circularising to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) I use action groups to toggle engines on/off. Turning them off during the l-o-n-g cruise periods means I can\u0027t screw everything up by pressing shift at the wrong time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...which is all I can think of off the top of my head.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RW-1","CreatedById":107278,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T19:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKnowing #1, cannot one just throttle down in the later stages of atmospheric escape?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMust ...
