Is there any way to get it back? I have since done a lot of things and it has not come back, I think it\u0027s locking me out of other tourist missions too.\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T20:00:06Z","Content":"You may need to wait or try declining other missions, but your reputation level affects what contracts you get as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Securus","CreatedById":77088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T14:18:37Z","Content":"Yeah, I\u0027ve waited for quite a while. Even tried the cheat menu to regenerate that particular quest but I can\u0027t get it to come back. Pretty disappointing since it was so early on in the game (career) and worth a nice amount of cash."}]}
