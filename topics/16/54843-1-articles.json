Basically, spaceflight is all about velocity because velocity is what determines which orbit you\u0027re in, or whether you\u0027re in an orbit at all. Spaceflight boils down simply to moving from 1 orbit to another, which is accomplished by changing velocity. Because each orbit has a particular velocity associated with it, you know how much you need to change your velocity (which as Vexx explained is what \u0022delta-V\u0022 means) to move to any given orbit. So, the amount of delta-V in a ship is a good way to measure where it can go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most amazing things about KSP is that it provides no way in-game to calculate a ship\u0027s delta-V, despite this being essential information. Thus, you need to get a mod like Kerbal Engineer Redux or Mechjeb that can do this calculation during ship construction. Or you can do the math to calculate it yourself on paper, although this is a real pain. But without knowing how much delta-V you have, you have no idea whether or not your ship will actually reach Kerbin orbit, much less go anywhere else or come back (there are 3rd-party charts showing how much it takes to get somewhere).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T01:42:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you want an answer to the question \u0022how much \u003Cstrong\u003Efuel\u003C/strong\u003E do I need to get from the surface of Kerbin to the surface of the Mun\u0022, then the answer is: it depends on the composition of the rocket (the heavier the payload the more fuel you need).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever to make this answer independent of the rocket, then Delta-V is your friend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will ask: \u0022how much \u003Cstrong\u003EDelta-V\u003C/strong\u003E do I need to get from the surface of Kerbin to the surface of the Mun\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the answer is: about 6260 m/s according to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_Sheet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_Sheet\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Plan to have some reserve on board) (there are also \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25360-Delta-V-map\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esome\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1iw30a/a_more_accurate_deltav_map/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eother\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20993-Request-Delta-V-maps?highlight=delta\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EdV-Maps\u003C/a\u003E available)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock KSP does not display the dV of your rocket, but there are some AddOns like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/a\u003E that display it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-01T13:33:30Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2013 01:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by mhoram\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T04:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like I\u0027m a little late to the party today, but all of the above users have posted some very good answers, so there isn\u0027t much I can add. Still, might as well go ahead and throw in a little more info:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA rocket works essentially by exploiting Newton\u0027s Third Law of Motion: \u0022Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.\u0022 To move a rocket, you have to shoot propellant out the other end. The propellant accelerates in one direction with a certain amount of energy; as a reaction, the rocket is pushed with an equivalent amount of energy in the opposite direction. However, because the rocket is shedding large amounts of mass, the effect of this energy per unit of propellant expended on the rocket\u0027s velocity (i.e. its speed in a given direction) isn\u0027t constant, because the mass this energy is acting on is changing as the rocket\u0027s propellant burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver a century ago, a smart man by the name of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky came up with a formula by which you can calculate the amount of change in velocity using a measure of engine efficiency known as \u003Cem\u003Eexhaust velocity\u003C/em\u003E, as well as the ratio of the rocket\u0027s full mass to final, dry mass. Essentially, what all the math boils down to is this: To increase the delta-v of a given rocket, you want either a lighter dry mass (which can be accomplished by either adding more fuel or subtracting mass from the payload) or a more efficient engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want more detail than that, I\u0027d highly recommend you read \u003Ca href=\u0022http://mykspcareer.com/2013/07/delta-v/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis article\u003C/a\u003E at MyKSPCareer.com, as well as \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/mission.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethese\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/engines.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethree\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/multistage.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epages\u003C/a\u003E on the Atomic Rockets site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T04:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematically, delta-V is calculated with the Rocket Equation Specialist290 mentioned - it takes the form:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelta-V = ln(M/M\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E)* I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E *g\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere delta-V is the change in velocity (a vector that\u0027s a dot-product of the scalar component of \u003Cstrong\u003Espeed\u003C/strong\u003E with the vector component of \u003Cstrong\u003Edirection\u003C/strong\u003E), ln is the natural logarithm function (look for it on a scientific calculator, or use =LN() in MS Excel), M is the full mass of the rocket stage, M\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E is the \u003Cstrong\u003Edry mass\u003C/strong\u003E of the rocket stage (i.e. what it weighs when all its fuel tanks are empty), g\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E is standard gravity (9.81 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eregardless of what body you\u0027re orbiting/launching from\u003C/em\u003E) and I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E is the \u003Cstrong\u003Especific impulse\u003C/strong\u003E of the engine (a way of measuring the engine\u0027s efficiency).

It is physically impossible to not move in space. Everything always moves. Therefore it makes no sense to talk about going from one place to another in terms of distance - it just keeps changing constantly. You cannot measure it in terms of time either, because if the distance keeps changing, the time required to travel that distance changes along with it. This of course begs the question: how do you describe going from one place to another then?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink about it logically. If everything is always moving, then the only way to \u003Cem\u003Estay\u003C/em\u003E at a certain place is to also \u003Cem\u003Emove\u003C/em\u003E in exactly the same manner (the same speed in the same direction) as that place.\u00A0But that only works if you are already where you want to stay. If you are physically elsewhere, you first need to \u003Cem\u003Echange your velocity\u003C/em\u003E so that you cross paths with the place where you want to be. Then, once your paths cross,\u00A0you need to again change your velocity to make it match the velocity of the place where you want to stay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the way you measure going from one place to another in space is simple: measuring the effort\u00A0of changing your velocity to cross paths with your target, plus the effort of then changing your velocity to then match that of the target. As long as you can do these two things, it literally does not matter how far away your destination is or how long it takes you to get there.

That\u0027s why we talk about \u0022velocity\u0022, which is the combination of a speed and a direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing you need to understand is that in space, there is no such thing as not moving. It is physically impossible to not move in space. Everything always moves. Therefore it makes no sense to talk about going from one place to another in terms of distance - it just keeps changing constantly. You cannot measure it in terms of time either, because if the distance keeps changing, the time required to travel that distance changes along with it. This of course begs the question: how do you describe going from one place to another then?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink about it logically. If everything is always moving, then the only way to \u003Cem\u003Estay\u003C/em\u003E at a certain place is to also \u003Cem\u003Emove\u003C/em\u003E in exactly the same manner (the same speed in the same direction) as that place.\u00A0But that only works if you are already where you want to stay. If you are physically elsewhere, you first need to \u003Cem\u003Echange your velocity\u003C/em\u003E so that you cross paths with the place where you want to be. Then, once your paths cross,\u00A0you need to again change your velocity to make it match the velocity of the place where you want to stay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the way you measure going from one place to another in space is simple: measuring the effort\u00A0of changing your velocity to cross paths with your target, plus the effort of then changing your velocity to then match that of the target. As long as you can do these two things, it literally does not matter how far away your destination is or how long it takes you to get there. You will be able to reach it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why everyone talks about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe measure of your ability to change your velocity.
