But I am failing every time, and I\u0027m not sure why: if I add additional fuel tanks, I can barely lift the plane. If I then enlarge the wings, I can rise to a certain height, but with the second phase (i.e. non-air breathing engine) my ship seems to heavy to get enough thrust in the outer atmosphere, i.e. my fuel runs out before I can achieve a stable orbit. Adding a second engine would make the ship even bigger - up to a point where it breaks while accelerating on the runway for unknown reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, can anyone give me a few hints how to basically build a space plane that can actually achieve something useful?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-31T10:34:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2013 10:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Monger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T12:18:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are some counter-intuitive rules of thumb for building effective spaceplanes, but once you learn them getting a plane into orbit is rather easy. I\u0027ll try to lay them out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) When considering the jet engines, thrust is your enemy, not your friend. The reason for this is that the max speed obtainable by your jet engines is almost strictly determined by their operational ceiling, which is determined by the ratio of intakes to engines. Adding more engines doesn\u0027t help, since you have to just add that many more intakes to feed them. You always want to shoot for the fewest amount of engines necessary to do the job. (The hardest stage of a spaceplanes ascent is the climb from 10km to 15km altitude. Add engines until you can manage that climb, then stop adding engines and start adding intakes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Corollary to 1), carry only the jet fuel that you need. One of the easiest ways for your design to fail is for you to accidentally add too much jet fuel. Any fuel unspent during your climb is dead weight in orbit and will limit your operational range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) In contrast to jet fuel, you want to carry as much rocket fuel as you can lift. Every extra unit increases your operational range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) You should not need much in the way of rocket engines to finish off your orbit. A proper ascent trajectory has you level out near the operational ceiling of your turbojets so you have time to accelerate as much as possible before you ignite the rockets. Done right, the ascent on jets should put you at near-orbital velocity, and you should not need much thrust at all to circularize. It is entirely possibly to design a spaceplane capable of orbit using only turbojets and ion engines, although I typically use nukes because I can\u0027t stand 15 minute long burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Use only the ram intakes. Everything else is added drag for paltry intake air. The radials might seem like they add a lot, but once you are at altitude they are far less effective than the ram intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) If you still can\u0027t make it work, try building a spaceplane using aerospikes first. It\u0027s quite possible to build an SSTO spaceplane without using jets at all (although you won\u0027t have much in the way of payload); one aerospike, about six of the long 1m tanks, and enough wing surface to get you airborne should suffice for a one-man pod. Once you know what it takes to make orbit without jet engines, you can start adding jets to the design. You\u0027ll be amazed at how much easier it is to make orbit, and how much extra fuel you have left.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T12:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJudging from my admittedly limited experience, it is quite simple\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- use turbojets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- spam ram intakes. 7 per engine will allow you to gain orbital velocity just on jets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- don\u0027t forget to throttle down to avoid flameout.

It does, however, punish you for mistakes, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, having Mechjeb is a huge benefit, if only for information. The surface and orbital information tabs help planning maneuvers, timing burns, and flying a \u0027clean\u0027 ascent. The TWR info in the hangar will keep you from over-designing the bird. The \u0027Utilities\u0027 tab is nice as the \u0027Prevent Flame-out\u0027 will automatically manage the throttle to keep you from having a flame out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Fuel balancer is also crucial - as your CG will move as fuel burns. Because the forward tanks burn first your CG will move aft if not balanced... this can be a very bad thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, having some parts mods will help just to build bigger planes. Taverio\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Pizza and Aerospace v1.4.1 has bigger landing gear, which make takeoff much easier (tailstrikes suck). Its also got some extra wing parts making it easier to get more lift w/o having huge wobbly wings made of lots of parts. B9 Aerospace has a ton of great spaceplane parts too. Having the different part sizes (mostly fuel tanks) helps get the right fuel/oxidizer ratio - as a good spaceplane needs extra jet fuel compared to oxidizer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for the design. As others said for stock parts Ram intakes are best. If you get Taverio\u0027s or B9 then their \u0027spike style\u0027 intakes work equally well. I generally go for a jet-only TWR around 1.5, any more and you\u0027ve got too much thrust (and thus \u0027dead weight\u0027), less and you will be have trouble at altitude/speed when the thrust starts to fall off. I\u0027ve found the rockets being at 1.5 at \u0027launch\u0027 works well for me to reach orbit from max jet altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor fuel/ox ratio, remember the rocket fuel tanks are \u0027balanced\u0027 while the fuel tanks are just fuel. I\u0027ve found 4 parts rocket fuel tanks to 1 part jet fuel tanks works about right, but usually I fly at 3-1 because of tank selection. This also provides me extra jet fuel for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther things to remember in the design - center of lift (COL) needs to be near, but behind the center of mass (COM). Remember that as fuel burns off the COM will move, even with the fuel balancer. I try to make sure I have equal fuel fore and aft of the COM so that, when balanced, the COM doesn\u0027t move much. If the COL is ahead of the COM the plane will be unstable. If the COL is too far back, however, you won\u0027t have sufficient pitch authority - so its all about finding a good balance. Also, if possible have an odd number of jet engines and place the center one last. The last engine placed is the first to flame out... and a center engine flameout won\u0027t put you in a flat spin. Finally, don\u0027t forget RCS, you may need it to maneuver once in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you leave the design, make sure you assign action groups. I typically put Rocket toggle on \u00270,\u0027 Jet and Intake toggle on \u00279.\u0027 Closing the intakes cuts your drag, so its worth doing once you switch to rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, from a flight perspective, the key is patience above about 15Km. MechJeb\u0027s surface tab provides rate of climb info (so does the GUI, but its on a log scale and small). The key is to climb slow enough that you gain speed and altitude together as air intake rate is speed and altitude dependent. I\u0027ve found 50m/s or less vertical works fairly well. Gain altitude too quickly and you won\u0027t have sufficient airspeed to drive the air intakes, flameout, and have to try again (if you don\u0027t get thrown into a spin). You can squeeze more from the engines IF you throttle down (or use mechjeb auto-throttle) to keep gaining speed at altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne you\u0027ve squeezed the jets for everything, its time to engage the rockets and climb again. MechJeb\u0027s orbital information tab is useful here - when both your apoapsis and periapsis stop growing you\u0027ve maxed out... this doesn\u0027t necessarily happen when you stop accelerating. There\u0027s a small window where the added speed gained by the rockets will provide extra air for the jets - but be prepared to shut them down quickly. Once on rockets there is no need be in the atmosphere so pitch up some to get out of the air and drag. I typically go to about 30 deg nose-high. Downrange speed raises your orbit (apoapsis and periapsis), while vertical speed only really gets you out of the atmosphere. Climb to steep and you will need a longer burn to circularize. Burn until your apoapsis is high enough - 75Km to 80Km works nicely. Then kill the throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor drag minimization, pitch back down so you are nose-on your velocity vector. You may need to tap the throttle to maintain apoapsis as drag will slow you down. Once you clear the atmosphere, setup a maneuver node at apoapsis and raise periapsis accordingly. I like 75Km to 80km because it give me time between clearing the atmosphere and hitting apoapsis to get everything lined up. If you gained enough speed down low, it shouldn\u0027t take a huge amount of delta-V to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T22:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Monger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Monger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- How do I spam ram intakes?
