If the intake provides 2 units of air, surely that number must correspond with the volume of air while the craft sits still.

Look, the deal is that the\u00A0devs are trying to make your life hard, all right? They build these parts so that they always have limitations that you have to deal with, and engineer around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first basic point about \u0022air\u0022 is that engines and intakes are always throttled at all points in their airspeed/thrust curves. The maximum amount of air that an engine needs is based on its maximum thrust -- which can never actually be achieved, because the engine is always limited by its thrust curves (so it\u0027s a worthless number). Additionally, you always have to keep in mind that at most one air intake can ever be assigned to a single engine at any one time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt zero speed, an engine/intake combo is almost always throttled by the intake air requirement. So the important number at a standstill is the effective\u00A0intake speed -- which corresponds to \u0022how good is the turbofan at sucking in air from the surroundings when standing still\u0022. If you plan to do a lot of low-speed taxiing, pay attention to this number. If you have an intake that\u0027s got a bad intake speed, then you need to keep your throttle low while taxiing, or you will flame out. This can be problematic if you are driving around the countryside, and trying to go up hills with jet power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn flight at low altitude, you have so much air getting crammed into your intake that it will always provide more air than any engine will need (because the engines are\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0limited by their thrust curves). So you don\u0027t have to sweat it in this case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt high altitudes\u00A0you have to fly fast. At high speeds the various air intakes choke, and the engines also choke because of their respective airspeed/thrust curves. Each of them chokes in different ways and at different speeds -- except for the shock cone intake, which never chokes. In some rare intake/engine combos the intake will choke first. But usually it\u0027s the engine that flames out while the intake can still provide enough. All you need to do at high speed is open the context menu of the engine and see if the \u0022Prop. Requirement\u0022 is 100% or not. If it\u0027s not, then the engine is being limited by the intake. Then you have to decide if you are already flying fast enough to suit your tastes, and whether you actually care about going a few m/s faster. None of the numbers that you see in the part menu in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E tell you what the performance curves of the intakes/engines look like. You either have to look them up here online, or you have to learn by doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoliath engines are thrust-limited so they can\u0027t go faster than mach 1. Rapiers go really fast. And each of the engines has a sort-of-matching air intake that can provide enough air through that engine\u0027s flight envelope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when it comes to \u0022air\u0022 and the stats you see on the air intakes, the \u0022effective base speed\u0022/\u0022effective air speed\u0022 is the only number that gives you any immediate useful feedback. On the engine, look at the Prop Requirement. If you want to know about high speed intake performance, do a search here for some of the graphs that other players have created.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"weregamer","CreatedById":168738,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-05T03:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you so much, that clarifies pretty much all the stuff that had me confused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223462334\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178719\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221538691811\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, you always have to keep in mind that at most one air intake can ever be assigned to a single engine at any one time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollow-up: Is this assignment dynamic or static?
