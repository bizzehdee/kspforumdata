I\u0027ve tried putting more RCS thrusters near the top. I\u0027ve even put small actual thrusters near the top. I\u0027ve stabilized the thing with girders and struts, so it doesn\u0027t wobble.

If so, adjust the ship to bring the center of mass below the half way mark of the ship. Also, try some winglets. I\u0027m sure COM is your problem though.

Imagine trying to parachute down from a plane, but with the (rigid) parachute out below you. You want to keep your attitude as close to the prograde vector as possible until you get out of the atmosphere, no more than 5 degrees maximum, and even that is pushing it at significant speeds. Control surfaces as low or high as possible will help a little as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively you can try to place your payload in between two lifter stacks instead of on top. I typically don\u0027t like to do this as I use subassembly and FAR, which means I can re-use realistic rockets without re-designing the lifter stage every time, but if the payload is large enough you save a lot more time building a custom lifter stage than trying to fly perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T00:22:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve successfully launched it.
