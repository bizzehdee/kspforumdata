This time, I\u0027m needing to build a ship that lands on a cargo bay so I can drive a rover in and out, so the engines are in nacelles. I want to feed liquid fuel from tanks in the core to the external tanks/engines (and from the ore processors to the central tanks), but a quick burn test tells me that fuel is not transferring from the center to the nacelles. (I have NO IDEA how I\u0027m going to test getting fuel from the processor to the tank without actually doing the launch.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI _can_ open the tanks, individually, and manually pump fuel around, but that\u0027s not going to be convenient when I\u0027m mid-flight.

This doesn\u0027t make sense to me, as the fuel line priority is usually the other way around. The tank at the starting point of the fuel line is drained first. For example, in asparagus staging, you run your lines from the first tower to decouple to the second tower, to the third, to the last. The first tower to decouple is drained first, since it\u0027s at the source end of the fuel lines.
