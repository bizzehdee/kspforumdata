The first two are with the boosters throttled to 80% and the third is at 100% as you can see from the 3 crash logs nothing is happening as far as the game is concerned as there is always a different first impact. It also seems that speed and altitude have nothing to do with it as it\u0027ll happen at different speeds or altitudes and it will arbitrarily separate 1 to 8 of the outer boosters. It does seem to be some kind of physics issue though as when the boosters are cranked up it consistently happens faster. While the boosters are close together none of them clip each other and I don\u0027t see any slop in the parts.

Even just a smaller booster or Rockomax fuel tanks had success. So I\u0027d say the issue here is don\u0027t direct attach thoroughbred -\u0026gt; thoroughbred or I would assume the clydesdales as someone else had mentioned I didn\u0027t do much testing with them however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-14T15:25:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may need to enable advanced tweakables for this: \u00A0In the right-click part action window activate \u2018Rigid Attachment\u2019. \u00A0 That feature has helped me with the large boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs others have mentioned, I suspect the force those large boosters generate is on the edge of the force at which the game releases parts. \u00A0Even a slight amount of oscillation or flexing causes problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother suggestion is look at\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewhere\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0you are using struts. \u00A0The base attach point for boosters seems to be at or near the middle- so any struts I add are at the top and bottom, to keep the booster from wobbling in/outward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also suggest trying hardpoints for mounting. \u00A0Honestly, with ships that large and those large boosters the game just plain acts unpredictably. \u00A0 What works for one ship might not work for the next, so keep trying different approaches until something works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-14T22:50:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223940202\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200994\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221615727564\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022187982\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00224x4cheesecake\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, 4x4cheesecake said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to disagree though.
