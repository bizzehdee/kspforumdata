In real life, mass results in gravity, but in the game that is not so. It\u0027s just a part (Curiously named potatoroid, if I remember correctly) and is pretty much treated as debris once in space"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T20:12:19Z","Content":"What others have said is true. There\u0027s also the fact that even if asteroids in KSP had gravity, it\u0027d be so negligible that it wouldn\u0027t be worth simulating. Take the case of a class E asteroid; they max out at a mass of about 3800 tonnes (3.8\\*10^6 kg) and are about 30 meters across. Surface gravity can be derived from Newton\u0027s Law of Gravitation, which states g = GM/r^2, where G is the gravitational constant of the universe, M is the mass and r is the radius (we\u0027ll treat the rock as a sphere even though it\u0027s procedurally generated and never perfectly spherical). 30 meters across means a radius of roughly 15 meters. Given those values, the surface gravity - and mind you, this is for the largest rock that KSP generates - is:\n\ng = GM/r^2 = (6.67\\*10^-11 \\* 3.8\\*10^6) / 15^2 = .000001126\n\nWhich is about 1/43,500 the surface gravity of Gilly, if I\u0027ve done the math right."},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T20:18:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E .....because the asteroids are just big, ugly parts that aren\u0027t accessible in VAB or SPH that spawn randomly around Kerbin.\n\nYou could edit the asteroid config to make it appear in the editor."},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T20:29:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You could edit the asteroid config to make it appear in the editor.\n\nWhen the editor first loads, I see a moment or two with a jumble of parts in the sidebar; pretty sure an asteroid is there."},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T20:41:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E When the editor first loads, I see a moment or two with a jumble of parts in the sidebar; pretty sure an asteroid is there.\n\nYou can make it appear permanently."},{"CreatedByName":"Lhathron the Elf","CreatedById":118706,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T20:42:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You could edit the asteroid config to make it appear in the editor.\n\nThis.
