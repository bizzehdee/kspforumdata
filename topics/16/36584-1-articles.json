This -particularly- helps with small rovers because they have such a tight turning radius, and very little mass. Thus, when you try to turn, your CoM is too light to prevent the flip-over. By disabling steering in the rear wheels, it makes the turning radius much bigger.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T20:16:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBehold, my newest, craziest, smallest ( only 4 parts), and surprisingly stable creation ( you have to operate rover fwd/back and rot controls separately to keep it under control, but it is surprisingly easy to learn and to do, and the rover can turn itself back straight from any position), so, if you want to make a \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ereally really small\u003C/span\u003E rover, you can use this and you never have to worry about capsizing :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LWy9ZLq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LWy9ZLq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-11T20:24:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2013 08:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MBobrik\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T20:23:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MBobrik\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MBobrik\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESmall stable rovers ? simple. avoid useless stuff like RoveMate or RoveMax 1 2 wheels and build your rover with TR-2L around a single SAS like this\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor nuclear\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will actually save weight because SAS weights a lot less than RoveMate and improves stability to the point where you can safely intentionally drive on two wheels over long distance if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, those wheels are bugged.
