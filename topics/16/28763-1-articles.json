Here\u0027s a quick and dirty procedure, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Hit F5 to quicksave. You are going to screw it up the first few times; that can\u0027t be helped (took me eight tries before I finally got it right). After Jeb dies in a big fiery ball or is stranded, hold down F9 and try again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Use your nav markers to pick a good landing spot. Ideally you want someplace flat. The center of a crater works well in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Make the de-orbit burn when you come up on the marker like any other maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If you can, switch to IVA (C-key) and find the radar altimeter. It\u0027s the gauge that looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.navfltsm.addr.com/collins-ra.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022collins-ra.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept yours will be in meters, not feet. You can\u0027t do this in the Mun 1 tutorial, unfortunately; do like the Apollo guys did and pick a landing spot just after sunrise or just before sunset so you can spot shadows on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Switch over to the staging view (C-key to leave IVA). Accelerate time until your altitude is 8000 above base level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Aim your ship retrograde (the marker that looks like the Mercedes logo, not the one that kinda resembles an airplane). Lower your gear (G-key)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Make sure your speedometer is set for \u0022Surface\u0022. If it still says \u0022Orbit\u0022, click on it until \u0022Surface comes up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Begin a full burn and watch your speed. When it gets to 100 m/s, reduce to 2/3 thrust. When it goes below 50 m/s, reduce to 1/3 thrust. Follow the retrograde marker as it edges towards the vertical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8A) While you\u0027re doing this, you want to switch back and forth to IVA to check the radar altimeter. Start this at 5000m and check it every 500 meters or so until the needle starts moving. At that point, you should have an idea of where the deck is and aim to be below 12 m/s when you get to the estimated altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) When you get below 10 m/s, kill your burn. Ideally, the retrograde marker will indicate you\u0027re vertical at that point (smack in the center of the blue side of the eight ball - like you are when you go to launch from Kerbin). You\u0027ll start picking up speed again. Give it some low thrust - one or two notches at most. You\u0027re just trying to control your descent speed at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Caveat: If you get to this point and the altimeter needle still isn\u0027t twitching, don\u0027t bother; stay at IVA until it starts to move before you worry about your speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10). When you get within 500 meters of the deck, make sure your speed is not above 10 m/s. Ideally you want it around 5 or so but you can still land safely at 10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11). As soon as you hit the deck, kill your burn. You might bounce; that\u0027s fine as long as you don\u0027t tip over. A squat lander with a wide base helps minimize this; tall landers can use RCS to upright themselves if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12). You\u0027re there. Engage any ladders if necessary, have Jeb hop out (hover over his picture and click \u0022EVA\u0022), walk him around, have him say a few words about \u0022small steps for Neil, but a long one for me\u0022, and whatever else you feel like doing. You\u0027ve only got the demo, so you can\u0027t go about planting flags unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA key thing is to make sure you don\u0027t burn up too much fuel in the descent. Watch your resources while you\u0027re doing this. If your fuel level gets below 90, you want to consider aborting; below 80, you need to hit space, below 70 and you might as well land since Jeb\u0027s not making it back in any event...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a novice way of doing it; folks will tell you a \u0022suicide burn\u0022 is more efficient and they\u0027re right. Problem is when you\u0027re doing it vanilla and its your first rodeo, you more often than not get to experience firsthand the effects of lithobraking. Just practice, practice, practice and you\u0027ll get it right eventually. Once you\u0027ve made your first successful landing, then you can try fancier maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rowns","CreatedById":66524,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T14:08:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi all,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thank you all very much, i was just going to write a new Thread about how it was going, and stuff like that.i will post a link to it later this day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreetings a very happy me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rowns","CreatedById":66524,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T14:22:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is it: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/31291-How-it-looks-right-now?p=385505#post385505\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/31291-How-it-looks-right-now?p=385505#post385505\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
