Mods I have are FAR, Aviation Lights and Kethane and yes I love FAR. Unfortunately I am unable to post pics. The general issue appears to be weight however regardless of where I position wings on more complex crafts where CoM has either moved up or down slightly the wings are promptly removed upon take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a summary of what I have attempted:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoM and CoL on same level with CoL a touch forward or back and even smack on CoM - no success\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoM with CoL below and no success\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoM with CoL above with no success\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso attempted with overkill on wing design in which ridiculous amount of lift with no success\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if people could share their thoughts and experiences on why wings would be pulled from a craft upon take off would be most great as I would rather understand than be told how to fix a particular craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have searched through the tutorials and searched the forums endlessly (spent about 3 days searching in total) looking for more information or similar experiences to no avail and I have only come across this issue more frequently while using FAR on complex crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-30T15:34:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2013 03:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RTK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luckyhendrix","CreatedById":78280,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T10:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esimple suggestion : not enough struts ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thescientist","CreatedById":69046,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T16:23:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith FAR make an aircraft is 10 time harder, however, have you tried to increase the wing area? Without a decent one you can\u0027t take off. Another thing, Each plane CoL-CoM position must be fixd with some test, because FAR change a little the flight behavoir of each plane basing on real world physic\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T16:56:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn FAR, you dont need a great deal of wing surface area to achieve as much lift. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find you will need to strut them, I usually strut from front to back on top and bottom, then from the center of the wing to the main body of the aircraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERarely now to my wings get larger than 3 panels out from the aircraft. But I also find that if you use \u0022fine\u0022 controls you can reduce your G force loads on your wings when taking off and turning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best place to have the COL is just behind the COM, or right through the rear of the COM ball, with the COL arrow pointing straight up. You can also have the COL just to the front with the arrow pointing through the back of the COM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso use flaps they are helpful on take off and landing if you have wings that are designed for high speeds, in otherwords the center of lift arrow points towards the rear of the aircraft at a 45deg angle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RTK","CreatedById":77305,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T23:35:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the input all I have decided that I will return to vanilla and do some further comparisons between vanilla and FAR as I believe something quirky is going on with the CoM and CoL indicators within the SPH and it is possible the various upgrades to the mods may have caused some inadvertent bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll suggested above have been carried out and it is correct FAR requires much less surface area of wings to generate lift however I could only place 1 wing piece anything further would tear off, leading me to thing it is a conflict/bug of some type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill update this post again in a few hours time after reverting back to vanilla and only using FAR \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E hopefully will be able to shed light. May re-build an earlier designed 3 man SSTO craft using vanilla stock while I have the chance as flying it was a treat and not to mention the ease to glide back down to Kerbin from orbit and land at KSC so some may be interested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again all, will update again soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T02:21:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only issue I have found with the game glitch on the COL and COM, is sometimes the COL and COM will not be correct until you reload the craft.

Also what appears to be a massive failure can be easily resolved with one or two parts, just have to be right ones at the right places. FAR does make the craft more sensitive/realistic during flight and making planes with it is much easier for me alas spent 3/4s of the day mucking about without FAR and actually found myself installing promptly after about 4 hours of failure using vanilla KSP....lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers again for the thoughts and inputs all,\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
