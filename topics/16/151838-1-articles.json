Having got enough building upgrades \u0026amp; unlocked the necessary tech i\u0027m trying to make a 3-probe KSO commnet cluster. I launched all 3 probes on the same rocket \u0026amp; deployed them using the 4 hour orbital period method to space them evenly. Now when I come to drop my 3rd probe it\u0027s always out of range of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (extra ground relays disabled). I thougt this would be fine as the other 2 probes would provide a link but this isn\u0027t happening?!\u00A0They also aren\u0027t providing a relay for a probe I have orbiting the Mun equipped with a Communotron 16.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm using the HG-5 antenna which I believe is a relay antenna \u0026amp; the probes all have sufficient battery power keep going in Kerbins shadow. The Mun probe can reach the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E just fine on it\u0027s own but it doesn\u0027t even try to connect to my relays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thought on where i\u0027m going wrong as I can\u0027t see it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-11T00:01:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are probably not fully grokking\u00A0the antenna range calculation. Sqrt (range1 * range2) -- means that the range between two HG-5s is 5Mm. The range between an HG-5 and a single Comm16 is a little over 2Mm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Tracking Station has an\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0powerful antenna for picking up weak signals, so thinking an HG-5 will perform similarly to the Tracking Station is not right.
