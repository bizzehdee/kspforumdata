Basically, there are certain parts across which fuel will not flow, such as decouplers. If you have such a part between the majority of your fuel tanks and the engine, then the engine will not \u0022see\u0022 those fuel tanks as valid sources of fuel. It will run out, even though you are still carrying plenty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour design looks very compact and heavily featuring surface-attached parts, which is why I cannot easily see from the image whether or not you have a crossfeed problem. You should be able to check this yourself in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Should you discover a crossfeed problem, worry not, all is not lost: many crossfeed-blocking parts, like decouplers, give you the option to enable crossfeed in the rightclick menu. It\u0027s just turned off by default so that engines don\u0027t steal from fuel tanks in other stages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
