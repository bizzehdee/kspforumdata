Then you need to account for gravitational and atmospheric drag, which would involve integration and factoring in the flight path. For a landing you could simply calculate the delta requirement for the relevant transfer and then calculate what the orbital velocity at that radius would be and add that much delta v to account for zeroing out landing velocity, which again for an airless body shouldn\u0027t be too far off. The requirement is much less if there\u0027s an atmosphere involved, to the point where you need hardly any fuel really with the current aerodynamics model.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-02T17:14:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2013 05:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Decho\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eslightly misread OP\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T18:40:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are a couple of websites with at least some of the information you\u0027ll need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWinchell Chung\u0027s Atomic Rockets website\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERobert Braeunig\u0027s Rocket and Space Technology website\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth of them contain lots of useful information.
