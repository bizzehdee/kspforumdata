Everything is going fine, but i can\u0027t properly reenter the kerbin without melting, or without few aerobraking passes. My Mk1-2 pod has a little rcs fuel, it has no reaction wheels, so my descent control are very very limited. I would like to do the reentry on a one pass. How to reenter without a ton of RCS fuel or reaction wheels? It\u0027s downright impossible, i can\u0027t even manipulate CoM and CoL by rolling \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T19:44:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s your periapsis when you first enter the atmosphere?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T19:49:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience you need several passes, and even that is no guarantee of success. Don\u0027t panic if you run out of water/food in the process, what\u0027s important is that you have enough oxygen and electricity, your astronauts can handle some thirst/hunger. Initial pass should have a periapsis slightly below 55 km. It should be possible without RCS/reaction wheels, as aerodynamic forces should make your capsule automatically point in the right direction, that\u0027s why capsules are designed to have such a shape. If you have some RCS fuel left, I think it would be best to keep it to raise the periapsis on the final pass, in my experience that\u0027s where you are most likely to lose your crew (just yesterday I\u0027ve lost a crew this way, the periapsis on my final pass dropped below 35 km and I had no way of boosting it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maxkm5st1","CreatedById":115411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T20:13:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure that you are coming at a \u0026gt;35 degree angle, and make sure your ship is very streamlined.
