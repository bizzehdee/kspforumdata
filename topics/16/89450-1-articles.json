Watch your closing velocity (click the velocity meter to show target velocity) as you close in, and just before going past, burn target retrograde until you hit 0 m/s relative velocity. To have the velocity killed at absolute closest approach, you will want to burn for time t, and begin the burn at 1/2*t before closest approach: so if it would take 8 seconds to kill your relative velocity, start your burn 4 seconds before closest approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to watch for is that you need to be pretty close to judge what relative velocity will be: if you\u0027re far away, the relative velocity is dominated by the phase angle*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*For example, if you\u0027ve got two spacecraft in 2.3 km/s circular orbits, 180 degrees away from each other, their relative velocity will be 4.6 km/s, because they are going 2.3 km/s in opposite directions relative to the center of Kerbin.

Before estimated closest approach, I turn the vessel to target retrograde. Then at estimated closest approach, burn until relative velocity to target is \u002B/-0.1 m/s. Then I turn vessel to target, setting up so that I get to a good position for final approach and docking. Speed for approach depends on distance to target. Rule of thumb being distance (in meters) divided by 100 is the closing speed I aim for. So if 500 meters out, initial approach speed is 5m/s. During the approach - and if available on my vessel - I reduce speed as I close using RCS. Again following the 1m/s per 100 meter distance to target guideline. If RCS is not available, I turn the vessel to target retrograde again, and use main engines to reduce speed as I get closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeeping such low speed during approach assures no unfortunate collisions, and makes it easy to make minor course corrections to line up properly to the docking port I\u0027m aiming for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActual docking is done by using MJ SmartASS target Par- autopilot to keep my vessel aligned to the docking port, and do the approach using Docking Port Alignment mod. Unless it is some small nimble vessel, where MJ does a good job of docking for me. Larger vessels have to be done manually, as MJ gets very wasteful with monoprop - and I don\u0027t usually have much of that on my ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Higgs","CreatedById":121852,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-05T09:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei am going to be short and sweet with you on this. get mechjeb. do not listen to the naysayers and negative nellies when they bemoan my suggestion.

Whilst it can do certain jobs very well, it requires constant monitoring and is no replacement for a proficient pilot doing it manually.

From designing the ship to flying it manually, all that information and fine control of the MNE is vital to doing a good job of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the autopilot is good for is executing nodes you\u0027ve set up, getting stuff to a desired orbit and landing stuff (*NOT* Spaceplanes) at a desired spot.
