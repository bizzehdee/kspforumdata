It all depends on the design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick tip though, since the game gives no indication whatsoever that this may be a problem: check that no wing parts, fins or elevons are in the exhaust path of your engines. Having parts in a jet\u0027s exhaust path, even when they\u0027re not being heated, is sometimes interpreted by the game as \u0027blocking\u0027 the thrust. Despite everything looking like it is/should be working, nothing heating up and engines reporting full power, you can still get a dramatic loss of effective thrust because of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrag, and especially body drag, is a huge factor. For the main body and engines, generally, try to use the smallest stack size possible (I find that generally, 0.675m \u0026gt; 1.25m \u0026gt; Mk2 \u0026gt; 2.5m \u0026gt; 3.5m \u0026gt; Mk3). Use as few \u0027stacks\u0027 of parts as you can get away with, and add the minimal amount of wings/fins/elevons needed to lift and control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more your main body can stay pointed exactly at prograde in flight, the less total drag and the easier it\u0027ll be to go supersonic. Adding a few degrees of angle of attack to the wings so you can point directly into prograde can mean the difference between being stuck subsonic or breaking the sound barrier right after lift off. One tick of the rotate gizmo in snap mode while holding shift is 5 degrees, which tends to be a bit more than optimal, but is easier to experiment with, and you\u0027ll notice a lot of improvement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-26T17:49:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2016 05:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by swjr-swis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T18:06:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother suggestion for making high-speed aircraft:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe drag model in that mod is far more advanced that what is available in stock, and clipping and occlusion are far better represented.
