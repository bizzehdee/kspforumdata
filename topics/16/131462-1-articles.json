Then gradually increase velocity. You may not be able to start a gravity turn until 20000m\u002B depending on how bad the aerodynamics are. It is an inefficient ascent, so plan to waste a couple thousand m/s of deltaV. May want to add a few more reaction wheels to help the craft maintain a vertical ascent.
