A and D are pitch, W and S are yaw, and Q and E are roll. They are all backwards also I think. I have it set up with stages. So first I start the main \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E and then second I detach and start the side SRBs. I control from the probe in the missile and have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on. During the launch sequence the main \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E destroys the heat shield on the beam often, so I switch to the launcher and detach then switch back. I try to be quick so the missile detaches before the heat shield gets destroyed.\u00A0When it\u0027s still attached the Navball acts normal. And then it\u0027s detached the Navball is sideways.

So in a setup like yours it is most convenient to just stage all rocket engines and the decoupler(s) in the same stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223789012\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194047\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221590097054\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022176753\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MeepTicoMeep\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, MeepTicoMeep said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I made a missile launcher car thing but when I launch the missile, all the directions are messed up.

If you mount the probe core backwards into your missile then pitch, yaw, and roll can still map onto the same axes that the design of the missile suggests but the probe core will believe that the missile is flying backwards and the directions are all inverted. If you then also rotate the probe core 90 degrees, then the probe core not only thinks the missile is flying backwards but also that it is flying on its side. So when the probe core pitches up or down then the missile will move in the horizontal direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can check the orientation that the probe core is in by looking at the navball. If the center of the navball points to the ground while your missile is going up and the retrograde marker is in the center of the navball, then the probe core is built in back to front. Similar for having a rotated probe core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(*) Well, to be more precise: the control point which can be a command pod, cockpit, probe core, or docking port. But if you only have a probe core on your missile then that probe core it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-22T12:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nO.K. While my explanations in the other post are correct they don\u0027t really address the actual issue: which is that when a section of a craft is staged away that doesn\u0027t contain a crewed command point, then the \u0022control point\u0022 of the discarded part is not set to the probe core controlling the part but to the new root part of the detached section of the craft.

My suggestion is to put \u0022control from here\u0022 of the probe core on an action group and hit the corresponding button after switching to the missile.
