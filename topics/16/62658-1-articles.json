If you are looking at the resource panel it wont actually start changing until you get into the thinner atmosphere. Your second question confuses me. Antennas work by transmitting data back to KSC. The packet size is how much data can be transferred at once and the other stat is how fast it transfers. Generally the bigger dishes transfer more data faster, but if you are not that worried about it, the small antenna is the way to go since there is not a range restriciton.

So if you have 6 intakes on your SSTO, it will take in about 1.20 units of air. The amount of air drawn in decreases as you gain altitude. For the most part, you\u0027re going to get 60% to 90% air for most altitudes below 10,000 meters. for 10 to 20 km, the amount of air drops rather quickly. Anything above 20 km, and you will not get enough air to drive your jets (it takes at least .10 units of air to drive a jet regardless of how many jet engines you have on the plane), provided that you\u0027re traveling at sub-sonic speeds.

That\u0027s one reason why folks around here will tell you to load up on the intakes; the more you have, the more air you can collect at higher altitudes, and the higher the operational ceiling of the jets. I\u0027ve had several designs make orbital velocity with the jets remaining at full throttle as high up as 30,000 meters, and its because I\u0027ve got one intake per tonne of aircraft.
