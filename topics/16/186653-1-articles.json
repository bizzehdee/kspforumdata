They are not a hack or a workaround, but a tool. They perform much the same function as the cables and cross-beams on a bridge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo enable them on parts you want to secure more ... uh ... securely than the single point that you get by default when connecting two parts together. Cycle through the various options of what to strut to, and use the one that you think will do the best job. For booster stages, feel free to use any of the options (though I tend to use grandparent or heaviest, which generally helps attach side boosters to the central stack). For long rockets strutting the engines to root can really help, and I also like to strut the base of a fairing to root.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XLjedi","CreatedById":175658,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-24T16:34:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou try to fly your craft without it...\u00A0 watch as the parts flex and flop around.\u00A0 Then use it sparingly to stitch your craft together so it feels, looks, behaves like a solid aerospace fuselage.\u00A0 That\u0027s pretty much it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use the regular struts when the design/\u003Cspan\u003Eaesthetic\u003C/span\u003Es call for it.\u00A0 ...in particular, biplane designs would need real struts between the wings not for just cosmetics, but because the autostrut options would not typically let you create those wing-to-wing connections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-24T16:39:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2019 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by XLjedi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
