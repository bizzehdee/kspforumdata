So far, I could resolve all my questions myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am trying to build a plane at the moment, which I have done often in the past. The twist is, I now have FAR installed (which everyone seems to think is great).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe weird thing is, it just shreds off the wings and the two side tanks when I pull up at 100 m/s (360 km/h, which is not a bad speed for a plane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the indicators, I first get a \u0022Large AOA\u0022, which means I am about to stall, but since I am fast enough, I am not stalling, and then I go into aerodynamic failure and everything false apart. I know for a fact that w/o FAR, this plane would \u0022fly\u0022, it could even lift of vertically. But why is FAR eating it up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I can tell, the main problem is that while I pull up, the plane continues horizontally, and therefore the wind pressure on the wings is too big. But that makes no sense, the wings should redirect the vector of the plane upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a bug in FAR that when you use gimballed engines instead of jet engines, it behaves more like a rocket and therefore the wings do not work properly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed now that, even without deadly re-entry, my rockets fall apart in the atmosphere when I come in unrealistically hot. The pressure is just too much then. I am kind of okay with that, since coming in with 2000 m/s or more, one would expect to be torn apart, although it was nice to be able to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERalph\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/558759332808978071/07CA7FD39E65A62D433B3EDD0E3846E67164F4A9/\u0022 alt=\u002207CA7FD39E65A62D433B3EDD0E3846E67164F4A9\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/558759332808981175/4EB2BCA1DC8B83098E2E83A4D727D0D3CC388939/\u0022 alt=\u00224EB2BCA1DC8B83098E2E83A4D727D0D3CC388939\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/558759332808983236/6593A04BCBBC74753AE360E09685A10E64667FF3/\u0022 alt=\u00226593A04BCBBC74753AE360E09685A10E64667FF3\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-24T09:09:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2014 09:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ker-boom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-23T21:18:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 13.2, FAR includes structural failures due to aerodynamic stress.

I assume that this particular aircraft is a tad unstable and won\u0027t lift off of the runway (Judging from both your proximity to the ground in the first picture, and your extreme pitch angle in the second) I would check your CoM and CoL locations and adjust them as needed, also you really don\u0027t need a whole lot of thrust for an aircraft, 3 rocket engines is a tad overkill in atmosphere. A plane is...well...a plane, not a rocket, so don\u0027t try getting airborne and then immediately pulling up to 90 degrees, you will rip things apart every time.
