I built a ship with extra seats in it, and a grabber. I eventually managed to get him with the grabber and bring him back to Kerbin safely. What I had wanted to do was just get him in the cockpit with me. Is there any way to take control of a rogue Kerbal and make him get in my ship?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T04:33:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 04:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by theShiz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sonny_Jim","CreatedById":103060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T00:45:38Z","Content":"You can use the [ and ] keys to switch between vessels/kerbals when they are within 2.3km."},{"CreatedByName":"theShiz","CreatedById":137822,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T00:49:19Z","Content":"I tried that, but it wasn\u0027t working.

Anyway, grabbing something with the claw is functionally the same as docking with it, which itself is the functional equivalent of making one ship out of two. You can transfer fuel and Kerbals, generate power on one side and use it on the other, and share monoprop.\n\nHeh heh. You really did this the hard way ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Normally you only need to grab them like that if you\u0027ve used up all their EVA fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T08:39:19Z","Content":"But... can you transfer monoprop to them when \u0022docked\u0022?"},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T12:17:17Z","Content":"They don\u0027t use monoprop.
