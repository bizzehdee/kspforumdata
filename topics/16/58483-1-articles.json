Then perform inclination change at that apoapsis and back at periapsis lower the apoapsis again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis maneuver is also called bielliptic inclination change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mkt8989","CreatedById":63523,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T16:14:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll want to use the maneuvering node to change your orbital inclination using the pink up/down directional handles. What you\u0027ll find is that when you do this the ending orbit you get will start to tilt but it will also get much bigger. You\u0027ll then have to correct for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly it requires a massive amount of fuel to make this change and if you\u0027re interested in doing it because you\u0027re in a polar orbit around, say, the Mun, you will likely find you\u0027ll run out of fuel before getting back to the equatorial orbit you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crazyewok","CreatedById":97592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T16:18:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I have a probe round Duna and Im trying to get it home but I keep missing Kerbin so it because im stuck in polar orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crazyewok","CreatedById":97592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T16:19:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThen perform inclination change at that apoapsis a\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you perform a inclination change?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T16:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crazyewok\u0022 data-cite=\u0022crazyewok\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do you perform a inclination change?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy burning perpendicular to your trajectory.
