What you may not know however (it took me a long time to learn this) is do the burn for Duna while still in Kerbins gravity. You will get a boost from kerbin (oberth effect), and so it costs less delta-v than burning in solar orbit. So technically it\u0027s only an addiational 380 added to the delta-v you need to escape Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope i helped \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I_Killed_Jeb","CreatedById":84817,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T03:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the issue is that interplanetary burns are more efficient in LKO than HKO, so IMO the proper way to read these maps is to sum it up from low orbit as opposed to calculating it from where you are?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T03:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI assume your 1000 dV is based on reaching a parking orbit around Duna, which means you\u0027re spending a ton of dV on getting captured (reducing your speed to orbital velocity)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe red arrow at the 250 pointing from \u0022Kerbin/Duna Transfer\u0022 to \u0022Duna Capture\u0022 indicates aerobraking.
