The reason you want the CoL behind the CoM is for positive aerodynamic stability. Lift is a form of drag. When a solid object is moving through a fluid, it naturally rotates so that the drag is toward the back, behind the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPut the COL in front of the COM and your plane becomes flip happy, put them too close to each other and your plane becomes excessively maneuverable.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight.

The CoM is the pivot-point about which the plane rotates. Look at a weathervane... one end has high drag, the other end has low drag. The wind makes it rotate around the pivot-point (the pole) so that the high-drag end is downwind, behind the pole. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the air flowing past your plane that makes it \u0022flip-happy\u0022 or not based on the CoL/CoM relationship, not gravity pulling down on the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I can also see that a plane that naturally wants to point downward makes pulling the noise up less twitchy, but in return, it\u0027ll make pulling it back down more twitchy, and the general maneuvrability of the plane isn\u0027t much affected.

It\u0027s not about \u0022balancing\u0022 your plane, it\u0027s about fluid dynamics pushing the high-drag end harder than the low-drag end, and the CoM is the point about which it forces rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E In general, why not have a plane that just keeps pointing in the way you put it?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you make a plane too positively stable, by putting the CoL too far back, it can actually become impossible to turn no matter how much you pull on the controls... they simply cannot apply enough force to overcome the airflow trying to keep the CoL directly behind the CoM. That makes it pretty difficult to fly, since you can\u0027t steer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you design a plane for neutral stability, it also becomes very difficult to fly... by being so easy to point it in any direction, it becomes very difficult to make it point in the direction you want it to actually go. The slightest disturbance and you\u0027re facing a different direction. That\u0027s great for fighters with flight-control computers, where the pilot is really just voting for what the controls should be doing and he\u0027s in the minority party, but not so great for anyone trying to just fly in a straight line by hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-25T14:08:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2014 02:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoClass","CreatedById":90399,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T14:31:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERoboRay has the best answer above, but I\u0027d like to expand on one thing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spyritdragon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spyritdragon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...the Centre of Lift goes behind the Centre of Mass, so our plane will tilt slightly downward when not controlled. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking precisely, a rear CoL will not by itself pitch the craft downward.
