I have a command module, a support module, and a lander module. One in orbit, I want to disconnect the lander module from the service and command module, spin the service and command module around and reconnect (dock) to the lander. The lander itself has an ascent and descent stage. However, I can\u0027t get the thing to separate correctly at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having a hard time with the lander-can in general because I can\u0027t attach things to it easily unless it\u0027s connected to the main body of the rocket.

If you have a stack separator between the docking port and an engine and you decouple using the docking port\u0027s \u0022Decouple\u0022 option, the separator will hold the shroud in place on the engine while the CSM can be moved into position with RCS and reaction wheels. Then, once the shroud is safely out of the path of the lander\u0027s docking port, you can activate the separator, which will remove the shroud and allow you to use the main engine as normal.
