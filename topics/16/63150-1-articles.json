So if you land without landing gear on your engine you will be fine if you had a velocity of 5 m/s, but if you are going 8 m/s the engine will be destroyed. The explosion of the engine will in turn provide an upward force to slow down the rest of the craft so depending on how heavy it is it might now be going slow enough for the next part (like a fuel tank) to survive impact with the ground. So basically when you hit the ground (\u0027land\u0027) your ship will be destroyed from the bottom up until the speed is reduced to less then the impact rating of the next part. If you are playing smart you\u0027ll have something like landing gear at the bottom which have an impact rating of 12 m/s, so you just need to be going slower then that and nothing will be destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater works differently. On water even after the first part like the landing gear passes the impact test the ship will still continue to sink (only at a certain point does buoyancy helps push your ship up and stabilize it). That means that if you hit the water at 10 m/s your landing gear will survive, but then it will immediately sink into the water and your engine will hit the waters next at 10 m/s destroying it. Because of this you generally need to be going slower if you want your ship to survive a water landing in one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Karretch","CreatedById":102077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T14:47:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShouldn\u0027t have forgotten about this.
