The challenge of building the rockets. Slowly getting more science. All of that is amazing to me. Ive gotten to the point where I can get to the Mun and\u00A0Minmus without problems. As simple as can be to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy problem is interplanetary travel. If I try to get to Duna as an example, I feel like I am blindly shooting in the dark trying to get there. I play around with a maneuver for 20 minutes until miraculously achieve orbit. But then I use to much fuel that I can\u0027t get a return. I also have NO clue when is the best time to launch. The Mun or Minmus is a direct shot. Duna.. no clue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a mod that can help with\u00A0maneuvers?
