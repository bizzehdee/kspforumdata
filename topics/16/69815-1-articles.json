You need the CoM and CoT perfectly aligned, it\u0027ll be much easier to fly if you include a reaction wheel and SAS (or at least a pod/cockpit with those), and if you want a KAS winch it can only go directly below/inline with the main rotor - that normally means either front/rear or side/side symmetrical fuel tanks so the CoM doesn\u0027t change as they drain. Could you show a screenie in the SPH with CoM and CoT of the best version so far, we could probably suggest what could be changed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-KidWithEyeBalls-","CreatedById":109013,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T08:59:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have taken The CoM and CoT in to consideration, but I didn\u0027t think of the Fuel draining.
