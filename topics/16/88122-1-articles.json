It burned up in the atmosphere. I went back to my quicksave, set the periapsis to 16km. The ship didn\u0027t slow down enough and is now forever in deep space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed my velocity was approx 5000km, and that seemed a little fast. So my question is, was it too fast? What is the maximum velocity you can enter Duna\u0027s atmosphere and expect to get an aerocapture?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T18:13:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ma gonna point you to the aerobraking calculator - \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should get you to where you need to be.
