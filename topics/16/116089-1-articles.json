Help please.\n\nYou have your bay with parts of your craft attached on either end.\n\nWhen you open the doors to put a part in, you have the option of attaching to one of the nodes on either end or surface attaching it to the floor of the bay.\n\nIf the part is surface attach, simply place it where you need it.\n\nIf you are attaching to a node, press your MOD key. On windows it\u0027s ALT on Linux it\u0027s Right-Shift.\n\nThis will make the part only attach to a node.\n\nTry to line it up with rotation before you press your MOD Key to attach it.\n\nHolding the MOD key stops it from trying to attach to a surface and only attach to a node.\n\nHope this helps."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T19:33:15Z","Content":"hold \u0027ALT\u0027 to have node-attachable things snap to those top and bottom nodes, attach surface-attachable things (e.g. goo, thermometers, etc.) to the inside surface of the bay.\n\nEDIT: ninja\u0027d"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T19:43:59Z","Content":"When I put batteries in the attach to the underneath side - meaning only half the battery is visible inside the bay."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T19:59:54Z","Content":"Toggle angle snap with \u0027c\u0027 - surface items will attach to the inside, in \u0027smooth\u0027 mode.\n\nAlso, the door collider areas can cause problems, [check out this picture.](http://i.imgur.com/nUKjPiX.jpg) Placing items too close to edges can cause \u0022you\u0027re in my space!\u0022 conflicts. \n\nOne test for this is take your assembly out to the Launchpad and open/close the doors a few times.

Or, if your craft with the cargo bay is already in orbit, then you need to fly your other stuff up there, rendezvous and then dock inside that cargo bay.\n\nBut again, just adding or merging it into it, does not work.

A science Jr. inside a 2.5 service bay. As soon as the rocket was loaded at the launch pad, all he\u0027ll broke loose! Sparks flying, rattling noises and BOOOM. \n\nI believe that the culprit is the fact that the bay has 4 nodes. 2 on the ends outside and 2 inside. Somehow we must have attached our science Jr. to the outer node, and it clipped inside the bay. Part clipping is something those bays really don\u0027t like! \n\nA second rocket with the same way of putting a science jr. inside a bay worked nicely. \n\nAnyone know if there\u0027s a way of determining which of the inside / outside nodes are used?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T18:53:01Z","Content":"Personally, I liked the time a 1.25m bay ate Bob ... it was hilarious, but he came out of it all right!"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T20:27:14Z","Content":"I changed this post to answered because I decided the problem probably is not me.
