How do i prioritize between intake area and the intake air initial/max? (Still primarily for FAR, but on a more general level too, i guess).\n\nThe intake area is the only stat that really matters there. The initial/max stuff is just how much IntakeAir can be stored - that\u0027s basically just leftover IntakeAir after the engines have been fed.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, with FAR, am i right to assume that the larger ones cause more drag, regardless of the 0.2 drag common to all of them?\n\nYou can determine the drag involved in FAR empirically fairly easily. Just place a plane to be tested on the runway, accelerate it up to a small, nonzero speed, and then multiply the Cd by the reference area for each design. That\u0027s your baseline drag for the whole craft. If you repeat those tests with different configurations, you can figure out which intakes have the least drag for a given craft configuration.\n\nNote however that at different altitudes and speeds, the Cd will vary dramatically (particularly above 20k alt and supersonic speeds). That shouldn\u0027t be too hard to test either, although will be more time-intensive (once you have the reference area though, you can use the Data \u002B Stability Derivatives to get an idea of the drag at various speeds and altitudes).\n\nYour overall aero drag will be approximately Cd\\*Reference Area\\*Q (in Newtons).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E jarmund,\n\u003E  The XM-G50 is the best radial- mount intake.
