The ejection burn is usually pretty long which means it\u0027s really difficult to execute precisely; at least I usually end up off by a bit. More optimal burns would be even harder to execute and I find that anything I theoretically gain from them gets lost in the execution errors. Your midcourse burn makes a huge difference too -- just now I wasn\u0027t able to execute mine on a probe that went into comms blackout, and instead of ending up in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E like I planned, I ended up in a very high polar orbit which means my recovery mission is going to be a lot more complicated than I intended.\u00A0So, to save fuel:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFind a good transfer window.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGo for a good insertion.

And if your target is Jool,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edefinitely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0make use of gravity braking: it will save you not just hundreds but potentially over a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethousand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0m/s. I\u0027m not all that great at orbital mechanics, but I have\u00A0managed an insertion into Laythe orbit that cost me all of 350 m/s starting from a rough intercept of the Jolian system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, there are tricks you can do with gravity assists -- for example it\u0027s cheaper to get to Jool by pinballing off Eve.

The rules don\u0027t change. What does change\u00A0is the fact that Kerbin is no longer your central body - the Sun is. And in contrast to before, where you started in low Kerbin orbit, you do not start in low solar orbit. You start in a \u003Cem\u003Ehigh\u003C/em\u003E solar\u00A0orbit right next to Kerbin itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is important\u00A0because of a concept called a \u0022transfer window\u0022. Think about going from Kerbin to the Mun. You start out in a tight, low orbit, you wait for the right time, and then you burn to raise your apoapsis out to the Mun to get an intercept. It feels like you\u0027re trying to hit a moving target from standstill\u00A0- it\u0027s just a question of aiming in the right direction and firing at the right time. But now, once you\u0027re in interplanetary space, you suddenly have to hit a moving target while you\u0027re also moving. This is so different, and so much harder!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Except it\u0027s not. Because even when you start from low Kerbin orbit, you are \u003Cem\u003Ealready\u003C/em\u003E trying to hit the Mun while you\u0027re yourself moving. Even \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E, you have to wait for the right transfer window - the moment in time where the celestial objects are aligned just right to allow you to achieve an intercept with your target. You think it isn\u0027t so, because Kerbin\u0027s position is static, but it\u0027s not Kerbin you should be concerned about.\u00A0It\u0027s your own vessel. Your vessel is \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E a celestial object, in its own orbit. And it must be properly aligned with respect to your destination body. It\u0027s just the same in interplanetary space. People generally use the\u00A0origin body to track celestial alignment, but you can only make that substituton because your vessel shares your origin body\u0027s solar orbit as long as you are within its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Once you exit,\u00A0you have to go back to thinking about your vessel in its own orbit again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing back to the Mun example: what happens if you miss your node? Well, you just loop around once and try again, right? It\u0027s quick and painless. But in interplanetary space, nothing ever moves quickly, and you have to wait for ages for the right transfer window. How come?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason is simple: since your transfer window is the point where everything is aligned just right, the frequency with which it occurs is related to how quickly the celestial objects in question change position with respect to one another. And there\u0027s a very simple rule of the thumb for this: the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eless similar\u003C/em\u003E the orbits, the \u003Cem\u003Emore frequent\u003C/em\u003E the transfer windows are. In addition to that, windows get more frequent based on the absolute size of the smaller of the two orbits.\u00A0So when you are in low Kerbin orbit and try to hit the Mun, you have both a really tiny starter orbit, and a really big difference between your start and destination, which makes the window reoccur really really quickly. You loop around Kerbin once every 30 minutes. But the Mun takes 38.5 hours to loop once around Kerbin. It has barely moved by the time you come back around. And so the transfer window occurs every 30 minutes (your orbital period) plus 1/77th (the amount of movement the Mun did in its orbit during that half hour) of 30 minutes. That\u0027s less than 31 minutes in total.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Minmus, the interval is technically even shorter, because Minmus moves even less distance in the time it takes you to loop around. The transfer window to Minmus out of a 30 minute low Kerbin orbit reoccurs every 30 minutes plus 1/598th of 30 minutes. ...That\u0027s not really a big difference, you say? Correct. because that is just how much your tiny low Kerbin orbit dominates the math.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what if your Kerbin orbit was different? Let\u0027s say you\u0027re trying to go from Mun (38.5 hours oribital period) to Minmus (299 hours orbital period). The transfer window there reoccurs every 38.5 hours, plus 1/7.767th of 38.5 hours. Which resolves into roughly 38.5 \u002B 5 = 43.5 hours. (Doing this trip and back, by the way, is a great way to practice interplanetary transfers safely inside Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now the counterintuitive part: what if you were trying to go from the Mun to an orbit just a bit higher than the Mun? Not all the way out to Minmus at 47,000km, but rather just to 24,000km,\u00A0twice the altitude of the Mun. The orbital period of that altitude is roughly 109.2 hours. So the transfer window reoccurs every 38.5 hours plus 1/2.836th of 38.5 hours. Which comes out to roughly 38.5 \u002B 13.5 = 52 hours. Even more than that, technically, because this simple way to calculate it has an error that gets larger the larger the second figure gets.\u00A0Your target orbit was much closer, much more similar than Minmus before; thus, you have to wait \u003Cem\u003Elonger\u003C/em\u003E for the transfer window to come around again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Taking this to its logical extreme: if the orbits are as similar as is possible - in other\u00A0words, identical - then the time for a transfer window to reoccur is infinitely large. It will never happen, because the relative positions of the two objects will never change. Fun fact: this is part of what makes orbital rendezvous - another concept with which many newcomers struggle - such a tricky business.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, back to interplanetary space. Where does everyone go first? Duna! Because it\u0027s right next door, it barely costs more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E than Minmus, and it\u0027s a pretty benign place overall. Eve costs about the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, but it\u0027s a really unfriendly place, so we go to Duna instead. Unfortunately, because it is right next door, that means its orbit is very similar to that of Kerbin. And so you have to wait a long, long time between Duna windows. Many\u00A0hundreds of 6-hour Kerbin days. As a result of this, many newcomers are confused: how do you get a Duna intercept? Even timewarping several days changes absolutely nothing! Correct, because if you\u0027re unlucky, you may have to time warp \u003Cem\u003Ehundreds\u003C/em\u003E of days for the chance to get an intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you were to go to Moho instead, you\u0027d get a window roughly every 30-odd days. All because Moho is in such a low, tight solar orbit compared to Kerbin. Getting a Kerbin-Moho window is the quickest and easiest of all the planets - which is a bit amusing, considering Moho is also the hardest destination to reach from Kerbin out of all the planets from a piloting and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E perspective. By contrast, Duna has the longest wait for a transfer window from Kerbin out of all the planets, even though it is ostensibly the easiest to reach.

Here\u0027s that first part:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMake sure your spacecraft is in a circular, equatorial Kerbin orbit, and set the Initial Orbit altitude on the website accordingly. The planner makes the assumption that you start in such an orbit, because it makes the math faster and easier; if you try to execute the calculated transfer from a highly inclined or eccentric Kerbin orbit, you will miss your target. You \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E make the planner calculate from an eccentric and/or inclined orbit, too, but you have to manually input all the parameters of that orbit through the Add Body menu. And that\u0027s both tedious and requires you to have a mod installed that shows you these numbers ingame in the first place, because KSP won\u0027t show them you by default. If you are already in interplanetary space, you unfortunately also need to manually input your orbital parameters this way.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nChoose your destination.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you are planning a flyby or aerocapture, check the \u0022no insertion burn\u0022 box; if you want to enter orbit around your destination, leave it unchecked.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you want to enter orbit, enter a useful value for Final Orbit. On bodies with an atmosphere, you want this to be 5-10 kilometers above where the atmosphere ends (you can look up that number ingame, or on the KSP wiki). On bodies without an atmosphere, simply enter 10.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSet Earliest Departure to your current ingame date.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSelect \u0022Ballistic\u0022 from the transfer type dropdown menu (though I believe that\u0027s also the default). Sometimes it\u0027s cheaper to do a midflight course correction, but I personally tend to not want to bother.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nClick on Show Advanced Settings to bring up two additional settings. They are pre-filled, and do not need to be adjusted in 90% of all cases; but once you undertand how to use the planner, you can use Latest Departure and Time Of Flight to narrow down your results more.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPress Plot It!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the colorful plot at the bottom, travel time is on the vertical axis, and departure date is on the horizontal one. \u0026lt;--- This is really important for reading the plot. Make sure you understand it fully. Mouse over the plot; you\u0027ll see a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E cost next to your mouse cursor that represents the particular date/traveltime combination you\u0027re hovering over. The planner will have pre-selected the cheapest solution it can find between your specified earliest and latest departure dates. This is the next \u0022transfer window\u0022 - the moment in time where the celestials are aligned just right. This solution will always be a Hohmann transfer, or as close to one as orbital alignment allows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to fly in that transfer window. You can fly at any time you want, and spend more or less travel time, as dictated by your whims and needs; but you will notice that those other departure date/travel time combinations cost more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. That is because you are either flying \u0022out of window\u0022 and/or are performing a \u0022high energy transfer\u0022, and have to spend extra \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to force an encounter. In some cases, though, the planner will show you multiple solutions marked in deep blue. That simply means that there are multiple Hohmann transfer windows of similar good quality for you to choose from in the near future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither accept the preselected solution, or find a solution that\u0027s suitable for your needs by clicking on that spot on the graph. If you want, you can adjust your Latest Departure and Time Of Flight in the advanced settings mentioned before and recalculate, to make the plot more focused on specific areas. When you have found your solution, click on it, then press \u0022Refine Transfer\u0022 at the bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs one last step, click on the little blue \u0022i\u0022 marker next to the Ejection \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E reading in the results list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you can finally proceed to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/150986-transfer-window-planner-precise-nodeprecise-maneuver-editor/#comment-2827151\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Esetting up your node\u003C/a\u003E in the game. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-02T13:26:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2023 01:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Victor12","CreatedById":182167,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-11T02:18:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
