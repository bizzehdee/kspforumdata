I needed to build a ship with enough fuel and enough resources for a return mission. As the result, I built a simple ship in order to get there, as shown on this monitor:\n\n![tYFfZ4d.png](http://i.imgur.com/tYFfZ4d.png)\n\nThis is probably one of the most complicated spacecraft I ever made. So many stages were required and larger rocket designs had to be used in order for this thing to successfully get to space. After a very long time warp, the spaceship got there successfully. No electricity was lost.\n\nI am going to admit, yes I am using mods. You can see the interior of the cockpit here.\n\n![fGXMBem.png](http://i.imgur.com/fGXMBem.png)\n\n![729pE6A.png](http://i.imgur.com/729pE6A.png)\n\nThis spacecraft is not designed to land on Laythe \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 that would be suicidal. The mission was to simply launch to Jool, grab some science with EVA reports on one of Jool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s moons and return back to Kerbin with the smaller spacecraft attached. I chose the closest moon \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Laythe, as shown here:\n\n ![zo4fwRd.png](http://i.imgur.com/zo4fwRd.png)\n\n![pkZpWCP.png](http://i.imgur.com/pkZpWCP.png)\n\nHowever, there is a problem\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\nI can get science, but the power isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t working properly!\n\nThe problem is that \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 even with those 4 solar panels deployed, not enough electricity is being produced anymore (see bottom image). Yes, they are facing directly at the sun. In fact, it is stuck on 0.05 energy. When I time warp, it goes up to 1.90 electricity but that\u0027s about it. On the night side of the moon, the energy just drops to 0.00. In other words, I went from having 8000\u002B electricity to nothing.\n\n ![CoiY01p.png](http://i.imgur.com/CoiY01p.png)\n\nAs you can see on the top image, no electricity is producing.\n\nI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure what happened because the solar panels were just working a few minutes ago on the Kerbin system, and suddenly they have stopped producing electricity once I got to Jool.\n\nLet me know if this is a small bug in the game due to the fact that I am using mods, or if there is something else I am not understanding here. Even with all my instruments and lights switched off, power is still not being produced.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T04:45:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 04:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The Kromblers**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T04:24:49Z","Content":"Did you calculate how far Jool is from the Sun, and how inverse square law would impact the amount of power projected on your panel?"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T04:32:25Z","Content":"Here is a [thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118819-PSA-Solar-panels-now-useless-past-Dres-%28as-it-should-be%29) where you can learn more about the recent inverse square changes.

Farther from the Sun (Kebals call their sun the Sun, so don\u0027t correct me), less solar radiation (light), less effective solar panels. RTG\u0027s are the answer...or really long extension cords. \n\nP.S. No shame in playing with mods. It\u0027s a single player game. Play in a way that is fun for you.

I\u0027ve been placing probes with solar panels on the Jool system without any problems. It seems to be only with this one that has a problem. Looks like I just need to get back to Kerbin and add more power to it. Another very long time warp it is.

I checked back on the spacecraft, no I left it off. I wanted to use the instruments and goo containers first before proceeding with the lab. Unfortunately, because I actually don\u0027t have enough power, I will have to abort the mission and return back to Kerbin to fix the power issue. I\u0027ll have to see what I can do from there.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAaah for !@#$ sake, I am SO BLOODY STUPID! After making a backup-save and reloading my old one, I saw that it turned out - YES, the lab was actually on. The power started to come back normally. I now have found the issue, it was the lab all along.

It is very useful information to know for future voyages.\n\nANother useful bit of information is, as I can see you use the Near Future suite of mods (which was updated today finally), you have access to some really powerful solar panels (the Near Future panels are almost better than the stock RTG in terms of power/mass out by Jool)."},{"CreatedByName":"The Kromblers","CreatedById":123939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T09:17:54Z","Content":"I only have the Near Future Spacecraft installed at the moment.
