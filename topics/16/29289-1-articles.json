Doodman landed Wade mk2 on Eeloo,no problems, other then nearly the entire planet is an ice ball. Yes I know I should have seen it coming and I should have sent a probe first... yeah I sent Doodman out there more or less blind... But the mk2 had improved power, traction, and control. He covered over 50km before the tires gave out, the Wade mk2 can run on 3 wheels and still drive, but not 1... 1 is two less wheels then three and two to few. Using the thrusters on the back of Wade is much to risky. I can build a craft to retrieve him but I have a problem, all of the crew modules come fully loaded with Kerbals... How do I empty them out, without throwing Kerbals out the airlock on the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease Help Doodman... he\u0027s taking isolation well... and he\u0027s even set up our new flag.
