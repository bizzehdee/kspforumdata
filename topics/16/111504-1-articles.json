Meaning I have a lot of hours I don\u0027t have to do anything but play KSP and keep an eye on the people.\n\nIs there a way I can open a save at work and at home? So I can play a carreer mode in my free time and during my babysit shifts? \n\nCan I place a shortcut to a dropbox folder in the /saves folder both at home and at work?

I have my KSP directory mounted via NFS, which would allow this. It might be a bit too slow to run, though.\n\n2. I also have my home directory backed up every 5 minutes with rdiff-backup, so if screw up, I can revert my persistent.sfs to whatever it was n amount of minutes/hours/days before. This would also allow for a simplistic approach to what you\u0027re asking without involving any 3rd parties\n\nBoth of the above are primarily made for linux, but I\u0027m sure there are windows equivalents if not ports"},{"CreatedByName":"hugix","CreatedById":55379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T21:36:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You could install the game on a external drive, or copy the save files over to external if your machine you are using has it installed with the same mods etc.\n\nI did copy my save folder a couple of times onto a stick and took it to work.

You\u0027re talking nonsense.\n\nBut seriously, if you\u0027re running windows you could use OneDrive or something similiar and make a symbolic link in your KSP folder to your Saves folder in OneDrive.\n\nThis way the actual save files are stored in the sync folders for OneDrive, but KSP when it looks in it\u0027s Saves folder it gets automatically redirected to the real location.\n\nHere\u0027s a link explaining how to set it up: [http://www.howtogeek.com/174765/how-to-sync-any-folder-with-skydrive-on-windows-8.1/](https://www.howtogeek.com/174765/how-to-sync-any-folder-with-skydrive-on-windows-8.1/)\n\nThe instructions aren\u0027t specific to windows 8.1, they should work on earlier versions too."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T23:19:22Z","Content":"The easiest way to do this is to use something like DropBox, which creates a folder and automatically syncs the files in it to it\u0027s own cloud. You then have the problem of KSP not looking in this folder for saved games. This can be resolved by creating a symbolic link within the KSP folder. Only link the saves folder, nothing else.\n\nSo, step by step.\n\n1. Create a drop box account and install it on both PC\u0027s, which will share the dropbox folder between them.\n\n2. Copy {INSTALLDIR}\\Kerbal Space Program\\saves to that dropbox folder.\n\n3. Create a [symbolic link](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/) on both computers in the KSP install directory called saves which uses that folder as a target.\n\nEDIT: I dun got ninjad. With the same link no less. EDIT2: Same website, not same link. My link is a bit more OS generic.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T23:21:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T01:29:04Z","Content":"I kept my whole install in my Dropbox for a while.
