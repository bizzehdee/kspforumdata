Half of the volume of this rocket is a giant fairing. It looks ridiculous, but almost actually works. TWR and dV are adequate. The problem is that I lose stability as I shed staging, and I believe it\u0027s because I can\u0027t get a great read on my center of mass and thrust. \n\nFor one thing, some of the rockets on my payload stage lander inside the fairing point sideways (It\u0027s like a schoolbus with thrusters at the bottom, being launched vertically.) and this confuses the center of thrust UI to point off center even though that stage is not used on the way up.\n\nAnother thing is that I have a complex radial booster subassembly that is already all hooked up with struts and fuel lines. If I take those off they don\u0027t usually go back on the way they came off. I\u0027d rather not spend a half hour hooking all that stuff back up and risking additional orphaned parts adding weight and drag for no benefit.\n\nI\u0027m using Kerbal Engineer Redux and that gives a torque reading per stage which is useful, but it doesn\u0027t give much help in correcting a high number in that field.\n\nIs there an easier way to eliminate stages from the CoM and CoT markers?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T20:00:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 08:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cephalo**"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T16:52:10Z","Content":"I suppose you could try saving the ship under a different name, so you can disassemble that one to check out each stage\u0027s CoM, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T16:56:54Z","Content":"Save it first - use a scratch copy if you want to really be safe.

What caught me this time, is that my last stage is mounted sideways on the rocket throwing off everything. ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif) I can do this, I just have to start over. Maybe I can put some drop tanks on the other side (top) of my lander or some kind of something useful."}]}
