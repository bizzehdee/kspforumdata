Anyway, I was wondering how to use the KSP patcher with steam because it is getting so annoying.

On Steam, you can set KSP to auto-update and it will just happen whenever a KSP update or hotfix comes out. If you don\u0027t set it to auto-update, Steam will tell you an update is available you\u0027ll have to start it manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theguyinthemines","CreatedById":119931,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T16:55:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taki117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taki117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou right click and then click \u0022verify integrity\u0022 or some such.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Still doesn\u0027t work, i still get the wierd SPH screen\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theguyinthemines","CreatedById":119931,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T12:17:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI fixed it. i just had to delete the demo and previous versions before running.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
