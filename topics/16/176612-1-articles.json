When it sits there on the surface, doing absolutely nothing at all with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off, the medium reaction wheel in its center starts to applying torque.

If I leave it alone with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on and the reaction wheel set to pilot only, I\u0027ll start violently tumbling through the air smashing my solar panels when I hit the ground. What\u0027s even weirder is that at certain points during the tumble, the direction that the pitch/roll/yaw is torquing will switch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m completely at a loss as to why this would happen, but I think it\u0027s a problem with Minmus. The exact same rover works just fine on Mun.

It was the trim! Thank you, bewing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor those reading this in the future, trim is a sort of autopilot feature where you hold alt \u002B wasdqe to adjust all reaction wheels/control surfaces to bend a certain way constantly whenever you aren\u0027t manually controlling them. alt \u002B x resets trim to zero. For planes flying through the atmosphere, this means you can get your plane to fly straight without constant minor adjustments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m surprised that I\u0027m just now learning about this after 402 hours of game time. Trim controls aren\u0027t in any tutorial or even in the key bindings menu; I had to google \u0027ksp trim\u0027 to find out about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
