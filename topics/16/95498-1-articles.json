The Kerstein Station consists mainly of a laboratory and a crew can and some science stuff for good measure and of course the antenna not visible on the image. The launcher uses a skipper propelled main stage and 4 boosters for the launch. Another small stage does the final orbital insert and should suffice to send it to the Mun or Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/kerstein_station_01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kerstein_station_01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere the station in orbit.
