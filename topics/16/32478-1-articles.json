Or rather, Caelus ran out of fuel and crashed in a ball of fiery disaster. A top-down redesign was required for Caelus II, including a larger, more functional rover. This presented... Difficulties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current configuration of Caelus II lacks the firepower required to reach Mun, but is the stablest configuration I\u0027ve had for her yet. I figured adding an extra fuel tank and poodle engine into the midsection might help, but this led to the whole thing glitching out, with solid boosters refusing to fire and launch supports refusing to detach. I checked and double-checked the staging, but had to revert to the previous design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anyone willing to help me out with this? Even without the lack of firepower, the design is lacking in a couple of places - the disconnect between the midsection and the underside of the rover/lander (designed to be an all-in-one to land the rover, explore around, then fly back up to reconnect with the orbiting manned section) isn\u0027t great, and the section around the rover could probably do with a bit of extra stiffening. I want to get the rover onto Mun, look around for a bit, then re-attach and return to Kerbin, but I\u0027m really running out of ideas to improve the design that don\u0027t result in an uncontrollable wreck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaelus II can be downloaded \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/bthvyp86ykrc6q6/Caelus_II.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T21:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s one of the craziest design I have seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t really give you tips, because I don\u0027t understand why you would design the rocket like that, nothing make any sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it can reach Kerbin Orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt don\u0027t have enough DeltaV to reach the Mun anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case this is far from optimal (and staged like this the main thruster don\u0027t activate at launch)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v154/Tribersman/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/KSP%200-20/Special/screenshot33_zps8901d963.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot33_zps8901d963.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v154/Tribersman/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/KSP%200-20/Special/screenshot32_zps0c55c75a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot32_zps0c55c75a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-11T21:08:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2013 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kegereneku\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cranium","CreatedById":69153,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T21:13:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow on Kerbin does that get into the air?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Undy","CreatedById":70104,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T09:21:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had it reach Kerbin orbit and it\u0027s reasonably stable from launch.

The section above was intended to remain in Mun orbit, awaiting the return of the rover (no idea if the eight 24-77\u0027s is enough to lift back into a low Mun orbit).

Well, we can all have a good laugh about them. Initially they were intended to raise the centre of thrust on lift-off, but the whole thing was arcing at about 500m and heading for the sea. Angling them on the top capsule was an exercise in the absurd born out of frustration while actually resulted in a very stable launch.

Some thoughts from just looking at the images; too many RCS thrusters on the rover. One cluster per side should be enough (4 total). Could use RCS on the \u0027top\u0027 (mun insertion/return) stage as well. As remarked about winglets, I\u0027d put them on the mainsail launch stage, can\u0027t use them in space and by the time you\u0027re returning to Kerbin you\u0027ll be coming hauling down opening parachutes. I hope? Wait I don\u0027t see parachutes on your staging list... guessing you want to return the rover in one piece? I\u0027d still opt for parachutes on the command pod (and rover in that case).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA single FL-T200 tank may or may not be enough for landing the rover on the mun, but from personal experience I\u0027d say extremely unlikely to get you back up again. 8 radial 24-77 is overkill, at least with your lightweight design, 4 (potentially 3 or even 2) should be enough. I\u0027d see about cramming some more fuel into the rover, Oscar-B tanks and the round gold stackable tanks probably since I don\u0027t think there\u0027s room for anything bigger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that there\u0027s heaps of ways to land stuff on the Mun, radial tanks\u0026amp;engines straight on the rover, a skycrane design, a larger lander with the rover underneath.. and even larger lander with two identical rovers on the sides, land the rover in a box with a ramp, the list goes on.

I got the command pod into a low Mun orbit then released the rover, but only managed to slow down the tangential velocity to about 120 m/s before running out of fuel and mono. Another less-than-impressive crash landing. Even attempting to reconnect with the command pod was an exercise in futility. Then efforts to return the crew to Kerbus ended with them endlessly circling the sun. Which was supposed to be the role of the Icarus series of probes. Still, much further forward than yesterday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027m going to call this rover a write-off.
