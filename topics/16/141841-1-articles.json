Doubling the TWR won\u0027t necessarily cut delta-v in half, decreasing fuel mass to half will. At least this is according to Kerbal Engineer, this mod seems to calculate delta-v precisely. It\u0027s true what Reactordrone says, overdoing the TWR will waste fuel, I always go for a balance between TWR and fuel efficiency. For a transfer stage you\u0027re wasting fuel with a TWR higher than 1, .5 is usually sufficient, unless you plan on doing very aggressive maneuvering and/or are bringing ISRU to re-fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoubling both engine thrust and fuel mass will increase payload capacity, so sometimes it\u0027s necessary to have multiple engine and tank assemblies if you\u0027re pushing a very heavy payload.

Adding another engine will add mass, but will also let you add multiple times that mass in fuel. Therefore, your overall mass fraction tends to improve, unless it already is hugging the theoretical maximum. This in turn means that you end up with more dV.

second, you typically want as few engines as possible, since they\u0027re dead weight that counts against your dV.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIf you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eare\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E fighting gravity\u003C/strong\u003E (e.g. you\u0027re ascending straight up after KSC launch), then your \u003Cstrong\u003ETWR matters\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 This is because every second you\u0027re ascending straight up, gravity is sucking 9.8 m/s out of you (on Kerbin, anyway), which is dV that\u0027s just flushed down the toilet.\u00A0 This is called \u0022gravity loss\u0022 and is a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehuge\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E hit to your fuel economy when gravity is strong.\u00A0 The only way to get around it is to minimize the time you spend fighting gravity (i.e. quickly get up above the thick part of the atmosphere, so you can tip farther over to the horizontal and spend your fuel in actually accelerating your rocket rather than fighting gravity), and the only way to accomplish that is with a high TWR.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, for a launch from Kerbin, it\u0027s a balancing act.\u00A0 On the one hand, you want to minimize gravity losses, in which case you want a high TWR-- the higher the better.\u00A0 On the other hand, the rocket equation still applies to you (engines are still dead weight), so if you go \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etoo\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E nuts with an overpowered ship, then you\u0027ll be wasting so much mass on engines that it more than offsets the benefit from reduced gravity loss.\u00A0 Furthermore, there\u0027s another practical limit:\u00A0 the faster you go while you\u0027re in the thick part of the atmosphere, the more energy you waste fighting aerodynamic drag.\u00A0 If you go faster than terminal velocity on ascent, then the loss to drag outweighs the benefit due to decreased gravity loss.\u00A0 This sets a practical upper limit on your speed, which in turn means it\u0027s not useful to have too much TWR, you\u0027d just waste the capacity.\u00A0 (Sort of like saying, it\u0027s not worthwhile driving a Lamborghini if you\u0027re going to be driving around city streets where traffic prevents you from going at high speed.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words:\u00A0 for liftoff, you need a happy medium in terms of TWR.\u00A0 Too low, and you waste too much dV on gravity losses.\u00A0 Too high, and you\u0027re lugging too much dead weight and wasting too much dV on aerodynamic drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I hear you ask, just what \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eis\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that happy medium?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnswer:\u00A0 It depends on your ship design (specifically, how big it is and how aerodynamic it is), but typically it\u0027s in the neighborhood of \u003Cstrong\u003E1.3 to 1.5\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 (Personally, I prefer 1.5.)\u00A0 The more aerodynamic the ship is, the higher the TWR it can get away with.\u00A0 Very large ships (i.e. multi-hundred-ton behemoths) can generally get away with a higher launchpad TWR, because they\u0027re less affected by aerodynamic drag and it\u0027s therefore worth their while to get up to speed faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, bear in mind that you don\u0027t want high TWR all the way up.\u00A0 You need it off the launchpad to fight gravity, but pretty soon you\u0027re going to be tipping over into your gravity turn, and going less vertical and more horizontal.\u00A0 Once that happens, a smaller fraction of your rocket power will be spent fighting gravity, which means you\u0027ll be wanting a lower TWR to get better dV efficiency.\u00A0 So, typically, you want your 1st stage off the launch pad to have a high TWR (e.g. 1.5), then your 2nd stage usually kicks in when you\u0027re already tipped over 45 degrees or more and can be considerably lower TWR (e.g. in the 1 to 1.3 range), and your 3rd stage should generally be pretty low (is fine to be under 1).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Space Dino","CreatedById":163476,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T02:30:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks everyone for the very helpful tips!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
