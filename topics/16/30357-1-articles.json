There\u0027s a maximum distance for part to part heat transfer. Because the orange tank is so long it\u0027s COM is far away enough from COM of the engine that the engine cannot transfer heat to the tank, hence why hot engines (mainsail, LV-N) directly connected to orange tank tends to overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to stick a grey tank underneath.
