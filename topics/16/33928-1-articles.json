I guess it could vary -- if the star systems are ridiculously close together, starting from a high orbit would probably be the best, whereas if the stars were reasonably far apart, a low orbit would be better, as the Oberth effect provides a \u0022lasting\u0022 benefit to reducing dV use, whereas starting from a high orbit only provides an initial benefit, but nothing beyond that. If the stars were very close (highly unlikely), the initial benefit from starting from a closer location would outweigh the benefit from the Oberth effect, since the trip itself would be too short to fully realize the Oberth effect, but if the stars are placed far apart (much more likely), the benefit from the Oberth effect would outweigh the benefit from starting at an orbit a bit closer to the star. I guess it could be compared to having to walk to a certain location, and being given a choice of either a) starting 750 feet closer to your target than you otherwise would (similar to starting at a high orbit that puts you closer to your target), or \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E being given a bike that tripled your speed.
