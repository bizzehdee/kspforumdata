The biggest challenge, in my opinion, is having enough fuel to execute the maneuvers. The Delta-V\\\u0027s for interplanetary transfers are much larger than Kerbin-Mun missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just ran the numbers (with KSP Orbit Mechanic) for a 850000 km parking orbit around Kerbol; here are the results:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst Delta-V: 13176.5873 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond Delta-V: 5975.8629 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfer Time: 20:19:15:57 (DD:HH:MM:SS)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntercept Angle: 109.828 deg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime between intercept opportunities: 01:21:31:25 (DD:HH:MM:SS)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe data is very sensitive to your initial parking orbit, so your mileage will vary depending on your starting location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-30T06:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWasn\\\u0027t there already a thread of this?
