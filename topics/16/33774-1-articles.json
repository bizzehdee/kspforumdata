There\u0027s not really any good \u0022combo\u0022, you just take the one that fits your delta V needs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, for interplanetary travel: you\u0027re definitely going to want to stick to the LV-N. It has a really low thrust and weights a lot, but it\u0027s efficiency overpower the other effects and really, doing interplanetary travel with another engine is often not worth it at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor orbital transportation, you have a larger choice: depending on the size of your ship, you\u0027re going to want to go somewhere between the Poodle, the LV-909 and the Aerospike. Personally I\u0027m getting a lot of love from the Poodle. A lot of people hate it because compared to a cluster of LV-909 it\u0027S not worth it, but it just looks really good on a ship and reduces the part count. But it just depends the size of what you move. When staying in the Kerbin SOI, LV-Ns are rarely really worth it because they\u0027re slow and heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust remember to take what fits your total mass the most and don\u0027t be afraid to use the LV-N if you\u0027re going away from Kerbin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alguien","CreatedById":1623,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T12:50:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you can get a NERVA (the atomic engine) with one of the big rockomax tanks (32 should be more than enoug, 64 is overkill) into orbit, it should be able to get you into any part of the system\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Margaul","CreatedById":69414,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T12:51:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour best bet is the nuclear engine with the big tanks (Rockomax) attached.

In theory, you could do it with RCS thrusters only, but that takes a lot of patience (though not as much as an ion thruster - which I have used before). Probably your best bet for this purpose is (as has been said already) the Poodle, LV-909 or Aerospike; depends entirely on the mass of what you want to move around. I\u0027ve also had some luck with the Skipper in this regard, though that\u0027s really more than what you need (unless you\u0027re going to be making extreme changes in the inclination of your orbit). An X200-16 is probably a good place to start; add RCS (use the big tank) as a backup and for good measure use a command pod with a fair amount of torque (both of the lander cans work very well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterplanetary (like between Kerbin and...say......Duna or Eve), you definitely want a cluster of LV-Ns.
