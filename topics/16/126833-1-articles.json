As far as I know a plane ist balanced if the center of lift and the center of gravity match. Ideally the COL should be placed behind the COG for the plane to be inherently stable but here\u0027s the problem:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEyerytime I start building a plane with a tailplane that consists of canards the COL is extremely far behind COG even if I add fairly big main wings. It seems to me as if the lift rating of the canards was way too high for their size. Am I misunderstanding something here or does anybody else draw the same conclusions ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI appreciate every helpful answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPillow\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C2uEfNk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022C2uEfNk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T23:46:20Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 11:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pillow\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eno image\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boris-Barboris","CreatedById":133181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T00:08:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEditor CoL vector\u00A0is a lift force, applied to your craft at 1-degree angle of attack.
