This is likely a Deadly Reentry problem. The problem is that I was roving around the grasslands near KSC when something on my craft caught fire. Visual flame trail streaming out the back of the rover, burning sound effect, but I couldn\u0027t tell exactly where it was coming from. I couldn\u0027t imagine any reason why it would be happening, but it didn\u0027t appear to be causing any permanent damage, so I continued on. Well, about a minute later, my driver (in a command seat) exploded in the usual puff of smoke. At that point I checked the F3 log and it said he\u0027d burned up from overheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anybody else experienced this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LongbowEOD","CreatedById":22817,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T14:56:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just reloaded the save from before poor Johnney combusted, and I noticed that his temperature was slowly but steadily climbing for no reason, as long as he was in the command seat.
