I don\u0027t use Mechjeb, so won\u0027t be flying there on autopilot. Rather, I\u0027d like to fly somewhere in the vicinity and then send out a rover to do a more specific search. At the moment I have Jeb out on a recce in the rough area of where I believe it to be, but being so southerly and the weak sunlight, he is literally stumbling around in the dark. He is currently at 65 54 16 S, 67 49 26 W but I haven\u0027t got a clue which direction to send him next to get closer or, if he is still some way off, whether he needs to return to his ship to do a short hop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T08:40:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry, I found it in 0.20 where the sparkly pixel syndrome is more prominent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: How do you change the status to Answered?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-02T09:14:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2013 09:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eurybaric","CreatedById":33541,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T14:20:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you have to edit the first post and then change the title from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T14:42:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is a lot easier to find anomalies in 0.20...just yesterday I used it to find the Armstrong Memorial.
