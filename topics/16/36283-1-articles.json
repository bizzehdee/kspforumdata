I\u0027ve tried searching the forum and Google with no results, so I apologize if this has been asked and answered before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I am referring to the issue where docked modules tend to have a \u0027bounce\u0027 when loaded in, or upon docking at all. For example, a Mun or Minimus low g base - I\u0027ll typically have my modules destroyed because they \u0027jump\u0027 20 meters in the air on some ends, while other modules stay grounded. Adding quantum struts only makes it a bit more balanced, but still a big jump. This has happened to me with every kind of docking port, particularly with high mass objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way around this? The KAS docking has it\u0027s own issues, but you can work around them a bit. I\u0027d much rather be able to connect up modules and leave them connected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone had success with any methods?

As you said, it\u0027s worse with High Mass Objects cause the Ports are pulling all of that weight into the Station / Base which causes problems. You can try the Low Attraction Docking Ports Mod which reduces the Magnetic Force the Ports need. It requires abit more spot on precision, but it does help. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/lowattractiondockingport/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elowattractiondockingport/\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, when the new ASAS system comes in next Update, it might help with stabalizing problems like this. You will be able to leave ASAS and RCS Thrusters On in Stations at all times with no problems [we hope]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darren9","CreatedById":58062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T04:54:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way around it and it\u0027s been around for a while. Because the connections between components have some flexibility under gravity they bend and the whole thing \u0022sags\u0022 over the uneven ground. The physics engine/save system can\u0027t seem to save a part to part connection that\u0027s \u0022sagged\u0022 or flexed, when it\u0027s loaded or reloaded every connection is made straight, it puts some parts (normally legs) slightly under ground and some slightly above instead of curved over it and the underground bits pop up with some force. If you want to build something big you have to go to ice-flats, even that though only works up to a certain size. Unfortunately I\u0027ve had to abandon several large constructions. The biggest basses have all been on the Minimus ice flats.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krisism","CreatedById":71149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T05:01:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you both for the info.
