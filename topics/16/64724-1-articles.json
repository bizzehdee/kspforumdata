The problem: for some reason, it tries to turn to the left or right at seemingly random times. At first, it was yaw, so I removed the dynamic vertical stabilizer and replaced it with a static one. That fixed the yaw problem, but now it was rolling! Everything should be stable, with the CoM in front to the CoL, and the CoT in line with the CoM.

That has no inherent stability and the vehicle is as likely roll as not. Try making the wings shoulder-mounted so that the weight is hanging from the wings, and the plane will have a slight but helpful tendency to stay upright. I don\u0027t see an obvious cause for unwanted yaw, though.
