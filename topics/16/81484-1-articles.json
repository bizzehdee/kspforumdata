A spaceplane doesn\u0027t need to be all that maneuverable or even capable of long-term flight.

I find it isn\u0027t hard to make a vertical-launch rocket into an SSTO. You just need enough fuel to keep the engine going the whole way without making it too heavy to lift off.\u003Cp\u003E...and of course there\u0027s some rocket science in there, but that\u0027s the gist of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it can be a plane SSTO with Rapier, it is not necessary. Careful balancing and watching the flight profile can get you to nearly 2,400 m/sec and over 36,000 meters before burnout. A small burn with rockets and you are in orbit. The design below will place Jeb into a low Mun orbit and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CjSDej9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CjSDej9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ummJbBL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ummJbBL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ejection burnout.
