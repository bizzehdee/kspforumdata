I\u0027ve hit a weird stumbling block, so I am hoping more experienced rocketeers can help me out. Stupid question below\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am trying to understand how to calculate the period of an orbit, elliptical or circular, and in my searching I came across this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period#Small_body_orbiting_a_central_body\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period#Small_body_orbiting_a_central_body\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is simple enough, and it makes sense, but I\u0027m a little perplexed because the article says the formula is for elliptical or circular orbits and only depends on the semi-major axis. Does that mean in a situation where you have a circular 250km orbit, and a 250kmx150km elliptical orbit, they have the same period? I know the velocity will vary over that orbit, but it seems like they shouldn\u0027t be the same, am I reading that correctly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMatt\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-20T17:27:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2013 05:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by photogineer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meithan","CreatedById":76123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T17:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat formula\u0027s correct (and by the way, it\u0027s pretty much Kepler\u0027s Third Law).
