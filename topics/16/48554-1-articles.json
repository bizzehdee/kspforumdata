It\u0027s a big long burn, usually done with nuclear engines (efficient, but not that fast, especially when pushing a massive vessel with landers, etc etc) and you\u0027re limited to 4x acceleration at most; often, you have to make multiple passes (to take full advantage of the Oberth effect) because it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eso\u003C/em\u003E long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, as part of answering someone\u0027s question about HyperEdit, I was messing around with teleporting a very simple ship (1-kerb capsule with parachute and decoupler on top of a tall SRB) I\u0027d already built for something else into Mun orbit.
