Yes if the science is kept inside the canister, you must return the canister to Kerbin\u0027s surface. But you can use a Kerbal on EVA to take the data and place it in a command pod, in which case the goo canister need not be returned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If you have taken the science out of a goo canister (either by a Kerbal on EVA as per 1 above or by transmitting) the goo canister will become unusable... unless you reset it, in which case it can be used again. If the science is still inside, resetting the canister will wipe the science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I think I\u0027ve got myself confused there with point 2.

What ElWanderer said. You don\u0027t get credit for the science unless you bring it back to Kerbin and recover it with the ship. This works if the science is still sitting in the science instrument that acquired it, and also works if the science is sitting in your command pod because you transferred it there via a kerbal on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u0022Reset experiment\u0022 throws away the science and you get no credit for it. Don\u0027t do this unless you actually don\u0027t need it. This functionality is there mainly as an \u0022undo button\u0022 in case you take a science measurement that you didn\u0027t mean to. For example, you have a ship that you\u0027re sending to the Mun, but it\u0027s currently in low Kerbin orbit. You accidentally trigger your goo canister, but you don\u0027t want to keep the science result because you already got a goo result for near-Kerbin space on an earlier mission, so it\u0027s worth zero now. So you click \u0022reset experiment\u0022 so that the goo canister will stay available for your arrival at the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the ability to transmit science instead of returning it. This is mainly useful for crew reports and EVA reports. Everything else is of questionable benefit to transmit, because 1. you lose a large percentage of the science points when you transmit, and 2. if you then go out and collect the science again to bring back to Kerbin, the points you got from transmitting are taken out of the points you get for returning them. So you don\u0027t actually gain anything by transmitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason to transmit is when you have a one-way mission, e.g. a Mun lander that doesn\u0027t take off again. In that case you transmit because half a loaf is better than none.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T23:42:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jiminator\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jiminator\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Enote that scientists can take the experiment out and reset the canister which allows it to be used again. if you put the science into the ship you can then transmit it... and repeat the process.
