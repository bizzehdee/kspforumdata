I decided to test it a bit now to try and answer your questions. I couldn\u0027t however get the same results as you, my main engine(s) were shut down correctly and my pod decoupled when I hit abort, no matter what order I added them to my abort action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up, I don\u0027t know of a way to remove \u0027disconnected stages\u0027, you have to manually trigger them. However, to get around the issue of having to go through them to deploy your parachutes you can simply make a separate action group for your parachutes. Personally I use 9 for abort and 0 for parachutes, you could use backspace to abort then hit 0 (or any other preferrable action group number).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor further help I think we\u0027d need your craft file to try and troubleshoot your engine issue, I simply added \u0027shutdown engine\u0027 for my main engines into my abort group and it worked flawlessly so I\u0027m not sure why yours wouldn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T14:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@thescientist. There is no reason to quote the whole OP if you are the first response. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the original question - for a workaround you might hit X to cut engines before you abort. Or maybe in the action groups, set up \u0022cut all engines\u0022 first, then add \u0022decouple capsule\u0022 or whatever after. I don\u0027t know if that will change anything, but it might be worth a shot if you haven\u0027t already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T14:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your answers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually I remembered the action is a little bit more complex - it shuts down all \u0022forward\u0022 engines and activates all \u0022backward\u0022 engines to pull the rest from the escaping module. I don\u0027t know if it plays role.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHitting X is not an option because I need my escape engines to pull me out of the mess. I even wish there was an action to put throttle to the max because now I need to be at full throttle for the abort sequence to work correctly. Looking for two keys to press in sequence in tight situations is not very comfortable either but I guess it\u0027s the best I can get. And using custom action groups to manually perform the last two stages is probably good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try to collect and post my craft file when I get back home because I really wonder what I am doing wrong.
