Here\u0027s the story. Lodner, Aldtrey and Rohat have had a great time derping about on the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Now their Mk.1-2 capsule is hurtling back towards Kerbin. I\u0027ve set the periapsis at about half the atmospheric height (50 km in 6.4x), yet lose only about 500 m/s of my 8400 m/s entry speed. I\u0027ve also tried setting the periapsis to about 30 km, but still I skip off into an eccentric orbit. During each pass, periapsis is lowered by maybe 1000 - 1500 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt a certain point periapsis is in the 20-25 km range. This results in the craft slamming into terrain at roundabout 2000 m/s. Is this a thing with 6.4x? Re-entering spacecraft (oddly, a HGR soyjuice capsule did the same re-entry without problems) not slowing down enough? I have got FAR installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEdit: Answered! Problem was a heatshield that clipped the command pod. That thing has two nodes, I attached the bottom shield node to the capsule.

Ensure that it\u0027s a bottom-to-top connection, and not a bottom-to-bottom connection: a bottom-to-bottom confuses FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, while this isn\u0027t your problem (if it\u0027s not a clipped heat shield, it\u0027s something else wrong with FAR), you can also try a lifting reentry. If you pitch up above your surface velocity vector*, the heat shield will give you some lift, and help moderate reentry. If you pitch below, the opposite effect occurs. If your reaction wheels aren\u0027t strong enough (usually the case in RO), you can try an asymmetric mass distribution: if CoM is above the midline, drag will naturally cause you to tilt in the proper direction, allowing you to use roll instead of pitch to control lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Just to be 100% clear: pitch your capsule above your surface retrograde marker. In my experience, about 2-5 degrees works, dependent on how much room for error there is before surface-attached parts start frying.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-21T15:39:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2014 03:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dorin6565","CreatedById":40540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T18:10:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have 0.90, FAR, DRE, and 6.4x installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have had a similar experience yesterday with 6.4x with deadly reentry on hard without the real heat (bottom button) option.
