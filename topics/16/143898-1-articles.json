And I don\u0027t understand the map, I\u0027ve seen videos of people make markers and then theres a trajectory line and a icon on the ball thing but I can\u0027t figure out how to do that, I cant even figure out how to zoom in. The controls on console are just so bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-16T04:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking markers and that sort of thing only come when you\u0027ve upgraded your Tracking Station to Tier 2.
