My 3-tank design is a central core of Structural Fuselages with 3-way ports on each end and the 3 orange tanks mounted radially. Each tank can be detached using the radial decoupler and has docking ports on either end, so a ship can come along and carry one away to use as extra fuel. When bringing new fuel to my station I have the option of adding the new 3 onto the previous 3 or deorbiting the old 3 and replacing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy minmus station in theory receives kethane from the surface, but so far I installed Kethane when i found resources weren\u0027t coming next patch, landed a big kethane refinery and orbital lifter then have never used them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Laythe station I\u0027ve recently began receives one orange tank at a time from the same design I use to rescue stranded crafts.

The side tanks allow it to get to most places without tapping the main tank, and with 4 engines I still get a decent burn time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T16:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is my standard refuelling vehicle.
