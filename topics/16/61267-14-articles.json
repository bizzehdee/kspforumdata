When in doubt, organise. Even though making a dedicated launcher for each payload with strictly calculated Delta-V may cut down on funds, but is time consuming and prone to human factor mistakes. Create a lifter stage that can reliably, cheaply and efficiently lift up to a certain ton threshold, then make it a subassembly. If you now use the save files for the payload only, you can mix and match, but this means you cannot directly access craft from the launch pad. Also, remember to upgrade your lifters as you unlock new tech nodes for increased performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.Reusability is key to a successful space program. Solid rocket boosters are dirt-cheap and therefore more expendable than liquid ones. This is also a reason to be simple and cheap to your lifter stages, as the debris despawning distance makes any recovery attempt futile, so don\u0027t even try getting parachutes on those (however, this can be averted with the StageRecovery mod) Now, if you\u0027re somehow blessed with the talent to easily make anything close to SSTO rockets or even spaceplanes with a respectable payload capacity, you have won half the game (you of course can\u0027t use SSTOs to lift everything, but the average mass of most versatile enough modules is around 8 to 10 tons) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If you want maximum efficiency, always have a TWR of just over 1 while ascending via throttling down. It will ensure you don\u0027t get any drag losses from the atmosphere. However, this can take a while, if you don\u0027t have my patience, either check out a spreadsheet with terminal velocities at each height, or at least always keep the TWR to less than 1.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Be conservative in your parts tests.On landings, make sure you are firmly attached to the launchpad with Stabilisers which you must not detach for 100% recovery rate. On flights, forget role 1: everything must be customly calculated to make sure the part gets at minimum altitude x with minimum speed y. On the other hand, orbital tests only specify the altitude, not the velocity, so it\u0027s easier to calculate how to get them up there efficiently -you might even want to incorporate them with something else you want to do, like using a Poodle test to go to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fahmiy123","CreatedById":109858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T12:09:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei learn more in KSP , something like \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.how to forget GF that we\u0027ve been having an affair with another man\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehehee , \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei learn how to build a rocket with aerodynamic body when i install \u003Cstrong\u003EFAR mods.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei learn how to orbit my own rocket in kerbin without fuel cheat (I honestly do not know that time)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei learn how to creat rendezvous node .
