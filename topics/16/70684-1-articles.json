You generally focus on things by double-clicking them, right? But the first click on a maneuver node causes the handles to open up and the second click does not bring the maneuver node in focus. But if the maneuver node is collapsed, and if you click twice quickly, first \u003Cem\u003Eoff\u003C/em\u003E the maneuver node and then the second click is \u003Cem\u003Eon\u003C/em\u003E the maneuver node, it will consider it a double-click on the maneuver node and bring it into focus! (Does not work if it\u0027s too close to a planet.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can then zoom on it and see things which may not be clearly visible from the opposite side of the solar system, such as how close it is to the AN/DN, or how closely it coincides with a planetary intercept on a future orbit (if you\u0027re into that sort of thing).
