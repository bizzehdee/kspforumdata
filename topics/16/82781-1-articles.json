I mostly use the autopilot if I want to land in a precise spot in an a body without atmosphere. Usually, I just use the prediction to account for planetary rotation. I don\u0027t manage to land rockets precisely at the KSC, though. But, then again, to me landing withing 20 km is good enough. My trouble with recovering rockets isn\u0027t so much distance but keeping the whole thing from tumbling over and breaking after touchdown.\n"}]}
