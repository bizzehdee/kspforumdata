That way you don\u0027t have to repeat missions just to run a new experiment. It\u0027s handy to have as many science parts as you can before you land on the Mun and Minmus. You don\u0027t have to go all-out, though. As suggested, it depends what you want to do next.

Once you have OX-STAT strap-on solar panels and Fuel Ducts, I\u0027d get all the 45-point tier techs unlocked and then move along the bottom of the tech tree to gain access to more experiments. The gravioli detector is a particularly nice one to gain access to at the earliest opportunity. You might also consider a few along the top - Heavy Rocketry for example. You can get a lot into orbit on Skipper engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxwellsDemon","CreatedById":147660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T14:39:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I did prior to my first Science campaign was to identify specific parts I wanted to use (e.g., nuclear rockets or rover wheels), and then determine which steps I needed to research in which order to get there.
