However, my question is can you leave for a planet anytime you want if you have enough fuel? Or given some mathematical formula I don\u0027t know, you can\u0027t hit another planet, Jool for instance at the 96.58 deg phase angle from Kerbin, regardless of how much fuel you expend?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pursuedtank","CreatedById":50078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T01:38:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith enough fuel and plenty of time you could leave at any time and still get into orbit. However you would have to expend a lot of fuel and possibly do a few orbits before you could get an encounter. This is what I did on my first interplanetary mission before I learned about the phase angles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mubzat","CreatedById":68092,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T01:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes it is completely possible to get an encounter without waiting for the target planet to allign. It will most likely be less fuel efficient and your kerbals may have to spend a few years in space. But yes, totally possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Conarr","CreatedById":60613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T01:51:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay. On my trip to Duna I followed the phase angle advice, but I wanted to see if it was possible if I developed ADHD or grew impatient and just burned for it. My little probe has tons of fuel, but I should probably just wait an launch when the stars align. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow the Doofenshmirtz do you change the thread thingy from unanswered to answered?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-30T01:53:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2013 01:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Conarr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matticus88","CreatedById":30754,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T12:13:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should be able to edit your first post to change its tag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you could burn in the oposite direction to a planets orbit direction, of course you\u0027d have an awful lot of speed to kill when you reach the planet... unless you\u0027ve built an impacter lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr_jt","CreatedById":58149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T12:45:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPachycephalosaurus\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-06T13:00:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2013 01:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by dr_jt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PaleoGamer","CreatedById":66992,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T12:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dr_jt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dr_jt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGood question.
