In KSP everything rotates in the same direction. That is prograde. If you view that from the \u0022top\u0022 looking at the northpole, that is anti-clockwise or mathematically positive. But: If you look at it from below, looking at the south pole, it actually is clockwise! That\u0027s why we use terms like prograde and retrograde to make it clear. :]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BoilingOil","CreatedById":153076,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T05:22:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy simple way of looking at it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
