Using the dV spent in trying to circularize, I\u0027ll guestimate what I need and then double it so that I might be able to also visit a moon or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s not cost-efficient but its fun going into the unknown not knowing if the mission will succeed or not. And I think of the early days of NASA\u0027s Moon exploration when they just sent probes to gather data doing flyby\u0027s and impacts dozens of times using the early Pioneer and Ranger probes, while the USSR was using their Luna probes. It was very Kerbal times back then, with launch failures, flybys and crashes into the moon, and that\u0027s how I play \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m similar to you except I plan the mission out roughly with maneuver nodes when the dV charts can\u0027t help.
