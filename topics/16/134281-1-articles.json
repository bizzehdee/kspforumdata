Sorry about the mix up (it also took longer than just a few hours, sorry again). \u00A0A couple notes about flying it. Because the back wheels are so close together, it\u0027s pretty unstable on the ground, so be extra careful on takeoff/landing. \u00A0Also, the roll response is pretty slow, if you want you could use\u00A0bigger main wings/better control surfaces. \u00A0And because the wings are so small it has a high wing loading (craft mass to wing area ratio), which means that it\u0027s stall speed is fairly high, around 70-80 m/s. \u00A0The few times I was able to successfully land I had to come in pretty steep, and as slow as I could, then do a big flare right at the end to kill my vertical speed (kinda like the Space Shuttle).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave fun with it, I did!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-17T03:39:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2016 03:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FullMetalMachinist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
