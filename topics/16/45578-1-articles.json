What I would like to see is a \u0022time\u0022 map. I know the distance between objects is constantly changing, but I would like to see a range of travel time for multiple objects. The reason I ask is because I use Ioncross. I need to know how much O2 I have to bring along to keep my crew alive through out their entire mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T00:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlexmoon\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELaunch Window Calculator\u003C/a\u003E plots interplanetary trajectories according to their estimated travel time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blue","CreatedById":1917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T01:03:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rule of thumb is that Moho\u0027s ideal launch window recurs every month or so, and a round trip to Eeloo takes in the order of 3 years.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T13:22:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think Alexmoon\u0027s Launch Window Calculator is your best bet - it tells you day of departure, day of arrival and time of transit. What you can do then is plug in the information for the initial transit, get the day of arrival, and then plug \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;that\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; day in as the earliest date for the return leg (often there\u0027s a long period between the day you arrive at a different planet and the day you leave). Plan the mission to take at least as long as the day of arrival back at Kerbin on the return leg, and add a little more as a reserve (maybe 5-10% or so).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
