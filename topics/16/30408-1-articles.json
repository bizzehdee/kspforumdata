Hence the tip about the extra probe body; when you change which pod you\u0027re controlling from, the navball will reorient so that \u0022up\u0022 for the navball (i.e. which way the \u0022wings\u0022 are facing) is the same direction as the top of the probe body itself. That will allow you to better correct for any drift you might experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reblet","CreatedById":64545,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T09:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also found the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/18230-0-20-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-6-0-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/a\u003E very useful for manual landings.

This of course assumes you have a good engine for the landing. If it has too much thrust, an analog throttle would still be useless due to the great differences in thrust output even in small throttle increments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T09:46:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly advice I can think to add is to try to cancel out your horizontal velocity higher up.

In the low gravity, even small bumps risk throwing you off on weird angles and flaming death, it\u0027s harder to touch down gently because the elevation of the surface is changing as you\u0027re moving over it, it\u0027s much harder to build a rolling vehicle that can withstand the shock, and of course there\u0027s no air to help you conserve fuel and slow your descent.
