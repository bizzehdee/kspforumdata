Personally, id love for teh game to add larger and way more powerful reaction wheels, as well as some to fit the MK-2 and MK-3 fuselage, and maybee one to fit the 3.75m rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for burn times, either make your orbit high enough that you can do it in 1 burn, or as someone here mentioned, do it in multiple burns, so you have a AP thats more or less near the max height it can be without breaking orbit. This is ofc very annoying with any bodies nearby (forget doing this near jool, and kerbin\u0027s mun seems to be rather notorious at getting in the way as well, but with some luck/reloading game saves, you can get past this complication). Its best to do this burn quite late, as the longer you wait, the higher the probability something will block your orbit. Another possibility is using agravity assist, but those are very tough to set up, difficult to execute, and still require quite a bit of burning. personally for longer burn times (above 10 minutes), i just raise the orbit to 100km, or if its super long, i make a new ship, as im not patient enough to deal with any burns that are more then around 20 minutes, even if i use x4 time compression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022workerbee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022workerbee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like this method but if you\u0027re waiting for a transfer that is a few weeks or months out, it is very likely that your orbit will eventually become disrupted by Mun or Minimus.

You can time warp fast enough past the intercept that the game never has time to calculate what the body did to your orbit. This can also be done to avoid collisions (you will phase thru the planet if you warp fast enough), but again, i dont use this personally as it is defenetely cheating (heck, at this point ill use Hedit to save the ship, or just let it crash like its suppost to)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-18T20:10:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2014 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"workerbee","CreatedById":131450,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T20:25:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI truly wish that larger crafts did not have so much joint movement...perhaps a different, more circular design is in order...sort of like the craft they use in the movie Interstellar.
