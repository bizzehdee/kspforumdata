Since it doesn\u0027t take that long to get to Mun, you basically have to wait till the polar orbit is near tangent to the Mun\u0027s orbit (so that it\u0027s nearly a circle when you look at it from Kerbin). Personally I would still launch in an equatorial Kerbin orbit, then do a midcourse correction to a polar Munar orbit half way there. That should keep the overall dV low while still providing flexibility and the ability to recover from a mistake. Realize that at the two times during the Kerbin month when you can transfer, the polar orbit will be going opposite directions. So you\u0027ll have to pay attention to if your station is north-bound or south-bound on your approach trajectory when you set up the Munar encounter for the inbound ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully that makes sense without me making a picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I should also recommend that you might want to set your station orbit so that the transfer windows happen during the full and new moon times (when the Mun is in-line with Kerbin and the Sun).
