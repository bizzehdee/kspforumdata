My Mun probe is equipped 6 Communatron 16 antenna\u0027s. My Communication satellites in Kerbostationary orbit (3 in total) are each equipped with 2 HG-5 Relay Antenna\u0027s as well as 4 cummunatron 16 antenna\u0027s. When my Mun Probe is in direct line of sight with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (I disabled the additional ground stations) the signal comes through just fine. but once \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E moves away from LOS the probe looses connection. My relay antenna\u0027s don\u0027t pick up the signal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I correct when I say I not only need sufficient sending capabilities on my probes, but that my relay satellites also need more relay antenna\u0027s or a more powerful relay Antenna?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-03T20:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like the key is line of site.

They do not combine with relay antennas, so they do not provide any benefit to a relay ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am assuming that your antenna range is set to 100% in your difficulty settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour 6 antennas on the probe give you 6Mm range. Your 2 HG5 antennas on your relay ships also have about a 6Mm range. Your probe is at an altitude of 11Mm above Kerbin, and your relays are at an altitude of about 3Mm, so the distance between them is 8Mm, and you will always be just out of range. So yes, you either need another relay much closer to the Mun, or you need more power in your relays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
