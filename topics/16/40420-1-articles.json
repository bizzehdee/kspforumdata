Try switching over to the lander and right clicking the dockingport, it should have the \u0022decouple\u0022 or \u0022undock\u0022 option,do that and the decoupler should detach from the rest of the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ryan7074","CreatedById":73794,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T07:19:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYES! it worked you were right ,i try right clicking the decoupler but that didnt work so i tryed it on the docking port and it poped right off thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorpi15","CreatedById":34189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T08:14:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour problem was that your decoupler was wrong. The little red arrow is where the decoupler detaches from, and it stays attached to the side without the arrow, typically the bottom. The decoupler (and arrow) can be rotated with the WASD keys. If you want to decouple from both sides then use a stack separator, but it leaves debris.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
