Engine thrust scales with atmospheric density now, and while Duna\u0027s atmosphere is less dense than Kerbin\u0027s, you\u0027re going to be reducing the engines\u0027 already-paltry thrust. Try going for a single 2.5 metre capsule and engine, perhaps a Skipper or Poodle? Heck, even aerospikes, due to that they maintain the same ISP regardless of atmosphere. All those nukes are just increasing your ship\u0027s mass far more than it needs to be, and you need bigger rockets to get it to Duna in the first place.\n\nBear in mind that this is just my personal preference, and if you like the nukes, feel free to keep them.

You just need to hold \u0022D\u0022 and the very low amount of torque should prevent you from overdoing it.\n\nBut once you decouple the SRB you have the classic issue you get with long and thin rockets : they wubble like hell. You have to deactivate the SAS and pilot it yourself (you can also reduce the gimbal). But I found it to have good tolerance with the usual \u0022fliping rocket problem\u0022 that happen when you\u0027re not ligned up with your prograde vector.\n\nThe ascending stage is supposed to put yourself in LKO. After that, decouple. You have then the transfering stage.\n\n![1438740480-2015-08-05-00007.jpg](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2015/32/1438740480-2015-08-05-00007.jpg)\n\nThe ship is designed to be aerocaptured by Duna. Before entering it\u0027s atmosphere, decouple, and you have a heat shield. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s really necessary but, well, you never know what can happen with future updates. They could make aerobreaking even worse than it\u0027s already is.\n\n![1438740483-2015-08-05-00008.jpg](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2015/32/1438740483-2015-08-05-00008.jpg)\n\nThen decouple and you have the final stage I already showed you. You have two drogue chutes then three classic chutes. A retroburn before touch down is required.\n\nAfter that the rocket can go home. Deouple before entering Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and you have a new heat shield. Don\u0027t forget to repack the chutes !\n\nAnd here you go. Each stage have extra fuel so you can make some mistakes, but nothing too extreme.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T02:26:04Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 02:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tatonf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T02:40:16Z","Content":"This is my Duna lander.
