He put a junior docking adapter on, and I was chuckling to myself because then his crew would be stuck in the lander. \u0027why did he do that?\u0027 I thought to myself.\n\nWell he did that, it turns out, because you can transfer crew just fine through the teeny tiny junior docking port. The one that has a description in game of \u0027its usable for transferring resources, but not crew\u0027. The main reason I\u0027ve been building unnecessarily large landers because you can\u0027t really put the normal docking adapter on the small mk1 pods or lander cans. \n\nSo what other examples are there where the game says one thing, but does another?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T12:39:48Z","Content":"Well, it was *supposed* to work like that, but at the moment Kerbals can be transferred through **struts**, let alone the tiny docking ports.\n\nI haven\u0027t noticed much else... though the unshrouded solar panels do not give a warning as to their lack of retractability."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T13:12:41Z","Content":"Think of it that way: The kerbals don\u0027t travel through the port.

My guess is that the original description was written for \u0022color\u0022 rather than trying to impart any specific game rules (similar to the cutesy warnings about explosions, for things that don\u0027t actually explode), and then when they added the crew transfer feature, nobody thought to go back and check all the part descriptions."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T16:15:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, it was *supposed* to work like that, but at the moment Kerbals can be transferred through **struts**, let alone the tiny docking ports.\n\u003E I haven\u0027t noticed much else... though the unshrouded solar panels do not give a warning as to their lack of retractability.\n\nIm pretty sure there is an orange warning under item icon in its description."},{"CreatedByName":"Nookos","CreatedById":144067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T17:01:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ... at the moment Kerbals can be transferred through **struts**, let alone the tiny docking ports...\n\nAsteroids is a good one too.
