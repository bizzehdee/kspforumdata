In this space-station picture I\u0026#39;d just finished manually docking the tug, on the right.

But if something out of the ordinary happens it goes nuts firing your engine and the only way to stop it is shut down the engine, cancel the command (which does nothing), then go back to the space center and return to the craft so the command really goes away. It\u0026#39;s very specific that it must be used as intended but gets confused easily. For example, if you forget to stage an engine, and a maneuver times out, it gives you an error. Activating the starts engine suddenly and won\u0026#39;t stop. If you execute a node and then delete the node, it starts but forgets to stop, on one occasion I had it do that for no apparent reason at all. Having two craft burn at once sounds like it\u0026#39;s just asking for trouble. EDIT: Actually I now even want to take that back, the thing is terrible outright. It can\u0026#39;t even hold the maneuver node correctly.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T05:47:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 05:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T02:32:40Z","Content":"\nI\u0026#39;m pretty sure that KSP kills any ships that are below a certain height in the atmosphere.\n"}]}
