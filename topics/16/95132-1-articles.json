The rover should be square (wheels on the corners) with the center of gravity as low as you can get it. I tend to use the smallest rover wheel because it makes for a lighter rover, so fuel savings for both the launcher and lander, and lower top speeds make it less likely to flip, which is VERY easy to do on the Mun with the larger wheels. The lander needs to be low enough for the docking magnetic force to pick up the little rover and lock it on. You\u0027ll have to do some test runs to make sure it works. The lander\u0027s rockets need to be on the side or angled out (I\u0027ve done both) so they don\u0027t blast the rover or landing legs. Also make sure you place your landing legs so that the rover can easily drive out from under the lander. And as mentioned above, bring a flashlight! (although for some strange reason it seems like lights don\u0027t always illuminate the Mun\u0027s surface, has anyone else noticed that?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
