Inevitably you are going to use a tiny amount to get into orbit. Your best bet is to dock at a space station and empty your liquid fuel tank and fill up your LF/OX tanks to head interplanetary, then you might actually have more than the 2600m/s to play around with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T03:58:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see you have the different engines in their own stages. If you click and drag them so that engine is at the bottom of the staging stack (2 in this case). MJ will show you the maximum possible delta v that engine would have with the fuel supplied to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour real delta v from there is entirely up to how you pilot it. The way MJ shows delta v is assuming you\u0027ll stage exactly like you have it arranged as soon as that stage goes dry (like on a rocket). Usually you don\u0027t fly SSTOs that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally on SSTOs its best to be short on the oxidizer and be tapping the rockets just as your liquid fuel starts to equalize with your oxidizer levels. I tend to use LOX tanks anyway so if I want to top it all off for my space engines at a space station then you don\u0027t have a whole lot of liquid fuel sitting around, or empty space, you can\u0027t use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4rt14n","CreatedById":101179,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T04:28:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay I switched the staging around so Nerva goes to 0 and it\u0027s showing dV of 2900.

Usually I just over-engineer rockets with massive dV and winging it to go to space. Unfortunately KASA decided to cut funding for space station so no refueling for the meantime. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T05:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually get more creative with how I flow the oxy and the fuel so MJ give better numbers, but this isn\u0027t always ideal since you may want all fuel available to all engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want accurate dV numbers from MJ for your space plane, your best bet is configure the fuel the way it would be when you use a particular engine. Then put that engine at the bottom of the staging stack. MJ will then output a dV number for you for that engine/staging point in your profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for the example you posted, your NERVA has more than 2600 dV available. It\u0027s just showing that because it\u0027s trying to push all that extra liquid fuel that your TurboJets would eat up. So adjust your liquid fuel to levels you normally see once you\u0027re in orbit (after your TurboJets have gotten you there). You can leave your engine staging the way it is, or move your lander stage up higher to be more accurate. Then the bottom line of MJ will tell you the NERVA dV available for your trip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4rt14n","CreatedById":101179,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T05:33:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to separate tanks for Jets and Nerva because of weird shifting issues. Since I\u0027m using the T-joint to merge two tanks together to 1 Nerva, if the jet fuel tanks feed into it, it will use the right tank first shifting the weight to the right. Or something like that. Not really sure what\u0027s going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso in theory, the jet fuel would be used halfway first, shifting weight to the front.

The problem is that only one connector on the dual side connects. So half your fuel stack isn\u0027t feeding the NERVA. You\u0027ll have to find a place to route fuel lines if you use the multi-couplers like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, even with separate tanks, MJ assumes you use all the fuel of a stage before activating the next stage.
