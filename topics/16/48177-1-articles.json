I was thinking maybe I should try doing a spaceplane, but I forgot that whatever is on Eve is probably not oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway to answer the OP it is Duna and Ike. Duna is actually not that hard. If you are having trouble with parachutes on Duna, remember to do your deorbit burn from 180 degrees away, so that your entry into atmo includes a nice long horizontal slice of air, that you are more or less pointed at a valley. Also strut the daylights out of whatever your chute is attached to, to whatever you\u0027d like to make it to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, also, also, it is very helpful to plan a Duna lander like a Mun lander, with parachutes. You still need a descent stage, and you want to turn it on at least three times during descent: once before you pop your chutes, once when you reach the fully-open altitude of your chutes, and once before you hit the ground. In the first and second cases, having some kind of decelerating thrust will keep the chutes\u0027 jerk from ripping your vessel to pieces. In the third case, you just need a little extra lift to bring your velocity down to under 5 m/s. Duna is so light, that if your landing vessel is tall, or wobbly, it may bounce back off the surface so you have to have some fuel to make up those last few m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T17:46:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely Duna and Gilly, which is exactly what I\u0027m doing.
