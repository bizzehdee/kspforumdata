I\u0027d start by investigating the forward-aft relationship between COM and COL, and how that changes as fuel is burned.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENext, are you turning on SAS? I find that extremely helpful. Short vessels with COM and COL very close together can be difficult to control, they rotate very readily and are easy to pitch rapidly past your target.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETo add pitch stability, try moving your COL a little further aft, and increasing the arm of your pitch control surface- with a traditional elevator move the elevator location further aft. (With a canard style pitch actuator, move it further forward. In a real aircraft, increasing pitch stability this way would come with a small drag increase, but I\u0027m not sure if KSP would give a significant amount of extra drag.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGood luck!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(BTW, This thread dates back to November.) All of what you say is valid, but KSP has a few quirks. Such as the fact that landing gear actually have no mass or drag.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESo the landing gear isn\u0027t going to cause pitch stability issues, except that it will cause the CoM in the SPH to lie, since the CoM marker takes landing gear mass into account. In flight, landing gear have no mass or drag effects so if you plan very little margin between CoM and CoL (likely for a small plane), KSP will bite you because the in-flight CoM usually ends up slightly aft of the SPH position.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEdit: Here\u0027s an example of what I\u0027m talking about.

Frankly, it\u0027s shortsighted in terms of scope -- if the OP were discussing a CoL / CoM imbalance of the size we\u0027re discussing, and the plane massed hundreds of tons, dozens of meters wide, five or six meters tall, etc., then this Co[X] discrepancy \u003Cem\u003Eas a function of overall fuselage length, wing chord length, and the length of distribution of pitch authority surfaces fore and aft\u003C/em\u003E... then yes, this would be an insignificant imbalance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut look at the photo in the OP, d00d.
