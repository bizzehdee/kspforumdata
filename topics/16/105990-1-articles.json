Is lift then pulling it back to lateral positions?\n\nIMO vertical structures should not apply their lift rating, except for when you change the angle of attack accordingly?\n\nWhat about the lift from fully or partially clipped parts?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T15:04:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 03:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Falkenherz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:04:59Z","Content":"For vertical pieces I guess it depends on the type symmetry you are using: radial shout generate roll, and mirror yaw or pitch. It may also depends on orientation of the parts.\n\nIf you launch a balanced plane vertically, lift should generate speed radially and you plane will move in the direction of its back.\n\nAnd I think clipping does not change lift, seeing the number of clipped parts in many creations."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:07:54Z","Content":"Lift vector is perpendicular to wing orientation, and \u0022backwards\u0022 from velocity vector, and scaled by AoA.
