The lower your peri the steeper your sun dive will be and the quicker you\u0027ll get there. With Kerbol the gravity is so high that even a small difference in periapsis can have a huge effect on the length of the mission. So be a comet and get dangerously close."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T01:17:28Z","Content":"Also, what\u0027s your day length? I\u0027m guessing you\u0027re using 6-hour days, so that\u0027s more like 22.5 days compared to 19."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T01:22:26Z","Content":"Actually, it won\u0027t make that much of a difference.\n\nYour orbital period depends on the average of your apoapsis and periapsis. Most of your orbit time is spent far from the sun, so as long as your periapsis is pretty low, making it lower will have only a small effect on the time taken.\n\nThe length of time for an elliptical (or circular) orbit is proportional to (Rpe \u002B Rap)^1.5. Kerbin\u0027s orbital period is 426 days. So, let\u0027s figure out \u0022what\u0027s the fastest Hohmann transfer down to the sun\u0022:\n\n- Apoapsis is at Kerbin\n\n- Periapsis is the lowest possible, for a fast orbit-- let\u0027s say zero.\n\nThat means that your average orbital radius for that highly-eccentric elliptical path will be 1/2 that of Kerbin\u0027s orbit. Therefore, its orbital period will be 0.353 of Kerbin\u0027s. You only want half of that (i.e. you\u0027re interested in \u0022how long to get to the sun\u0022, not \u0022how long for a round trip\u0022), so that makes 0.17677 of a Kerbin year. Kerbin takes 426 Kerbin days to orbit the sun.\n\nTherefore, the time taken to reach the sun in this best-case scenario will be **75 Kerbin days**.\n\nSo yes, you will get there faster if you lower your periapsis, but not by much-- the absolute best you can hope to do will be to reduce the time from 90 to 75 days.\n\nSo, if someone did it in 19 days, then that means something else is going on. I haven\u0027t watched the video you mention, but I can think of two possibilities:\n\n1. If he did it in \u002219 days\u0022, was that Kerbin or Earth days? (A Kerbin day is only 6 hours.) The above \u002275 Kerbin days\u0022 best case scenario works out to about 19 earth days, so maybe that\u0027s it. In other words, not a lot faster than what you\u0027re doing now-- your current 90-Kerbin-day path is only 22.5 Earth days.\n\n2. If he did it in 19 *Kerbin* days, that would mean not doing a Hohmann transfer: it would mean expending a metric crapload of dV to give him a very fast radial-inward velocity from Kerbin\u0027s orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"thelordrahl","CreatedById":148127,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T17:13:10Z","Content":"thanks for all the replies and the video was made before patch .23.5 so all the days are in earth days rather than kerbin days"},{"CreatedByName":"thelordrahl","CreatedById":148127,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T17:16:51Z","Content":"thanks for the replies videos was made before .23.5 so all the time was in earth days rather than kerbal days"}]}
