So to sum up, once I reached around 90-92% reputation I received the ultimate challenge contract (twice, probably a bug). Then from 92-95 till 99% I got the complete xxxx challenge asking me to land on sthg between 3 to 6 bodies. But now it\u0027s been a while I m stuck at 99% with all the previous contracts completed and there\u0027s no new ones appearing. By that I mean no new world\u0027s first and no new challenge contracts ( the ones in the form of: complete the xxx n course/expedition/voyage/rally/challenge/journey) \n\nIs there anything else after those? No contract to land on all bodies?

From what I ve seen there was a clear progression up till I reach 99%. There was those early game contracts indeed. Then the game released some contracts labelled grand tour but only evolving fly by. As mentionned once I reached 90-92% I got the one called Ultimate Challenge ( which was fly by everything) And then finally grand tour contracts involving landing. But now I don\u0027t receive anymore of those at all. Even though I was expecting an Ultimate ultimate challenge one with landing on everything.

The wiki mentionned it was not possible to reach 100% and it seemed true since I m stuck at 99% for a while even though I m doing big contracts with all funds and all science converted to reputation. \n\nThen I guess maybe reaching 100 might unlock the ultimate ultimate land on everything grand tour?\n\nOr perhaps to reach 100% you need a perfect game with no failure. I failed some so I might never get there then\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The game ends when your creativity ends. Has a colony of a million kerbals on each moon?

The game will offer you more contracts from now until the end of time. Failing something makes no difference to that, as it is a single failure out of a literally infinite series (not infinite variety, it will repeat, just infinite as in never ending). It\u0027s just near impossible, by design, to reach 100% reputation, as it has a diminishing returns mechanic which is designed to make it near impossible (but it can, I believe, eventually reached)."},{"CreatedByName":"Nookos","CreatedById":144067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T14:58:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It sounds like you\u0027re still not quite getting it.

I know very well there is no end game contract ( my choice for subject wording was probably wrong) but if you read my posts that is not what I am asking and talking about exactly. There is a clear pattern of the game unlocking certain type of contract at certain points. Like you don t get the ultimate challenge right after landing on the mun.. And there is another clear pattern I will repeat again regarding \u0027grand tour\u0027 contract.. first the fly by then the ultimate fly by then the landings.. my question is am I wrong to expect an ultimate landing grand tour challenge. I m not asking if there is a contract that is gonna tell me: congratz you beat the game now you re done!\n\nAnd regarding what you quoted you didn t read much around either because it clearly is about 100% reputation\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T15:05:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 03:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nookos**"}]}
