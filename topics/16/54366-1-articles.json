RCS really isn\u0027t very helpful until you\u0027re trying to dock, and you need a lot more research to get docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others have said, returning from the Mun or Minmus is rather easy. About 75% of the delta-v it takes to return to Kerbin from the Mun\u0027s surface is just the delta-v it takes to get off of the Mun\u0027s surface, so I find that a lunar rendezvous mission profile takes more than it returns.

Small batts and lights are a nice bonus as well (particularly for making landings). Fuel Systems is a consideration not for RCS - you want that one next for Fuel Ducts (allowing asparagus staging and shorter, wider lander stacks); the 48-7S is a nice bonus. Space Ex and Advanced Flight Control have the Pegasus I Mobility Enhancer (ladders) and Probodobodyne OKTO (the first probe core available) respectively; Space Ex also comes with the Thermometer, a Science Part, which is why I recommend it first.

Transmitting data back vs returning it is not really balanced in 0.22 You dont actually \u0027lose\u0027 any science, you just have to keep retransmitting the same experiments until they stop yielding, at which point it will equal bringing the science home anyway.

Chase down the electronics branch at the bottom of the tree. It starts with solar panels/batteries and progresses through a lot of science modules.
