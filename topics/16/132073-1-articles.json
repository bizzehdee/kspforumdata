I have had many saves die due to stuff like this :/\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Does Antenna Range have any seperate mod parts?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 If so removing it will make KSP delete your sattelites on loading your save however it shouldn\u0027t break the save itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Assuming the answer to 1. is no let\u0027s go on. What are the ranges of the stock antennae wiht Antenna Range and what are the corresponding ranges for Remote Tech?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 If the ranges are bigger than with Remote Tech there might be a problem, depending on how close to the limits your relay sats are.
