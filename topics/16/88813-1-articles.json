What do I mean?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You land after reentry sequence safely on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) As opposed to pressing \u0022recover pod\u0022 or whatever, you send out your OWN recovery vehicle to grab the pod yourself and bring it back to the KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) When the pod is brought back to the KSC, THEN you can recover it for refurbishment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking about playing the game this way and to be honest, it sounds like a fantastic idea if I do say so myself. It makes the whole rocket launch much more involved than by just pressing a button to recover the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T00:05:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I land too frequently in locations that are not at all close to the KSC to be doing this (as in, I like to land in oceans on the other side of the planet because I have terrible aim when it comes to atmo landings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have however built a craft that is capable of completing this tast in any location, though I think it\u0027s fuel capacity was limited to probably 20 minutes carrying a heavy payload, perhaps 40 unloaded. Now that I have a joystick instead of just a controller, it might be worth checking to see if I can still get the mod and rebuild this craft. Or I can boot up version 19 and fly it there I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i62.tinypic.com/nvozh3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nvozh3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i57.tinypic.com/2rrxmwj.png\u0022 alt=\u00222rrxmwj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe prop engines can rotate. Unloaded, typically fly as a plane with the engines at 30 degrees. Can take off and land as a plane perfectly well. At high speeds with cargo, typically 70 degree rotation on the engines was possible, often flew them at 90 anyway. 90 degrees for all VTOL operations obviously. Maximum lift capacity was probably 110%-120% of the craft weight. More if the fuel tanks were running low. However, past about 80% it would take long enough to get cargo airborne that you really had to fight the craft tendency to slam into the ground instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 10 degree engine rotation, it makes a decent rover too (in 0.19, the engines at 0 degrees would pull the rear end up before the brakes became unstuck. Would probably be fine in 0.25).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift is achieved by magnetic grapple. I think some modifications would be needed for indefinite carry. The batteries this version carries, along with the solar panels are good for 7 minutes. It is often much easier to land and attach the grapple manually then it is to land the grapple on target from the air. Used the magnetic version that requires power so that cargo could be jettisoned without the need to land, which saved a few crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas a very fun craft to fly, of very limited use. It was less fun to build. Very touchy on the engine placement, and I never got it quite perfect because of the way the engines rotate (they are weight forward when in the down position, which makes them hard to balance for VTOL use).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-29T00:11:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2014 12:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Randox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pauldbk99","CreatedById":102495,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T00:11:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just pretend they are picked up when I press recover.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T01:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI land at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr crash with only debris to recover.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T01:55:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome people do (not many).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe awesome thing about KSP is that if you want to manually bring back your stuff, you can!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are running pure stock though, it can be a challenge.
