(too easy)\n\nBut the problem is I already started my career. I set the heat Multiplier to 1.0 (because that was ok at the time)\n\nBut now with this new update to KSP, the 1.0 heat multiplier is too low.\n\nHow can I change it without starting a new career?\n\nPS: I edited my latest save file and I found a line saying something like Heat Multiplier 1\n\nSo I changed that to a 1.5\n\nMy ships were getting much hotter so I was happy. BUT!!!\n\nas soon as I saved again the heat was back to 1.0 ?!?!?!?!\n\nIts as if only that single save was edited, but all subsequent saves following that were reverted back to the original 1.0\n\nCan someone help my set heat multiplier to 1.5 and make it stick permanently?\n\nThanks!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"DJK","CreatedById":114951,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:56:37Z","Content":"Check this thread for making re-entry more difficult.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118775-Tweaks-for-a-challenging-re-entry-effect](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118775-Tweaks-for-a-challenging-re-entry-effect)\n\nMy personal settings.. everything works for my taste, rockets, sstos and stuff actually blowing up during re-entry.
