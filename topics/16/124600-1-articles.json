It consists of 3 landers and a mothership/tug with 4 LV-Ns and a stupid amount of liquid fuel. My DeltaV is literally off the charts: NaN m/s. I have enough fuel for around 5 hours of continuous burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, ofcourse, comes at the expense of TWR, which is 0.05 at the moment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m raising my kerbin AP little by little, trying to keep it approximately in line with the desired escape. However, I will not have this option once I get to jool - My question then is: What\u0027s the best approach for ensuring a jool capture in a timely manner? I wouldn\u0027t want to aerobrake at Laythe, as my contraption probably won\u0027t survive the forces. My number one priority is ensuring I don\u0027t simply scoot through the joolian system, so where should I aim my PE? Tylo?

Preferably while still in Kerbin\u0027s SOI but at the midpoint or AN/DN should be fine. Burn to pass Jool on the right (so you\u0027re going the same direction as the moons) and get your trajectory passing right through Laythe or Tylo\u0027s SOI. Laythe\u0027s good because it\u0027s close and Jool\u0027s gravity gradient\u0027s more pronounced, and Tylo\u0027s good because it has more weight to throw (you) around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo that burn, and if you\u0027re lucky you\u0027ll actually get an encounter with that moon, and for a couple decimeters per second you can tweak the encounter (I suggest using a maneuver node to tweak, so you only have to burn once) to enter the moon\u0027s SOI from behind, and exit from the side putting you into a Jool orbit. If you\u0027re not lucky, no biggie. Just (again, use a maneuver node. Measure twice, burn once as they say) do a burn that is a combination of radial and -grade for - again - a few decimeters per second and you\u0027ll get an encounter in no time. Then tweak it as above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s too squirrely (it\u0027s hard to do a perfect 2-decimeter burn with a massive hulk of a ship) just go forward about halfway to Jool, and the burn will take more dV and therefore be a bit easier to fudge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T23:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Horseman said.
