Also the RCS are used to make me fly up and down since I need very little additional thrust beyond my jets (which I set at about 40% thrust depending on fuel remaining) in order to land I simply RCS downwards and then once I (gently) touch down, I kill the jets and wait for the thrust to stop while still RCSing down. I have an abundance of fuel and an abundance of mono-prop and the thing flies like a beauty on kerbin. The idea was to make an Vtol lander which could sample multiple biomes and transmit the data then find a good landing site to set up a duna base then wait at this location for my landing party in an in-game year or so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here\u0027s the problem. I tug the vessel to duna with my nuclear tug and aerobrake into a clean orbit disconnect the tug, then I reduce my peri until its about 6000m with RCS, but once I\u0027m in the atmosphere I cannot for the life of me get my jets to fire up and my parachutes tear off resulting in my lander smashing into the ground at uber high speeds... I have a feeling that I accidentally fired them when I originally launched the vessel from kerbin but I can\u0027t check now because I\u0027m at work, So here\u0027s my questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - If a flame-out has occurred, then what\u0027s the procedure for getting them going again if indeed there is a procedure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Whats the ceiling on a standard Jet with 6 radial intakes on duna? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts also worth mentioning that on each engine I have 6 intakes, 3 pointing up for airflow when climbing and 3 pointing down, for use when falling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have MJ, protractor and Scansat installed although they\u0027re not to blame for my poor designs lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceGremlin","CreatedById":65961,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T14:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStandard jets do not work on Duna.
