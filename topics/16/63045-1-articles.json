It wasn\u0027t very efficient and the ship was ugly as all hell though. It took my 3 dockings above kerbal then 3 more above Laythe do the whole trip. It also ended up as a rescue mission with the first failed attempt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main goal now for myself in KSP is to make much more efficient designs mainly for SSTO\u0027s. I can get my ship into orbit very easily but then I end up with very little oxidizer and I need to refuel once in Orbit to do anything worthwhile. The goal I have set for myself is to reach the Mun in one shot without a refuel on the way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI downloaded the B9 aerodynamics pack and it makes the ships look 1000000x times better but I still can\u0027t make an efficient design it feels like. I usually take my ship right after take off at a very steep angle of ascent up to around 20,000 feet and then get to about 1000 m/s at this point I\u0027m usually running out of air so I swap to rocket mode and angle up and get my apoapsis to around 80,000 then circularize. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs my launch really bad or do my designs just suck? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/3314950511254890800/1A7E53F4493FBDA2B75752CC20EAFE899DF04E0F/\u0022 alt=\u00221A7E53F4493FBDA2B75752CC20EAFE899DF04E0F\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what my new ship looks like atm.

It makes building and flying the SSTO harder, but it\u0027s something to consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Having more air intakes than engines allows you to reach higher speeds and higher altitudes before switching to rockets. I personally don\u0027t do that, but most people do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Ram air intakes work better at higher speeds.

Having more than 1 on a ship this small is a waste because they\u0027re so heavy.

The secret to making an efficient SSTO is intakes, intakes and more intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir intakes are extremely overpowered for SSTO\u0027s. With enough intake, you can run your jet engines at 35,000 meters going 2300 m/s. All it takes is a little more dV to actually get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to make something efficient, don\u0027t build something that looks good and could work in real life.

I tend to go straight up to 10k and then gradually move to 60 degrees by the time I\u0027m at around 20-25k. I\u0027m at 45 degrees by the time I hit 30k. Obviously all depends a bit on your ship and number of intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Don\u0027t activate your Nuke before the very last moment. Coast to your apoapsis the second it hits your desired height and fix your periapsis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Consider a 2-stage approach. You might not need the lift of the entire SSTO, make it so that a separate lander detaches from the wings and other necessary stuff. The Hondo is a great example of that...can make it from Kerbin\u0027s surface to the moon and back, twice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Turbojets \u0026amp; 1 Nuke seems to be a good combo for efficiency. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) If you\u0027re willing to use mods, look into Kethane...I\u0027m working on a Kethane SSTO at the moment. Would solve all your range issues I recon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Use a carrier rocket in Kerbin orbit. SSTOs are light, so you don\u0027t need one with huge DeltaV. Alternatively, use an interplanetary ring...a few examples are on the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
