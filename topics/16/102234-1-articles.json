Since Kerbin orbits at a lower altitude than Jool, this means you\u0027ll approach Jool from the lower (sun-facing) side. If you stop your transfer burn as soon as intercept is achieved, you\u0027ll most likely have a Jool periapse on the sun-facing (radial-in) side. If you then perform your capture at that periapse without changing it, your normal will be opposite that of the moons.\n\nThere are three ways you can fix this: 1) burn a little extra during the initial transfer burn, 2) perform a mid-course correction (likely burn prograde a bit, or some combination of prograde and radial out) or 3) establish capture first (but only enough to just barely bring the apoapse into Jool\u0027s SOI) then burn to flip your normal at apoapse.\n\nThe first option is arguably the most efficient, and the most difficult (as even the slightest variation can cause a significantly more difficult capture).\n\nI believe the second and third options are both equally viable; however, option three will be more difficult to plan if you\u0027re performing an aerocapture (which seems likely).\n\nSo my recommendation is a mid-course correction, a handful of m/s (at the right time) is enough to make drastic alterations to your encounter profile, and you\u0027ll have more than enough time to tweak it precisely. Midcourse corrections are also the best way to establish a good aero capture, so this makes the most sense. The only downside is that mid-course corrections are... less than intuitive with the large distances and orbital forces at work... but I assume you are familiar with this type of maneuver if you\u0027re trying to get to Jool."},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T17:57:32Z","Content":"I apologize for being naive and/or a noon, but how does a retrograde orbit make landing impossible?"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaver","CreatedById":46640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T18:11:47Z","Content":"If you go in direction of a pillar and put out your hands to the left and right.

In prograde, you approach at (your speed) minus (moon\u0027s orbit speed), while in retrograde, you approach at (your speed) plus (moon\u0027s orbit speed). Approaching retrograde requires you to loose *much* more dV in order to avoid smashing into the surface."},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T19:00:07Z","Content":"Alternatively, you can use Jool\u0027s moons to reverse your orbit via gravity slingshots (especially with Tylo) and/or aerobraking\u002Bsling at Laythe. It would be a pain to plan, though, so just avoiding the retrograde orbit/reversing your orbit at very high Ap would be better - but the possibility is there.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I apologize for being naive and/or a noon, but how does a retrograde orbit make landing impossible?\n\nIt\u0027s not impossible, it\u0027s just way harder.\n\nSay you want to land at Vall. Vall orbits Jool at 2558.8 m/s. You are coming at Vall from a retrograde Jool aerobrake. Your velocity relative to Vall when the two of you meet will be about 4 km/s (just a rough guess, don\u0027t quote me on that. Point is it\u0027s higher than Vall\u0027s orbital velocity around Jool), which you have to (almost) cancel out using precious fuel (and/or Vall\u0027s gravity) just to get into orbit around Vall. Comparatively, the traditional transfer from Jool prograde aerobrake to Vall orbit will take much less dV due to both the craft and Vall going in the same direction.\n\nLanding on a celestial body from a retrograde orbit around that body will also be harder than landing from a prograde orbit, because of the body\u0027s rotation. You want to match the velocity of the surface for landing, and being in retrograde orbit increases your velocity relative to that surface. It\u0027s like trying to exchange something between two cars, one of which is driving at a constant speed. If the cars are driving in the same direction, you just have to match speeds. If the cars are driving opposite to each other, one of them will have to slow down, stop, turn around and then match speeds. Aplied to spacecraft and surface of a celestial body, stopping and turning around costs precious fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"thadisjones","CreatedById":134649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T19:05:20Z","Content":"If yer goin\u0027 to Laythe, that marble\u0027s coastin\u0027 at a hot little 3.22 km/sec.
