And that mission only includes near asteroids. I think in the future KSP will open to asteroids in multiple zones, but for now since they are partnering with NASA for this specific mission, the asteroids will be limited. I think a mod will easily be able to tweak starting locations and starting trajectories. I think long-term KSP goals was to include some large objects out near Eeloo anyway. And at one point Dres was supposed to be a place-holder for an asteroid belt analog in KSP. I think having the asteroids near Kerbin opens up some great gameplay, and I\u0027m glad they decided to go that route to begin with, but I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll see more in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T12:32:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think HarvesteR mentioned in Scott Manley\u0027s video that asteroids are only spawned near Kerbin\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T12:50:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blizzy78\u0022 data-cite=\u0022blizzy78\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think HarvesteR mentioned in Scott Manley\u0027s video that asteroids are only spawned near Kerbin\u0027s orbit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure that that means they won\u0027t be on a trajectory that takes them to another planet.
