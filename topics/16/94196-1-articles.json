The problem sounds like your inclination is just too far out of alignment. To fix that, wait until you\u0027re at your Ascending Node (AN) or Descending Node (DN) relative to the orbit - these are shown on the target orbit - and then burn (for a prograde orbit) south or north respectively until the orbits are aligned. The numbers on the nodes should read a value close to 0 and possibly start jumping all over the orbit when you\u0027re done. If the number reads 180, you\u0027re going in completely the wrong direction\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-23T02:28:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2014 02:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by armagheddonsgw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluebird1","CreatedById":132481,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T13:25:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah that was it, node was at 180.

I\u0027ve yet to see a contract that has a low enough orbit for that - instead either do the burn at apoapsis if you\u0027re in a reasonably elliptical orbit already, or raise it (at periapsis) and then do it. A variation on a bi-elliptical transfer might help with the efficiency if you\u0027re low on fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
