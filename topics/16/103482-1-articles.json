Wheels are not needed. trying to make it vtol capable too but without breaking the aesthetics much (engines on pivots?). flying in atmosphere is something that would be great!\n\nif anybody needs the craft file ill put it up."},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T00:11:55Z","Content":"There are several landing gear that will take that mass, I have SSTO space planes that weigh more than that and the gear takes the weight. \n\nThe problem I see with that craft is the lack of clearance you will have with the ground and those fins that stick down. If it were a tail sitter I could see it landing and taking off. \n\nThe other issue I see is it doesnt have much of a control system for atmospheric flight. This would be a huge issue if you plan on ever flying it anywhere where there is an atmosphere. \n\nI see that you have FAR installed have you looked at the flight data readouts for FAR to see if that craft is even capable of flight?"},{"CreatedByName":"senoiurkabls","CreatedById":59457,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T01:06:17Z","Content":"What landing gear are you talking about? I can always fit the fins on hinges if there isn\u0027t any clearance. She can move if thats what your asking but the center of life is very far in front of the center of mass but it tips down like god is pulling it. Seems like the top paneling (b9pro wings) might have something to do with it. shes a lifting body for sure. launch in atmosphere would go like this\n\nfire vtol engines \n\nget high enough to tilt ship and fire rear epstein drives\n\nhope to god ferram is not even in the same universe as you \n\nshe just needs to do that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T19:58:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 07:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by senoiurkabls**"}]}
