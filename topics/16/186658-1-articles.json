Again!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday I concocted\u00A0a mission to Laythe with a mining ship and took special care to scan its surface beforehand with the M700 Survey Scanner. What was my joy when the ore abundance at some places reached 70 %! I set a navigation point to one such location that in the resource map overlay didn\u0027t go blank under 70 % cut-off and made my merry way to that very place, almost killing three kerbals along the way. Alas, after landing and deployment of my drill (the large one) I was confronted with \u0022nothing to mine\u0022 exclamation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContrast that with my Minmus\u00A0mining rover, which happily mined ore where the scanner only found 20 % of ore.
