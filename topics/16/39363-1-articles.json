However, after the update, even if more than one thing is in the stage like a decouple, it takes 2 SPACE bar strikes to initiate the action, despite them both being in exactly the same stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably a stupid question but answers are much needed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E thankyou\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T15:53:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not encountered this, are you running any mods?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DesolateChris","CreatedById":76258,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T16:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhhh that worked!
