It has an X shape to it, with a command pod in the middle, and four fuel tanks/engines/docking ports attached radially to the outside using I-beams. The tanks are the FL-T400 tanks, then below that is an inline clamp-o-tron, below that a lv-909 engine (on top i have a medium sized RCS tank, but I don\u0027t think that matters). I have fuel lines attaching the fuel tanks diagonally to two engines (the one to it\u0027s left and the one to it\u0027s right.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I have that explained, here is my problem. It takes off and about 6 seconds into flight I can\u0027t control it because each engine is using an uneven amount of fuel. I never had this problem when i was landing it. All of the engines are at 100 power and all of the fuel tanks are completely full. If you look at it from the top, the engines on the top-right and bottom-right use fuel twice as fast as the ones on the left.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T08:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure that each engine can only draw fuel from one single tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might get the idea to connect multiple tanks to each engine for redundancy, but this will screw things up because ultimately, what draws fuel from where in which order is a round-robin operation.
