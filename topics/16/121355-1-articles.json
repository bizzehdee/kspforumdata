I assumed starting from a 70 km circular orbit and maintained the thrust vector pointed in the prograde direction throughout the duration of the burn. I stopped the burn when the hyperbolic excess velocity reached 1,000 m/s, which is about the median for a trip to Duna or Eve (a little less for Duna and a little more for Eve). I assumed a specific impulse of 390 seconds, though Isp really doesn\u0027t make that much difference.

Although I\u0027m not sure how that translates into a Mun or Minmus encounter? Also, what is the longest practical burn time for such a Space Plane? I\u0027m guessing around 1 minute starting 30 seconds before periapsis/maneuvere node? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, maybe not the \u0022only way\u0022, but definitely the most efficient way. It is always most efficient to do your burn as low as possible in the gravity well when you are moving fastest. This is the Oberth Effect. Consequently, short repeated burns near periapsis are the way to go when using low-TWR craft. The price you pay is that it\u0027s that more tedious to complete a multi-lap burn than a single high-thrust burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoughly speaking, I think your estimate of 1:30 burn time per lap is a reasonable one, although other people will have their own views. Your burn efficiency is a function of orbital velocity, so one way to judge how far out to extend your burns is to note how your speed changes (when coasting) as you approach periapsis, and decide for yourself how much inefficiency you can tolerate. To a first approximation, the Oberth Effect says that if you are traveling only 90% as fast (for example) as at periapsis, burning at that point is only 90% as efficient as would be a burn at periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s another inefficiency as well: assuming you are using maneuver nodes and pointing at them during your entire burn, your maneuver noed won\u0027t always be aligned with your prograde marker. This means you have to add in the cosine losses from burning in a direction that is not totally aligned with your prograde direction all the time. This obviously gets more severe the farther away you get from periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to use repeated short periapsis burns for a Mun/Minmus encounter, you need to plan how many orbital laps this process is going to take you, and orient your apoapsis to take that into account. This adds to the complexity and tedium, but it isn\u0027t difficult as long as you don\u0027t mind a little math.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-22T19:16:41Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2015 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yakky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
