I\u0027ll start with the problem, its explodes when leaving kerbins atmosphere, the third one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts built as three main stages. Main booster rockets to get it into orbit on the bottom. 2nd stage to break kerbins orbit and get it to the moon. Final one for landing. I think I will have enough fuel, my only problem is the exploding bit. Already made a lot of adjustments, even learnt to move the centre of mass away from weak structural parts. Right now i\u0027m at a loss as to what to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts meant to be the beginning of a munbase refuelling depot. Some of its parts are missing, they be sent later on. Anyone had similar experiences with stuff exploding at this altitude and managed to fix it? if so how did you do it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-28T08:19:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2013 08:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Moonfrog\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gus","CreatedById":68154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T18:46:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re probably going too fast and crushing your ship against the atmosphere. In the Wiki you can look up Kerbin and see the \u0022maximum\u0022 speeds at different elevations. Also, if you look at the end of flight summary, you can see which connection failed and fix that. But if you\u0027re going too fast, usually another part will then fail instead. Also, if those are 7 Mainsails, you\u0027re almost certainly going too fast if you\u0027re not throttled down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-27T18:52:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2013 06:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlmarti","CreatedById":70037,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T18:56:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHit F3 the moment things look odd, see what part failed and fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T19:11:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMainsails on jumbo tanks overheat and explode.

The part of the atmosphere that it explodes at is one just before your in space orbit on the far left of the atmosphere bar. I continue to experiment a litte with throttle. I try to give a better description of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has 7 mainsails that fire at launch. These are set up, I like to call it spiral fuel link set up, or S link set up, so the fuel looks like an S. Everyone else calls it asparagus or something. After doing it again, and it exploded again. The rocket seems to explode after 6 of the outer jumbo orange tanks and their engines have been decoupled. The rocket is only firing on the one mainsail at about 80% thrust to prevent overheating. The reason for me using mainsails is because the original design, using quad engine part, it lacked the thrust to take off properly. The 2nd stage part used to be twice as big, but I cut its fuel in half and reduced the side engine tanks to smaller ones as u can see in the first post, were roco max ones to begin with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems to explode with all radial tanks are dropped of on the launch stage. Thx for your answers I try stopping my acceleration at one point, it does start to increase quite rapidly when I break through the atmosphere so it could be that as some of u have said.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moonfrog","CreatedById":76295,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T22:09:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter flying at lower speeds, the rocket successfully did not explode, so it seems you guys were right about the speeds. I kept it between 150ms and under 200ms below 10,000, and under 300ms for next part, it seemed to work fine. Unfortunately it doesn\u0027t have enough fuel to get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is my next problem, I would like to ask this of you guys. I have an idea, but was wondering if u guys also had ideas on how to lift the munbase part into orbit. Heres the new idea I came up with before I go to sleep, maybe u can tell me if its worth it or not, cos it sounds complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan on splitting the jumbo tanks that are radially attached into 2 rings of the half sized fuel tanks. Then I plan to attach a fuel line going from top ring too the bottom ring. Then decoupling the top ring fuel tanks when they become empty in the same order as u would do in spiral/asparagus style. Idea being that I can jettison half the jumbo half and maybe be more fuel efficient and get it into orbit. I might have to use sepatrons, I fiddle with it if u guys think its worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso be grateful for any rocket ideas u can think of that might help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bmcloughlin","CreatedById":58333,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T03:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esend it up part by part and dock together in munar orbit or on surface\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gus","CreatedById":68154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T04:24:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJettisoning fuel tanks mounted\u003Cem\u003E above\u003C/em\u003E the engines definitely presents challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot a common practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moonfrog","CreatedById":76295,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T08:18:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI try sending it up part by part as well. thx. at least its not exploding anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moonfrog","CreatedById":76295,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T18:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/scaled/large/689/qm54.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qm54.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYay I made it.
