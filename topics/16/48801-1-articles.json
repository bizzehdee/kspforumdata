Basically, my plan is to attach several \u0022return\u0022 units, specifically, a Probe Body with a return system, and as I explore planets/moons, grab all the research by commanding it from the Probe body, then detaching it and returning it to Kerbin. Once I have my return trajector set, I\u0027ll switch back to the MSS and set it for it\u0027s next target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question however, is if I NEED the science stations after I do the research and detach the probe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T02:25:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyes you do\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apophis775","CreatedById":81516,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T02:31:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDangit.
