Sure, they\u0027re functional enough, they avoid pancake designs, they\u0027re somewhat believable, and they fly well with both FAR and Deadly reentry.\n\nBut, they all look more or less like a stack of orange tanks, with Kerodyne tanks as boosters. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve made this design at least once, and is therefore aware of what i\u0027m talking about.\n\nWell, meh.... time to change it up a bit, and the Donut tank certainly looks good, and can be used to make at least my landers more appealing.\n\nHowever, apart from the visual pleasure it provides, why would i use them? Am i missing something here? I see many people use them in their crafts from time to time, but i have yet to understand why.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T14:38:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T01:09:42Z","Content":"Apart from the visual appeal, I see two reasons:\n\nThe nodes are close together, making for a VERY flexible attachment point.

If you\u0027re missing a delta-v target by a small amount, adding a round8 can help you hit that target while not committing to a full extra T100 (or similar).\n\nJust be aware that it has a rather high dry mass for the fuel it does carry (2.5 round8s have the same dry mass as a T100; the round8s have poor fuel fractions)..."}]}
