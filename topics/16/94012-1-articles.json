The only things that changed last update were that we got new, bigger parts and the editor got an overhaul that made it easier to use. The basic idea is that you need engines of some kind - preferably jets or turbojets, liquid fuel only (there are special tanks for this) and air intakes if you\u0027re using jets, or liquid fuel/oxidizer tanks if you\u0027re using rockets, wings and landing gear. I\u0027m going to assume you\u0027ll be using jets for the rest of this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should typically add at least one intake for every engine you put on the plane, but for a basic first plane just one of each is plenty. Either the ones you attach via nodes (these provide more intake air, but are more awkward to attach), or the radial ones are fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a very simple plane, you can attach 2 of the liquid fuel tanks (1 is enough, but 2 will give you more surface area to attach to, without having the plane be too heavy at one end because all the fuel\u0027s there) to the Mk1 Cockpit, and then attach your engine to the back of that. Next, attach a pair of wings; the Wing Connector Type B and Structural Wing Type B are both decent choices for wings early game - the wing connector provides double the lift (which means you can fly slower) but also makes it a little harder to balance a small plane. Neither look very pretty but that has no real impact on the performance in stock (yay stock aerodynamics).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to turn on the center of mass and center of lift indicators, and you want to line things up so the center of mass (the yellow/black sphere) is just slightly forward of the center of lift (the smaller, blue/black sphere with an arrow pointing upwards). This will ensure that the plane is stable in flight, and as fuel drains the center of mass shouldn\u0027t move in a way that makes the plane so unstable it\u0027s uncontrollable - you may have a slight issue with it wanting to pitch up or down though. Don\u0027t bother with this too much though until after you\u0027re done placing everything else on the plane. You can adjust the wing positions either just by picking them up and re-placing them, or you can use the new \u0022offset\u0022 gizmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, you need to add control surfaces. Attach 2 of the \u0022Elevon 1\u0022 parts to the back end of the wings, rotating them so they line up neatly. Right click them, and then click the buttons so that only \u0022Roll\u0022 is Active. These will be your \u0022ailerons\u0022 - the things that let you do barrel rolls \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E. Next, you\u0027ll want actual elevons - the things that let you pitch up or down. I recommend using the AV-R8 Winglet for this. They don\u0027t provide much lift, but they rotate by quite a large amount, which gives you a nice agile plane. Stick them on the back of the plane in line with the main wings, and do the same thing as you did with the ailerons, except this time make sure only \u0022Pitch\u0022 is active. Lastly, add a 3rd winglet in the middle, on top of the plane with symmetry off, roughly in line with the elevons - make sure it\u0027s perfectly vertical. This will be your rudder, set it so that only \u0022Yaw\u0022 is active. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, you want intakes and landing gear. For the intakes, stick 2 of the XM-G50 Radial Air Intakes in symmetry mode between your elevons and rudder. The exact placement doesn\u0027t matter too much, but they need to be behind the center of mass because they have a lot of drag. If you place them too far forward your plane will want to fly backwards (more of an issue on larger planes - this small one probably won\u0027t matter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the gears, lots of people like to go with a 3-wheel design, but I\u0027ve always found those to be quite prone to flipping out on the runway at high speeds, so I would recommend a 4-wheel design. For this small plane, you should place 2 wheels just behind the cockpit, and 2 just in front of the engine. I recommend starting off by placing the wheels very splayed out, and then rotating them back to almost vertical. This way the gears will be nice and spread out, which helps to keep the plane stable on the ground at speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re done, it should look something like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/X1E8G\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
