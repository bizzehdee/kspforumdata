Now though, we have the ability to refine fuel locally, distinct biomes, and useful research to be done in the mobile lab, so there\u0027s even less of a need to return experiments to Kerbin. However, there\u0027s also different aerodynamics and reentry heating to consider, and I suspect that my existing designs would be useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, a few questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. My old base used four 2.5m stacks of components. If I built this sort of structure again, would a central 2.5m heat shield, with perhaps 3.75m shields (to protect the landing legs) under the outer stacks be sufficient for an Eve entry?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Precision landing- I\u0027d most likely have a mining facility separate from the main base module. Obviously, they need to be landed fairly close to each other. Is it actually possible to do an accurate landing on Eve? Or should I think about putting wheels on the mining facility to move it closer to the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Rocketplanes and large electric rovers- can these be safely landed on Eve and used as a viable means of exploration. With no means to power Ion engines other than shipments from Kerbin, I guess they are out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Crew- My old colony was established before specialisms existed. I guess I need some high-level scientists to carry out research, plus some engineers to run the mining operation efficiently. Pilots don\u0027t have to be at a particularly high level as they\u0027ll only be needed to fly planes. I\u0027ll probably establish a space station in orbit and go and visit Gilly, so some higher-level pilots could go and return to Kerbin without landing on Eve itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-05T12:52:01Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2015 12:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlyingPete\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlextheBodacious","CreatedById":139447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T11:45:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. It depends on your attack angle and speed.

In general for Eve entry if there\u0027s anything other than heat shield that is not protected in the shock cone of the heat shield, then most likely it\u0027s going to blow up at interplanetary transfer speed.

I just landed my new Eve ascent vehicle, it is a short tower, single stack, ranging from 3.75m up to the thinnest part.
