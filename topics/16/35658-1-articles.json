Meaning each constituent of a space station is connected to another via no more than 1 dock. They can dock to multiple modules, but between two there is only ever 1 connection. This is annoying because the docks don\u0027t seem to have any angle locks (the kind of locks you can use when building your rocket so that the pieces line up in nice clean 90 degree angles). I find this tends to make your space station core look like a spindly tree with random branches sticking out of it in all sorts of directions. Even if one is very careful when docking, it inevitably happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I wanted to try using this 4-point docking configuration, to ensure that the core of my space station would be a big solid (and most importantly, consistent) square. Basically it would be lots of square cross-sections stacked on top of one another forming the \u0022spine\u0022 of the station. Additional modules could be connected to the sides using 2-point connections. I wanted to do a ground test first. I was quite unable to get them to line up one on top of the other, so I decided to try with this side-to-side docking first, and... it won\u0027t connect. Is the game just being difficult with me, or are these sort of multi-point connections just not possible at the moment?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1059.photobucket.com/albums/t429/PTNLemay/Multi_point_docking_trying_to_connect-1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Multi_point_docking_trying_to_connect-1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-02T20:24:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2013 08:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T20:27:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELots of people make multi-port connections.

Another way to describe what happens in the editor is that you can have multiple branches off of a part but they can\u0027t all reconnect later. For instance if you use a three way coupler (tri-coupler? I forget) to branch down into three parts and then try to attach an inverted tri-coupler, only one connection will be sound. The craft format can\u0027t describe a situation where all three children merge back into one; only one path can continue and the others have to terminate.

You just have to rotate the 6-way node to get it connect in examples 1 and 2. Only the top and bottom part of the 6-way nodes can connect to a parent part, just fiddle with the rotation keys \u0027QWEASD\u0027 until you get it rotated correctly and it should connect fine.

First and foremost: Multidocking is really, really annoying if there\u0027s any flex at all between the ports. Once the first port in a multi-dock is locked on the others lose their \u0027magnetic attraction\u0027 capability and only lock if they physically touch. And when they do lock, they lock however they happen to hit...which means they\u0027re not necessarily aligned correctly (if you\u0027ve got flex in the structure between the ports, the changes of getting full alignment are basically zero.) If you disconnect a port, you can reconnect it by moving it far enough away from the port it was connected to (Cue wobbling a tank arm back and forth to reset it trying to get it to align properly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA useful trick with it is that if two unconnected ports are at least mostly-aligned when a scene load completes, they\u0027ll automatically lock on. You can use this fact to build structures that aren\u0027t normally allowed right in the VAB: Simply place pairs of ports facing each other, and they\u0027ll automatically multi-dock when the ship loads in on the pad. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/595879242732410860/E95F97D2DD3454CD69F9B78BBE4DD1FDE728CF4D/\u0022 alt=\u0022E95F97D2DD3454CD69F9B78BBE4DD1FDE728CF4D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fully docked port, connected in the VAB, is the one on the BOTTOM. The strain is pulling the top two apart but they ARE still connected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least until I decouple it. The two multidocked ports lose connection at that point, and don\u0027t re-lock (presumably that \u0027has to move far enough away first\u0027 restriction is at fault), and the exhaust in the decouplers causes some interesting motions (and explosions). The fully docked bottom stays locked on, however:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/595879242732526918/05C6D578A64247DB97E7BF68C80E1B1051F569C8/\u0022 alt=\u002205C6D578A64247DB97E7BF68C80E1B1051F569C8\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes.
