It really revolves around two points, most of which relies on what you consider \u0022better.\u0022\n\nFrom one perspective, it\u0027s easier because you don\u0027t have to do much maneuvering or bother establishing that pesky orbit. However, I\u0027d say that it\u0027s generally easier to learn how to establish an orbit, which buys you time to get your maneuvers set up and your plan ready before executing.\n\nOther people consider \u0022better\u0022 a matter of what is the most efficient, which is usually measured in Delta-V expended. Rather than answer this one directly, I\u0027ll let the masses swarm about direct ascent vs. orbital rendezvous.\n\nWelcome to the forums! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T02:33:07Z","Content":"Claw, no argument has happened yet. \\*sniff\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T02:35:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Claw, no argument has happened yet. \\*sniff\\*\n\nHas so."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T02:59:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Perry Apsis said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Has so.\n\u003E \n\nHello, is this the [right room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFKtI6gn9Y) for an [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_Clinic)?\n\n*(sorry, couldn\u0027t resist)*\n\nShort answer is:\n\n- going to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E (low Kerbin orbit) first is much easier from the standpoint of piloting and mission planning; direct ascent requires a lot of skill to get the precise trajectory you want.\n- as far as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirements are concerned: as long as your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E is pretty low, in practice there\u0027s very little difference in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirements for the two.

Half your fuel is directly lost to gravity.\n\nAt 45deg from vertical, you\u0027ve got a twr of 2 along the hypotenuse.\n\nthis works out to an acceleration of sqrt(2) horizontally, and (sqrt(2) - 1) vertically\n\nyou gain altitude much more slowly, but lose much less energy to fighting gravity.\n\nSince orbit is very little to do with altitude, and almost all about horizontal velocity relative to the surface\n\nthis works out more efficient.\n\nAs TWR goes to inifinty, the losses to gravity become proportionally less and less important.\n\nEdit to add: For getting into orbit, altitude is required for exactly two things. Avoiding mountains, and avoiding atmosphere.\n\nOn a perfectly spherical world with no atmosphere, you could enter orbit at any nonzero ground seperation.\n\nof course, there are no perfectly spherical worlds, so a few KM above highest point is usually a good idea.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T22:50:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 10:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lelitu**"},{"CreatedByName":"Weywot8","CreatedById":146603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T03:47:39Z","Content":"The effort that goes into KSP!
