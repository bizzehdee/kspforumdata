The craft in question is a composite munbase, made of 4 smaller craft linked using Kerbal Attachment System. I wonder if the issue is a RAM shortage, but task manager tells me it\u0027s only using 3.7 Gb of RAM, when I have 8 available it seems unlikely this is the problem. The problem I\u0027m having is the game nearly loads - I get the \u00221x time warp\u0022 message up, but then no more loading than that. I end up having to kill KSP using the task manager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else had problems with large part number or composite/docked craft not loading and/or know of any solutions? I\u0027d like to load it so I can get my kerbals home if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIas\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T21:27:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP is still 32 bit.

I do see lots of mods at play there. I think this is a mod related issue. Much as I hate to condemn people\u0027s bases, I suggest EVAing the kerbals and getting them well away, then terminating the base entirely. I would suggest updating KAS and try to narrow it down to the mod. I see AEIS, NP, KAS, and Kethane there. I highly doubt it\u0027s Kethane.
