My main gripe with whatever the default setting is is that it makes interplanetary burns a fair bit harder to manipulate - so I guess if there\u0027s a mode that is ideal for say, a direct burn from Kerbin to Duna, that\u0027d be the one I\u0027d be looking for!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for your help, I love you all.
