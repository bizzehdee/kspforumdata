You may want to increase the full deployment altitude to something more than the default one kilometer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is one consideration however, you will need to keep the probe and the carrier craft within 25km of each other until the probe touches down.

You have to arm the parachutes before you decouple the probe, as you said. But then your vessel with focus needs to keep the probe\u00A0within the physics bubble (it might be 22.5km) until the probe reaches the ground safely. If you are outside the physics bubble, the parachutes won\u0027t work on the probe and it will be destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-08T21:16:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223374035\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174751\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221525802692\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022188776\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022excelsiorvariant\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, excelsiorvariant said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you know if it is possible to create a probe, a rocket or any part, attach it to a plane or rocket and undock it or just disengage it\u00A0while flying, and set the parachutes to autodeploy when it reaches certain altitude?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, that\u0027s what the right-click altitude and pressure settings on a parachute are for.\u00A0 I use this to make \u0022drop pods\u0022 out of solid rockets, airplane tubes, and parachutes which auto-deploy and drop themselves out of orbit without any piloting help or indeed any possibility of piloting at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey still need watching all the way down or else they\u0027ll disappear, unless you install a mod like \u0022stage recovery\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-08T21:18:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2018 09:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Corona688\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
