And then you have a long way down accelerated by gravity, which generates more vertical speed for you to cancel out than you saved in the horizontal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo figure out what that vertical speed is, you need to sum up the ever-increasing acceleration as you approach the surface... in other words, you want an integral over gravity. The resulting function describes your increasing speed over time. With that, you can figure out how long it takes you to fall from a given height, and what your final velocity will be as you impact the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis value, finally, is what you must add to the cost of zeroing out your horizontal velocity in order to get the total dV cost... a value which of course assumes you can perform a perfect, near-instant suicide burn. Because in addition to the cost comes the fact that if your burn to decelerate vertical speed is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E instant, you lose extra dV to gravity drag in addition that what you would normally spend. This is because your engine expends a part of its thrust just to maintain the status quo (\u0022hovering\u0022), which does in no way contribute to decelerate you. And if you come in vertically from a very high orbit, you need a very long burn to cancel out your vertical velocity, which will be very inefficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe burn to zero out horizontal velocity does not suffer from this, because there is no gravity trying to pull you forward. 100% of the engine thrust goes towards decelerating you. Therefore you want to burn as much horizontally as you can, and as little vertically as you can. (This is the reason we do a gravity turn - and yes, you can do a \u0022reverse gravity turn\u0022 to land. It is in fact the best possible maneuver, but so hard to pull off that in practice nobody bothers.

In a 50km orbit over the Mun, zero out horizontal velocity and then decouple your fully fueled lander for the vertical descent\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Fall straight down and make a short, hard burn at the last possible moment in order to land\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.)

After landing, note how much fuel you have spent for the descent\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf what you claim is true, both descents will consume the same amount of fuel, because you\u0027re dropping from the same height and it doesn\u0027t matter how long your engine is running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, what you will find in reality is that your first attempt will get you safely landed, while your second attempt will likely run out of fuel before you even get near the surface. The reason is that because you\u0027re floating down slowly, you give gravity far, far more time to accelerate you. Every second, the Mun applies acceleration. The longer you spend descending (regardless of height), the more you get accelerated downwards, and thus the more fuel you need to spend on cancelling it out. That is gravity drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo minimize gravity drag, you want to spend the shortest possible time being accelerated by gravity.
