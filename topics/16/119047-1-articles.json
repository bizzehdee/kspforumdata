Two, anything clipped anywhere near a service bay will very often cause explosions. if you have any clipping make sure nothing is clipped between teh service bay and other components. Part clippiung inside teh service bay is ok, but not part clipping that has a part somewhat in teh bay and then sticking into say fuselage as well, thats a near guaranteed problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is another bug that ive found (its not consistent and sometimes it happens sometimes not), but it seems that attaching stuff to the inner nodes on service bays, cargo bays, ect can cause random separation of bay and parts bay is connected to when time warp goes above X2 (and even sometimes when u hit X2). In egenral avoid using those two nodes as they juist cause alot of bugs and issues. if you must use those nodes, make sure absolutely nothing is clipping into the part u connect to internal cargo bay node, otherwise its a 90% chance of problems sooner or later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, service bays seem problematic in general, cargo bays dont cause as much spontaneous explosions, so i tend to use those moreso then the service bays (they are too small to fit missiles inside so its not liek i have any use for them in the 1st place). That said, what id do for a MK1 sized cargo bay that can fit 1 missile, thatd allow me to make Mk1 fuselage fighters without strapping insanely draggy ibeam\u002Bsepatron missiles to the outseide.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tbarcello","CreatedById":147952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T04:18:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it does overheat, then it would be visible in a savefile.
