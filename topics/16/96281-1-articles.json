I have already launched a ship with a 90 deg. inclination, so I\u0027m close to the target plane. How do I set it correctly? The target orbit says Ascend node 178.8 deg. Is there a MechJeb feature I can use to make the ship fall into the target orbit plane perfectly? I don\u0027t mean apoapsis or periapsis - I can set those well enough by myself.

On the \u0027target\u0027 orbit you should see two points marked AN and DN (Ascending and Descending Nodes) -- these are essentially the two points where your orbit and the target orbit intersect (ignoring altitude). What you\u0027ll want to do is orient the camera so that the target orbit looks like a flat line, and the AN and DN markers are pointing to more or less the same point on the screen. Then... it depends on whether or not you have manoeuvre nodes unlocked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you \u003Cstrong\u003Edo\u003C/strong\u003E have manoeuvre nodes unlocked, click that point and create a manoeuvre. Don\u0027t move the camera. Fiddle with the Normal/Anti-normal handles (pink triangles) until your predicted orbit matches that of the target orbit. You don\u0027t need to be super precise, but it\u0027s not overly difficult to manage a 0.0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA or \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B10.1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA match in the orbits. Don\u0027t worry if the AN or DN appear to move around the orbit once you get close to matching them; this is normal, and a result of having quite a close match to your target orbit. Then perform the manoeuvre once your craft reaches the node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you \u003Cstrong\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E have manoeuvre nodes unlocked yet, it\u0027s more tricky. First you need to figure out whether burning normal (pink triangle) or anti-normal (pink triangle with lines poking out of the middle of its sides) is what you need to do. Generally speaking, if you want to flatten your orbit out a bit, you\u0027ll want to burn anti-normal when you\u0027re at the AN, but normal when you\u0027re at the DN. You\u0027ll need to orient your craft towards these markers on the nav-ball as appropriate. Using the camera trick outlines before, you want to wait until your craft is just a little bit before either the AN or DN, depending on which one you\u0027ve planned to burn at. Fire thrusters, watch the orbit change, but just take a little bit of care, especially if you\u0027re doing a plane change of more than 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA or so -- the normal/anti-normal markers on the navball \u003Cem\u003Ewil\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003El\u003C/em\u003E move as your orbit changes, so make sure to keep up with them as best you can to avoid wasting fuel and mucking up your Ap/Pe too greatly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T22:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you going in the correct direction in the orbit?
