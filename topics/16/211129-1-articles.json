I know Jet engines in the game are already one of the most efficient engines in the game compared to other engines like the xenon thruster but I was wondering would that affect the performance or would you need \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E for this level of aerodynamics design?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheFlyingKerman","CreatedById":182407,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-20T14:05:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo. In stock KSP each part is calculated independently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-20T14:25:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWingtip vortices are well beyond the stock aero model and quite possibly beyond \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E as well. Wingtip winglets add weight and drag and almost no fast planes (from military jets to Concorde to rocketplanes like the X-15 all the way to the Space Shuttle) have them; however those aircraft generally don\u2019t worry about fuel consumption as much as a commercial airliner.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
