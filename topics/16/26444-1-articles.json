I\u0027ve attached landing gears to the hab module so I can move it in case of an inprecise landing. And to move the hab module, I made a little land tug, which is pretty much a cockpit, Rovemax 1 wheels, some NUKs, and a KAS winch. I ran into problems when I tried linking the two together, and trying to back up. Apparently the model 1 wheels don\u0027t have a very high towing capacity. I\u0027ve slapped some 24-77 rockets on the tug, but it didn\u0027t do much. In fact, I think the rockets pushed AGAINST the hab module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this leads me to my question. How do you figure out how much force is needed to haul a given load? I know, there\u0027s thrust ratings on the rockets, but heavy math and I go together like peanut butter and dish soap. I want the bare minimum of force so I don\u0027t destroy my poor tug. Hell, if the Model 3 wheels work, that\u0027d be fine, too. Although, I\u0027d have to figure out how a stubby little kerbal can reach that high.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T23:43:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERocket exhaust is physicsless, it won\u0027t bounce off a surface and push it away - although in that situation is does seem to have a bug where the force vanishes entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout friction it\u0027s simple enough.

You can blast kerbals and other parts at hundreds of m/s using rocket exhaust. Try it: Put an engine on an action group, back up the nozzle to a small part in orbit, then full throttle and switch the engine on suddenly and then off again. Your velocity will be only slightly different, but the other part will be moving hundreds of m/s.

The equation will do me well. But I do have to agree with Horn Brain.

I only had two landing gears on the craft, which caused it to tip backwards, which caused it to dig itself in, so to speak. I fixed it by putting on another two to stabilize it, and it worked fine.
