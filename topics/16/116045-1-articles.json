The problem I\u0027m having is that I can\u0027t select \u0022Fredbal\u0027s wreckage\u0022 and set it as a target. I tried right-clicking on it a million times to no avail. I can right-click parts of my ship, so I no it\u0027s not that I can\u0027t right-click anything. \n\nAt first I thought that the ability to set a target was something that needed to be unlocked or researched, but I see nothing in the KSC upgrades. \n\nCould this be some kind of bug? Please help.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T07:22:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 07:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MerlinsMaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T06:00:46Z","Content":"Have you tried restarting the game?
