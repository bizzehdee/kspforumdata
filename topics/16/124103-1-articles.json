I am not using any mods. I have Basic Rocketry, Engineering 101 and Survivability and I\u0027m trying to launch my second rocket. I am only going sub-orbital, never reaching an altitude higher than 24,000 or so, but I have this problem if I go higher as well. I have a basic rocket with a Mk I Module, 3 Science Jr., a Hammer, a parachute on the nose and two on the sides of the top Science Jr, and three Mystery Goo containers on the second Science Jr. I also have two sets of 4 fins at the bottom of the rocket and on the third Science Jr. This is only the latest of several different designs. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s23.postimg.org/kqg4dwqnf/screenshot0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the fuel burns out and I return to the surface, in all cases, I am going too fast to deploy the parachutes, all the way to the ground. I am unable to control the ship in any way to try and slow it down. Even though the SAS light is on, I have never installed it as I don\u0027t have the technology yet. I have no idea what I\u0027m doing wrong. From what I\u0027ve read about similar problems, I\u0027m told to get the speed below 250 m/s. How am I supposed to do this? As you can see from this picture, I still have the \u0022white lines\u0022 indicating drag and I\u0027m far too low in altitude to deploy the chutes.\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s7.postimg.org/5aaijrbhn/screenshot8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs this specific problem doesn\u0027t seem to be mentioned, I\u0027m assuming I\u0027m doing something so fundamentally wrong that none of you experts are even thinking of it as a problem.

The problem with something like you have there is that it\u0027s fairly low drag, and wants to point nose first when coming down. So there\u0027s not a lot slowing it down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of launching straight up, try using a flatter profile, launching and flying at a bit of an angle. That way, when coming back down, the ship is traveling a bit down range also. This lets the rocket travel in thicker air for longer and helps it slow down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso consider decoupling that SRB. They add a bit of weight and make it harder to slow down. Funds wise, empty SRBs are quite cheap. You can also keep the decoupler by attaching it upside down, so that it sticks to the Sci Jr and jettisons only the SRB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure others have more ideas.

I even accidentally killed Jeb while I was still not understanding why I wasn\u0027t able to fly (and didn\u0027t even know he died! R.I.P. Jeb) or release parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, it was easiest to try to maneuver it while at the highest altitude, or the thinnest possible atmosphere. You want your rocket pointed in the retrograde direction on the way down (you have it in the prograde direction currently), which will give you the least aerodynamic shape. The flat-ish bottom of the Hammer is significantly less aerodynamic than the angular shape of the mk1 pod, and you should slow down a lot more, well beyond the point you can deploy your parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also attempt to turn your rocket on the way up so it\u0027s going in a more horizontal direction - the more horizontal you go, the less vertical speed you have which should give you more time to slow down. Just don\u0027t go too horizontal or you could flip or not reach the target altitude you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that, I\u0027m still a newbie here too so some of the aerodynamic experts around here should show up any time if I\u0027m wrong in my understanding of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Jeb (your current Kerbal) is a pilot, so you do have SAS, and if you didn\u0027t you wouldn\u0027t be able to activate it.

I too found that early game, how fast and how high is limited by what you can bring someone back alive from , not what the rocket itself can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS is artificial stability system. It makes control inputs to try and counteract any deviation from the straight and narrow your vehicle may do. It\u0027s not actually a tech - because your crew contains a Pilot, the option is available. However, it can only correct using the same control surfaces that you yourself have - a sufficiently skilled player flies just as well without it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here in lies the rub. You don\u0027t have any control surfaces. Those fins are not steerable, nor does the rocket motor have thrust gimballing. The only steering you have is the reaction wheel torque from the crew capsule. I guess you could outfit your vehicle with multiple crew modules for more \u0022steering\u0022, but it\u0027s not ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, surely the rocket is going slowly the moment it runs out of upward momentum and stops going up? Or are you well out of the atmosphere at this point ? In which case, you\u0027ll just have to earn science with smaller rockets for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, is your rocket turning over horizontal shortly after launch, and developing a very high horizontal velocity which never goes away till you smack the ground?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s plenty of science to be had from little rockets anyway. When I got steerable fins, I basically used a combo of winglets and fins to pull the vehicle out of it\u0027s vertical dive once re-entry was complete. They\u0027d slow it to 100-150 or so, and a 30 deg dive, wherupon the parachute was safe to deploy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gojira1000","CreatedById":152681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T17:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDitch one or two of those materials bays, as a capsule, the lil SRB and a single mat bay will descend safely (just) on a single chute, even with a vertical launch.
