I accept that MchJeb\u0027s features are great for doing routine stuff \u003Cem\u003Eonce you have got to the stage that they have become routine\u003C/em\u003E, but if you start off with it you\u0027ll never get a feel for all of the mechanics you need to play the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for getting to that orbit: first thing you need to know (not possible to see on a screenshot) is which direction the orbit is in. If it\u0027s anti-clockwise when you look at it from above, then that\u0027s fine and easy. If it\u0027s clockwise, then you need to start off with a westwards launch (against the spin of the planet).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m writing this on the assumption that it\u0027s the right way around (so you take off relatively normally to get to it). However, you wouldn\u0027t be the first person to make the mistake of going the wrong way to satisfy a satellite contract. If it\u0027s clockwise, just go the other way...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in any event, Aethon\u0027s advice is the most efficient, without a doubt. Take off from KSC as the orbit passes overhead and match the orbital plane as you do your gravity turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, you can simplify things for yourself if you accept some dv losses, because the plane-change angle from equatorial LKO is significant but not too huge. It looks to be about 30\u00B0, which means that it\u0027ll cost you half of your orbital velocity to change plane, and you can set things up so that (a) your orbital velocity is relatively low when you do it and (b) you integrate a slight angle to every burn to reduce the full cost of changing plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EFirst step\u003C/u\u003E (whether following Aethon\u0027s advice or not): \u003Cu\u003Elaunch to LKO very shortly before the target orbit crosses the equator at KSC\u003C/u\u003E.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be efficient, you\u0027ll try to do as Aethon said and get to LKO with more or less the right angle, with AN/DN reducing to zero. If you don\u0027t and you end up with a more-or-less equatorial orbit, you\u0027ll spend more fuel but the next bit is still valid:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of your ascent, you\u0027ll generally have about 1 minute of doing nothing while you wait to reach Apoapsis to circularise. Use that time to see how far off the target orbit\u0027s angle you are. The reason why is because you want to make any plane change at as slow a speed as possible, and this is one of those times that you\u0027re going slower than full orbital speed. \u003Cstrong\u003ECircularise while adding a slight (max 15\u00B0 or so) normal / antinormal component to reduce the plane-change angle\u003C/strong\u003E. Watch what is happening in map view and make sure you don\u0027t overdo it, i.e. don\u0027t make your LKO too high and don\u0027t overdo the adjustment towards the angle of your target orbit (if there is any significant change in angle needed, that should be mostly left to step 3 below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENext step: burn up to near the target orbit\u0027s Ap while adding a slight plane-change angle\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming that your angle is still quite far off, place a manouvre node \u003Cstrong\u003Eat AN or DN\u003C/strong\u003E for the burn up to the target orbit, as close as possible to the target Ap. And \u003Cu\u003Ereally Ap, not Pe\u003C/u\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is because when you get there, you will be going at the slowest speed ever since you lifted off from KSC, and that is the time you want to do the biggest change to the angle of your orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, again, adding a slight normal/antinormal vector is not going to cost you too much. So when you are placing your manouvre node, start with prograde to get your orbit up, note the m/s cost of the manouvre, and then add the normal/antinormal vector up to a relatively low limit (like 10% of the cost of the purely prograde burn). Be aware that adding a normal or antinormal vector will change the final Ap, so adjust prograde/retrograde to compensate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom your picture, your target orbit\u0027s Ap is unlikely to be at the AN/DN. That makes it a little more complicated because you\u0027ll need to add a radial component later, but it\u0027s still not a significant problem. The plane change is the most expensive part of all this anyway, so concentrate most on reducing the AN/DN angle a bit. But don\u0027t try to reduce the angle too much at this stage either: it\u0027s better to wait until the next stage for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFinal step: circularise at Ap with the remaining plane-change vector \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve done all this right, you\u0027ll reach Ap exactly as it touches your target orbit. And you\u0027ll be going relatively slowly. Much more slowly than in LKO. So this is the time to make the biggest plane-change burn if you have to. Simply place a manouvre node and match orbit to the target orbit. That means adding a significant prograde vector and a normal/antinormal vector.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you are unlikely to be at the target orbit\u0027s Ap, you will also need to add a radial in/out vector. Do this all at once, it\u0027s cheaper than doing it all in separate stages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd voila, burn and you\u0027re done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, if the target orbit is clockwise, not anticockwise, then you simply need to follow the same simple steps but start off going westwards (270\u00B0 not 90\u00B0) from KSC instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-14T11:31:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2016 11:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T14:21:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d suggest just using SmartASS from MechJeb, instead of going cold turkey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMJ doesn\u0027t have the option to match a contract\u0027s orbit, although it would not be impossible to implement, I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you absolutely have to use MJ, circularize at the target Pe or Ap, then change inclination to match the target orbit when you intersect it.
