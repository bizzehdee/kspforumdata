amount, \u00A0and cost the same delta-v, whether you send it on a tanker or as part of your main ship. \u00A0And doing a rendezvous and docking will use up some extra fuel as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E was not sure if a one-launch design to the farthest planets were possible. I suspect they are not comfortable with massive many stage ships, and that is fine. But the cost due to using a refuel ship method will definitely cost more fuel, time, and money...at least is a solution well withing their grasp to achieve, and maybe even master.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow","CreatedById":65767,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-31T20:22:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can go anywhere you like.\u00A0 I\u0027ve tried using ore mining after it was introduced but just found it too much hassle to set up, so have played without it ever since.\u00A0 Before it was introduced I sent manned missions to all the landable planets and moons and safely returned everyone.\u00A0 As far as I am concerned it is just a feature to add variety to the game but isn\u0027t a necessity.\u00A0 That may be different for someone who wishes to visit more than one planet on any particular flight, rather than simple out and return flights.\u00A0 In that case you may want to include refuelling via a mining operation somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
