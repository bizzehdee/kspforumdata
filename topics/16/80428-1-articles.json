Sandbox disables science and funds both, meaning you wouldn\u0027t really get that much out of it. That said, you could also do Career mode and just revert to launch after any launch failure to prevent loss of funds. Contracts give you so much money that even that might not prove too terribly necessary, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want to get into the maths side of things, there are mods that can help with that, which tally up information and give you data like your current delta-V and thrust-to-weight ratio. A favorite for that is Kerbal Engineer Redux.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T19:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say science is probably the best mode for beginners.
