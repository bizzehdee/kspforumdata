Not sure why, but it feels safer. Anyways... Science modules get to the ground safely and than venish from Tracking and I can\u0027t recover my science stuff.

Assuming the debris did in fact land safely and didn\u0027t get too far from you and get deleted (debris further than 2.5km from the active or focused vessel in an atmosphere will be deleted), you can find it using the icons across the top of the screen to toggle the visibility of debris in the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T14:07:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the Tracking station, there\u0027s a line of buttons displaying different ship types.

BTW, try decoupling science about 3 km above ground level, this might save it from disappearing (don\u0027t forget to activate chutes though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you can also just take experiments using EVA suit and store them in command module.
