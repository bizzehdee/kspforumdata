Ideally, you\u0027d nail the exact course from Kerbin orbit and the crew could sleep until the injection burn. The problem is that the transfer burn from Kerbin orbit is usually 1000\u002B m/s. Unless you have a very high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, that means you will be burning relatively far from the actual maneuver node for part of it.

Since I couldn\u0027t tune it that precisely, I launched on a \u0027close enough\u0027 trajectory. When I was ~ 80% of the way there, I did a correction burn to get the encounter and it was still only about 2 m/s. It was worth the extra 2 m/s because I just couldn\u0027t dial in the intercept precisely enough from the

couple points I haven\u0027t seen mentioned on this yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, when setting up transfers by hand, it\u0027s often easier to set up any correction node once you\u0027re outside Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, just due to how patched conics display.\u00A0 And, when you\u0027re still in Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, any up/down adjustments you make are relative to Kerbin, when what you\u0027re ultimately needing is relative to the sun.\u00A0 This can sometimes be confusing, so it\u0027s generally easier to wait until you\u0027re outside Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\u00A0Also, prior to the relatively recent addition of the maneuver node editor box in the lower left corner, the interface often made it very difficult to plot correction burns while you\u0027 were still close to Kerbin.\u00A0 You had to focus on the target planet to see your trajectory in its vicinity but the node was all the way back at Kerbin where it was hard to manipulate.\u00A0 So this is often why folks would do their corrections like 1/2way to the target.\u00A0 They were outside Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and close enough to the target to manipulate the node while focused on the target.\u00A0 Experienced players, knowing this was how you had to work around the limitations of the interface, would bring a bit more fuel than necessary to cover any inefficiencies this method caused.\u00A0 Nowadays, however, with the node editor, these concerns don\u0027t matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing to keep in mind about waiting to the middle to do the mid-course inclination burn is that the further you get from Kerbin, the more vertical distance there is between Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane (where you are)\u00A0and the plane of the target.\u00A0 Thus, your ship has to go up or down at a steeper angle the farther you are from Kerbin.\u00A0 Which means, when you encounter the target, you\u0027ll have more inclination relative to the target because you\u0027ll be approaching it at a steeper angle from above or below.\u00A0 If you\u0027re wanting to get into an equatorial orbit at the target, then yo\u0027u\u0027ll have a bigger inclination change to do once you get there than if you\u0027d done the en route plane change closer to home.\u00A0 If you\u0027re not concerned about this, then it doesn\u0027t matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

You wont leave Kerbin orbit in just one burn, so after burning 450-500 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E necessary to leave orbit i delete the node and make another one in the same place, rotate once around the planet and continue burning. I lose nothing but some time (45 min to 1hr in game) which changes nothing in interplanetary transfers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Press ALT and . to engage in forced warp, so you can burn AND warp at the same time.
