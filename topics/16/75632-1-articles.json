This occurred after working out in a small rocket, that it actually had more delta V for the same total mass, than using as many stages as possible. I was clearly under the mistaken impression that staging always helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter doing a bit of research, in form of a spread sheet, now looks like a mess of numbers that gives me a headache \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. Discovered a couple of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spread sheet calculated delta V, total mass, and fuel mass and the ratio that you Ln in the calculator to get the delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI increased its increments by the 0.5625 mass fuel container. As the increments increased I noticed the difference between each increment in Delta V was always getting smaller. Each 0.5625 container gave less delta V each time I added one, which I kinda expected. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI created another column next to it which calculated delta V of a rocket that had a new stage added, using a decoupler and engine. Then incrementally put this next to the column with difference in delta V for each added 0.5625 container. I paste some of the spread sheet here. It didn\u0027t copy very well, but if u look at the number 618.3, then column next to it that\u0027s what I\u0027m referring too. Its very rough, I didn\u0027t take TWR into account, or really proper engines ISP, just used the same ISP. I think optimum staging point is roughly at 65% of the total mass as fuel, for when you should stage. If u do it before that, the staging creates less delta V increase than simply adding the container. It might be different with smaller parts, I only tried it with early career ones. Certainly anything that is less than 50% of total mass as fuel would be less efficient. Sort leads me to believe that the asparagus pancake design I see a lot is actually quite wasteful. I imagine the fuel pumps are not the problem just how the staging is done, with each section being the same size container as previous stage. This seems to suggest each stage should get proportionally larger. I\u0027m not that great at maths or this stuff, so maybe someone else has already figured this out, and could save my brain a massive headache?

It\u0027s that thing in logarithm brackets in the rocket equation. Even though it looks like it\u0027s just a simple, inconsequential division operation, it actually carries a number of important implications. And that\u0027s something that takes most people a while to truly understand - myself, I played KSP obsessively for months before it suddenly clicked (and then only after asking and reading on the forums).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wrote a wall of text about it here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81919-PURE-rocket-SSTO?p=1194322#post1194322\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81919-PURE-rocket-SSTO?p=1194322#post1194322\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlightly different topic (SSTO design), but same general gist, especially the first half.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TL;DR version is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour fuel mass fraction can never exceed a certain number, even if you attempt to add the entire observable universe\u0027s mass as fuel. This in turn means your dV will never exceed a certain number either. And that, finally, means that the more fuel you add, the less you get from each additional unit of fuel (which is exactly what you observed). Eventually the point comes where you practically cannot gain any more dV by adding fuel. This is called \u0022the tyranny of the rocket equation\u0022. The only way around that problem is staging, because this \u0022law\u0022 applies to individual stages only. A staged vehicle can have a theoretically infinite amount of dV. The smaller each stage is, the less diminishing returns you face from the fuel mass fraction, and thus the higher your efficiency becomes and your total amount of dV goes up despite your mass on the launchpad staying the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as you continue to make stages smaller and smaller, you need more and more of these stages to achieve your intended total dV. Also, the amount of fuel in each stage becomes smaller and smaller, and thus it becomes more and more dominated by things that are not fuel. Such as engines. If you keep downsizing, your gains from downsizing get smaller and smaller - just like the diminishing returns a single stage faces from adding more fuel, just in the opposite direction. Eventually the point comes where you cannot gain any more dV by having a larger number of smaller stages. Additionally, there is a point even before that where you can build a less staged vehicle with the same dV but with less total weight on the launchpad, because you\u0027re lifting less dry mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus the ideal point of \u0022least mass on the pad, largest dV in flight\u0022 lies somewhere in between these two opposing scales of diminishing returns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, in the real world, each staging operation is also a potential \u0022single point of failure\u0022, which is a thing you really want to avoid in engineering. Thus having many stages is often undesired, even if additional stages could improve the efficiency of the launcher. Most contemporary rockets go to low earth orbit (or even geostationary orbit) in two stages. The Saturn V carried the Apollo lunar lander into lunar orbit in 3 launch stages plus a fourth transfer/return stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, what I took away from all of that for myself is a set of three \u0022rules of the thumb\u0022 for designing my rockets: 1.) all stages should have as similar dV as possible; 2.) individual stages should aim for a fuel mass fraction of between 50% and 66%; and 3.) this needs to be achieved while still maintaining useful TWR for all stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-21T17:12:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2014 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T18:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...Finally, in the real world, each staging operation is also a potential \u0022single point of failure\u0022, which is a thing you really want to avoid in engineering.

Technically, the way the rocket equation works has not - but the way we build rockets, that sure changed as the physics model of the game was improved over time. Asparagus staging, for example, is very rarely used nowadays, as the \u0022new\u0022 aerodynamics model from 2015 actively works against pancake shaped rockets.

Since you want to keep a similar Mass fraction,\u00A0\u00A0and you want to minimize pancake design (tho I play with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E and deadly reentry so not sure how this effects things) then the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is your limiting factor on keeping a similar mass fraction. So it is a balancing act between keeping launch \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and mass fraction good with respect to your mass you are delivering to space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with this in mind it would make perfect since to design the payload first, so you can get a idea of total weight of the payload. Then with some fancy math you could easily come up with the amount of fuel needed for each stage below that. Then you just keep adding/removing stages until your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is good and you target \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E is good (for me it is always low kerbin orbit).

stages, or are you speaking of a ten-stage monstrosity?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery staging scheme has its benefits and its costs.\u00A0 Traditionally, there are inline staging and side-along staging.\u00A0\u00A0There are some variants such as onion staging, and asparagus staging is a sort of hybrid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInline staging (like the Saturn V) has the benefit that when each stage empties and is jettisoned, the remaining upper stage is fully-fuelled.\u00A0 This works well for the Saturn V because it gives the benefit of full burn time for each booster but at a cost of reduced thrust on each stage.\u00A0 However, the reduced thrust is okay because the upper stage engines are optimised for the region of the atmosphere in which they were meant to work; there is no benefit from burning all of the stages at once (assuming that it could be done without rapid unplanned disassembly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSide-along staging (like the Delta IV Heavy) has the benefit that all of the engines\u00A0(core and two boosters), burn at the same time, which increases thrust (by about three times, assuming my arithmetic is still good).\u00A0 Putting aside the throttle trickery used by the actual Delta IV Heavy, the net effect is that when the boosters empty and stage away, the core is left partially empty and thus suffering from both a higher dry mass in the mass fraction and reduced burn time because of the lack of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnion staging (I don\u0027t know of any rockets that actually use this, but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any reason they can\u0027t) is actually a variant of inline staging.\u00A0 Envision a rocket like the Delta IV Heavy, but instead of lighting all three engines, imagine that only the outer two are lit, and when they are empty, they stage away and the core is lit.\u00A0 The name\u00A0comes from the idea that the outer boosters fall off and leave the inner ones to burn anew, much like peeling layers of an onion.\u00A0 Note that it looks the same as the side-along-staged Delta IV Heavy,\u00A0\u00A0 but it merely appears similar to side-along staging because strapping the boosters to the sides helps with symmetric thrust.\u00A0 You get the same result when you attach the boosters to a bicoupler or the like and achieve a more inline look.\u00A0 In essence, we can even go so far as to say that inline staging is the degenerate case of onion staging when there is only one additional booster in each stage.\u00A0 Its benefits and costs are the same as for inline staging, except that when there are multiple outer boosters, they do have the advantage of some increased thrust (though technically the same effect can be achieved with clustering and taller or more numerous propellant tanks).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsparagus staging works by the boosters sharing their propellant with all engines inward from them.\u00A0 Practically, it is a series of powered supplementary propellant tanks--meaning that the tanks lift their own mass against gravity rather than your core stack needing to lift their mass in addition to the rest of the rocket.\u00A0 This means that, in the Delta IV Heavy example, all three engines are lit at the start, but you\u0027d see the outer side boosters stage away much sooner.\u00A0\u00A0The core engine, however, would have the benefit of full burn time because until that point, it would be\u00A0running on propellant flowing in from the outer boosters rather than in its own tank.\u00A0 In this way, it combines the advantages of high thrust and high second-stage mass fraction, but at the cost of increased drag (there\u0027s no inline form) and much-reduced stage burn time.\u00A0 Because the core stage burns (usually with a full propellant load) the entire time, this is a problem with efficiency in the new aerodynamics model because first-stage engines get to be quite inefficient compared to their vacuum-rated counterparts once they get over ten kilometres.\u00A0 The old model had an atmosphere thick enough to require high-thrust engines quite a long way, and it also calculated drag in a weird way that actually justified pancake-shaped rockets (drag was calculated per-part and paid no attention to orientation, so nosecones, for example, increased the part count and thus \u003Cem\u003Eincreased\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0drag).\u00A0 It made sense in some cases to have many-stage rockets\u00A0that were\u00A0wider than the launchpad just to get to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the atmosphere is thinner (such\u00A0it takes 1,000 m/s less delta-V to reach orbit), and the aerodynamics reward long, thin rockets.\u00A0 If you need extra thrust in the first stage, then solid rocket boosters provide that at a bargain.\u00A0 Asparagus staging, on the other hand, \u003Cem\u003Erequires\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a wider rocket and

that your rocket was too light--three tonnes of engine on one tonne of payload is a lot.\u00A0 Three tonnes of engine on thirty tonnes of payload is a lot less of a dry mass penalty, and gives the nuke a chance for its higher efficiency to work for you.\u00A0 Second is that you were using rocket propellant tanks instead of liquid-fuel-only tanks.\u00A0 That not only gives you a reduced fuel

there is no benefit from burning all of the stages at once (assuming that it could be done without rapid unplanned disassembly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSide-along staging (like the Delta IV Heavy) has the benefit that all of the engines\u00A0(core and two boosters), burn at the same time, which increases thrust (by about three times, assuming my arithmetic is still good).\u00A0 Putting aside the throttle trickery used by the actual Delta IV Heavy, the net effect is that when the boosters empty and stage away, the core is left partially empty and thus suffering from both a higher dry mass in the mass fraction and reduced burn time because of the lack of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnion staging (I don\u0027t know of any rockets that actually use this, but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any reason they can\u0027t) is actually a variant of inline staging.\u00A0 Envision a rocket like the Delta IV Heavy, but instead of lighting all three engines, imagine that only the outer two are lit, and when they are empty, they stage away and the core is lit.\u00A0 The name\u00A0comes from the idea that the outer boosters fall off and leave the inner ones to burn anew, much like peeling layers of an onion.\u00A0 Note that it looks the same as the side-along-staged Delta IV Heavy,\u00A0\u00A0 but it merely appears similar to side-along staging because strapping the boosters to the sides helps with symmetric thrust.\u00A0 You get the same result when you attach the boosters to a bicoupler or the like and achieve a more inline look.\u00A0 In essence, we can even go so far as to say that inline staging is the degenerate case of onion staging when there is only one additional booster in each stage.\u00A0 Its benefits and costs are the same as for inline staging, except that when there are multiple outer boosters, they do have the advantage of some increased thrust (though technically the same effect can be achieved with clustering and taller or more numerous propellant tanks).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsparagus staging works by the boosters sharing their propellant with all engines inward from them.\u00A0 Practically, it is a series of powered supplementary propellant tanks--meaning that the tanks lift their own mass against gravity rather than your core stack needing to lift their mass in addition to the rest of the rocket.\u00A0 This means that, in the Delta IV Heavy example, all three engines are lit at the start, but you\u0027d see the outer side boosters stage away much sooner.\u00A0\u00A0The core engine, however, would have the benefit of full burn time because until that point, it would be\u00A0running on propellant flowing in from the outer boosters rather than in its own tank.\u00A0 In this way, it combines the advantages of high thrust and high second-stage mass fraction, but at the cost of increased drag (there\u0027s no inline form) and much-reduced stage burn time.\u00A0 Because the core stage burns (usually with a full propellant load) the entire time, this is a problem with efficiency in the new aerodynamics model because first-stage engines get to be quite inefficient compared to their vacuum-rated counterparts once they get over ten kilometres.\u00A0 The old model had an atmosphere thick enough to require high-thrust engines quite a long way, and it also calculated drag in a weird way that actually justified pancake-shaped rockets (drag was calculated per-part and paid no attention to orientation, so nosecones, for example, increased the part count and thus \u003Cem\u003Eincreased\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0drag).\u00A0 It made sense in some cases to have many-stage rockets\u00A0that were\u00A0wider than the launchpad just to get to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the atmosphere is thinner (such\u00A0it takes 1,000 m/s less delta-V to reach orbit), and the aerodynamics reward long, thin rockets.\u00A0 If you need extra thrust in the first stage, then solid rocket boosters provide that at a bargain.\u00A0 Asparagus staging, on the other hand, \u003Cem\u003Erequires\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a wider rocket and involves extra parts that are also extra-draggy parts.\u00A0 It still has applications (Darts enjoy good efficiency from the surface to orbit, and\u00A0high thrust, high second-stage mass-fraction rockets are a practical application for\u00A0a lot of situations--Eve ascent is the crown of them all), but it is no longer the champion\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u00DCber-rocket\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0that it once was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, in space (which was your original question) it is normally a waste to haul engines that you do not absolutely need.\u00A0 As with anything, there are applications, but few to none for asparagus staging once in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the staging info, this was actually very helpful information.

the rules are a bit different from the situation that would necessitate asparagus staging on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main advantage of asparagus staging is that it was essentially a way to run the core along with the boosters while still expending only booster propellant.\u00A0 This does two things:\u00A0 it gives a lot of thrust, and it also leaves you with full propellant tanks after each staging event.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn space, there is little need for high thrust.\u00A0 It helps in certain applications--the Rhino is a vacuum-rated engine and it has a proper niche--but it\u0027s not strictly necessary in the way that it is necessary to have high thrust to get off the pad at launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, having full propellant tanks after each staging event (or, more accurately, staging away empty tanks rather than carrying the tankage dead weight)\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0useful in space.\u00A0 That\u0027s already a concept; it\u0027s called\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edrop tanks\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 The idea is that you have one engine (or cluster, or however you\u0027re moving your rocket) feed from a series of tanks, and as each tank empties, you stage away the empty dead weight.\u00A0 This works in applications that need it, but in many cases, it\u0027s just not necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of the reason for that is that it doesn\u0027t take a literally astronomical amount of propellant to get anywhere in KSP.\u00A0 Another part is that staging away the empty tank improves your mass fraction by the mass of an empty tank--i.e., not much if it\u0027s a large rocket.\u00A0 Small rockets benefit more, but in those cases, it\u0027s trivial to add significant propellant mass fraction.\u00A0 A small probe on an FL-T800 tank with a Spark engine can go nearly anywhere.\u00A0 The same probe on an S3-14400 tank can go anywhere ten times.\u00A0 There\u0027s no need for staged tanks when you can simply use a larger tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are mostly correct, one reason

finished moving the asteroid, yes?\u00A0 In that case, then yes, you saw increased delta-V because you removed many tonnes of no-longer-needed mission equipment that was reducing your mass ratio.\u00A0 However, you would also have seen increases in delta-V from staging away the claw, for example; the nature or use of the dry mass is not important, but the \u003Cem\u003Eamount\u003C/em\u003E of dry mass is important.\u00A0 That the engines were heavy was the deciding factor in your delta-V increase, but the fact that they were asparagus-staged did not matter.\u00A0 In this respect, once you are in space,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E reduction of dry mass will give you delta-V increases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I believe you are aware, delta-V for a stage in space is dependent on exactly two things:\u00A0 engine efficiency and mass ratio.\u00A0 If you add additional engines of the same type, then the efficiency is the same; there\u0027s no \u0027bulk discount\u0027 or similar concept at work.\u00A0 Thus, with the caveat\u00A0that your engine choice for a given rocket stage remains the same (not necessarily always the case:\u00A0 some spaceplanes can\u00A0switch from a Dart for ascent-and-circularisation to a Nerv for orbital manoeuvres, for example),\u00A0the only way to gain increased delta-V while in space is to increase the wet-to-dry mass ratio, and the only ways to do \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E are either to add wet mass (via tanker or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E) or to get rid of dry mass.\u00A0 Note that I am not mentioning tricks such as the Oberth effect and other things that allow you to get more out of the delta-V that you already have; I am strictly limiting myself to actual increases in available delta-V by manipulation of the rocket, not the trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe location of the discarded mass can be an important factor:\u00A0 a reduction in dry mass improves the mass ratio of its stage and of every stage below it.\u00A0 Thus, payload mass reduction is extremely helpful, but launch-stage mass reduction doesn\u0027t help so much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first key element\u00A0of asparagus staging that separates it from other staging options is that it optimises the fuel flow to allow\u00A0you to run several different stages\u0027 engines off of one stage\u0027s propellant\u00A0supply,\u00A0with the effect\u00A0that you get the benefit of increased thrust but without needing to add any more boosters\u00A0to your rocket than you\u0027d need otherwise.\u00A0 The second key element of asparagus staging is that it ensures that stages drain sequentially and are immediately discarded--tanks and engines both--once emptied, with the effect that it keeps the wet-to-dry mass ratio for each stage as high as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever--and this part is critical--you may note that this is functionally \u003Cem\u003Eidentical\u003C/em\u003E to inline staging insofar as delta-V calculation is concerned, because the rocket equation doesn\u0027t care about thrust.\u00A0 Only the second element of discarding tanks and engines when they empty is relevant to the rocket equation.\u00A0 The only differences are\u00A0in the arrangement of the tanks and the fact that with asparagus, the engines all burn together rather than one at a time.\u00A0 Since additional engines of the same efficiency do not contribute additional delta-V, but do\u00A0count as dry mass, removing those engines but keeping the propellant tanks (i.e., drop tanks) will yield a modest increase in delta-V.\u00A0 The same thing is true of inline staging:\u00A0\u00A0imagine, if you will, a rocket that has a long line of\u00A0propellant tanks behind it, and rather than having the engine at the bottom of that stack, there is a pair of radial-mounted engines on the forward-most tank.\u00A0 Each tank drains sequentially from the aft to the fore, and as each aft-most tank empties, it is decoupled and discarded, leaving the remaining tanks full.\u00A0 The net effect is inline-staged drop tanks, and it sees delta-V\u00A0values that correspond to the radial-mounted, asparagus-derived\u00A0drop tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

you well noted.\u00A0 Part of our misunderstanding, I think, is the fact that the various staging options are generally regarded

launch configurations, though thrust may not be especially important in space (except for, as you stated, personal preference), thrust is immensely important when trying to escape gravity and reach orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ELaunch\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0delta-V\u00A0depends on three things, not two:\u00A0 engine efficiency, mass ratio, and thrust, because the rocket has to contend with the gravity field of the body that it is attempting to orbit (which is a technical way of saying that it needs must be able to lift itself from the ground).\u00A0 Though it is not technically accurate to say that the launch delta-V is \u003Cem\u003Edirectly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0dependent on\u00A0thrust, it is true that without a redesign of the rocket, thrust\u00A0is the only way\u00A0you have to control those additional factors that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0directly affect launch delta-V.\u00A0 I can show you the equation for delta-V in a situation where external forces act on a rocket, if you like, but the short version is that (among other things) there is a subtraction of gravitational acceleration multiplied by flight time (acceleration multiplied by time is a velocity--but this is negative velocity that takes away from your available delta-V).\u00A0 Gravity always pulls the rocket down, reducing the vertical speed, and the longer the rocket is not in stable orbit, the longer the force acts against it\u00A0and the more the force needs to be overcome.\u00A0 High thrust mitigates much of this loss because, although it cannot do anything about the acceleration, it helps you reduce the flight time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrust, engine efficiency, and mass ratio\u00A0also interact with one another to affect burn time, both in the sense of length of time the boosters run before they are emptied and in the sense of length of time required to complete a manoeuvre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe various staging configurations are all designed to maximise something, always at the cost of something else, and the trade-offs are all to do with the three components:\u00A0 mass ratio, burn time, and thrust.\u00A0 Asparagus staging maximises thrust and post-staging mass ratio at the expense of burn time.\u00A0 Inline (and onion)\u00A0staging maximises burn time and post-staging mass ratio at the expense of thrust.\u00A0 Side-along staging maximises thrust and burn time at the expense of post-staging mass ratio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere may be specific elements unique to each staging scheme that weigh their relative value one way or the other but do not relate to what I have listed here.\u00A0 I am not attempting to be exhaustive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSide-along staging, although it provides good thrust and manageable burn times, is often a bad choice for spaceborne operations because of the mass ratio issue.\u00A0 For launching heavy payloads into space in the first place, it can be excellent because its long burn times mean it does not suffer the decay in thrust that asparagus staging does:\u00A0 you get full thrust for the boosters\u0027 full\u00A0burn time.\u00A0 The problem is that when the boosters are expended, you are left with a core stack that spent an appreciable fraction of its propellant pushing the stage that is no longer there.\u00A0 This reduces the mass ratio, which in space is inefficient.\u00A0 You may note that SRBs are almost purpose-built for side-along staging, but that mostly results from the fact that they usually don\u0027t have enough thrust on their own to loft a payload to space, and that their propellant cannot be pumped from booster to booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce in space, asparagus staging and inline staging both preserve maximum mass ratio for upper stages,\u00A0so the\u00A0best ways to compare their usefulness involve a focus\u00A0on thrust in space (as you do) or on how you get the rocket to space in the first place (as I do).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that runs into the issue of personal preference, too:\u00A0 I don\u0027t like draggy rockets, even though asparagus staging also gives higher thrust.\u00A0 One of the specific elements unique to asparagus staging is that it works best with fuel lines, but fuel lines are drag-inducing parts.\u00A0 Therefore, I design my payloads, where possible, for inline-staged rockets where the thrust, though lower, is still exactly what I need to do the job, and I don\u0027t need to concern myself with the drag of the lines, struts, radial decouplers, and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022

choose.\u00A0 Doubling the engines doubles my potential lifting power, but the bicoupler\u00A0limits the aerodynamic losses (somewhat).\u00A0 On the other hand, it makes the long, thin rocket even longer and still rather thin--there\u0027s a limit there, too, where wobble and oscillation can cause problems.\u00A0 My landers, for example, are often more pancake-like because they won\u0027t tip

this is why fins at the fore are normally a bad idea.\u00A0 Fins at the rear\u00A0can help keep a rocket stable, but there is also such a thing as\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0stable, because too much stabilising drag can make the rocket difficult to turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder the old (pre-version 1.0) aerodynamics, drag was so much worse that it cost over a thousand more metres per second just to reach orbit (roughly 4,500 m/s versus the present roughly 3,400 m/s).\u00A0 Furthermore, it was practically necessary to lift off vertically for the first ten kilometres and then make a sharp turn to forty-five degrees.\u00A0 You cannot do that with a current-version rocket and expect not to flip out of control and crash.\u00A0 But this is also the reason why so many posts and threads (especially old ones) sing the praises of asparagus staging:\u00A0 under that aero system, a staging scheme that had high thrust and kept high mass ratio was the best way by far to plough through the atmosphere and still have enough fuel to get to orbit.\u00A0 Under the current system, it is not that asparagus staging is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebad\u003C/em\u003E, but rather that it is reduced to an equal footing from its original status as the clear winner over everything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223653936\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002275632\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566264977\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bobisback\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/19/2019 at 9:36 PM, bobisback said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the game I am currently playing I am finding the big issue is getting enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, even with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s it is a challenge when you are trying to lift 50\u002B tons with only skiffs hahahaha.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing that you mean fifty tonnes of payload delivered to space, not on the pad.\u00A0 If so, then yes, that\u0027s a lot of Skiffs!\u00A0 Consider looking at the Twin Boar;
