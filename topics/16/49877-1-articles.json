That\u0027s dictated my progress so far. After Basic Rocketry, my next priority was Survivability for the LV-909 (which let me do reasonable efficiency Mun flybys), General Rocketry (for the LV-T45 - which can steer, which means I can build heavier boosters) and Stability (for TT-38-Ks, enabling basic onion staging at least). After that was General Construction (struts! and the TT-70 didn\u0027t hurt; I\u0027ve never really liked the 38-K), Science Tech (for the Z-100 Battery packs, moar power of course) and Advanced Rocketry (for the FL-T800; not really essential but fewer parts is a consideration when you\u0027ve got a low-end box like mine). Electrics (for OX-STAT panels) is my next priority, and once I have Fuel Systems (for fuel ducts), I can rebuild the Apocalypse (which uses true onion staging; having RCS at that point may also open up some more possibilities). I may have picked up Flight Control somewhere along the way; I want to say I have access to the Stayputnik but haven\u0027t used it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T16:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven the massive amount of science that can be earned on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus, any tech that gets you there the sooner the better. What tech that is depends on how you construct your rockets.

Just make sure you maximize your science when you do anything - so completely farm our the science on ground, lower atmosphere, and Kerbin LKO (transmit several times before returning your science cans, do an EVA and get a report), same with higher orbit. Make a bee line for other science cans would be a help.

Once you unlock your first set of Solar Panels, sending stayputnik probes with mystery goo all over the system to only do flybysis enough to generate a good amount of science points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nadreck","CreatedById":89087,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T17:08:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, I really missed docking ports and made them a priority right after solar panels.

Obviously, RCS is needed for the docking port to be usefull, and you get the fuel duct (makes launchers more efficient, and landers with a much lower CG).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T17:49:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, basic solar panels were a priority because I need them for any reasonable science mission, whether manned or unmanned. So I\u0027ve gone around the bottom of the tech tree, much like SkyRender. This is purely a self imposed limitation mind. I prefer to go with \u0027realistic\u0027 re-entries, so anything that sits in front of the capsule heatshield is a no-no. Hence I don\u0027t tend to bring many science pods home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepends on personal play style though. I can see a couple of other ways down the tree. Heavy rockets to bring back big landers with science parts all over them, or an earlyish focus on construction techs to get to docking to let you build interplanetary ships in orbit and get your science fix around distant worlds. I\u0027m not sure I see the point of early plane technologies though but I\u0027m not a big spaceplane builder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T08:13:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup - priority on Science Parts and Solar Panels (though, you only really need the small panel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe in some future version the science parts will be unlocked by Tech Level, not by any particular Tech Node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAircraft parts are, sadly, the worst path to go deep into early.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T12:51:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve actually found myself hitting a wall around tier 4 parts.
