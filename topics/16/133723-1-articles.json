There are a couple of reasons for that. \u00A0Fist is that for a ship that size, you really don\u0027t even need RCS for attitude control. The reaction wheels inside that command pod should be plenty to turn your ship. \u00A0That means that they\u0027re only useful when docking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, for docking there is a little-known trick for translation movements: use fine controls. If you\u0027re unaware, you can press Caps Lock at any time and it will put you into \u0022fine\u0022 control mode, and the little red arrows in the bottom left corner will turn cyan/light blue. \u00A0The important thing this does for RCS and docking is to automatically adjust the thrust of each RCS block to keep it within what the command pod reaction wheels can counter, as long as they\u0027re fairly close to balanced to begin with. \u00A0This means that RCS thrusters closer to the CoM will thrust more, and ones further away will thrust less, automatically. \u00A0So as long as you\u0027re close enough to being balanced, the fine controls will take care of the rest for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if/when you\u0027re willing to look at mods, there\u0027s a great one called\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/33124-105-rcs-build-aid-v077/\u0022\u003ERCS Build Aid\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0that has lots of features to get your RCS balanced\u00A0\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ejust so\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E.
