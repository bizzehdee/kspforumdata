After placing the decoupler on the rocket body (anywhere from 1 to 6 of them), attaching the SRBs to the decoupler seems to be a matter of hit or miss. With 6 decouplers on the rocket body, placing the SRBs on the decouplers seems to attach the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E directly to the rocket body instead of the decouplers. Sometimes it works, but a lot of the times the attachment isn\u2019t correct, resulting in a \u201Cclick\u201D when I decouple in flight, but the SRBs remain attached (with an attendant disaster!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing the move tool to reposition the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u2019t seem to help, since correct positioning of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E on the decoupler requires both lateral and rotational movement, and seeing what\u2019s happening is nearly impossible, especially when you get to 6 SRBs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems to be a known problem since I\u2019ve seen references to it dating back to 2015, but I\u2019m hoping that there is a relatively simple solution since all I want to do is add 6 radial decouples and attach a corresponding 6 SRBs. If it matters, I\u2019m running the latest Steam version on a Mac.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance for and advice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-17T13:13:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/212503-macbates/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022212503\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/212503-macbates/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@macbates\u003C/a\u003E, your question has been moved from Welcome Aboard to our Gameplay section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrdinaryKerman","CreatedById":208637,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-17T13:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure you actually attached the boosters to the decoupler? The relatively small size of radial decouplers makes it easy to miss and accidentally attach your boosters directly to the core stage and not to the decoupler.
