How does that work exactly?\n\nSo last night I did do a redesign of the craft again, this after re-installing LoadOnDemand and getting rid of some excess mods that I a) no longer needed and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) didn\u0027t really use that much, like KVV (being able tell which button in the ModuleManager does what again is *very* nice; my screenies from here on out shouldn\u0027t look like dreck either). The version of the craft on my Dropbox is pre-revision, so I could go revisit it again if I wanted to (I\u0027d just download it from myself). The redesign saw the removal of the structural intakes and 24-77s and the removal of the fuel from the tail, and the addition of side fuel/intake/nacelle pods with two side-mounted LV-909 engines. FAR greenlit the flight except for L\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u00B8\u003C/sub\u003E at 30/4 (it thought I needed a tailplane). 0.46 TWR on takeoff. Don\u0027t know if I would\u0027ve made it or not; what I do know is that at Mach 3.9 and 36k the jet flamed-out (I guess those 24-77s really *were* putting on the drag), I hit the button to light the rockets......and only the portside one came on. Well, long story short there is that after I recovered from the resultant spin and dive I dumped out all the oxidizer and did an RTLS abort, despite being 600 klicks downrange of KSC at the time. Damn plane almost got back up to as fast as it had been going during the slog back. Landing went okay for the most part; did get the Q up to 10kPa at one point trying to slow down, but nothing much to report there otherwise; did S-turns and applied the spoiler to slow down. I was a little low and left of center when NavUtilities called the middle marker, probably should\u0027ve gone around but it was getting late and I needed to get to bed, so I went for it. Blew the jet off on touchdown (was coming down around 8 m/s - too fast - when I touched down) but otherwise a successful landing.\n\nNot really much I could say about that flight - the starboard rocket failed to light due to a classic SPH action group bug, which I made sure to fix right before I shut the game down for the night. I won\u0027t know if that alone will ensure a successful flight until I get a chance to fly again. Meantime y\u0027all might fill me in on whether the 909 is a good choice or not...I really wish KSP had an inline engine in the 100-120 kN thrust range. I mean, yeah I could tune down a pair of LV-T45s, but that\u0027s an extra two tonnes...\n\nAnyways, I\u0027ll try it y\u0027all\u0027s way next chance I get - 20k as fast as possible without losing control, then flatten it out and build up speed in that regime. I should be able to handle that.\n\nOne more thing - how do I know what my takeoff speed is again? Is it when the AoA at ground level with the flaps in the right setting goes below 5 degrees, or have I got that wrong?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T13:30:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 01:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T13:21:26Z","Content":"Alright - changed the engine setup to two turbojets and one LV-T45 centerline. I wanted to get to orbit, dammit. Good thing I made it...\n\n![9rUijRl.png](http://i.imgur.com/9rUijRl.png)\n\nNot a great design, though. The monoprop is acting as ballast, and there is some pretty wicked engine torque indicated (hence the number of reaction wheels). The nose fuel tank is also full and acting as ballast, so there\u0027s actually less working fuel there than what it appears. I doubt very much that the design could handle any substantial payload; I suppose I could (and should) give it a shot. Thrust would be okay - it\u0027s the delta-V I\u0027d be worried about.\n\nI do wonder if taking out the Mk2 Rocket tank centerline was a good idea. It shortened the fuselage and saved on some mass, yes, but the CoM is most certainly aft of the cargo bay. Not as much ability to fiddle around with fuel tank placement, see.\n\nThe \u0022bouncing\u0022 technique works pretty well, I must say. Been a bit since I\u0027ve actually hit Mach 4 above 30k...\n\nI\u0027ve had this crazy notion this morning of sticking the wing directly onto the fuselage and mounting the engine pods *below* the wing, perhaps attached to a Hardpoint. Something I\u0027ve noticed - I get less torque with the engines mounted low, but with the wing mounted to the engine pods, that has a tendency to put the CoL low as well. Torque generally doesn\u0027t appear until I put the fin on. Something to try with another design, perhaps.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T13:28:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T14:12:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Right-click drag analysis in flight\u0022 - something I think has been mentioned before but I\u0027m not quite sure to what it\u0027s referring.

Pretty much 2/3 of the drone is actually tail; but it does balance and work \n\nMoving the Deathtrap to a nacelle design will help you with this, since you can swap out the MP tanks for LFO, shorten the nacelles, and have the engine weight forward in a similar fashion - if you can handle the aesthetics of it xD If you flipped the cargo bay into a bomb bay, you can lift the main wings so they clear the engines, and cause the weight of the drone to hang underneath the CoL, which should make it resist flipping. Alternatively, a low wing (like a NASA shuttle) would give some counterweight to the high tail, and reduce torque overall.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E One more thing - how do I know what my takeoff speed is again?

I have some that don\u0027t hit 10 degrees until mach 0.4, but they\u0027re high-TWR so they can get away with it. For low-TWR birds, you need more wing to enable lower lift off speeds. The flip side is that if it takes off at low low AoA and low speed, it\u0027ll be a bugger to get back onto the ground. 5 degrees at mach 0.3 would be hard to bring down on it\u0027s back wheels; probably end up having to nose-dive ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T14:04:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eddiew**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T14:22:01Z","Content":"1) Get the *Stock Bug Fix* mod.

I\u0027d only put 440 Oxidizer each of the two fuselage tanks (880 total). By my own guidelines, I should\u0027ve had about twice that. The torque you\u0027re seeing there is being generated solely by the Skipper in the back; it occurred to me this morning that I could try to fix that by replacing the aft fuselage fuel tank with a slanted piece instead and either raise or lower the position of the Skipper and see what that does to the torque. I imagine it needs to be raised. The jets are well balanced - and each has its own Mk1 fuel tank.\n\nPitch authority on this plane is pretty lousy - I have the wing control surfaces set up (from outboard to inboard) as aileron-spoileron-flaperator-elevator. The canards proved to be necessary - first flight without them, and elevators set to 30 deflection, this plane went into one of those damn unrecoverable dives. Load-tested the plane in the process; when it finally crashed into the ocean (and nothing \u0027sploded in the meantime), the Q meter reading was just over 115 kPa. For reference, surface air pressure of the Earth in the standard atmospheric model is 101.3 kPa...\n\nUltimately I widened the control surfaces, set the deflection on the elevator to full (40), and added the canards. Second flight the plane got up over Mach 4 below 30k and I\u0027m convinced it would\u0027ve made it - had the plane been loaded with a proper amount of fuel. The emergency landing did not go well; I wound up slow over highlands. The crapper of it is, though, that that was one of those situations where it was getting late in the evening again - the plane\u0027s turbojets still had plenty of fuel and I probably could\u0027ve flown back to KSC despite being over a thousand klicks out at that point...\n\nGoing to try again with this plane tonight after adjusting the Skipper and putting in a proper fuel load.

No problems with the test flight of note. FAR gave me a red lights on the main parameters in the 30k/Mach4 regime but I went anyway and I was able to hold it steady in the crucial region. Wound up with the plane in a stable 82x79 orbit, 382 oxidizer remaining, 641 LF remaining with 88.23 units of LF remaining in each of the nacelles (so 288.08 left for the Skipper - it started with 1680 units of Oxidizer/about 1374 units of LF). I have a screenie of the plane in orbit but imgur\u0027s having a hiccup this evening; I\u0027ll try to post it up later.\n\nAlso going to have to figure out what all that implies as far as the plane\u0027s potential maximum potential payload. This was another empty run. Switched over to the rocket at Mach 4.2 and 32k.\n\nEDIT: Here we go.\n\n![SoMEkYZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/SoMEkYZ.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T13:04:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 01:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T13:21:10Z","Content":"Quick question - when you\u0027re building a delta winged plane, when does it need a tail and when does it not? Or is that another \u0022it depends\u0022 type of question?\n\nI ask because over the weekend I built another craft, this time in my career game - I was trying to build a replacement for my Barn Owl 7 design, which was my stock probe delivery craft (the one I\u0027d used to fulfill probe contracts). It was a quad-jet slung under the wing /double LV-T45 twin-fin tailless delta-wing design with Mk2 fuselage parts and it flew like a discount brick; into the drink three times, CoM was too far aft, CoL was balanced to the DCoM which was too far back from the CoM at takeoff, wasn\u0027t enough pitch authority so I added canards, and since I only have Level 2 R\u0026D in my career game I couldn\u0027t use standard/advanced canards - had to try and approximate them from B9 Procedural all-moving wings (which worked, I suppose). When I finally got it into the air, I lost control at 30k/M4...just like the FAR analysis said would happen. She\u0027d roll onto one side and try to flip onto her back, I\u0027d lose altitude and try as I might I couldn\u0027t get the plane to right itself again; when I\u0027d pitch down while inverted, the plane would flip over again. It never really stabilized from that behavior once it began, even as I got further down into the atmosphere again. \n\nI should mention that I did make a bonafide effort not to put any monoprop in the design. By which I mean it did have a pair of monoprop cylinders in a forward utilities bay along with the probe core, SAS units and batteries, but it would\u0027ve been used for RCS maneuvering instead of just ballast. No screenies, I\u0027m, afraid, but I intend to work out the kinks so I\u0027ll get some made eventually. Pretty sure this design will need a tail when everything\u0027s said and done."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T14:40:04Z","Content":"AV-R8s make perfectly good canards.\n\nYour delta needs a tail if the trailing edge of the main wing is too close to CoM for the control surfaces to work as elevons [1]. But if you want a tailed/tailless delta, you can place the wing appropriately.\n\nChanging to a tailed delta usually involves shifting the main wing forwards slightly, so what you\u0027re mostly getting is a slight forward shift in the CoM and CoL. The cost is that your elevator duties are now restricted to the stabilator, instead of being able to divide the load amongst the main wing\u0027s elevons. The stabilator can probably do the job, especially if paired with canards, but greater deflection = greater drag and earlier stall.\n\nIf you\u0027re rolling, the problem isn\u0027t lack of tail, it\u0027s insufficient dihedral and/or wingspan. Where are the red numbers in the FAR screens?\n\n[1] Yes, there are experimental canard-only things. Trying not to overcomplicate it, okay?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nBTW: a sample Mk2 tailless delta satellite carrier. Nukes here, but with a bit of rebalancing you could swap in LV-T45s on a similar airframe.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I use monoprop tanks and RCS thrusters on a great many of my larger and smaller SSTOs. The thing is they make for great counter balance tanks but they are a bit heavier than most other tanks. \n\nLike this tiny fighter it has mono tanks and RCS thrusters. I dont believe in abusing the SAS reaction wheels to achieve level flight. If the craft is well designed you can fly it without a reaction wheel.\n\n![oCs1ooN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/oCs1ooN.jpg)\n\nAnd I am a huge fan of \u0022tailess\u0022 delta designs.\n\n![cbdhwvG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cbdhwvG.jpg)\n\n![9qW2xpd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9qW2xpd.jpg)\n\n![wu6fyh0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wu6fyh0.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T18:33:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 06:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo**"}]}
