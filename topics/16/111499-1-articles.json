Tourist can\u0027t EVA so even if I rendezvous with them in orbit, I can\u0027t get them into my rescue ship.\n\nShip doesn\u0027t have a docking port either. \n\nAny way to bring him back?"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T14:21:15Z","Content":"the KLAW!"},{"CreatedByName":"MathmoRichard","CreatedById":113752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T14:23:05Z","Content":"With the claw and possibly a cargo bay you can get almost anything back.

I don\u0027t like this though because the claw shouldn\u0027t be able to transfer fuel.
