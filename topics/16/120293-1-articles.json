The craft re-enters on a shallow glide, keeping AoA around 45 degrees, using mainly wings and body to bleed off speed, but also with airbrakes fully extended. The shallow glide helps to manage the re-entry heat, you bleed off a lot of speed before hitting the thickest atmosphere. Once below 30km when air-breathing jets start working again, AoA lowers and becomes more like normal flight, and then I just use airbrakes to trim my speed down to manageable. Checking the world map, my trajectory is usually either right beyond or right in front of KSC by that point. Now it\u0027s more like a normal flight, but still bleeding off speed. I only throttle up the engines if it looks like I\u0027ll severely undershoot; it\u0027s mostly gliding. I usually pass just over the tops of the mountains west of KSC if I\u0027m on the proper course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T21:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom 80x80 orbit it was pretty straightforward for me.

The shallower approach angle I can get away with the better as the less fuel I use in the deorbit burn the more I have to cruise to the runway if I get it wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think looking at some other people\u0027s designs I\u0027m relatively low power and high lift, but I found with less wing I was having to have a really high AoA, which caused a lot of drag on the ascent. I assume 20-22km and 1000-1100m/s is a sensible target for lighting the rockets when using the Whiplash ramjets (not researched Rapiers yet). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad a go at building a bigger one last night with 4 ramjets and 2 rockets to use as a crew shuttle, but got the weight balance wrong and one wing and engine pod broke off when it pitched up sharply during re-entry.
