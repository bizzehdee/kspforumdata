And I have the ambition to do a bunch of interplanetary missions in the near future. What\u0027s the recommended way to use the Minmus fuel, without making Mr. Oberth upset too much (see fig 1)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see a bunch of options, but none seem easy or efficient. If I have a fully fueled mothership at Minmus, I could:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n(1) Fly back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. Advantage is that launch is trivial. Disadvantage is that I lose a LOT of fuel to get down from Minmus, and lower both \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n(2) Adjust my plane to Kerbin\u0027s equator, then lower only my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to 80-100 km, and launch for interplanetary at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E. A lot more efficient than option 1, but much more difficult to plan, especially when I need to get an intercept with one of the smaller planets (I didn\u0027t forget you, Dres).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n(3) Just fly off from Minmus, straight out of the Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E. By far the easiest to plan, because the whole interplanetary intercept is planned when you\u0027re on a solar orbit. This seems to make Mr. Oberth really upset though. Major disadvantage is that the extra fuel needed has to be taken outside of the Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, so if you want to drop those extra tanks, they are lost and cannot be recycled/refueled. This in turn means that the refueling business now also includes an extra launch from Kerbin for new tanks.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I have a tanker, I could:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n(4) Fly the fuel to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. I could repeat this as often as necessary, since the fuel is essentially for free. It would either mean lots of flights (my current tanker can deliver \u0022only\u0022 about 20000 units of liquid fuel to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E in 1 flight, but I have some ambitious plans). This is boring and repetitive, and downscaling the payload is not an option I want to consider in this thread.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n(5) Launch a new tanker, which is even larger, possibly including an upgraded mining station. Fly the huge tanker to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and refuel whatever needs refueling. Costly (but possibly the most Kerbal way, and already my preferred option).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, a combination of the options above is possible too.
