Ofcourse no resources were mined since I left, making this very tedious. It seems like the drills stop when I quit the game (or it crashes).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs I was using a microwave receiver I thought maybe this mod craps out when the game is not active, but even placing a fixed power supply (like the little power canisters or even a 2000ec/s fusion reactor) will not keep the drills running. The drill I use are the orange Ore drill and the Karbonite drills.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyone have an idea how to keep them running?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://dasher.nl/kerbal/kerbal_07.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://dasher.nl/kerbal/kerbal_08.jpg[/IMG]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T17:51:23Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 05:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gilph","CreatedById":150861,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T18:55:39Z","Content":"\nI have the same problem on Pol.

No messages were presented, the drills just stop drilling.

I have 8 mining rigs running on Eeloo. Sometimes they keep running no problems, sometimes they just stop right after I leave.

This can happen with standard drills, MKS dust sifters and I used to see it with Karbonite drills when I used it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is especially bad with bases where a hard component (such as an orange tank) is directly sitting on the ground. In fact, large bases with large hard surfaces sitting on the ground visibly jump when I switch to them, sometimes extremely so.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think this is a problem in KSP\u0026#39;s activation of physics calculations on a craft when its landed and focus is switched to it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe best solution I found so far is using landing legs and not locking them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCould it be something like that?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T13:30:39Z","Content":"\nI dont have any part touching the surface like tanks, checked that. Often times I also see the craft is stuck in the sand when you first switch to it and then it pops to the surface which makes it jump.

I had the adaptive landing legs mod and locked the legs because they would keep wobbling.
