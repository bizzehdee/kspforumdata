(with mods, but nothing that should change comet behavior)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have 2 sentinels in solar orbit. They are finding many unknown objects in the tracking station like they are supposed to. So far, every unknown object that I start tracking has turned out to be an asteroid. I\u0027ve read that KSP comets are rare so maybe this is normal. How do I know when a Sentinel found a comet? Do I have to track every unknown object? Or will comets always be larger than size class E so I can tell before tracking the unknown object?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite no apparent comets found by sentinels, I\u0027ve seen distant comets with tails in the sky while I\u0027m on the launch pad. Is KSP\u0027s comet sky display unrelated to actual comet objects?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo any common mods like Scatterer, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, or Distant Object Enhancement add their own comet displays? Maybe that\u0027s what I\u0027m seeing in the sky but I don\u0027t recall that ever happening before 1.10.

Either way, they\u0027ll appear just like comets in the tracking station until you track them, but if you find a comet it will probably have a distinctive name like Dooley-Hartgen-Milsner* rather than Ast. D-6442 as asteroids do and probably a much higher mass too. If you can see its tail in flight, it\u0027s a comet and should be really conspicuous on the map as the tails still show up in map view and in the tracking station (I think, but might be wrong- haven\u0027t done much in 1.10 so I can\u0027t say for sure).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*name invented for illustrative purposes only, I haven\u0027t played a lot with 1.10 so can\u0027t provide an example of one I actually got.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-12T02:01:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223852839\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196849\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221599859968\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso can\u0027t provide an example of one I actually got.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226cJP8NO.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022162.62\u0022 height=\u0022335\u0022 width=\u0022206\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/6cJP8NO.png?1\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
