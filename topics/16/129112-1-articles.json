Companies offer you an advance when you accept a contract. The amount, just like the completion, depends of the difficulty of the mission. How should this advance be considered ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs that a way for the game to tell you if a rocket design is acceptable ? For example, a contract gives me 100 000 credits as an advance. Should I consider my design as :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Good : if total cost \u0026lt; advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Bad : if total cost \u0026gt; advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Or advance is not related, you might need to put more money on the table to achieve the objective ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a mission which requires to bring a class C asteroid in Kerbin orbit and the advance is 163 000 credits, (\u002B 429k credits for completion) do you think it is enough ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T16:32:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a non-issue.\u00A0 You should think of the value of the contract in terms of \u003Cstrong\u003Etotal value\u003C/strong\u003E, i.e. the advance plus the reward.\u00A0 If there\u0027s a 100K advance and a 300K reward, then that\u0027s a 400K contract.\u00A0 The fact that you happen to get some of that money before you complete it is a side issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen on the other side of the ledger, is the \u003Cstrong\u003Etotal cost\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 This equals the cost of the ship you need to build to do the mission, plus the intangible \u0022cost\u0022 of your spending your personal time executing the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you\u0027re deciding \u0022should I take this contract or not\u0022, think of it this way:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd the advance plus reward for the contract.\u00A0 This is the \u003Cstrong\u003Etotal value.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSubtract the cost of the ship it\u0027ll take you to complete the contract.\u00A0 Now you have the \u003Cstrong\u003Enet cash profit\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThen ask yourself:\u00A0 Is this amount of net profit worth spending the amount of my time to do the contract?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n(Note that all of the above is assuming that your only motivation in accepting the contract is to make money.\u00A0 Some contracts are just fun to do, and your personal time is a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebenefit\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E rather than a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecost\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.)\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ForScience6686","CreatedById":144187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T17:56:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only time the advance really makes a difference is early career. \u00A0I expand mission control for more available contracts and use the advance for more building upgrades. \u00A0Early contracts are usually cheap to complete so I\u0027m not too worried about using up the advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T18:11:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a random element to the money a contract will pay for a given sort of mission.
