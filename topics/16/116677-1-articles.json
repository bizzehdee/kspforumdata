Lucky for you, you can still salvage the probe, if you have enough deltaV. At your PE, burn prograde to raise your AP very very high. When you get to the AP, you will be going super slow (the further out, the slower). This is the point to burn retrograde; you will halt your small orbital speed, and then flip it back in the other direction. Do so to the point that your PE is where you need it. Travel to PE, and burn retograde to drop your AP to where you need it.\n\nThats the most cost-effective way to salvage the probe. If you dont have enough deltaV, you\u0027ll have to send another."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T18:20:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I believe I discovered the issue. I\u0027m orbiting the wrong direction. Is there a way to salavage a backwards orbits or not?\n\nYou can do it if you\u0027ve got sufficient delta-V remaining. Basically, you need to look at your current orbital velocity and plan a retrograde burn of *double* that amount at the next apsis. Obviously, the slower your orbital velocity, the easier this will be to pull off (which is why klesh is telling you to raise your Ap - generally the higher your Ap, the lower your orbital velocity is)."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T18:52:16Z","Content":"Side note, you\u0027re not going to be able to easily plan that burn ... just plan a burn at AP to bring your PE to nothing (as in center of the body you\u0027re orbiting, not just the surface) and double it.

Just click the \u0022-\u0022 on prograde enough times ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAlso, see how much delta-V you have. Bringing your AP very high sure saves delta-V but definitely not time - at the edge of Minmus SOI the maneuver can take two weeks (and some 40m/s.) You can easily shorten the time by choosing a lower AP. The absolute worst scenario is some 400m/s, but with a day long orbit this can be reduced to something of order of 80.\n\nAs for \u0022planning the burn\u0022 at AP: Don\u0027t bother with a node. Just direct your ship retrograde, burn and watch your orbit. When the PE is roughly on your target orbit cut off. It\u0027s really one of the few maneuvers where nodes are really not all that helpful. (they can help you estimate the delta-V required, but the burn results are immediately apparent and the orbit near AP is so slow that an hour one way or another doesn\u0027t matter.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T09:18:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 09:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T14:01:06Z","Content":"Depends on your altitude actually.
