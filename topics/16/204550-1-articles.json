I want to de-orbit all thee of the hitchiker containers at once. I have a heat shield and parachutes on each of them. After the two that I\u0027m not flying reach about 800m/s (after any flame worries) they blow up in atmosphere. No rhyme or reason. WHY!? I\u0027m so titled right now... I flew this thing all the way to minmus. Landed it on the surface... decoupled the hitchikers and now I have no option but to watch these things blow up repeatedly because I have no save point from before I broke them up....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat did I do wrong here!? The chutes should deploy and the hitchikers land neatly on the surface for collection...
