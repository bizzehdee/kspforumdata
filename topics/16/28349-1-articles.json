I started off with a return trip to minimum based off a scott manly video and then used the same ship for a return trip to the moon.

I was wondering if there are any more tutorials that are more mission guides than anything? I\u0027m still not great at building ships completely on my own but have a pretty good grasp of everything else. I\u0027m basically after more missions laid out the same way the apollo one above was - Gives you a ship design to build and just some basic pointers on how to do the mission. Basically I just want more of these mission outlines which get increasingly harder (start with duna then build a space station etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I am after mission outlines that include ship design more so than actual tutorials but I haven\u0027t been able to find much when searching the tutorials board and google.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T07:44:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking through the Drawing Board, I found this one that walks you through \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/21618-Tutorial-Duna-For-Dummies-How-to-get-there-without-math\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebuilding and flying a ship that can get you to Duna\u003C/a\u003E.

Produce a few cheap probes that you can practice landing on bodies, and if you happen to land in a good spot that probe will act as a beacon so you can land there with your manned mission. Also, place some sensors on your probes to get some useful readings, I.E. gravity, atmospheric pressure, temperature, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IllicitMedic","CreatedById":66677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T11:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Venerator\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Venerator\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I will probably start a new save file and put up satellites and such.
