It\u0027s centered on the fuselage, like the nose gear, but it\u0027s mounted farther aft, so it\u0027s only slightly in front of the rear gear.\u00A0 This gear is set to \u0022initially deployed =

extend it, then manually retract the nose gear.\u00A0 Presto, you have a much shorter turning radius on the ground.\u00A0 Giving your plane some hefty reaction wheels to assist with the turn can also

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eproportional steering\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 The pilot of a real plane can just nudge the steering wheel a little bit (to make a safe, gentle turn while traveling fast), or pull it way hard over (to make a sharp turn, while traveling at a safely slow speed).\u00A0 In KSP, basically the only option we have is a button to press which yanks the steering all the way to one side.\u00A0 It\u0027s all-or-nothing, so the \u0022all\u0022 has to be gentle enough not to cause planes to flip out if you steer some while landing at speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Maybe proportional steering is an option if you have a joystick or some other form of \u0022gradual\u0022 controller.\u00A0 But I would guess that the large

that adjusts the steerability of the landing gear based on ground speed (i.e. make it automatically adjust so that it can steer by bigger angles when traveling slowly), but they haven\u0027t done that
