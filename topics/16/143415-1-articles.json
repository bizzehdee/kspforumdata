It also doubles the amount of energy it takes to make the wheel roll forwards. (OK, maybe it\u0027s not double, but it\u0027s more.) It also makes the brakes work better -- because when you lock up the brakes, you stop. Even on 50 degree slopes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeaving it at less than 5 makes it so that when you hit a pothole, or jump the rover over a cliff,\u00A0your rover spins out instead of flipping when it lands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe automatic traction control applies the brakes when it detects that a wheel has started sliding. And wheels slide a lot. Especially on hills. So every time you want to go up a hill, turn it off or you will be fighting your own brakes as you climb the hill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-09T17:21:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.
