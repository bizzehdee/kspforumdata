That\u0027s a long way from orbital velocity, so you\u0027ll need to pitch up rather a lot to fight gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour rocket engines have TWR about 0.65, so at best you can go 80% of terminal velocity off them alone at full throttle. The lowest altitude where they could push against drag hard enough to reach orbital velocity is just over 33 km; below that altitude, you need to be pitched up to fight gravity, which reduces your speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow you need to bridge the gap between 23km at 1140 m/s and 33km at 2200 m/s. If it\u0027s possible, my best guess is that you\u0027ll need to fly your jet at a steep angle to push apoapsis up high (say, 38km, where your top rocket speed is well above orbit velocity). Then you use your time on a ballistic trajectory to try to gain enough horizontal speed for your low-TWR rocket to reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it might not be possible, in which case the answer is either more rocket thrust or more intakes -- or, perversely, bring up less rocket fuel to reduce your mass. Halve the mass and you can ride jets up to about 24km at 1550 m/s, whereas your rockets can push you to 12% faster than terminal velocity, so you can reach orbital velocity just above 30km.
