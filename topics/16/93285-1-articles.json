I was playing in hard career mode my Duna Lander was entering the atmosphere. All parachutes were set to deploy at 1000m from the ground. To my surprise, I crashed at 750 m/s on the surface at 5 500 m altitude, with the parachutes being only partially deployed.

Drogues should work fine by default, to give you hints on where to start, but you shouldn\u0027t be using drogues for your final product because they have far too little drag. Perhaps also the parachute must partially deploy and remain partially deployed for a long enough time before fully deploying, so you might lower the minimum deployment pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d just set the deploy altitude to the max for Duna.
