I have tried putting another decoupler on it, but the SRBs ignore the other decoupler. Additionally, I have figured out that I can use struts to prevent the SRBs from wobbling around, but whenever I detach the SRBs, that will usually just fall into my rocket and the whole thing goes to pieces.

And so should you! With crossfeed enabled on the decouplers, those fuel tanks will drain first before using fuel from the rocket\u2019s core meaning you get more delta-V; the solid boosters are there for pure power so they can handle the extra weight; and the tanks get dropped with the SRBs once drained so it\u2019s more efficient than more fuel tanks in the core stage.
