Frankly, it\u0027s only because I\u0027m waiting for a ship that got into an on orbit just scraping teh top of teh atmosphere (with no propulsion left) to de-orbit) that I\u0027ve notice teh thing much. Been playing since 0.23 and just really noticed the thing now. My best guess is that it might be temperature-related, but if so, temprature of what? exterior of capsule? interior of capsule? Or is it something else entirely?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-19T09:36:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2015 09:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Esme**"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T23:21:51Z","Content":"It\u0027s the vertical speed. \n\nAnd it\u0027s not your eye-sight, it\u0027s really tiny and hard to read.
