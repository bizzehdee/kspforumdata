Or just somewhere that it doesnt show mach effects/entry effects.\n\n-In Duna, you want a really shallow entry, and you might still need to do a powered attempt to slow down, because the atmosphere is nowhere enough to slow down heavy and aerodynamic craft.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T01:22:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 01:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Feradose**"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T08:29:56Z","Content":"No, It is certainly possible to do an aerocapture and then a landing on Duna without requiring heatshields, it just doesn\u0027t have enough atmosphere to do real harm.\n\nAssuming that your guys are coming back I would simply use you ascent engine to take the worst of the re-entry heat and then provide last minute thrust to give you a soft landing. It will only require a small amount of fuel and will save you from carrying large numbers of parachutes."},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T09:17:32Z","Content":"I\u0027ve landed a pretty heavy lander on Duna and used zero ablator on my 3m heatshield.\n\nI did land at very high altitude, though.

My heavy mining base landed with a mix of parachutes and reverse thrust.\n\nIn 1.0.4 you\u0027re probably going to need heat shields and to keep everything very tightly behind the heat shield to avoid being obliterated, unless you do many high atmosphere aerobraking passes or a big retrograde burn first.

After capture I was in an elliptical orbit of about 460 x 60 km and then dropped the periapsis down to 20km for landing.
