Something just above atmo\u0027 will do just fine, but my computer can\u0027t handle the computations needed to keep the ship from ignoring little things like struts and linkages.. Any advice here? (I would prefer to avoid the use of the Orbital Construction mod, but if I can\u0027t, keep in mind that I\u0027ll be loading the Delivery/Construction lifter with the equivalent mass for whatever I\u0027ll be \u0027Constructing\u0027)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I know that if you want to alter the ... er... rotational speed (?) of a ship, you alter the orbital altitude, but which way? If I thrust prograde, I\u0027m speeding up, but I\u0027m also increasing the diameter of my orbit, making my ship take longer to complete an orbit... So, if I have one ship in a parking orbit at 200km, and another that I START at 200km, which way would I thrust to make the second ship move FASTER around the planet than the parked ship?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ekku Zakku","CreatedById":34696,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T20:58:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t help with #1, but there is a \u0022how to make KSP run faster\u0022 thread in this How To forum if you want to look at that (I haven\u0027t as I don\u0027t need it lol).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for #2, if you want to orbit around a body faster, you take a lower orbit. This is key for orbital rendezvous; if you launch behind another craft (say, a space station), you\u0027ll want to hold a temporary orbit about 5 km or so below the target (depends on how far behind you are and how quickly you want to catch up). Then as you start to catch up, you can either just slowly raise your orbit closer, or use one of those charts that are around to determine the exact burn time to raise your Apoapsis to match the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, a higher orbit is a useful way to slow down so your target can catch up =3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T21:41:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA 100ton payload shouldn\u0027t be too taxing, what sort of part count are you after?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corbald","CreatedById":2219,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T04:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the payload it\u0027s self is running around 70 parts.
