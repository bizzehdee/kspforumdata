However, for your results to be significantly off, it seems like you could be more precise in your execution. If you ever do feel like installing additional mods, the transfer window planner you linked is available as an ingame tool that has a button to display the exact point where you need to place your node. It helps quite a bit with making the burn. Also note: the planner can spit out both ballistic (direct) trajectories, and trajectories with mid-course correction maneuvers, depending on what you set it to. If you set it to \u0022optimal\u0022, you may sometimes get one and sometimes the other, depending on which is cheaper. If you overlook this, you may end up trying to treat a trajectory with a mid-course correction as a direct trajectory and end up confused because you arrive nowhere near your target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, you\u0027re probably planning your node wrong. The website displays you a transfer \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E cost, but in 99% of all cases that is not a simple prograde vector! it is a combination of prograde and normal or antinormal, and you can only see this if you click the little blue info button next to the ejection \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E reading. Yes, that\u0027s kind of stupid to hide important info like that, I know, but it\u0027s what it is. The larger the normal/antinormal component is, the more massively wrong your result will be if you just treat it all as prograde \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as understanding the problem goes: try to visualize and understand each of the following bullet points in order of presentation, before moving on to the next one. If you have questions on any of them, don\u0027t hesitate to ask.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- An orbit around a central focus point defines a plane in which it resides, the so-called \u0022orbital plane\u0022. This plane always passes through the focus point. Ergo, the planes of \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E possible orbits around the same central focus always pass through it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Because of this, that means that any two given orbital planes of orbits around the same focus point will intersect with each other. The orbital parameters are irrelevant; they are guaranteed to intersect somewhere. The only exception to this rule is for orbits that are coplanar - that occupy the exact same orbital plane. But in that case you don\u0027t have a problem in the first place \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E The intersection takes the form of an axis of infinite length passing through the focus point as well as the orbital paths of both orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- In order to assume a specific target orbit, you must be in that target orbit\u0027s orbital plane. In order to enter an orbital plane through a maneuver, the maneuver must be executed in a place where that orbital plane actually is. Think of it like: in order to drive from a rural road onto a highway, you must first follow the rural road to the place where the highway actually is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- If you are on orbital plane A, and you want to go to orbital plane B, you must therefore find a spot which is simultaneously located on both orbital plane A and on orbital plane B. That is the spot you must make the maneuver at - the only spot where you physically \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E make this maneuver at. This maneuver is called a \u0022plane change\u0022, unsurprisingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The only spots where these conditions are fulfilled are those where the two orbital planes intersect. Any spot along the intersection axis is valid. That means that even when the two orbits don\u0027t touch each other anywhere, you can still find a suitable spot. in fact, since the intersection is an axis of infinite length that passes through the orbital path of each involved orbit, that means that there are always two such perfect spots on any given orbit. You literally cannot make an orbit that doesn\u0027t have exactly two such spots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- But keep in mind that these two spots do not exist on a lone orbit. They only exist \u003Cem\u003Ein reference to\u003C/em\u003E another orbital plane, which is why you don\u0027t normally see them in KSP if you are just minding your own business in your own orbit.\u00A0They only show up if you have another orbiting object targeted. And they will be in different locations for different target orbits. This is why guides about rendezvous or traveling to another celestial body always start with \u0022select x as your target\u0022. Only then you will see all the information you need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- These two spots have special names. They are called the \u0022ascending node\u0022, where your orbit rises from below through the target orbit\u0027s plane, and the \u0022descending node\u0022, where your orbit falls through the target orbit\u0027s plane from above. Ingame, they are marked in neon green as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E markers. Mousing over them will show you how many degrees of inclination you are off from the target orbital plane. (Bonus trivia: the game will also show you a dotted line leading from each node linearly towards your target orbit. This is the axis of intersection between the two orbital planes that I keep talking about.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have understood all of the above, you should now know what you must do in order to correctly arrive at a target orbit without ending up above or below. You can check your answer inside this spoiler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou must target the object you want to go to, and travel to either the ascending or descending node on your current orbit. There, you must perform a plane change maneuver that zeroes your inclination relative to the target orbit, as displayed while mousing over the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E. Which of the two nodes you pick is not important - the only difference is the direction in which you must burn to get the effect that you want. At the ascending node you must burn antinormal, and at the descending node you must burn normal. (Those are the purple maneuver markers, if that wasn\u0027t clear.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are sufficiently close to one of the nodes at the time you make your transfer burn, or the inclination difference is very small, you can usually include a normal/antinormal component in your ejection burn and be done with it. This is not only incredibly fuel efficient, but it also means you can avoid coming back for a mid-course correction later. Alexmoon\u0027s planner almost always gives you a trajectory that does this in some form, as mentioned near the top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt other times, this will not be possible or sufficient, and you must make a separate plane change. You can either do this before your ejection burn while still in your original orbit (plane matching), or after your ejection burn while you coast towards your target (mid-course correction). The latter is almost always cheaper, but requires you to remember when you need to stop timewarping and/or doing other stuff and come back to this vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-27T07:39:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2016 07:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magzimum","CreatedById":167187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T07:54:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222825604\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022150888\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477553239\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 minutes ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, you\u0027re probably planning your node wrong.

The concept I was trying to point out is the same though.\u00A0 You can find the info on nodes in the wiki, if I remember right, but I personally don\u0027t. To explain my earlier comment, what I used do is to look and see that Eve, for example, has an orbit that is inclined 2.1 degrees. So, while in Kerbin orbit, I\u0027ll make small normal/antinormal burns until \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E tells me that I\u0027m \u00A0plus or minus 2.1 degrees. There\u0027s no specific readout for it, but if you watch the numbers once or twice it becomes apparent (90 \u002B or -, IIRC, I\u0027d have to look). This basically does what TWP does (I think) in compensating for the normal/antinormal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, but it does it while in orbit around Kerbin. Then, you don\u0027t have to worry so much about the plane change that Streetwind pointed out in his very complete reply, and if you pull prograde while approximately at the correct phase angle you should get some sort of encounter.\u00A0I have no idea if there is any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E savings when considering the Oberth effect; it probably costs more to do the inclination change in Kerbin orbit than it does in space, but you get some extra from Oberth? \u00A0These days I usually just launch and adjust when out in space because it\u0027s easier than fiddling with orbits trying to get lined up. I did use TWP for a while too, and before that just scrolled way out on the map in the plane of Kerbin orbit and tried to eyeball where orbital paths crossed and set maneuver nodes there.

Right click on the target chevrons so that I can always see whether the intercept distance is rising or falling (or if there is an encounter, right click on the destination \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to see how close it\u0027s getting).

If you have Kerbal Alarm Clock though, you may be better off with mid-route plane change and just deferring the normal burn until you\u0027re 1/4 the orbit away from the encounter.

If there is a way to execute both in one single burn, rather than two separate burns, I would love to know how to do that in practice.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me emphasize that by now, I think I am confident that I understand the physics, but I still need to know some more tricks in the game to put that knowledge to use.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have KSP here but I\u0027m pretty sure \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E in the Orbit section can have \u0027Inclination\u0027 added, that would be your clue as to how much off you are.
