View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first image you can see the thermal guages on the upper left of my ship where my lander is attached (one fuel tank and all the connected parts). Note that the other side of my lander is just fine, the temperatures there are around 150 or so (normal for deep space). Nothing on the lander is even activated yet, I\u0027m still doing the transfer to my target of Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second image I pulled up the temperature debug info for the lander\u0027s fuel tank and also for one of the LV-N engines that is currently thrusting and you can see that they fuel tank is about three times as hot. The thermal numbers look really messed up to me on that lander fuel tank (they are bad on all parts in that immediate vicinity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this just some kind of strange bug I\u0027ve stumbled across?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I exited out of the game and loaded back in and was able to execute the burn just fine. Then when I arrived at Eeloo, the same set of parts on the lander had the overheat problem again when I tried to do my capture burn. Again, killing the game and loading back in seems to have fixed it, but this is starting to get really annoying. I\u0027d rather not use cheats, but I\u0027m on the verge of disabling all heat in my game because of this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-09T02:42:23Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2015 02:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kelderek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T02:57:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKrakens transfer heat via conduction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry the stock bugfix mod.
