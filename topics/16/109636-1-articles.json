It was impossible to launch though unless the spaceplane was wrapped up in a shield. All the lifting surfaces were playing havoc. \n\nWith a shield though it got up there fine. Loads of dV left and flying it back to the surface I found it actually flies incredibly well.\n\nCraft file: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/m02ldwbt0r8h530/Dynasoar%202.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m02ldwbt0r8h530/Dynasoar%202.craft?dl=0)\n\n![HWWgC0K.png](http://i.imgur.com/HWWgC0K.png)![S2vDnMS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/S2vDnMS.jpg)\n\n![wYzpwYd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wYzpwYd.jpg)\n\n![EAnUVY8.png](http://i.imgur.com/EAnUVY8.png)\n\n![xGmMDho.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xGmMDho.jpg)\n\n![Dyna_Soar_launchers.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Dyna_Soar_launchers.png)![images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR4tBrOMumIaXT0OK9O6G2tprV4Vr8iCMPxLuCwDhCYEQ3ylQ65](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR4tBrOMumIaXT0OK9O6G2tprV4Vr8iCMPxLuCwDhCYEQ3ylQ65)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T16:05:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 04:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T16:04:38Z","Content":"I want to try a Dreamchaser soon, but I don\u0027t know how to disable the control surfaces on the plane for the launch.
