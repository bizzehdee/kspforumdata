For example, if you aim for a higher initial apopasis, then your ascent angle will be higher. This means your engine is thrusting more towards the ground, less sideways; and at any time you are thrusting towards the ground, you have gravity losses. These will be made worse by the fact that you are spending more time not in orbit (because it takes time to reach that high apoapsis), and you are travelling at slower speed, which further increases the time spent not in orbit. Whenever you are not in orbit or landed, you have gravity losses. Another thing is the Oberth effect, which (simplified) states that burns executed while travelling faster and closer to a gravity well are more efficient. This doesn\u0027t really make much of a difference for a few hundred kilometers of apoapsis height, but it starts getting more and more noticeable the higher you go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn ideal ascent is one that follows a natural gravity turn to end up at orbital velocity just a few kilometers above the edge of the atmosphere, while never coasting, always thrusting (and ideally at full throttle). In practical application, this is\u00A0hard to achieve even with a computer-controlled autopilot unless the rocket itself is built specifically for the purpose. In manual flight, with typical player-built rockets, it is practically impossible to achieve.

There are two competing effects: on the one hand you want to do your burns as low as possible to maximize the Oberth effect, and on the other hand you want to burn perpendicular to the gravity to minimize gravity losses. (You always only want to burn in the direction of your orbital prograde vector to minimize steering losses.) So on an airless body you\u0027d want to give you a small kick to get clear of the ground, and then burn parallel to the ground (at 0 degrees elevation) until you get to your desired apoapsis. (Assuming that there is no terrain in the way...) Essentially doing a Hohmann transfer from the surface to the desired orbit. On Kerbin you have that pesky atmosphere, so you have to balance the Oberth effect against atmospheric drag and gravity losses. In addition trying to directly burn to the desired orbit to meet with e.g. a station (my gateway station is at 500 km, not 600 km \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E) means that you have a lot less time for navigation and being even slightly in the wrong plane can quickly eat up any gains from better use of the Oberth effect. If you are in a low parking orbit, then you can put your transfer burn at one of the nodes to your target orbit and thus minimize the losses for the plane change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my conclusion is: while a direct burn to high apoapsis might in theory be more efficient, in real life you probably do better to first get into some kind of parking orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-15T09:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223687421\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188897\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221571130722\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197939\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AHHans\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 minutes ago, AHHans said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, in theory a direct burn to a high apoapsis is more fuel efficient\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to which theory?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour explanation appears to be advocating for the lowest apoapsis possible - either directly above the terrain on an airless body, or as close as you can get to that while avoiding an atmosphere in the process. That is consistent with what I said, but runs counter to the claim that burning to a high apoapsis is more efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember,\u00A0by burning really hard right away and pushing your trajectory way up, that burn will\u00A0be performed at low speeds, under high gravity losses. Oberth cares about speed. Also, that\u0027s not an orbit insertion. You have to do another burn at apoapsis. And the higher up that apoapsis is, the steeper your trajectory becomes, and thus the slower you will be going at apoapsis, which is bad for Oberth, and it means that you\u0027ll be spending an increasingly larger share of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E budget there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as losses across a powered ascent from Kerbin go:\u00A0roughly two thirds fo your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E budget goes to orbital velocity, another quarter goes to gravity losses, maybe 5% or so\u00A0is lost to aerodynamic drag, and one percent to steering inefficiencies.
