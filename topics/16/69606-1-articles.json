It\u0027s not a bug, it\u0027s part of the game and everyone\u0027s had to deal with it since the beginning. I recommend building a bigger launch stage so you have enough fuel to reach that speed when you get to space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T04:16:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you include some more information about the nature of the problem?
