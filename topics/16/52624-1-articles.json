I took a break from KSP shortly after that and resumed when 0.22 came out on my new Mac, and I\u0027m loving the game again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s the dilemma, I\u0027m trying to land on the Mun, I\u0027ve watched every video there is, I\u0027ve tried over and over using quicksave and I just can\u0027t quite get it. I\u0027m close, but not quite there. One of my landings ended with a crashed pod full of Kerbals, so now I want to rescue them. Before I get to that too, I\u0027m trying to master landing and making it back from the Mun without worrying about where on the Mun I land to pick them up. To that end, I\u0027ve built and can fly a rocket (the Avenger II) in to Kerbin orbit, I can transfer to a nice 90km circular Mun orbit, but whenever I attempt to land it goes the same way. So, here is what I am doing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. From a 90km parking orbit I burn retrograde to drop my periapsis down to about 1km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I ride out the descent, near the end I burn hard retrograde to null my horizontal velocity out, and this seems to use up a LOT of fuel!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I drop vertically, periodically firing the engine to control my descent rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Just before touchdown I fire the engine at a high throttle settle to slow my descent to a crawl.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I touch down, almost completely out of fuel, and then fall over and break. Every. Time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my big problem here is the tumbling over, but I\u0027m landing on a flat surface, I\u0027ve killed my horizontal velocity, my lander is completely symmetrical, I have no idea what I am doing wrong. Also, this method seems to use up too much fuel for me to return to Kerbin easily/at all. So I have to think I am doing something or things wrong here!

Most folks design a lander like that (Chute, Mk-1 Command Pod, FL-T400 tank and LV-909 with 3-4 lander legs) for their first trek out; this one\u0027s larger of course, but essentially the same idea. The problem is in the design; it\u0027s easy to tip this kind of rocket over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how I\u0027d go about fixing it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Dump the big RCS tank - I\u0027d wager you\u0027re not using that much RCS anyway. If you\u0027re not comfortable with doing away with RCS completely, I\u0027d humbly submit you use 4-6 of the small Roundified tanks (read: I recommend zero, two at the most if you \u003Cstrong\u003Emust\u003C/strong\u003E have some). You\u0027ll save mass (and therefore improve your delta-V).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Consider swapping out the Mk1-2 Command Pod for three Mk1 Lander Cans. Again, there\u0027s a mass savings there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Here\u0027s my key suggestion - swap out the X200-32 tank for four X200-8 tanks, and set each one radially outboard of the X200-16 as low as you can attach them. Place your lander legs on those tanks, and run fuel lines from those outboard tanks to the central tank. That widens and shortens your stack while keeping the same amount of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also humbly suggest getting closer to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s surface before you burn to deorbit. You can safely orbit as low as 14 km above the surface, and you won\u0027t pick up as much velocity in the process of your deorbit. You\u0027ll still have to burn a good deal to bring your horizontal velocity to zero (you\u0027ve got a heavy ship there, that\u0027s unavoidable), but it should save you some gas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou only need about 850-1000 m/s of delta-V to make it back to Kerbin from the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar surface (assuming you acheive M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit first). Assuming you dump the RCS tanks, your \u0022bingo fuel\u0022 level is therefore just over 200 liquid fuel units; if you go below 210, hit space or plan to not return from the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar surface with that flight. With the RCS tank, \u0022bingo fuel\u0022 is 300 fuel units. If I\u0027m doing the math right, you start with 2430 - so it won\u0027t look like you\u0027ve got that much left either way.

As you have no docking ports on the vehicle, I assume you don\u0027t intend to use this craft to rendezvous with others, which makes the RCS an unnecessary addition. There are no ladders on your lander. This isn\u0027t too much of a problem on Mun or Minmus, where the gravity is low enough for any Kerbals on EVA to use their jetpacks to get back in the capsule, but it could be a problem on some other bodies. The chute you have attached is a drogue chute, designed for atmospheric braking. I\u0027ve never used one to land a returning capsule back on Kerbin, so am not sure if it has enough drag to do so successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving removed both the RCS and the larger fuel tank from your lander, it is capable of landing on the Mun but not with enough fuel to get back to Kerbin. This is principally because I had to use the lander to circularise the orbit at Kerbin and fly the Munar injection phase. If you can incorporate a more fuel efficient middle stage to perform these tasks, I am sure your lander will have more than enough fuel to perform a Mun landing and return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/trial.png\u0022 alt=\u0022trial.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T02:34:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would say your biggest problem is ( step 1. ) As others have suggested, try your retrograde burn from a lower (parking orbit) like 35 or 40\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
