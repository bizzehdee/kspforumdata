But i\u0027m curious as what i should research next. And how cautiously i should use science points, Because on my last one i got so far i can\u0027t get science from kerbin anymore.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T21:01:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have a detailed path worked out yet, but in general: solar panels, then probe cores, then science instruments.

Launch into polar orbit and do EVA reports over as many biomes as you wish. Come back down when you\u0027re ready. Expect to lose the engine and about half your fuel tanks when you finally land - your command pod should survive. That\u0027ll get you a goodly amount of science right off the bat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo....that was not your question. #facepalm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETier 2 techs I recommend in this order: Survivability, General Rocketry, Stability (radial chutes allow you to make bigger constructions - read moar goo pods in polar orbit; the Mk1 Command Pod has sufficient torque thrust for steering most of the rockets you\u0027ll be building at this level unless you go ape, and about the only thing moderately useful Stability offers is the TT38-K, which is quickly outmoded by the TT-70 with General Construction). I do recommend you get them all before moving on to Tier 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise I recommend you get all Tier 3 techs before moving on to Tier 4. I recommend Science Tech (batts!), General Construction (struts!), Flight Control (Stayputnik!) and Advanced Rocketry (not much!), in that order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETier 4 is where your options open up. Go first for Electrics (solar panels), then Fuel Systems (fuel ducts = asparagus staging).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there it\u0027s really a matter of what you want to do next. In general, though, I\u0027d recommend Heavy Rocketry and Advanced Construction next on Tier 4, then jump to Specialized Control and Heavier Rocketry on Tier 5 before hitting Nuclear Propulsion on Tier 6. That gets you nuclear engines, which is generally what you need to go interplanetary. You don\u0027t necessarily have to do that to max out the tech tree, of course, but like I said it really matters what you want to do most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I suppose once you\u0027ve got Electrics, you could go Electrics -\u0026gt; Advanced Electrics/Advanced Exploration -\u0026gt; Electronics -\u0026gt; Advanced Sci Tech. That way you unlock the rest of the Science instruments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-06T23:09:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2014 11:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T22:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt really depends on what you need to get to the Mun and then to other planets with your current skill set. The comments so far are all good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it sounds like you are not at a Scott Manley you should definitely get all the techs that cost less then 45 each (all 4 of the odd priced techs) and then Science Tech. That gives you the basics to go to the Mun and Minmus (just pack some batteries) and gives you the Science Jr which is the highest value science instrument you can use until very late in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there I would suggest getting the other 3 items that cost 45 science before investing in items like Fuel Systems, Electrics and Space Exploration. If you\u0027ve been having trouble going to the Mun or Minmus these techs will help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there it depends on how far you want to go - there is a lot of science on the Mun and Minmus (just try landing in different places). If you are happy staying near Kerbin then you can get a lot of mileage by pursing the techs at the bottom of the tree - Advanced Exploration, Advanced Electrics, Electronics and if you can finally afford it Advanced Science Tech. Investing in these early can greatly increase the amount of science returned by future missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow all this really depends on your skill level in piloting and design as well as how many times you want to land on the Mun or Minmus (the Mun has dozens of different biomes, each one can be explored for more science).
