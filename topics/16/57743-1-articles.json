FAR reduces the dV requirement to reach orbit from about 4.5 km/s to 3.5 km/s, which is pretty significant. On the other hand, the improved drag model can cause rockets to tumble out of control if you turn them too abruptly; this is worst with large or otherwise awkward ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI also see most of you using KW that lets you get in orbit with 1-2 stages.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock rockets can easily reach orbit with 2 stages, and rocket-only SSTOS are possible at the expense of a very small payload fraction. KW rocketry doesn\u0027t change this. However, it includes 3.75m parts, which should make it possible to launch heavy payloads into orbit with a slightly smaller part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy question is: do and wich mods make easier to get in orbit and save fuel? \u0027cause all the time I run out of fuel when comnig back from the Mun or Minmus, and I\u0027m planning to go on Laythe.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, there are two types of mods for KSP: \u0022new stuff\u0022 mods like KW rocketry or B9, which don\u0027t significantly affect the difficulty of the games, and \u0022realism\u0022 mods like Deadly Reentry, FAR, or Realistic Solar System, which almost always make the game harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your case, I\u0027d recommend you download a mod which tells you how much dV your vehicle has. Mechjeb and Kerbal Engineering Redux are the most popular. These don\u0027t save you any fuel, but they make it more likely that you\u0027ll pack enough for your mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to really \u0022save\u0022 fuel in KSP is to fly as efficiently as possible. There are many tutorials on this out there. Mechjeb may also be helpful. The autopilot features aren\u0027t always the most efficient, but it\u0027s incredibly useful for tasks such as fine-tuning an aerobrake (landing guidance) and automatically throttling engines to keep you at terminal velocity or prevent asymmetric flameouts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T09:05:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to save fuel is to know what you\u0027re doing.
