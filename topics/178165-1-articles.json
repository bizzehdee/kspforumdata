Saw this guys trap video. He say\u0027s it would be convenient to hold in the ground. This is potentially true. But I imagine that is even more difficult and a simpler solution is possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mQQ688csuw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mQQ688csuw\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8mQQ688csuw?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething even simpler and elegant is that is it light enough for the animal to walk but not enough to run from weight and size. This also makes materials easier to find and the design simpler. If you simply stick it in the snow or on the snow like the picture he only needs to get his foot in a little bit. This means it could be setup in multiple ways also. Over a hole, like he said, maybe with leaves. Possibly weight down or loose with a closed setup. Or it could be spring fed to need less space meaning it gets trapped and held on the foot enough to make walking annoying by shape and other aspects. In a snow environment it would leave much bigger tracks in the snow making it easier to hunt. So would any encumbrance to it\u0027s running. As it it long and thin it could start to rotate if running getting in the way of the animals stride etc. And with the spiky thing it could cause pen further making the animal not struggle and break or loosen from the trap. This could also slowly or quickly rub against it flesh causing bleeding that in a snowy environment could make things easier to spot. Although I suspect the light and not breakable may be one of it\u0027s best uses as it could hang from one leg and not let the animal destroy it for multiple uses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Looking at it again, the illustration is not in the snow. But the logic could still apply. I think he\u0027s right about the way the trap was used basically and how it only needs minimal reinforcement to hold onto the animal. This means a simple twig could be used to hold the trap open and easily replenish-able if the mechanism is not attached. If facing the direction of the two other parts it can use it\u0027s own weight to hold on and the deer would have a hard time removing it. And if the hole it cut to not rotate it could still easily hold on to the foot and make him easier to hunt down. Mabe even wear him out over time if it stops him from resting. They could be making him not be able to sleep and then slowly hunt him down after he is exhausted. Think how most 4 legged creatures sit. They have to bend their front legs in a certain direction. Just stopping that forward motion,which those spikes aid in preventing psychologically if not physically. Will keep the trap alive and slow the animal down in the long run. Then they just need to find him. If it makes him bleed that may help also, unless it makes it more likely for other animals to find him first. Don\u0027t know anything about hunting so I have no idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong design would also be convenient because wooden planks on the ground may conveniently be in this form making maknig it easy to make out of random debri and not need as many tools in case of a need or desire to make the traps out in the woods. And if making out of wood and debri it might not be good to require it to take a lot of force as it might break. This could make a looser design superior as it\u0027s more versatile and can be make of more materials. Structural strength requires materials to accomplish and may make it more difficult to make the trap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the trap is dangling it may also make extra noise helping the hunter track down the animal faster to get to it(or track it until it\u0027s tired) before other animals can get it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, if it\u0027s not weighed down it\u0027s quicker to set and place meaning it can be used in more ways. Say you know where the animals will go or you will make them go over it to see if you can get them to step in it. This is better the less you have to do potentially.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-09T08:15:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2018 08:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-09T07:57:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8mQQ688csuw?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one?

I seriously doubt it was set immovably in the ground at all, because of how immensely strong herbivores legs are.

They dug a hole in the ground near a trail of their prey, and inside it hunters installed a heavy wooden ring with sharpened spikes placed inside. There was a rope tied to the ring, and other end was tied to a piece of log (preferably with branch stumps still on it). When animal stepped into the trap, wooden spikes would get embedded in the leg, keeping the prey trapped. Even if animal was able to pull the ring out of the ground, its weight and the log snagging on every bush and rock would work to slow it down and weaken it for the hunters to kill easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCruel, i know - and my modern environmentally conscious self is cringing at the though.

The length could be purposely designed. If the trap is carefully cut to not turn on the hoof it then coudl be designed to purposely interrupt the front to back leg movements. This would potentially stop it from running. If it can turn on the hoof it could snag in all directions if done long enough. If the wholes are cut purposely small enough it could be custom made to animal leg length, which people hunting and eating on a regular occurrence, let alone wearing as clothing/jewelery, would be intimately familiar with those lengths and sizes. They may even use them as standards for clothing and whatnot. They would basically be taking the most efficient part of the animal and then throwing a wrench in that part as efficiently and simply as possible. That would be a very good trap on that grounds alone I would imagine. Unless that is not why it\u0027s good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think the easiest way for the animal to minimize the trap is for the back to go slightly outwards. The trap could then be designed around how the animal walks to hit the other leg depending on the stride of the deer. If not it would hang but risk getting in the way of limbs on any side and still make it harder to walk gapping the distance it and the hunter can move in a given period. If not the whole or other parts could be specialized to control the movement to make something more likely to happen. Maybe that trap design can be modified to different animals that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if anyone has compared the traps lengths and stuff to the way the animal walks to see what they specifically focused on in the trap design. It could probably reveal a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also don\u0027t think the fresh trap(the recreation) is realistic unless it\u0027s design to be shaped with use against the hooves of the animal. The real trap looksl ike it\u0027s custom fit to dangle as low on the hoof as possible by dangling out and is slightly cone shaped. I wonder if this is to be on the stronger part of the animal to cause less pain. And or to also potentially hand on the lowest center of gravity to mess with the individual foot as well. I could imagine they carve it specially or they could hypothetically let it\u0027s wear and tear carve it out a bit. But the pre coned/shaped hole could be useful. They would probably have a hoof around as a mold or shape to follow. The rest depends on the individual knowledge about the animal. And if they hunt it to survive I imagine that is pretty thorough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also doubt the wood would be finished and polished that way. I would think that might make it look too man made. Unless the prey goes for that sort of thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough if it was set in a whole all they have to do is set the resistance of the trap not to break the trap and lift out if needed. Then it acts as described as they move. They would have to know how to do that fairly easily as that is the basics of how the rest of the trap would already have to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it was in a hole it was probably to hide it and or get the foot far enough in and go down the leg to trap it. And then hidden just enough that if it gets out it doesn\u0027t remove the trap and is auto resettable which is actually a really good thing potentially as it gives more chances. If it gets trapped it could hypothetically be held light enough to then pull ou and stay on the animal unless it\u0027s easy enough for the trap to hold it there. I guess you could play with the hole design to limit the animals pull force if it forces the leg be bent in an inefficient way or something. It would depend on how each trap was made and the limits of the design. It seems interesting though. I wonder if the museum people went over it thoroughly enough to get potentialy structural limits or tested designs to see how it may work in practice per it\u0027s intended prey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m virtually repeating what the guy in the video said though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-10T05:02:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2018 05:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
