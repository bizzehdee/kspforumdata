The skids are **much** more forgiving but getting the plane off the ground again is tricky.\n\nSo after much experimentation I came up with a rather excellent solution using the large lander legs from the popular NovaPunch pack.\n\n![easyflyer.jpg](http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/2515/easyflyer.jpg)\n\nWhen folded the legs work like giant skids with less ground friction than the C7 skids. When deployed you\\\u0027re all set for a vertical take off, or you can deploy them when taking off normally to \u0027unstick\u0027 you from the ground.\n\n[Landing made easy in Kerbal Space Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRiflB1OC7g#)\n\nI\\\u0027ve only installed NovaPunch, C7 flight pack and KSP 0.14.4. This method won\\\u0027t work with 0.13 because the lander legs seem to need 0.14 to work.\n\n ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n.craft file below"},{"CreatedByName":"Excalibur","CreatedById":12839,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T11:46:58Z","Content":"That is such an elegantly ingenious design - hats off to you!\n\nQuite jealous I never thought of that. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nMind posting the .craft file please?"},{"CreatedByName":"0muffins0","CreatedById":25347,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T14:33:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That is such an elegantly ingenious design - hats off to you!\n\u003E \n\u003E Quite jealous I never thought of that. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E Mind posting the .craft file please?\n\nI can\\\u0027t find the damn thing.

I think you just saved a bunch of folks a lot of headaches.\n\nI haven\\\u0027t downloaded the mods yet, and don\\\u0027t have time for a session of KSP today. But, I wonder what would happen if you rotated those three legs 120\u00C2\u00B0 or 180\u00C2\u00B0? That way, there would be one leg on the back to serve the same purpose as the big tail, and the two skids in front would help auto-level the plane during takeoff and high-speed taxi. I\\\u0027ll try this as soon as I can, but ideas are impatient. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAnyway, your idea and design work very well. o7"}]}
