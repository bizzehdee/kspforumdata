Maybe at some point telescope parts and camera parts could be implemented into the stock game? They could serve both as science parts (maybe the science multipliers of bodies could be increased if detailed pictures had been taken of them beforehand), and as reputation-increasing parts (your reputation could go up if you have taken and released to the public lots of high-quality images of deep space). Just a small idea I had to try to encourage running a space program similar to ours (and it could also help encourage the use of space probes) and to add a somewhat key element of our space program to the stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daishi","CreatedById":85055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T11:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, it\u0027s an interesting omission from the whole exploring\\discovery theme of KSP.
