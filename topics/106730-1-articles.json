I made this as a reference that I could use and I figured I may as well share it. It can be especially useful if you are trying to fulfill a contract to build an orbital or surface outpost/station. I chose to not include the EAS-1 External Command Seat because of how broken that is from a mass and realism point of view and because I don\u0027t think it counts for station contracts (not certain of this part).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see the Mk1 Lander Can and Mk2 Crew Cabin in various combinations are usually the winners. Keep in mind that for passenger parts, you would need to account for additional mass from a probe core. Also, the form factor (1.25, 2.5, Mk1, Mk2, etc) may be more or less important depending on your design and mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I hope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
