Thanks to Green Skull, you can even see this gas in the Kerbals\u0027 helmets now (once I figured out how to use that mod correctly) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using the updated Interstellar tech tree that shifts things around somewhat besides adding its own stuff.

The story so far is that after getting into orbit, the Kerbals attempted to orbit Minmus but lost Richdun and Philfred to FAR-induced tumbles, after which they sent probes instead. This allowed them to send basic SCANsat probes next to map the biomes of both places, setting the stage for crewed orbital missions. I tried something I picked up in The Great Science Mission Thread, which is the real subject of this post.

The Mun Skimmer was equipped not only with Elsen and his pod, but also a thermometer, an orbital telescope, and the magnetometer from Orbital Science. Out of all this, the only things that worked on biomes (as opposed to working just once in low orbit) were EVA reports and the telescope.

Its waste heat system isn\u0027t unduly burdensome in a fresh game starting with it from scratch, although it will kill existing games if you have stuff in flight that relies on solar panels but lacks radiators. Life support hasn\u0027t become an issue yet, either, because the trips so far have been so short that it\u0027s just a matter of adding 1 part to check that box off. However, I can see this being a pain later on because of the hard duration limit and/or resupply requirement it will impose on long trips. FAR is something you just need to know how to deal with and once I remembered the routine, it was no problem. But Deadly Reentry has immediate and rather significant effects. There\u0027s now a limit on the size and shape of things that I can land, and I have to bring back enough fuel to set up a reentry within heat shield parameters. That\u0027s where I\u0027m having to do the most rethinking.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-29T16:25:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2014 04:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T02:59:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPISODE 2 -- FLAILING AROUND\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Subtitle: \u003Cem\u003EThe Cruel Tutelage of FAR\u003C/em\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(again, all pics are clickable thumbnails)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with some shiny new toys, the Evil Empire\u0027s quest for galactic dominance continued. The creaky rocket-based economy\u0027s mills needed more Science! to grind, of course, and one of the new discoveries from last time was an orbital infrared telescope that generates 1/2 a Science! every day. All you have to do is get it into space. And its tank of cryogenic helium. And the nuclear power plant needed to keep the helium cold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was in the course of doing this that the main theme for this episode 1st became apparent: FAR is a harsh mistress. It wasn\u0027t really a big deal several versions ago but these days it\u0027s got a mean streak. This might be more noticeable because I got the distinct impression that not all the mods I\u0027m using, which say they\u0027re 0.23.5-compatible, don\u0027t use the 0.23.5 joint strength but wobble as much or worse as before. And I\u0027m not entirely sure Procedural Fairings really do more than look pretty because my rockets were often acting like the wind was blowing right through them. But it\u0027s a poor craftsman who blames his tools so I\u0027ll take the blame for the long string of disasters that ensued, through poor design and bad flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, through serious trial-by-error, I did come to understand some general parameters that FAR tries hard to impose nowadays, and they basically boil down to almost forcing you to make short, narrow payloads relative to the rest of the rocket. It really doesn\u0027t like long payloads and it especially doesn\u0027t like wide payloads. Because both dimensions are limited, the amount of stuff you can do with 1 launch is pretty limited unless you\u0027re prepared for a long, hard fight getting off the ground. I don\u0027t like limits so I spent hours today butting my head against them. For the most part, FAR won.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, after much frustration and the expenditure of countless billions on failed launches, the Evil Empire\u0027s 1st orbital IR telescope (by necessity, a long payload) was up and away. It also had the 1st full-blown, flying fission reactor Kerbin had seen.

You need a separate rather large part, a \u0022thermal generator\u0022 (aka a steam turbine?), to turn the heat into electricity. Needless to say, the Evil Emperor was furious when he found this out, especially because the KSPI thermal generators don\u0027t seem to make electricity out of any other heat source like rocket exhaust, being HyperEdited into low solar orbit, etc. And the only reason people lug nuclear reactors into space is to make electricity. It\u0027s not like they\u0027re making steam to spin turbines to move the ship. So why?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, after numerous public executions of boffins who either hadn\u0027t read or hadn\u0027t understood the user\u0027s manual, the orbital IR telescope was redesigned, and the lifter redesigned for the higher payload weight and even longer shape, and many more failed launches followed, but eventually the Orbital IR Telescope Mk 2 was in place, operational, and making Science! while the boffins sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nbPT3J\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7122/13905999074_8ac328b4ee.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213905999074_8ac328b4ee.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the user\u0027s manual, the reactor will last for about 7 years. The cryogenic helium will probably run out before then. But at least the Empire has plans for one that flies so should this parallel universe last that long, a new one can be sent up come the day. And perhaps a few more in the meantime because 1/2 a Science! per day ain\u0027t very much given all the trouble this caused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then it was back to trying to get a Kerbal on some moon or other. The boffins dusted off the Sacred Blueprints of the Standard Science!-Plundering Lander from back in the pre-FAR days, hung a fairing around it, stuck a lifter with sufficient delta-V under it, and expected great results.

This resulted in the Mun Lander Mk 3 vehicle:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nbPSWm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3675/13905998704_bfd44e1875.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213905998704_bfd44e1875.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR wasn\u0027t happy about this and cause the rocket to do 2 somersaults at SRB burnout, but Elsen managed to regain control and got it into orbit. The original idea was to just orbit, test various systems, and then land, but after so much trouble just to get off the ground, the Senior Boffin decided to go on and attempt a landing on Mun. When told that the new lander design only had a single 48-7S to deorbit at Kerbin and test reentry properties, the Senior Boffin took out his slide rule, decided the lander had a TWR \u0026gt; 1 at Mun, and said it should work there OK.

The object now was to make a probe that could carry all the Orbital Science and SCANsat stuff, plus whatever KSPI science fit in, plus a Kethane scanner, all at once. The initial concept was to try out the new KSPI thermal rockets, too.

Why? If fuel lines can run through the reactor core to the exhaust nozzle, surely steam lines can run through the fuel tank to the thermal generator. Here on Earth, the steam turbines are often 100m or so from the reactor core with the steam pipes going through all the shielding in between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh well, at least this ship had enough battery power to prove that the thermal rocket itself is useless at this tech level. Sure, it\u0027s Isp is 1000 but it only produces 8.9Kn thrust. The LVN, also available to the Evil Empire at this point in time, although inferior in a few details, is vastly superior in overall operational characteristics. For instance, it took an inordinate amount of time to de-orbit this misbuilt ship (yes, I crashed a reactor on Kerbin, but on a Rebel stronghold so no harm done \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there was 1 thing where the thermal rocket out-did the LVN, and this was important to FAR.

Why did the boffins make that switch, knowing it would arouse the demons of FAR? Because, after going to all the trouble to fill LKO with the magnetometer probes, somebody pointed out that the usual tactics of aerocaptures in the Duna and Jool systems might be problematic because they hadn\u0027t put any heat shields on these probes. AARRGGHH!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for a while the boffins were quite despondent, thinking they\u0027d have to deorbit the lot and start all over before reporting to the execution dock. But then they realized these probes don\u0027t actually have to capture at any place they\u0027re going because their instruments are 1-shot things for high and low orbit, that will work just fine on fly-bys. They might actually capture into huge orbits around the central planets by just skimming the atmospheres, which they might get away with even without heat shields, especially at Duna. But no need to capture at any Joolean moon, raising the possibility of playing gravity ping-pong there and Scienc!-ing all the moons. In which case the boffins wouldn\u0027t have to be executed after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s a different story with the SCANsat probes, which definitely have to capture into fairly low orbits. So these probes needed heat shields. But they also couldn\u0027t retain their fairings for the trip out due to the need to run the ships on solar power during the trip. Thus, the boffins used a 1.25m tank with a 2.5m SDHI \u0022reusable\u0022 heat shield on the bottom, between the tank and the 909, so its overhang will hopefully protect the stuff radially mounted on the tank. This was tried on previous probes and seemed to work although what you see in the game makes you think otherwise. All the radial parts show as \u0022isShielded=false\u0022 and the reentry graphics come off the rocket nozzle and the radial parts instead of the shield edge. Might be a limitation of Deadly Reentry.

To this end, they created the Mun Lander Mk 5, put Nedfred in it, and shot it off. Things did not go well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket proved to have bad harmonics, causing SAS to reinforce oscillations until the ship broke up. LES systems not yet having been invented, Nedfred did what he\u0027d done many times before, hitting the stage button repeatedly as flying debris knocked off parts of his lander. What was left of is lander got clear with enough functioning chutes to come down safely and it looked like just another routine launch failure. But for some reason, perhaps the accumulated trauma of a dozen or so such incidents, Nedfred then climbed out of the lander can, lost his grip, and plummeted about 450m to his messy demise. So perished the last of the Kerbals who\u0027d survived going to space so far.

The only difference was that SAS was not engaged until SRB separation. During the SRB burn, the rocket wobbled somewhat and didn\u0027t want to go in the right direction, but at least it went up. Once the SRBs were gone, Mitsen switched on SAS and the rocket calmed right down and flew fine, although on an inefficient path. Once out of the atmosphere, Mitsen popped the fairings, deployed his solar panels, and only then exhaled the huge toke of cigarette smoke and Purple Haze he\u0027d been holding in since ignition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/ncE6H4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7344/13915407041_8c75f78411.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213915407041_8c75f78411.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon Mitsen was on his way to Minmus, chosen over Mun as a low-gravity shakedown. The pic below shows the main features of this ship. The boffins had found a way to cram the Sacred Standard Lander\u0027s 4-barreled Science! assembly on a rocket skinny enough to survive FAR after a struggle. There\u0027s a tank of TWPH (tobacco, whiskey, Purple Haze) under the can, 1.25m heatshields under the Materials, a 2.5m heat shield on the main shaft below them, then 2x Poodle-powered stages on the bottom with the remains of the fairing in between. The lower Poodle does 1/2 - 2/3 of the transfer burn, all the capture burn, and what\u0027s left acts as a crasher stage during descent. The upper Poodle does the final landing, the ascent, and the return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the big tank on the bottom, the lander is taller than I like but such is the price of using FAR. Also note the 8x medium legs, the big legs not yet having been invented.

In the meantime, the Jool window came due so off went the 4 probes, 3 identical Science! probes intended for Jool, Laythe, and Vall, and 1 SCANsat probe for Laythe. But as usual, I got interrupted while in the middle of hurriedly burning this flotilla 1 after the other, with the result that 1 probe went WAY off course. It has no hope of getting to the Jool system but has a decent chance of hitting Dres in a century of so when their orbits synch up.

It\u0027s another Interstellar thing that makes Science! while you sleep, provided you staff it with smart Kerbals. In this case, it\u0027s Geofmal and Camlin, with zero and 5 stupidity ratings, respectively. They were at least smart enough to drive the thing about 3km SW of KSC before starting to work, out from under the usual impact area of failed rockets. They have tobacco and whisky for 648 days, unlimited electricity from their own nuke plant, and a system that continually makes fresh Purple Haze out of the atmosphere. And for all this, they\u0027ll generate only 0.288 Science! per day, meaning this entire beast will only make 186 Science! after 2 years. Geofmal and Camlin are way too smart to waste their time this way so they\u0027ll just stay out a few days to make sure the core doesn\u0027t melt down, then drive it back for scrap.

But how to get that much Science! in less than 2 weeks? The only option was to do a couple more Mun landings, so they hastily cobbled that together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the 1st mission, they selected Hadry, the bravest and stupidest Kerbal on the roster, and put him into another Mun Lander Mk 6. A feature of the Mk 6 was a SCANsat downlink which so far hadn\u0027t been used. But this time the boffins used it and MJ\u0027s point-landing feature to lock Hadry (who was too stupid to fly such a mission on his own) on course to land at one of the anomalies previously detected. Somewhat to the surprise of all (MJ\u0027s landing routine seems to work in a vacuum), this worked and Hadry made an amazing discovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nerEG5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7044/13935614532_fcb36624df.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213935614532_fcb36624df.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Science! gained on this trip, the boffins quickly upgraded the lander to the Mk 7 and sent Richhat to the East Farside Crater in hopes he\u0027d redeem himself for the tragic loss of all his data last time.

In my previous careers without FAR, I\u0027ve just gone alone the top and the bottom of the tree (rockets and Science! parts), ignoring the middle, which is mostly airplane stuff, until I had nothing better to spend points on. However, FAR demands streamlining. FAR demands control surfaces and even actual wings on rockets. So in this game, I\u0027ve often had to prioritize the airplane stuff just to make flyable rockets, THEN worry about getting Science! stuff and bigger rocket parts. Hence, I\u0027ve been pretty much filling in whole tiers from the middle out before moving on to the next tier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, with the new technology in hand, the boffins set to work throwing together an Eeloo probe. When they were finished, it looked like this on the pad, and was a fairly interesting beast:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nguoiB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7136/13958777733_3172987092.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213958777733_3172987092.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith FAR, payload fairings need to be proportionally small compared to the rest of the rocket, but you don\u0027t want the rocket too long or it will get all wobbly. So, a payload of the size shown here pretty much needs the 3.75m rockets just for stability in flight, not simply for the power. You can launch payloads this size on 2.5m rockets but don\u0027t expect FAR to like it at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note the high placement of the boosters. This is another FAR-induced thing. When the main rocket stack is about the correct proportion for the payload, and its tail feathers and all have it aerodynamically balanced (CoM as high as possible, CoL at the very bottom), but it just doesn\u0027t quite have enough delta-V, you have a choice. You can add another tank to the stack or you can add boosters. FAR doesn\u0027t like you to do either. FAR really likes SSTO rockets but sometimes you just can\u0027t make that happen. So.... Making the stack longer makes the rocket too long and it gets all wobbly. But OTOH, adding boosters in the conventional position at the bottom brings the CoM down and the CoL up, ruining stability. But if you hang the boosters up near the top or at least in the vicinity of the CoM, you preserve the aerodynamic balance while avoiding excessive rocket length. But it does look rather silly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it worked. In fact, this rocket flew better than any before it. When it got up, it shed its fairing so the probe could extend its panels and instruments to make sure they all worked. It has panels simply for the high power denands of transmitting, especially with the big dish antenna. The probe is armed with both magnetometers, the orbital telescope, the standard instruments that work in orbit, and the low-res SCANsat altimetry and biome mappers. The boffins sent up 2 of these for redundancy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nerG8v\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2909/13935619371_0934147c16.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213935619371_0934147c16.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the Eeloo probes were up, the boffins set about trying to plot their course, but immediately ran into a problem. The KAC Almagest says to burn on Y1 D240. Alexman\u0027s website (which KAC supposedly uses) says to burn on Y1 D280. And MJ says to way over a year. Perhaps confusion was introduced with the 0.23.5 changes to the calendar. Anyway, with nothing firm to go on, the boffins programmed alarms for all 3 dates and crossed their fingers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile waiting for the 1st of the alarms, they went back to work on the Duna flotilla, adding a 1-way probe lander to the mix. This thing will transfer out on the Poodle stage, keeping its fairing through aerocapture. Then it will do a deorbit burn and ditch the Poodle and the fairings, coming down with a 2.5m heat shield to protect all the exposed things, using a 48-7S and 8 radial parachutes for landing. It\u0027s got all the stock instruments plus the Orbital Science core drill and lasers, and the Interstellar gas chromatography. The guts are the only interesting part; it went up on a simple 2.5m SSTO rocket with no real FAR issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nerG3v\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2907/13935619081_cc78de8a3e.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213935619081_cc78de8a3e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the boffins wanted to see if Interstellar\u0027s Science Lab would do any better in LKO than it had on the ground. So they put together a 3.75m rocket to see. Inside were Jondous and Camwise, 2 of the smartest Kerbals in the world. They almost bought it as the rocket flipped several times but Mission Control regained control and they ended up in the 80km orbit desired.

This means that any multi-part thing you build in orbit, like an interplanetary ship, has to be built of more modules than without FAR. Besides the tedium of the extra launches and dockings this entails, you also end up with more docking port joints and thus more wobble. This puts a premium on the 2.5m docking ports.

However, if all the ships are going to the same place, and aerocapture isn\u0027t particularly finicky, then it aught to make my life a lot easier. For instance, at Laythe, there\u0027s only like a 3-4km band of altitude between not capturing, capturing into a decent orbit, and lithobraking, so that\u0027s not a good place for simultaneous arrivals. Nor are simultaneous arrivals desirable if your ships are aerobraking at different heights at Jool to go to different moons.

It was hoped that the Claw would solve all the previous problems encountered docking wheeled vehicles. It certainly did work great for docking. Unfortunately, the boffins discovered that none of the electricity from the reactor made it through the Claw to the antenna. Thus, the entire thing was utterly useless and immediately scrapped.

Attempts to launch the 3.75m reactor all failed due to 3.75m fairings not yet having been invented. While the 2.5m fairings would stretch that far, they created a weak neck on the rocket. Furthermore, the sail area of the fairing was so great that no amount of tail feathers could make a stable rocket. So in the end, the boffins decided to start with a 2.5m reactor just to see if they would work.

Thus, they were finally able to enjoy the show without having to focus constantly on the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn due course, the OMG Mk 2 arrived in a 300km orbit with about 500m/s to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/noNL9q\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7332/14041578696_760ef26640_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214041578696_760ef26640_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn due course, the OMG Mk 2 arrived in a 300km orbit with about 500m/s to spare. IN YO\u0027 FACE, FAR DEMONS!! HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW, GRAVITY?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce up, the OMG Mk 2 fired its 1 and only stage, dropping its lifter and shedding its fairings. Then it fired up the nuke and began transmitting microwaves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: I decided not to put a generator on each end of the reactor because I now think that\u0027s an exploit of KSPI. Looking at the double-ended rover, it\u0027s putting out 2x the power but says it only has 1x available, so basically it\u0027s getting 1/2 its juice for free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nsBW6e\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2920/14084731903_6115048aea_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214084731903_6115048aea_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this great success gave the green light to launch 2 more OMG Mk 2s to be spaced out ~120^ around the 300km level. With the 4x relay stations at 500km, it was hoped this would provide the system\u0027s total power in all directions from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the 2nd launch, the boffins only changed 1 thing. They added another 4 heavy Sepratron MK IIs to the lifter because they didn\u0027t think it had separated well enough. But then a new problem arose. The 2nd rocket sank into the Launchpad and refused to budge when the engines lit. So the boffins had to jack it up on a few launch clamps to solve that problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nsBVF6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/14084730503_bacb2afed8_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214084730503_bacb2afed8_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut after that, the other 2 launches went just fine and by late morning all 3 OMG Mk 2s were up. Not symmetrically spaced but with each of them always able to see 2 or 3 of the relays, no big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nqTycq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2911/14065147054_dbfff921ab_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214065147054_dbfff921ab_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the question was, how many usable microwaves was this constellation actually making? The instrumentation on the OMGs and relays didn\u0027t really say and in fact looked quite confused, which was confusing. There was only 1 way to find out: send up a microwave-using probe to see how much juice it could pick up. And to really taunt the FAR Demons, the boffins decided to again try a plasma thruster from the ground up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nqyYcL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5102/14061520682_1025cab9ee_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214061520682_1025cab9ee_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stats looked good on the ground but what would happen? How long could the probe use the ground-based source? Would the space-based sources kick in soon enough? Would they be sufficient? Would the FAR Demons go berserk over the appalling lack of aerodynamics? Only 1 way to find out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nqyY5b\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7335/14061520242_24859caeb0_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214061520242_24859caeb0_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ground-based power flowed and while there was a noticeable drop at about 30km, after that the space-based power started coming in at ever-increasing levels. The FAR Demons tried hard to stop the probe\u0027s ascent but they only succeeded in making the probe burn a lot more fuel than it otherwise would have. As it turned out, the probe ended up with insufficient dV to achieve orbit, which was just as well because it was only a flying test instrument with no destination in mind. But it did get completely out of the atmosphere where it was able to measure 1.98 GW of available power, pretty close to the theoretical maximum the OMG Mk 2 network should have been producing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/noNK8h\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7318/14041575266_11f5e0ccaa_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214041575266_11f5e0ccaa_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, xenon tanks exhausted, the probe fell back into the vengeful clutches of the FAR and DR Demons. It beat the latter but not the former.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nqyXHE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2931/14061519052_de4d6392b1_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214061519052_de4d6392b1_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the boffins, quite satisfied, took the rest of the day off. They had accomplished much, they had learned much, and they had kept their heads on their shoulders. They repaired to the pub to meditate on what they could do with all these microwaves.
