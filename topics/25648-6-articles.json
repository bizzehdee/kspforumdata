His parents, Wallaby Salmon and Shallot Salmon, abandoned him because he was so ugly. After he was abandoned, he snuck aboard a british empire vessel - the HMS Papadum - and was transported to the Kingdom of Prussia. There, he met Frederick(II, III) William, who raised him as his son.\u003Cp\u003EOnions was 16 when Europe War I began, so, in order to fight for the Kingdom of Prussia against the British Reich, he lied about his age. Due to three penguins - Louis, Louie and Lou\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BFs - who voice acted him so the army wouldn\u0027t be able to tell how squeaky and annoying his voice is, he was able to join the ranks of the Kingdom of Prussia\u0027s Militia, and was transferred to the Elite Guard after just 5 minutes due to Sm\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6ke Skre\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ABn being eaten by the mechanical spiders of the British Reich.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter joining the Elite Guard, he had to undergo intense training. Much of this involved standing straight and being breathed on, and there was very little actual combat training. Nonetheless, he got an Elite Guard Diploma and was deployed to the Schlieffen Front between France and the Kindom of Prussia.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe recieved the order to travel through Neutral Belgium, to get to the capital of France. However, when he reached there, the Neutral Belgians gave stern resistance - up to several thousand ohms in places. He was forced to retreat along with the rest of the Elite Guard, but there job was not done yet. The only way to break through Neutral Belgium and reach the capital of France would be risky, but the Elite Guard had to do it. The Elite Guard had to find the Ohm-Mega Keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter scouting for the Ohm-Mega Keys for days, they stumbled upon a Supermarine Jackhammer (an experimental propeller aircraft). It had crashed, killing the pilot. Inside the engine was an Ohm-Mega Key , and another was close by. Only one remained to be found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir answer was found shortly after when they stumbled upon a wounded soldier of the British Reich. Called Pvt. Wing, he said that he knew the location of the final Ohm-Mega Key, but required medical kit. Once healed, he gave the Ohm-Mega Key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the three Ohm-Mega Keys in hand, they were able to go through Neutral Belgium. They tried to resist, but the current of the Neutral Belgians was dissipated as heat. Marching southwards, they entered France and took the capital, as Georges Clemenceu was doing his laundry at the time and they mistaken it for a white flag. Georges Clemenceu did not dispute this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rasheed","CreatedById":29903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T20:36:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the 4th of July, 1953, Poland invades Germany, starting WW3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T22:12:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2001, Poland becomes the first country to set foot on the moon.
