Sorry about that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I have an idea for Real fuels/realism overhaul. Making the engines take an amount of time to get to full thrust or 0 thrust. For example the F1 took like 2 seconds to get up to full thrust after it was ignited, And when they were cut they took a few seconds to fully lose thrust as the remaining propellants in the combustion chamber was used up. Would that be possible to implement? It would be a function of the size of the combustion chamber I think, Small rocket engines would go from 100% to 0% in like half a second. Larger ones may take 2 or 3 seconds to finish burning up the remaining propellants.

I am guessing right now for making the stockalike file, and I really don\u0027t know what types of engines I\u0027m looking at in most cases. Also, I want to share how I\u0027m setting up the fuels. I\u0027m using a system since the stockalikes are for gameplay, not realism.

So I\u0027d suggest replacing MMH with AZ50 (or UDMH) for U, and HTP/Kero for L. (and varying whether AZ50 or UDMH). Actually, you could just exclude MMH and AZ50 and always use UDMH.

MMH gives the best Isp, but can\u0027t be used in large, regeneratively cooled engines, because it decomposes. UDMH can be used in much larger engines than MMH, but has a lower Isp. AZ-50 is in the middle, it\u0027s better than UDMH for medium-size engines, but can\u0027t be used for very large ones.
