Deploying patches and updates to consoles is a significantly more involved process than publishing steam updates, involving significant review and testing from the platform controller, and an associated cost. The speed of iteration is just one of many reasons why console early access is so rare. This is starting to slowly change with things like Xbox Game Preview, but that is very much a \u0022Microsoft will pick and choose\u0022 process, and not something the devs can just do themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you lose out on, mainly, is console player feedback on game mechanics, but that is generally not a problem so long as your PC launch is large enough - Its unlikely that console players will have input to say, the balancing of Colony resource production that is any different from PC players. Any divergent feedback will almost exclusively be in regards to console input/control schemes, which would be the bottom of the barrel of concerns during the core part of actually adding new gameplay mechanics and content - There\u0027s simply more important things to focus on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
