Sometime I see some jittering movement backward, but it merely moves the rover. and once I release the buttons the rover goes full forward, just like if I was pushign the buttons full forward. when I brake, it decelerates but once I release the brakes it goes back to \u0022full forward\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe only way for me to regain controls is to hit \u0022full forward\u0022. at this point I regain control as if nothing happened...until I try to go backward again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried a vanilla install, I moved the controls for the rover on the numpad, even tried with a USB numpad, removed all my controllers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to build a rover with a rovermate, a command seat, other probes.

I should have a look at that and either find a workaround or make a hard decision.
