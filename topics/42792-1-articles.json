The terrain/suspension problem on rover wheels makes all rover use a crapshoot at best and futile at worst, as it *will* go tumbling down a hill and break sooner or later as a result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad don\u0027t seem to grasp how big of a problem it is, since the most recent bugtracker report (with the best reproducibility I\u0027ve seen on one yet, complete with a save file) has been downgraded to \u0027Low\u0027. It\u0027s not \u0027Low\u0027, it\u0027s a major issue that\u0027s seriously affecting an entire core game function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo do all of us a favor: If you\u0027re ever experienced the problem where the suspension on your rover jacks up, resulting in the rover losing traction and bobbling about and/or flipping over, please add a comment on your experiences in this regard to this bugtracker report:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/1141\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/1141\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need to show them that this is a major, widespread problem that causes serious gameplay issues, and not just some minor niche thing that a couple of people are experiencing occasionally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-16T23:33:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2013 11:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Echostatic","CreatedById":59603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T23:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has made driving my two seater on Laythe a nightmare...

My latest attempts moved them back and used docking controls so that I could experiment with active ASAS use. Which helped some on flat terrain but at one point seemed to actually lift the rover off the side of a hill, causing it to go tumbling down the hill and break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s lots of things that help rover stability in general, and this isn\u0027t about any of those issues: This is about terrain segments that cause your suspension to lift your rover partially off the ground, removing almost all traction and control ability, and have a severe tendency to send you rolling down a hill if you\u0027re on one when it happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause right now, even with good design, lots of testing, and every other assistance measure, this bug still ends up flipping you over if you drive in hilly terrain (and massively slows you down if you don\u0027t).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyRender\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SkyRender\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem is not the driving mode, the problem is that the suspension on stock rover wheels doesn\u0027t have nearly enough flexibility for the terrain.

This causes the suspension to either harmlessly push the rover down or lift the rover up. The latter causes problems because it seems to actually be able to exert force on the rover, and tries to pull it right off the ground. The problem is that it partially succeeds, resulting in instability and lost traction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven TT\u0027s Multiwheels, which work far better than the stock wheels in many cases, have this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-17T00:22:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2013 12:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T00:19:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...why did it make a new post instead of editing the previous one... *confused*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd more importantly, where\u0027d the delete button go!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Echostatic","CreatedById":59603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T00:21:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed that when I get this bug, the wheels are all the way out on their suspension.
