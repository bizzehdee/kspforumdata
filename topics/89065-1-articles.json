I have the virtual joystick mapped in the CH control manager and everything works in game (with the exception of the thumb joystick that is on the pro throttle) however, the controls of both the throttle and the joystick are not the way i would like them. The joystick is basically all or nothing which defeats the purpose of a joystick altogether. When flying a spaceplane both roll and pitch are very sensitive and adjusting the sensitivity only makes it so that i have to move the stick further before it\u0027s \u0022all or nothing\u0022. I can\u0027t figure out how to smooth things out. The Throttle works as well but from 0-1/3 throttle it\u0027s very smooth and from 2/3 to full throttle it\u0027s very smooth but from 1/3 to 2/3 it\u0027s very sensitive and basically skips over this range all together. I assumed that in CH manager this could be changed in the \u0022gain and response settings\u0022 graph but it\u0027s a straight line and adjusting it only makes things worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T23:50:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds as though you might be applying the joystick bindings as buttons, instead of as axes. Each binding that supports a joystick input will have two input options separated in columns. The left column usually lists buttons and is \u0027all-or-nothing\u0027. The right column utilises joystick axes, and is what you should use for most of the joystick (apart from its buttons).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pyromaniah","CreatedById":127880,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T23:52:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have all the controls set up as axes not as buttons, with the exception of yaw which is set up on one of the buttons on my joystick since it doesn\u0027t have a twist axis and I don\u0027t yet have the rudder pedals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
