This mean that fuel transfer follows crossfeed\u00A0rules. The problem is a heat shield doesn\u0027t have crossfeed. This cause problems refueling ships at stations, because the fuel tank is below the heatshield. It has been suggested that I simply connect a fuel line to the heatshield, this only works if you connect two (one from each direction). This is not easily done. I am looking for a more reliable way to connect the fuel lines. Please help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t suggest turning off the crossfeed rule as that makes me feel like I\u0027m cheating.

Only way i think:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave a structural pylon or girder stick out of your vessel slightly, and add a fuel line from 1 tank to the girder, and from the girder to the next tank. The girder can be any size - even an OscarB tank\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-18T22:13:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMount a docking port on the side of the craft near the tanks to avoid this.
