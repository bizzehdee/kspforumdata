Your craft must have 1 Kerbonaut on board, either in a cockpit or in a command seat.\n2. STOCK PARTS ONLY.\n3. No MechJeb (you can have it installed but you must promise not to use it\u0027s flight assistance, however using it\u0027s altimeter and other readings *is* permitted.)\n4. No wings of any kind.\n5. No aerodynamic control surfaces of any kind.\n6. No RCS.\n7. No decouplers may be fired once the vehicle leaves the runway or the launchpad. (They may be necessary right at the start of the mission to allow command seats to be used).\n8. Parachutes *are* allowed.\n9. No Cheats, no Debug Menu.\n\nTo qualify, all you need to do is show a screenshot of your craft driving over to the VAB, and then driving up the wall until all of your craft has left the ground and your craft is in full contact with the VAB\u0027s wall. You can choose any wall you like. You must not destroy any buildings during your mission, and all buildings must be fully intact at the start of your mission.\n\nAchievements for BONUS POINTS...\n\n- **Evel Kneivel** -- Your craft has no more than 2 wheels. **50 POINTS**\n- **Happy Camper** -- half way up the VAB wall - stop, get your pilot to go EVA and take a selfie while the vehicle remains stable for 5 seconds! (Take one screenshot when he goes EVA and another 5 seconds later). **200 POINTS**\n- **Kerbal King of the Castle** -- end up with your craft on top of the VAB (smouldering wreckage is acceptable). **40 POINTS**\n- **Kerbal Prince of the Castle** -- end up with your craft on top of the Space Plane Hanger (smouldering wreckage is acceptable). **5 POINTS**\n- **Royal Flush** -- Achieve **both** the above **Prince** and **King** achievements in the SAME mission in any order. **20 POINTS**\n- **Burnin\u0027 Bridges** -- Park your craft on top of the bridge in the \u0022Research and Development\u0022 facility at KSC. **10 POINTS**\n- **BIG RIG** -- your craft has eight (8) **RoveMax Model S2** wheels on it. **200 POINTS** **\u003C\u003C\u003C\u003C NEW BONUS**\n\nI\u0027ve got a simple craft that will drive up the VAB so I deem this Challenge entirely possible. It can be done with very few parts.\n\nInterestingly, wheels will steer effectively and brake effectively on the side of a building, if you can provide a means to press your craft against the building.\n\nADVANCED CLASS:\n\n- There are NO RULES for Advanced Class ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Do something cool with space tape and moar boosters. Use any mods you like, any parts you like. Craft in this category are not eligible for the main Challenge. You may still claim points as defined above though.\n\nOther than that, just have fun with racing up vertical surfaces.\n\n**LEADERBOARD**\n\n1.

Aaaaahhh.\n\nWell, one of the staff at our KSC said they are \u0022okay with a bike\u0022, and were \u0022kinda almost willing\u0022 to test out a rocket bike. So the engineers [came up with some blueprints](http://kerbalx.com/juzeris/The%20Bike), intentionally omitting a bottom booster, so it wouldn\u0027t be just boring hovering.\n\nI\u0027m fairly sure she managed all of the achievements, unless you just added some. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nI also did use MechJeb but only the information parts (altitude above surface!).\n\nAlso I broke the \u0022no decouplers\u0022 rule, but I don\u0027t think I broke the spirit of that rule.\n\nHere are the results of the test drive:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
