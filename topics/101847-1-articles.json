Where would you say is a good test spot. My plan currently is to go to the mun then boost into a higher orbit then aero-brake around kerbin back to a 100km parking orbit. So who can answer first?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T01:47:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 01:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by spaceman1999**"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T01:18:30Z","Content":"There is no real analog to Duna but Duna. It all depends on what you want to test.\n\nIdeally you\u0027d send a probe first to see how many parachutes you need, or thrust you need, etc.\n\n(there are mod and online resources that will help, but you sound like you want to do this without their aid)"},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T01:31:41Z","Content":"I test everything on Kerbin before committing to a mission.\n\nSTEP 1) Build the lander either in the VAB or SPH, depending on the configuration, and take them out on the launch pad or runway. Good way to see if you forgot ladders and such. \n\nSTEP 2) Once I\u0027m happy with the design, I\u0027ll add on temporary boosters (if the lander can\u0027t takeoff on it\u0027s own power) for suborbital test flights. For testing parachutes and power assisted landings.\n\nSTEP 3) Once they pass that test, I\u0027ll build and test the booster stages that will take them into a stable Kerbin orbit.
