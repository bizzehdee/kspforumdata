It is, however, not clear which family of small bodies is responsible.

The D/H ratio found was very close to our terrestrial value -- which was not really expected. Most models on the early solar system claim that Kuiper Belt comets should have an even higher D/H ratio than Oort cloud comets because Kuiper Belt objects formed in a colder region than Oort cloud comets.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThe new findings of the Rosetta mission make it more likely that Earth got its water from asteroid-like bodies closer to our orbit and/or that Earth could actually preserve at least some of its original water in minerals and at the poles.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T14:40:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd we have the first colour image released to the public.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2014/12/colour_image_of_comet/15109319-1-eng-GB/Colour_image_of_comet.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Colour_image_of_comet.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERed, green and blue filters.
