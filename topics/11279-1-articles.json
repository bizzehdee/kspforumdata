So far I\\\u0027ve found I can get it to a 600km orbit. Uses stock parts and some Nova parts.\n\nThere were some sloppy inconsistencies in both designs, I\\\u0027ve updated both craft files.\n\nPretty stable, I generally take off and climb at 40 degrees pitch. When my vertical speed reaches its peak, I activate the aerospike thruster and climb until the air breathing engines\\\u0027 efficiency drops, at which point I decouple them from the wings and activate RCS control. Landing will probably be a glide down, but if you\\\u0027re careful you\\\u0027ll have fuel to correct you reentry if needed.\n\nPics below of the stock and Nova variants.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\***IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT ACTIVATE THE LAST STAGE.

Also, fly my plane! Highly capable, also capable of delivering small probodyne satellites into kerbin orbit. Just keep an eye on that RCS!
