Using speed and time calculations, the runway width is ~360ft wide. In addition, FAA publishes the runway centerline stripes to be 120ft long. Again, based on speed and time calculations, they are ~577ft long. The spacing between those are supposed to be 80ft. The lighting has some things wrong. The centerline and runway edge lighting is semi-directional for colors, not omnidirectional. Going down the runway, centerline lights are white until the last 3000ft, where they then should alternate white and red. At 1000ft before the far end of the runway, they are solid red. Runway edge light is white until the last 2000ft or last half of the runway, whichever is less and turn to yellow the rest of the way. There are other things I noticed too but since I teach students to fly planes, I figured I\u0027d throw in some finer detailed suggestions. Let me know if you want more feedback on some of the other things I noticed with the airport.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatsEJstandfor","CreatedById":220814,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T21:41:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a big ol plane dork as well and was looking for things to call out the devs on regarding the runways, but decided that, even if they don\u0027t conform to FAA regulations, the kerbals would clearly have the KAA, and who knows what their regulations are?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T02:04:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy only suggestions for the runways have nothing to do with lighting or striping.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) I get that there are no winds on Kerbin so we don\u0027t really *need* any angled runways, but the sake of returning spaceplanes which may be returning from elliptical orbit, it would be nice to have had at least one, RWY 30/210 would have done nicely.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) The overruns are generally allowed for takeoffs but not landings, so it would have been nice to see the taxiways extended to the ends of the overrun areas for really long takeoff runs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steve7893","CreatedById":226360,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-05T15:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually I have trouble seeing the run way lights at night.\u00A0 \u00A0 Even from a short distance it seems all black.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
