When you look at the later models of both aircraft the Spitfire begins to clearly overtake the Bf 109. The simple problem the Luftwaffe faced with the Bf 109 was that its design had less longevity, and less relevance as time went on. Part of this is due to the fact that the demands of the Luftwaffe were far too eclectic - they were pouring money into modifying the Bf 109, modifying the Fw 190 (which was planned to become the mainstay fighter simply because the initial design was far superior to that of the Bf 109), designing successors to the Bf 109, developing jets, developing ultra-long-range bombers. The late Bf 109s rather got left by the wayside, given marginal engine improvements and equipped with ordnance that was really only fit for taking down B-17s and B-29s. \n\nWhereas, the air force, and even navy, of Britain was spending almost all of its money on the Spitfires. The Typhoons and Tempests were very capable and so weren\u0027t modified too much, and the same goes for almost all of the bombers used. Britain adopted a \u0022it\u0027ll do\u0022 attitude with regards to the majority of its air forces except for the Spitfire. Further, money was saved to a great degree by the RAFs initial disapproval of Whittle\u0027s jet concept, which led to Whittle developing the jet almost independently without funding from the government until the design was almost completed. Germay, on the other hand, spent vast amounts of government money on developing jet aircraft, and ultimately produced a plane (the Me 262) that frankly wasn\u0027t very fit for jet combat.\n\nAll of these factors meant that the Spitfire saw much more development time and money than the Bf 109, which ultimately meant that the Spitfire ended up eclipsing the Bf 109 in most performance parameters. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n*That\u0027s*, why people prefer the Spitfire. Not to mention the fact that the Griffon-engined Spitfires with bubble canopies (from the XIV onward) are the most beautiful machines mankind has ever produced. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"FourGreenFields","CreatedById":139309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T18:32:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well the Spitfires for the most part had a superior rate of climb to contemporary Bf 109, were only slightly slower in level flight and while they had a lower VNE in a dive they accelerated in those dives faster due to having a higher power/weight - which negated the possibility of Bf 109s escaping.\n\nAs said, I partially limited it to F-4 and later, vs pre-griffon spits. \u003C3 G-2\n\nAlso, with the Spits having high aileron stiffness at high speeds, the 109 could roll away in a dive (no warranty, and only below about 700km/h)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E When you look at the later models of both aircraft the Spitfire begins to clearly overtake the Bf 109.

The indicator used to be great for getting a ballpark estimate allowing for further adjustment from there.\n\nThere are more issues I have with 1.0.5, as well. The panther, for example, is a nightmare on single-engine designs, seeing as it forces full yaw on attempted roll maneuvers if the engine is even remotely out of line with the center of mass.
