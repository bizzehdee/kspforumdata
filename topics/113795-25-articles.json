When you look at the later models of both aircraft the Spitfire begins to clearly overtake the Bf 109. The simple problem the Luftwaffe faced with the Bf 109 was that its design had less longevity, and less relevance as time went on. Part of this is due to the fact that the demands of the Luftwaffe were far too eclectic - they were pouring money into modifying the Bf 109, modifying the Fw 190 (which was planned to become the mainstay fighter simply because the initial design was far superior to that of the Bf 109), designing successors to the Bf 109, developing jets, developing ultra-long-range bombers.

The Typhoons and Tempests were very capable and so weren\u0027t modified too much, and the same goes for almost all of the bombers used. Britain adopted a \u0022it\u0027ll do\u0022 attitude with regards to the majority of its air forces except for the Spitfire. Further, money was saved to a great degree by the RAFs initial disapproval of Whittle\u0027s jet concept, which led to Whittle developing the jet almost independently without funding from the government until the design was almost completed. Germay, on the other hand, spent vast amounts of government money on developing jet aircraft, and ultimately produced a plane (the Me 262) that frankly wasn\u0027t very fit for jet combat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these factors meant that the Spitfire saw much more development time and money than the Bf 109, which ultimately meant that the Spitfire ended up eclipsing the Bf 109 in most performance parameters. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThat\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E, why people prefer the Spitfire.

The panther, for example, is a nightmare on single-engine designs, seeing as it forces full yaw on attempted roll maneuvers if the engine is even remotely out of line with the center of mass.

It\u0027s now highly maneuverable sub-sonic. AOA of 25*. Capable of vertical climb. Now stable while supercruising. Highly stable sub-sonic. No yaw problems (unless fully stalled, but that\u0027s not possible while the afterburner is on). It\u0027s actually a really decent fighter. Its numbers are similar to the real-world F-16, which I would have thought impossible given the limited yaw stability.
