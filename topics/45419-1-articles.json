I think it should drain from the tank closest the thruster drawing it and it should obey decouplers as not crossfeed capable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheHengeProphet","CreatedById":14895,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T23:31:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn .19 and previous (I am unsure about these latest versions), RCS drained from tanks in the order of placement, thus the first tanks were drained first, etcetera.
