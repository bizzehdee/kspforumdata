Now for a fuel tank, it seems quite clear that flying through the air sideways produces quite a bit more drag than flying through the air end-on, but is this also true for wings? At first it seemed like the delta wings I was using generated a fair bit more drag than the much narrower strakes I ended up with, but now I\u0027ve seen a fair number of designs around that seem to use both swept and delta wings, which cut a much wider swath through the air than the strakes. IRL, all planes that go super-extra fast, like the SR-71, do have a very long and narrow profile, but is this actually true in stock KSP aero?

I guess I can stop worrying about that now. On a related note, would you happen to know if clipping wings into fuselages, etc. alters their effective area and/or drag? I\u0027m not trying to cheat the aero system or anything, but sometimes the shapes you\u0027re given just don\u0027t fit the design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T16:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have read other posts (too lazy to look for citations) that state that clipping parts does NOT reduce their drag.
