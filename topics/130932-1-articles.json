I have over 100 hours into the game and mostly understand these new aerodynamics, but I am having issues building a rocket that can go just about anywhere in return. My best rocket weighs 384,000 Kg roughly and has about 10.7k Delta-V. I know that I can do much better than that, because I\u0027ve seen designs of rockets that way 200 Kg or less and reach upwards of 13k to 15k Delta-V. If someone would be able to help me figure out how to construct a rocket where I can get the highest possible Delta-V that weighs 200 Kg or less and doesn\u0027t have assembled in space, I would massively appreciate it! If my desires are too steep, let me know as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T22:00:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith your criteria,\u00A0 you best bet would be a very small probe with a single tank of Xenon Gas\u00A0and Ion engine.\u00A0 most likely a small battery with the minimum amount of solar panels required.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStack the thing on top of a 4k D-V launcher ( for 100/100 circularization ) and send it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft would have very limited uses tho, as it is extremely low-weight you don\u0027t want to clog it with science experiments or Cockpit\u002BKerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abraxas Defiant","CreatedById":157755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T22:13:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do appreciate the response and will keep that in mind for probes, but I ask you, how would I go about building a manned spacecraft capable of landing and returning from\u00A0eeloo/dres? In terms of mass, it doesn\u0027t matter to me, but efficiency is what I care about. I would like to be able to build a manned spacecraft with maximum Delta-V to go just about anywhere in the system and be able to return if possible. I don\u0027t really know too much about the advanced maneuvers such as the hohmann and others like it. Am I asking too much? Because no matter what I do I seem to only be able to push out 9-10k Delta-V on a craft that is 350,000 Kg or more and I know that I can do much better, but haven\u0027t the slightest clue how to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT #1: Okay, so I managed to create a craft that has about 10.8k Delta-V, but the weight is about 190,000 as opposed to 350k.

They do symbolize two ideas, using different engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin general: These are landers with return ability,\u00A0all electricity needs are\u00A0handled by 1 rtg and yes, an extra reaction wheel wouldnt hurt for turning speed, you could do w/o. No ship can land anywhere and return (unless you believe the dude on youtube who went everywhere with 1 craft ^^), these two could land on most planets. Tylo, Laythe and Eve would require redesigns. Both rockets have an \u0022ant engine\u0022 as final stage for the final ajustments. Not needing a capsule would be a different story though.. and for Moho and Gilly,\u00A0you should consider ion, if you have the patience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnr 1, 205t: use the interplanetary stage engines, as lander engines and return engines. Only ditch used tanks when you can. (Do not carry more heavy\u00A0engines than needed !! ) Its downside is aerodynamic drag during take-off. You can easily upgrage this ship by adding a liquid fuel tank in the interplanetary stage... \u00A0Did I\u00A0accidentally create\u00A0a Tylo lander ? ^^.. It needs the extra liquid tank and the landing/return would be too close for comfort, but nb at all. \u00A0^^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnr 2,\u00A0266t: cheaper and lower tier\u00A0poodle and\u00A0lv-909 as final engine prior to the ant. This is probably considered to be a \u0022standard\u0022 rocket design.\u00A0More streamlined but heavier with less dv. The poodle stage seems\u00A0a bit large, but it is a strong engine and I went for it because\u00A0I dont like littering space with debris ^^.\u00A0Note the use of fuel lines, giving that last mainsail a full tank at stage 6 and getting pretty close to the perfect stage mass ratios Blaarkies explains. Note that using a single nuclear engine for the interplanetary stage would lower the total mass\u00A0quite a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(It might not be able to lift off from Duna.
