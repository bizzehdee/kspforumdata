Thanks!\n\nAll drag can be overcome with more power, Just slap an extra few engines on what ever design and itell work, thats the only reason Cronus can take 80 tons to orbit.\n\nAdmitted Cronus does have i think 60 engines to do that, 45 of which are air breathers. \n\n![ksPICP9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ksPICP9.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T02:24:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 02:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Roflcopterkklol**"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T02:21:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/CDNtL5O.png](http://i.imgur.com/CDNtL5O.png)\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/d1YkyCb.png](http://i.imgur.com/d1YkyCb.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/FrgqnmT.png](http://i.imgur.com/FrgqnmT.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Hey guys, I wanna have some opinions for this.\n\u003E \n\u003E When I make SSTOs, I always try to make simple ascend profile.

No. But reusable? Also no. For career gameplay\u0027s sake, I believe the usual purpose of having an SSTO is to be able to refuel it and reuse it over and over again.
