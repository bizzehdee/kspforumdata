The planets work differently than objects e.g. asteroids, rockets and space stations. They are always loaded,\u00A0so with the\u00A0right tools they can\u00A0be seen visibly from anywhere in the Kerbol System. By using the zoom in feature in a command pod, you can easily spot Minmus\u00A0if you set it as target, but it\u2019s possible to zoom in on other planets!\u00A0So far I was only able to see Eve as four purple pixels on the screen as well as Jool (2x2 to 3x3). I also tried to spot Duna\u00A0from kerbin but with no luck. If you plan on trying this for yourself, make sure the planets/moons are as\u00A0close to the location you are observing the object from. This makes it easier to spot.
