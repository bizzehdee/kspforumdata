I wrote that off to having to clear stuff out due to the \u0022trapped in VAB/SPH\u0022 bug, and hoped it\u0027d be fixed with the next patch; not sure that\u0027s the case, as I heard something about a Unity update that had less-than-wonderful side effects, but here\u0027s hoping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -- Steve\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpion","CreatedById":4192,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T06:48:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t noticed this correlation myself, but I wouldn\u0027t rule out coincidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old system loaded a static scene whenever you went to the space centre, which meant it had a roughly constant load time, but in the new system it\u0027s just drawing part of the universe, which means caching effects should affect the load time: the space centre should load faster if you were recently in its vicinity (since it\u0027s already in memory) but load slower if you\u0027ve been away for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that in a new campaign, you\u0027ll likely see fast load times as you fool around at KSC, but as you get further in the game you\u0027re more likely to see slower load times. If you started a new campaign when 0.21 came out, it\u0027s possible the longer load times you\u0027re seeing are related to your progress, rather than the patch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
