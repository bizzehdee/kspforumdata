The lander must be reusable, so I had to find a way to replace the heat shield during the mission. As it doubles as the main command pod of the mothership, I could not put fuel tanks or other non-accessible parts between the pod and the docking port.

While I had used similar designs with turbojets before, the ground was too uneven for the RAPIERs. When the engines were spooling up, the lander started drifting horizontally and eventually crashed. Ultimately I had to take off with the engines in closed cycle mode, before switching to airbreathing mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ascent was quite difficult. Climb too fast, and the engines run out of air prematurely, just like with stock aerodynamics. If the climb rate was too low, dynamic pressure went up, and bad things happened. Because the ship needs a relatively high angle of attack to maintain a stable climb rate, it gets out of control when the dynamic pressure rises too high. My best attempts were 200-300 m/s short of reaching orbit, which should be enough for Laythe.

The lander itself has just over 12000dV to get off eve, will be landing using just parachutes. The lifter to get it and it\u0027s transfer stage into orbit generates aroudn 64MN thrust on the ground, and lags my poor lappy to around 3-5 frames a second till a few stages are burned off.
