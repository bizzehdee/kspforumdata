For the tl;dr crowd, skip to the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night, playing a career game. Still relatively early in the career, so I only have about half the tech tree unlocked. Got a contract to rescue a Kerbal marooned on the Mun. Figure I\u0027ll do a quick and dirty rescue mission. Throw together a lander craft, put in a Kerbal that needs Mun landing experience, and send it to the Mun. After landing near the stranded Kerbal (close to the Mun south pole), I realize that I don\u0027t have enough delta-v left to even get into Mun orbit. Thankfully, I have a docking port on the rescue craft, so I figure I\u0027ll do the Kerbal thing and send a rescue mission to rescue my rescue mission. Throw together another rescue craft, put in a 3 kerbal crew (need experience) and send it to the Mun. Get it into the appropriate orbit and then launch rescue1 from Mun surface into a high, suborbital trajectory. Timed it so rescue2 craft would intersect, and then I burn a ton of fuel getting them to rendezvous and dock (as they are both hurtling towards the Mun surface). Burn a ton more fuel boosting the now docked craft back into Mun orbit and realize that I now don\u0027t have enough fuel to get either craft back to Kerbin. What to do now? Yep....rescue mission for my rescue mission for my rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time, I just build a remote controlled fuel tanker. Slap a probe core on a fuel tank, add an engine, some RCS ports (and fuel) and a couple docking ports on opposite sides of the fuel can. Launch that into LKO, send it out to the Mun, get it into the right orbit, and rendezvous with the docked together rescue1 and rescue2 craft. Then I undock those two craft from each other and dock each one to a port on the fuel tanker. Hooray! I now have plenty of fuel to get both rescue craft home to Kerbin and can leave the fuel tanker floating around the Mun for future missions. I transfer enough fuel to rescue1 to get it back to Kerbin, undock it, and send it back. Re-entry is cool and mission successful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I get to thinking, why send rescue2 back? I got tons of fuel in it now; why not send it to Minmus and see if I can pick up a few contracts with that? But first, lets get rid of some clutter. All these launches have been terribly inefficient and I\u0027ve left a lot of junk in space. Lets go to the tracking station, sort by debris only, and terminate all the stuff labeled and classified as \u0022debris\u0022. So I do this, and then go looking for my rescue2 craft (which I left still docked to the fuel tanker). Hmmm....not there. Not listed as a ship, not listed as a probe, it\u0027s gone. Check the astronaut complex and, sure enough, 3 dead Kerbals; KIA. Really??? Apparently, the tracking station classified (and labeled it) as debris despite the fact there was a probe core on the tanker, and a manned ship docked to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESigh. Pouring out one for my dead homies....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR - A fuel tanker with a permanently attached probe core (and therefore a \u0027probe\u0027), and a manned ship docked to a docking port on the fuel tanker was labeled and classified as \u0027debris\u0027 and not as a \u0027probe\u0027 or as a \u0027craft\u0027 by the tracking station. Therefore, when I terminated all \u0027debris\u0027 via the tracking station, I killed an entire crew.

My understanding about the way KSP works is that when two ships dock together, you don\u0027t have two ships anymore, you have ONE ship, and a couple of lines of text in the ship\u0027s persistence file that remember things like the name and classification. Then when you undock, it splits them into two ships again without actually knowing anything about the ship that once existed as a whole vessel - it just snaps the Legos apart at the docking node, and rebuilds the ship from there, since what if you docked ANOTHER thing to the second ship, etc etc. My assumption is that it attempts to read the old name and classification from the previous root part / command part, but that\u0027s just me speculating. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe process seems to work mostly okay for the actual physical separation of the vessels, but the naming and vessel classifications are a crapshoot. It seems to me that KSP has a hard time dynamically figuring out what a vessel should be named and classified as, especially if you glom together a bunch of different ships together and then break them off asymmetrically. If you have a fuel tank or something as the root part of a vessel, that seems to exacerbate the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"keeper","CreatedById":124530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T20:07:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always make a habit of re-naming the craft after seperation/undocking.
