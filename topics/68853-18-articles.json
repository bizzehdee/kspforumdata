I get lots of YouTube video comments that suggest people are still a little confused about what just happened.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you watched episode 50 then you know this:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere were two almost identical parallel dimensions. Let\u0026#39;s call them US and THEM. In the US dimension Bob was experimenting with transporter technology, but a containment failure caused a tear in space-time. The tear affected many parallel dimensions at the same time so THEM was affected too. Many Kerbals in both dimensions were killed. US had the original Kerbals you know like Kranz, Joseph, Bob, Jeb, Kesla, Neil, and Valentina, but Svetlana had died. In THEM everyone [i]except[/i] Svetlana died, and their space administration was being run by Sergei and Komalak. Joseph was assigned to a task force to research the anomalies but ultimately almost everyone died when Kerbin was destroyed. Kranz went back in time to warn Joseph not to make the same mistakes again that had led to their destruction.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo in the second timeline Kranz was assigned to the task force and Joseph was opposed to the program. He knew it was going to lead to their destruction due to the warning from future Kranz. The Kerbals from THEM found us and Svetlana from there crossed over to US. Once again we were not entirely successful in stopping Kerbin\u0026#39;s destruction, but this time we discovered how to go back in time and stabilize the original experiment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo US started over again for a second time, and this time there was no explosion. Since there was no space-time rip this means no Kerbals have died. THEM was restored back to normal and does not even know we exist. Svetlana from US never died, so she is now able to apply to the new task force that is being prepped to investigate the [u]stable[/u] space-time anomaly we have just discovered.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbonautInTraining","CreatedById":145373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T17:39:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you think you could give a basic explanation as to how you overhauled the default electrical system?
