Once at 70m/s hit the spacebar for RATO assistance, then again when the RATO packs run out. Fly it to arround 10km, still at 45 degrees, then kick in the Aerospikes. Ride the thrust out to your desired altitude and circularise. Still has usable amounts of rocket fuel out to about 150 km circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
