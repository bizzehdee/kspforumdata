Well, IMHO, you\u0027d be correct. This beast is my attempt at recreating a stock version of this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69593-Infernal-Propulsion-Challenge-Walkers-catapults-and-more%21-Infernal-Robotics?p=1398160\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1398160\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMun Runner\u003C/a\u003E. When I first saw that challenge I was mostly underwhelmed by the entries (no offense to the entrants but I was looking for a \u0027real\u0027 walker.) The closest thing I saw to what I wanted was the entry by Parallax. You can find his walker for download \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93815-BIPEDAL-WALKING-CONSTRUCTION-ROBOT-now-available-for-download\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. His impressed me. It was agile, wasn\u0027t lethargic and looked like a real walker. Though it\u0027s speed was still rather slow it was at least able to climb hills. After studying what he created, I saw a major problem with his design. It requires a script to run it. I assumed he had either a programmable keyboard or something like the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-nostromo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENostromo\u003C/a\u003E. I discovered he uses uses a program called AutoKey. He basically programs a sequence of keyboard strokes into a piece of sofware that are timed properly. When he\u0027s ready to walk, he hits a keyboard command and Autokey plays them back in order to achieve movement. While his walker does work, it was a lot more complex than I wanted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith only 4 gigs of ram and an ancient AMD quad core, I needed a \u0027fire and forget\u0027 walker that required nothing else to work. Turn it on, it walks. And that embarked me upon a month-long quest of building and refining. As a result of bloodying my head against the wall numerous times, I have decided to share what I have learned in order to help prevent any further emergency room visits by KSP addicts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I came up with is what I\u0027m describing as a rotary cam-operated walker. Using only 4 Rotatrons as it\u0027s propulsion method, I\u0027ve created a unique walker design that\u0027s both agile, powerful and, as walkers go, fast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis tutorial will teach you the VERY BASICS of rotary cam-operated walker design.

Basically, it looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Nockenwelle_ani.gif/220px-Nockenwelle_ani.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022220px-Nockenwelle_ani.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA cam rotates. But rather than being completely round, one side of the rotating part has an extension or offset called the \u0027lobe\u0027. The lobe allows the conversion of rotary motion into vertical motion. And by duplicating a cam in KSP, we\u0027re going to change the IR Rotatrons into cams and thus, converting their round and round movement into an up and down movement that will make the legs of a walker move up and down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Art of Falling Down\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce upon a time, I read somewhere that bipedal walking was the art of falling down and not getting hurt. Each step you take you essentially fall forward. Before you land on your face, your other leg moves forward and stops you from falling, it then, makes you fall forward again. When designing a walker in KSP, that\u0027s exactly what you have to achieve. To fall forward, stop, then fall forward again. If you look at many of the robotic designs currently out there, like Asimo,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/ASIMO_4.28.11.jpg/175px-ASIMO_4.28.11.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022175px-ASIMO_4.28.11.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll see one big problem with all of them. They\u0027re slow. It\u0027s amazing how quickly the human brain is able to determine balance and react to imbalances and move your feet in order to keep you upright. Trying to duplicate that in KSP will be currently impossible. But, we can duplicate a subset of that motion. While your hip is on a rotating ball joint and can move in multiple directions, we\u0027re going to have to be satisfied with simply up and down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Up and Down\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I\u0027ve already described cam\u0027s, let\u0027s start with those. If you noticed the image above, that cam is \u0027fixed\u0027 in that the lobe can never change. The valves you see it opening will always open the same exact distance (discounting lobe wear). We\u0027re going to improve on that design and create a cam that is variable so that we can easily change how much rotary movement gets transferred into up and down movement. Here\u0027s a closeup of two of the cams on my design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutRotors.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutRotors.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach one consists of basically 4 parts. The Rotatron motor, a sliding gantry rail, a FREE docking washer, and two stock adapters to act as the lobe. The way it works is, you turn the Rotatrons on and they begin spinning which in turn, causes the gantry rails to spin. To create a cam, you extend the gantry rails. This moves the two adapters away from the center of the Rotatrons. The FREE docking washer is there to ensure that all that rotary motion doesn\u0027t get transferred into the adapters. As the Rotatrons spin, the adapters will still move freely. This allows us to attach various parts to them, a strut in our case, and transfer all that rotary motion into an up and down motion. The further out away from the center of the Rotatrons that the adapters move on the rails, the more up and down motion we achieve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ELeg bone connected to the... hip bone\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, by creating our own adjustable cam, we have up and down motion at our command. The next objective in creating a biped, is to have some legs. For this particular design, I\u0027m going to keep things EXTREMELY simple. I have experimented with designs that have up to 7 pivot points per leg, for this tutorial, we\u0027re going to stick to 2 basic ones and a mechanical one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the image at the top of this tutorial, you\u0027re gong to see 3 joints. The hip, the knee and an ankle. Believe me when I say that the most CRITICAL joint of all those is... the ankle. For that reason, we\u0027re going to use a mechanical hinge for that joint because changing ankle angle is, believe it or not, going to give us both stability and directional movement. The hip and the knee are going to be VERY simple. They\u0027re again, FREE docking washers (Note that I emphasize free. There are two types of washers, those that move freely and those that are powered. All of the ones used in this tutorial are the FREE moving variety.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe Hip\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s take a closer look at the joints, starting with the hip:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutHip.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutHip.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first BIG thing you\u0027ll notice in that image are the inline reaction wheels. I\u0027ll get to those later. For now, notice that between them I have a free docking washer. That allows the two outer reaction wheels to spin freely. Stuck to those is a \u0027Radial attachment point.\u0027 For some reason, Squad and most every modder has yet to realize that some of us NEED 90 degree parts. Since there aren\u0027t any really good ones, we\u0027re using the radial attachment point to create one. Attached to that is another adapter (for looks mostly) and to that I have an adjustable cylinder from the IR mod. That cylinder is going to allow us to experiment with leg length later. If you were to take this joint and hang it from a launch stability enhancer and launch, you\u0027d see the hip rotate downward and the entire leg would begin to swing freely. What we want from this hip is completely free motion. No power at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe Knee\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe knee is very similar to the hip in that it contains a single free docking washer. Much like your own hip and knee, we want them to pivot freely and let the muscles, or in our case, the cams, to do the work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutKnee.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutKnee.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the knee another problem arises, especially when using stock parts. Instead of a 90 degree part, we need to essentially build 180 degrees from the upper leg in order to get a decent angle on the lower leg. For this, you\u0027ll see I used more radial adapters and a short girder. While it\u0027s not pretty, it does work. Buried in that mess is the all critical, free docking washer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe Ankle\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you begin experimenting with walkers, you\u0027re going to QUICKLY learn that the most important parts to success are the foot and the ankle. Since our hip is a simple pivot rather than a ball joint, and since our cams are going to have a limited range (lift your feet too high and they\u0027ll splode when you bring them down) the foot and ankle are going to determine our direction of travel and how well we travel. In a perfect Kerbin, we could mimic real muscle attachment locations and have our cams pull back and forth rather than up and down on the leg. However, the physical world that Kerbals live in is vastly different. If you try to do that on Kerbin, you end up yanking the joints apart rather than swinging them. Instead, you\u0027ll see the rotors roughly placed directly above the corresponding joint and it\u0027s also why the legs are slightly bent. Because we can\u0027t mimic the full range of motion of a real leg, we\u0027re going to have to rely on the foot to do a lot of the work. By making very minute adjustments to the angle of the ankle when we walk, we end up pitching our entire walker either forward or backward. Just like I described in walking, our walker will \u0027fall\u0027 forward. The ankle angle determines how far above or below horizontal our walker leans. For this reason, we\u0027re using an active hinge from the IR pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note: in the real world, we\u0027d use our hips to slightly lean forward when walking. By adjusting our walker\u0027s ankle angle, it actually achieves a similar effect. Because the hip swings freely, you\u0027ll see the legs stay mostly upright while the upper structure of the walker pitches forward.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutAnkle.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutAnkle.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll also notice we\u0027re using a full size cylinder from IR for the lower leg. This will again let us experiment with leg length later. One of the other reasons for using an active hinge for the ankle is for when you fall down. You\u0027ll find that by lifting the landing gear and rotating the ankle around, you may actually be able to stand back up. For now, keep in mind that your ankle and foot angle are going to have two drastic effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhether you fall down or not when launching\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESpeed\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor these reasons, the ankle needs a full range of motion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutAnkleRotation.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutAnkleRotation.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe Foot\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, the bane of my existence, the KSP foot. If you begin experimenting with walkers, you\u0027re going to spend a LOT of time on foot design. Especially if you\u0027re trying to achieve speed or stability. Designing a proper working foot... well I haven\u0027t created one I\u0027m satisfied with yet. Here\u0027s the issue with Kerbal feet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding gear. They are pretty much essential. If you try to use any other part for the feet you\u0027ll find they tend to explode. If you try to push the limits of walker speed and leg height, landing gear will be essential. Especially now that they have built-in shock absorbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIF... your landing gear are angled too far from vertical, they explode when you sit your foot down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIF... your forward toes are at the wrong angle, you\u0027ll stumble a lot. Landing gear are designed to sit firmly on a spot on the ground and they do that too well. We\u0027re going to be putting them on the ground, back up again and back down. They don\u0027t like that much. The best way I can describe the effect that the wrong angle has is, you end up stubbing your toe. It\u0027ll briefly, for example, hang on the pavement of the runway in mid stride and cause your entire walker to pitch forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIF... you don\u0027t have enough angle on your heel, you\u0027ll just stomp your feet and go nowhere. The rear facing landing gear actually creates a lot of your forward motion. As they absorb the shock of hitting the ground, they tend to rebound, thus pushing forward. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting the angles of the toes and the heel just right, will drive you nuts. I\u0027ve created perfectly good walkers and had them fall on their face because of the feet. Or I\u0027ve had them go nowhere, or... I\u0027ve had them go backward from my intended direction. Feet and ankle angle are critical. The one I\u0027ve shown here is... an all-purpose foot. It does achieve decent speeds (10-15m/s) but, it\u0027s far from perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutFoot.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutFoot.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027l also find that, if you have forward pointing toes, they can often (and unexpectedly) create a braking action. Too much braking and you\u0027ll fall on your face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EConnecting it all together\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you understand the basics of our cams and our legs, let\u0027s start attaching all these pieces together so we can see how they work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing we\u0027re going to need to do is to transfer the motion from our cams into our legs. We\u0027re only going to have two attachment points per leg. One at the knee, in order to lift the upper leg, and one at the ankle in order to lift and swing forward. We\u0027ll use struts to accomplish that task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutStruts.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutStruts.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s where you need to pay a bit of attention to details. First, the upper struts on the forward cam is attached to the lobes (adapters) on our cams. The other end is connected to the inside of the knee. Make sure you connect it to the INNER part of the leg and that you don\u0027t attach it to the docking washer. The whole purpose of the forward cam is to simply lift the upper leg. When it does so, that upper leg should move freely. If you accidentally attach it to the docking washer, you just locked the knees motion. Take a better look at the screenshot of the knee and you\u0027ll see that I attached mine to the radial adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rear cam is attached just above the ankle. Again, it\u0027s purpose is to provide lift for the leg and some forward motion. In the screenshot you\u0027ll see that I\u0027ve attached mine to the end of the cylinder. IF you attach it to the foot, keep in mind, that you just negated the ankle hinge. While it will still flex, every time you do flex the ankle, you\u0027ll end up pulling or pushing on the cam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETransferring Power\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that we have everything attached, we need to make sure that we can turn the motors on. Here\u0027s where you\u0027ll need at least one action group. While you can play around with these settings I\u0027m going to try to describe simple forward motion. Other ways of configuring this will lead to... well unpredictable results or... leap frogging (My video of Mun Walker shows it leaping... predictably). First, make sure all four rotors are set to speed 1 (right click on them). Next create your action group so that all the Rotatrons on one side (left or right) spin in the same direction usually by setting them both plus or both minus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, depending on how you attached your rotors, the ones on the opposite side will need to be set to spin the opposite direction. The goal here is to get all of the rotors spinning either forward or backward. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutRotorDirection.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutRotorDirection.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have to attach a launch stabilizer and make a few test launches to make sure you have them all spinning the right way. Once you do, create another action group and have them spin the opposite of the previous group. In your experimentation you\u0027ll want to test them in both directions. They do have an affect on how the legs work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, you\u0027ll want to test your gantry rails. The objective here is to have opposing sides. For example, when you launch and click on the servo to slide the rails, the two on the left side should slide forward and the two on the right side should slide backward. The reason for this is to have the motion of your legs opposed. If, for example, all of your rails slide forward, when you turn on the rotors, both legs make the exact same movement and, you end up jumping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether the rails slide forward or backward on any one side is irrelevant, as long as the OTHER side slides the opposite way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutGantryDir.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutGantryDir.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final thing you\u0027ll need to do is to organize your servos in the IR popup. (Screen shot in a bit to show you my organization) You\u0027ll want hinges, gantry rails, rotors and cylinders all in their own group. The washers, since they should be free moving, don\u0027t do a thing when you activate a servo after launching so they can go anywhere. Usually I put them into their own group and never use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ELet\u0027s go for a walk\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, now it\u0027s time to launch. Once you do, the very FIRST thing you want to do is turn SAS on. You\u0027ll notice that I have a number of reaction wheels on my design. It\u0027s unfortunate, but in KSP there is no \u0027inner ear\u0027 to keep things balanced. Instead, we have the good old gyroscope. Without these, walking in KSP would be... difficult, not impossible but you\u0027d spend a LOT of time correcting and balancing. They\u0027re also the reason you see a lot of thermo generators sticking out of my design, they eat gobs of power. Another option here that I\u0027ve seen on some designs is to use RCS to maintain balance. While this does work, monopropellant is a consumable. It may offer more stability than my basic design but, I don\u0027t have to stop and refill anything. In your experimentation, keep your options open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now, if you turned SAS on, hopefully you\u0027re balanced. For your first test run, make sure the rotors all spin the right way and the gantry rails slide the right way. (if you\u0027re using my craft file, the action group to spin the rotors forward is 1). If they do, it\u0027s time to experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis particular design, I have had pretty dismal results with the rotors spinning at anything less than 15. To me, that\u0027s really too fast. All of my others work well at 10 and less. One thing you\u0027ll find is that once you turn the rotors on, they will create their own new gyroscopic effect. On the design I have shown, it leans the whole walker forward and causes it to veer slightly to the right. Nothing that isn\u0027t manageable though. If your rotor speed is too slow or your rails aren\u0027t out far enough, you\u0027ll just stay in one spot and wobble a lot. And I\u0027ve discovered that each design has it\u0027s own \u0027personality.\u0027 The design I\u0027ve shown should work at speed 10. But, if you try it at speed 10 some weird harmonics develop and your legs get off sync. So, if you\u0027re using my craft file, set the speed at 15. If you\u0027re designing your own, you\u0027ll need to experiment to find what rotor speeds work well with your design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutServo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutServo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, you may want to lean backward or forward a bit depending on your design to compensate for the gyroscopic motion of the rotors. Plus, you\u0027re about to create forward motion and it will quickly pitch your walker backward. You need to be prepared for that shift and compensate. Using the servo buttons, SLOWLY... A FRACTION OF A DEGREE... adjust your ankles to lean the walker forward or backward depending on the angle you initially start at. You\u0027ll find that once you\u0027re walking even a SLIGHT change in ankle angle has huge a effect. Now, if everything went right, you\u0027re still standing upright with the rotors spinning. Next, using the servo control panel, slide your rails. On my craft file, it\u0027s safe to slide them all the way forward or backward, it\u0027s the same effect either direction. Once you start experimenting with different size rails, take it easy. Too much motion on those rails leads to too high lift and you\u0027ll end up slamming your foot down and things start sploding. Another thing to keep in mind is that the gantry rails, regardless of size, move the same exact distance. This means that when you activate the servos for the rails that a 1/4 size rail will be fully extended while a full size rail will be only 1/4 extended (in the same amount of time). You may want to adjust your rail speeds so that they all extend equally. In my craft file, they\u0027re all at the same speed so the 1/4 rail is fully extended while the 1/2 rail is only half extended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that your cams are fully extended, you should be off and walking, if not running. If you\u0027re not moving very fast, slowwwly... adjust your ankle so that you\u0027re leaning a bit forward while manually maintaining your pitch. Eventually, you\u0027ll find the \u0027sweet spot\u0027 where the ankle angle is just right, the pitch is just right (usually -10 degrees or so) and the rails are positioned properly and it\u0027ll walk without you having to do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EAn experimenter\u0027s dream... (nightmare)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith any luck at all, you were able to start walking. Some things to keep in mind if you had problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnkle angle: I know I keep bringing this up but it\u0027s so critical. If you want to go forward, angle your ankles so that the entire walker leans forward. Make very SMALL adjustments and wait to see if they had an effect. If you want to slow down, angle them so the walker leans backward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStopping: When you\u0027re ready to stop, keep in mind that this walker design, particularly my craft file, moves on average at 9-10 m/s. If you try to stop too quickly, you\u0027ll end up on your nose. To stop, you need to \u0027center\u0027 the gantry rails. Hit the \u00270\u0027 button on their servo control for a second, (you\u0027ll see me do this in the video) wait, watch for slowing down, adjust your angle backward a bit if needed, then hit it again. If you simply hold the button down, you\u0027ll stop too quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStomping: On my craft file, one of the peculiarities of the design is that it will stomp in place. If you hit the action key \u00272\u0027 the rotors spin backward. The net effect is, the walker goes nowhere. If you adjust the ankle angle a bit, you can move backward. Another use is to spin completely around. By lifting the legs in place it has 0 forward motion but is still able to turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning: Just like waking and running IRL, there is a point whereby you can travel faster than your legs can move. The same applies to walkers. The further forward you lean them the faster they\u0027ll move. But, if you overcome the ability of the reaction wheels to keep you upright, you leave lots of parts on the ground behind you. Finding that balance is... a trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeg Length: You\u0027ll soon discover that just about every part, piece, angle... everything has an effect on walkers. I usually include some method to adjust the length of the legs. While this does change a lot of angles on things, just by extending the legs on the Mun Walker design I went from 10 m/s to 18 m/s. Now I realize to jet pilots that doesn\u0027t sound like much but for a pair of mechanical legs... that\u0027s haulin\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnd now, if you dare...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you click this link... I\u0027ve shown you the VERY BASICS of walker design using cams. Unlike aircraft or rockets or even rovers in KSP, the affect that even small changes have on the design can lead to huge or disastrous results. Even changing leg angles, rotor locations, attachment points, creating better washers, everything you do to a walker makes a huge change. I can tell you I haven\u0027t even BEGUN to explore the possibilities using cam power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI created this tutorial because, despite all the other fun things I\u0027ve done in KSP this... I consider my greatest accomplishment. I\u0027ve just fed you with an idea of how to do the same and even improve on my design. If you can figure it out without downloading my craft file, I can tell you that the first time your walker actually WALKS... you\u0027ll be amazed. And if you can do as I did and get it to another body like the Mun... it was a blast. Climbing a nearly vertical crater by walking up it was something I seriously didn\u0027t expect it to do. Every wheeled rover I\u0027ve tried that with ended up at the bottom of the crater, usually on it\u0027s roof. I\u0027m hoping, if you can accomplish this with just my instructions then your sense of amazement and achievement will equal mine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, however, my explanation was lacking (a very distinct possibility) the craft file is yours to experiment with. Again, it is only the beginning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: The craft file for this walker requires previous versions of IR.

But, I\u0027m going to describe for you some of the techniques I\u0027ve experimented with in order to create a more stable and more life-like design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutAdv1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutAdv1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an advanced walker design. One of the first things you\u0027ll notice is that the leg design is radically different from the stock design. When working with cam operated walkers, the only limitation is what your particular computer can handle. You can literally come up with hundreds of leg designs and cam locations. This particular experiment was designed to keep the center of gravity more centrally located over the foot and allow all the joint flexing to occur over the foot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I\u0027ve mentioned before, one of the BIG problems with designing a walker is stubbing your toes. If the landing gear protruding out the front of the foot hits the ground at the wrong angle, you come to a rather drastic stop. This design attempts to \u0027fix\u0027 that problem by creating a foot that also rotates as it moves forward. This is accomplished by using a free docking washer to create a flexible ankle as well as a IR hinge to allow adjustment of that angle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother \u0027problem\u0027 this design attempts to correct is the \u0027wobbling\u0027 of parts. In the stock design you may have notice that many of the parts don\u0027t stay perfectly aligned. This is caused by the stresses place on the parts by the struts. In this design the knee joint has a double docking washer and the strut is connected to the center of that joint. One problem you\u0027ll discover is that when you attempt to connect a strut to your legs, the struts really like to maintain the original angle you designed them in. This creates a problem in the flexible joints because the strut \u0027pulls\u0027 the joint at a fixed angle and can lead to the parts becoming misaligned. This design allows the strut to keep that original angle. As the strut pulls and pushes the knee, the center portion of this joint rotates to match the strut angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, when you watch the video, you\u0027ll notice I did something different. The rotors do not all rotate in the same direction as in the stock craft. One thing you\u0027ll want to experiment with is rotor direction and rail placement. I typically set up 4 action groups on my walkers. Two of those action groups have the rotors on the same side turning in the same direction (forward and reverse). I then set up 2 more action groups that have the rotors turning in the opposite direction on the same side. One thing you\u0027ll learn quickly is to never assume that your walker will perform best with the rotors going a particular direction. You may even discover, as I have many times, that you walker ends up going backwards better than it does forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutAdv2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutAdv2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the knee joint. You\u0027ll notice that I used 2 of the docking washers with 2 B9 end caps in the middle. The strut is connected to the end caps. This allows the center portion of this joint to rotate freely as the strut pushes and pulls on it while also allowing the upper and lower leg to swing freely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutAdv3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutAdv3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a closeup of the ankle joint. You\u0027ll notice that I added in a free docking washer and that the strut is connected to the rear of the ankle. The effect this has is that when the cam pulls up on the ankle it actually rotates the ankle. When you look at the video below play close attention to how the foot \u0027rolls\u0027 through a cycle much like your real foot. The heel hits the ground first and then rotates to use the toes for added propulsion. The really nice part of this design is that it drastically reduced the \u0027toe stubbing\u0027 effect when you try to slow down. The forward landing gear is lifted each time the foot is rotated and reduces the chance that those \u0027toes\u0027 will jam into the ground and pitch your walker forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/TutAdv4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TutAdv4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s this design on EVE. One thing to take BIG notice of is gravity. While your walker may work just perfect on Kerbin, every planet has different gravity and thus, puts more or less stress on the legs. While this design does work on EVE, the height of the foot lift is much lower and, the upper body tends to bob and weave as the legs are moved. Thus, the speed is greatly reduced and the walking effect is considerably more violent. Finding the balance between leg weight and upper body weight is a science all in itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look REALLY close, you\u0027ll notice that a lot of my parts are misaligned. This occurred during the transfer to EVE. Make sure if you do put walkers on the launch pad that everything is locked down well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/o0J3yTGV4Hw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s a short video of this advanced design.
