I\u0027ve been to many a derby, and I\u0027ve always been able to tell who built what just by looking at it ... meaning did \u0027dad\u0027 build it or the scout lol. Maybe things are different now? I have a lady friend who had two sons in Cubs, and I \u0027helped\u0027 them build their cars... supervised only, they did it all themselves. I was also asked by all the den mothers at the race to officiate, be the \u0027official\u0027 timekeeper ... only because my watch had a stopwatch function LOL! The most fun I had with this group of Cubs however was when we built model rockets! I was quite into model rocketry back then (1988-89?), so being involved with them was a lot of fun. Launch day at the park was spectacular, every single Cub\u0027s rocket flew great! I even launched one of my own, a D-engine Nike.
