While these creatures had the ability to photosynthesise, they remained mobile, eventually evolving into large, multicellular, mobile organisms. Over time, a rigid cell wall appeared in some but not all of their cells, allowing a more advanced structure than the slime they came from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModern kerbals retain their photosynthetic abilities, and in some circumstances show a sort of closed metabolic loop, requiring no food or external nutrition, only sunlight. However, their meager photosynthesis cannot sustain a full range of activities, and typically only supplies all necessary energy if the kerbal is willing to sleep for 5 hours a day. Originally, this was just what they did, until they realized that their functional digestive systems worked for getting energy in addition to minerals (normally accomplished by eating dirt), and that they could remain active for nearly 4 hours a day if they were willing to snack occasionally. As you can tell, kerbals are not particularly smart. However, they are nothing if not relentless. Over the next few years, they managed to scare off most of their predators by making loud noise, waving sticks around, and setting things on fire, themselves included. Having gotten predators out of the way, they decided it was high time they got rid of that stupid Mun thing that was blocking such a huge patch of the sky. To that end, they began launching primitive wooden rockets up, in an effort to scare it off like they did to the predators. Inevitably, one kerbal had an accident while setting up his rocket, and was launched skyward. He soon realized that the Mun was farther than they had thought. Eventually, over years of launching themselves to get a closer look, they became rather fond of it, and decided it would be better to go up and tame it, as they had to kittehkats and dawgs. Meanwhile, some other kerbals were working on exploring the world, which they did by walking, swimming, and later by making rafts out of kerbals, who would work in shifts to alternate rowing and floating. In time, they had colonized the entire, very small planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals reproduce sexually, using pollen emitted by the males and seeds created by the females after being pollinated. Unfortunately, most pollinators wouldn\u0027t have anything to do with kerbals, and so the kerbals were forced to resort to more... unique ways of spreading pollen, such as setting their pants on fire, causing the pollen from their hair to drift upwards in the hot air currents. At a certain point, they decided it would be a lot easier to just brush out the pollen into a little bag and give the bag to the desired mate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals are biologically immortal, and very close to literally immortal. On death, roughly 73% of their cells become free living extremophiles, which can revert to their previous state and eventually reform when in a safe environment. This gives a damaged recreation of the previous kerbal, which will heal up after about a week. Due to the impracticality of this approach for offworld kerbals, TKSA collects tissue samples of any kerbals preparing to leave for a mission, allowing them to grow a replacement kerbal, identical to the original at the time of departure, on the event of the kerbonaut\u0027s demise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals have functional circulatory and respiratory systems, which move oxygen and carbon dioxide into, out of, and throughout the body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext time: Ancient Kerbal History\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T01:26:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222508917\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131453\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460422192\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152665\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketSquid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n35 minutes ago, RocketSquid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EInfolude: Kerbal Biology and Prehistory:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour guess is as good as mine \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketSquid","CreatedById":152665,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T11:53:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222508976\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131453\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460424417\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269507\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Geschosskopf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour guess is as good as mine \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup.

Therefore, they decided to invent a reason not to relocate their dwellings. As a result, the concept of a city (from the Litan word \u0022citay\u0022, or group of kerbals\u0022) was invented. These cities had little in common with each other, besides holding a lot of kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, the kerbals figured out that things would get much easier if they worked together and split the jobs, as previously kerbals who were very good at building things had a bunch of houses that they couldn\u0027t do anything with, and kerbals who were very good at finding snacks often had to give up their homes to store all of the snacks. Soon, the cities grew grander and grander, with teams of dedicated archytects (from the Litan words \u0022Archy\u0022 and \u0022tecter\u0022 together meaning, \u0022Kerbal who is very good at making arches\u0022) building structures, kept fed by the snack-finders (A\u00A0 Litan word meaning \u0022Kerbal who finds snacks\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater, a clumsy snack-finder by the name of Farmin dropped some of his snack haul on a patch of dirt outside his house, only to find snack-plants growing there the next day. As he experimented more, he was able to determine which snacks could be planted, and which had seeds that they didn\u0027t eat. His experiments unlocked a new, more powerful way to get snacks. Now, the question of what to do with all of these snacks arose, especially how to distribute all of them. Some cities had it all placed in one central building, known as a \u0022restaurant\u0022, \u0022diner\u0022, or \u0022kafeteria\u0022, where snacks were stored and distributed. The first two later came to mean any place where snacks were sold, but the last one became the name of the system, \u0022kafeterinism\u0022. Other cities, on the other hand, decided that kerbals should be able to get snacks in exchange for things, such as houses or haircuts or fireworks. This system became known as \u0022kapitalism\u0022, from the Litan word \u0022Kapit\u0022, meaning \u0022Help my head is on fire\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd speaking of Litan, it was the official language of the Ronam empire, which came a bit later. Essentially, the leaders of one city, Ronam, decided that if kerbals were more productive in cities, then cities would be even more productive in city-cities. They also decided that \u0022city-city\u0022 just sounded dumb, and decided to call it an empire, from the Litan word \u0022Empier\u0022, or \u0022that which provides pie\u0022. Yes, they did derive it from a Litan word despite speaking Litan, as they had actually forgotten that during the meeting.

This was determined to be because of an eclipse, which happened every so often, but this one was seen as an omen, leading the cities to attempt to refound the Ronam Empire. Unfortunately, none of them really wanted to submit to Ronam again, so they decided, \u0022Why don\u0027t we just start our own empire?\u0022. All of them. At the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a brief (~4 day) period of conquest, some of the cities emerged victorious, with mini-empires known as \u0022nations\u0022. Some, such as Ussari, Kerima, Dachland, and Abvonovichatkaderivokistan still exist to this day, while others, such as Murp and Potatopolis, soon died off (Although many say that Potatopolis still exists somewhere, either under the ocean or in space, as it notably was built under a giant glass dome and destroyed by a volcano).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for a time, these nations fought. From the ashes of old nations, new nations arose, including the Untied States of Kelpogart, who, among other things, hated lace-up shoes and named their nation to reflect that. Sooner or later, things stabilized, and they stayed this way for about 70 years, which was quite a long time for the kerbals. During this time, the kerbals made many great new technological advances, including flushing toilets, lighting that didn\u0027t set everything on fire, electricity (which did set everything on fire, at least at first), and most importantly, the airplane. The airplane was originally invented by Orville and Wilbur Kerman, who, in an astonishingly successful attempt to win a contest, made a paper airplane big enough to ride on and strapped fireworks to the back. Predictably, it exploded, but not before filling their heads with wonderful ideas for ones that wouldn\u0027t. Soon, they made those ideas into reality. Unfortunately, the planes still were made of flammable materials, and propelled by fire. This would never do. They would need to make some sort of an \u0022engine\u0022 to hold the fire. They succeeded, only to find that fire can\u0027t propel them when it\u0027s contained. So next, they added a spinny thing to be spun by the fire and move air-wheels. Unfortunately, they soon realized that wheels need ground, but in a lucky accident involving a very bent air-wheel, they discovered that certain shapes make wind when spun. Eventually, they managed to discover aerodynamics despite general incompetence, and finally created something that sane kerbals would fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPredictably, this invention revolutionized warfare. Now, instead of fumbling to climb the walls, they could fly over. Additionally, the invention of the fire-spinny-thing allowed larger and larger ground vehicles, which previously had to be pushed. Obviously, this was also applied, rather haphazardly, to make a vehicle that would simply go \u003Cem\u003Ethrough\u003C/em\u003E walls. Soon, these new inventions would be applied in the greatest war known to kerb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-26T12:10:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2016 12:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RocketSquid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFinishing it\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketSquid","CreatedById":152665,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T12:21:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWOO!!

Eventually, the political situation in Yaltika devolved to name calling, pinching, and extreme noogieing.This, of course, led to war. Kerbin was divided, just as Yaltika was. Dachland and a number of countries came in on the side of West Yaltika, but most of Yaltika\u0027s neighbors came in on the side of East Yaltika.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, the now-major powers of Kerbin, Kelpogart, Gratniena, Ussari, and Abvonovichatkaderivokistan, were forced to join the fight, with the first two pretty much just trying to stop this whole stupid thing, and the last coming in with their allies in Dachland. Ussari, having made the decision to mostly ignore outside politics, elected to attack any combatants they could find with the traditional Ussari weapon, the wet towel. This proved stunningly effective, and if Ussari had elected to fight on any particular side they would have turned the tide. As it was they merely annoyed everyone, but surprisingly only into thinking that the Ussaris were fighting on the opposite side. The ridiculous truth only came to light later, when sullen, vaguely discomforted, and/or entirely unaffected veterans sat around fires and swapped stories, at which point it was realized just how strange Ussari foreign policy was. But I digress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, during the long, bloody conflict (Most of the blood is attributed to splinters, as kerbals consider fighting with sharp objects to be dishonorable, inhumane, and incredibly wasteful of sharp objects that could be better used in ridiculous accidents), the order of the world was changed. Rules were different, and territories were altered. Even the long-held kerbal tradition of not-killing-the-enemy was broken, albeit briefly and accidentally when Georgoff Kerman, in a particular feat of stupidity (even for him) managed to knock down a building with exactly one enemy in it (a fact completely unknown to Georgoff), thus medically \u0022killing\u0022 said enemy for nearly an hour!

This status meant that it would be treated as \u0022powerful\u0022, \u0022dangerous\u0022, and \u0022wealthy\u0022 regardless of whether they were actually any of those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerin was split into Gerin and Gerinia, primarily just because the winners though that it was getting too big and they didn\u0027t want to waste a split-power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDachland was made to pay 4000 snacks to the winners.

However, this new war would be quite different from the old one, thanks to several new innovations, including tanks, non-exploding planes, and most importantly, the rapid-fire potato gun. This revolutionized warfare, even more than all the previous warfare-revolutionizing inventions, as it allowed kerbals to actually knock other kerbals off of the wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis war was also even bloodier than the last one, due to the advent of military intelligence. This meant that the various militaries would be actually taking notes on each other, as opposed to the previous strategy of just trying really hard to remember.

As you can tell, they probably should\u0027ve hired better physicists. Their rockets did, in fact, work, but they generally just ended up sending them the wrong way, and almost all the rockets ended up crashing into the ocean or into other countries. This was very disappointing, since if they had wanted to destroy their enemies they wouldn\u0027t bother launching the rockets all the way into space first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Hanmattan project, named for the city of Hanmattan in Kelpogart, developed the first nuclear reactors and something that scientists called a \u0022nuclear firework\u0022. These proved to be quite fantastic for celebrations, assuming you could find a giant desert to launch them in.
