Worked pretty good, till I overloaded it... I was playing with an orbit strategy of getting to an almost polar orbit, filling the map, then going polar to finish. I did a lot of warping, and ran three sensors at the same time, and suddenly the map screen snowed out, went grey and the game eventually crashed. When I relaunched and tried to start over, I am stuck with the grey map... and my original map craft is still in orbit. Can I delete the database and resume mapping with my two birds?
