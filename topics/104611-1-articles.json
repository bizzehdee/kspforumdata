Like those mystery ruins on other planets. Once harvested, then you can use mass effect cores on ships, resources withstanding. Also, will need power generators, like big part reactors and things to run the big Mass Cores. Basically, more power consumption than ion engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to add that little bit of extra, you need to skim an upper atmosphere to discharge the drive core after using it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T20:19:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 08:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Blaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T08:35:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if you can have negative mass parts in KSP, because that would probably be easier than modifying all the masses of the connected parts.

While Mass Effect focuses on Commander Shepard, leaving the Normandy more as home base / fast travel vehicle, the lore fluff is that ships going interstellar have to discharge mass effect cores upon entering the system, usually at gas giants, which may also double as helium-3 refuel station locations or ramscooping passes (fusion torch drives). Mass effect cores build up static charge while in use at ftl speeds, and the charge has to be dispersed at a planet, or the buildup could jump into the ship\u0027s hull and cook it.
