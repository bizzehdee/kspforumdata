Rocket plumes look awesome. We also have a good working understanding of fuels and how rocket engines should look. That makes them easier to write than a fictional drive from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, when scifi spaceships (star wars and many more) use what appear to be rockets to go everywhere and back, it does not sit right with me as a sci-fi writer. Knowing full well that staging is always the way to go if using rockets. It is the only way to maximize fuel efficiency beyond weak ion rockets, by shedding extra rockets when they go empty. So as not to be lugging around extra mass which cuts into fuel reserves harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI finally came to a solution. If I did not use rockets at all it would make all the research I ever did on them seem pointless. So I included them, even though my scifi has \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E ships that can reach orbit using both oddly shaped choices (like saucers ) and practical ones ( long tube like a\u00A0passenger jet minus the wings).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRocket engines are used ONLY for leaving an atmosphere. But they are helped along by antigravity shielding which shields the ship from gravity, allowing it to float like a balloon in the air. With that assist, even saucer shaped ships are a viable means to escape the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn space itself, the ship uses a uniquely shaped space jet drive. Which uses vacuum as reaction mass, and space has plenty of that. For propulsion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFTL drives are easy by comparison and did not require nearly as much thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet what I enjoyed about ny solution is that it made space-mining resources more likely in my scifi setting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince if you plan on navigating inside an atmosphere you need rocket fuel. Also if you plan on leaving in a reasonable time (floating like a balloon with antigravity would take a good while).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet in space, the vacuum jets allow constant acceleration, and they are quite useful for travel to\u00A0asteroids and landing on airless moons. Also for orbital insertion near planets. Which means you will get fuel depots that ships can ressupply and be ressupplied rocket fuel from. In space and LEO of any atmospheric planet in frequent use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor that matter, with a long enough hose a ship could\u00A0suck up gas from a gas giant while\u00A0it slowly flies above the atmosphere in space with it\u0027s gravity blocking shield up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is my solution for the rocket issue in scifi.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is yours?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-25T03:41:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell some people just bite the bullet and accept long transfer times - going with already existing rocket technology (or future tech that isn\u0027t much better in terms of specific impulse but much improved in other aspects) and the consequences of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne interesting idea I had was to scale the whole thing down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike, for example: Star Wars takes place on and near multiple planets across a galaxy. But what if instead of that we made it take place in Jupiter\u0027s system of moons, along with man-made artificial structures (large habitats like O\u0027Neill Cylinders)? Normal rockets could be used, maybe nuclear thermal ones. Hydrogen for propellant is abundant, and if fusion tech is around so is fusion fuel. Solar power is still a possibility, but a larger area is required for the same power. Then there can be issues based around who controls what, like parts of the different moons and so on. Saturn\u0027s moon system could be interesting as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t have to be on a grand scale. If you scale it down enough, even rockets like we have today aren\u0027t necessary. For example, you could have a cluster of orbital habitats close together so that spacecraft with simple propulsion systems and low specific impulses could rapidly traverse the cluster. If the cluster is, say, 24 thousand miles across, then it would take less than 42 hours to traverse at relative velocities similar to your average airliner today. Total delta-V would be less than 1km/s (I\u0027m assuming that since the orbit of such a cluster would be pretty large that everything is basically stationary in space relative to each other, of course orbital drift would need to be accounted for and station-keeping would be necessary, but with enough energy that shouldn\u0027t be an issue). And that 42 hours is a worst case scenario, most trips would be much shorter. Combat spacecraft in such an environment would be interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically I think that if you have to have FTL in your sci-fi story , it may be worth it to scale it down. I try to keep stuff like FTL out of my work unless it\u0027s possible in general relativity, and even then it\u0027s usually stuff that requires a civilization that\u0027s already interstellar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-25T04:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve really enjoyed Andy Weirs approach to hard-boiled sci-fi, just adhering as closely as possible to the most technologically and economically likely\u00A0approaches and dealing with the social and emotional outcomes.
