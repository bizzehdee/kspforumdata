For further information, I have tried performing the transfers with Mechjeb with no success and I have tried performing them manually, according to phase angles given by the ksp.olex.biz calculator, with the same results (crash and burn). I\u0027m not sure what I am doing wrong because, like I have mentioned, I have performed this same burn a dozen times with no problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is probably a simple explanation for this, but I have given up at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-29T04:49:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2014 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dill\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T20:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess the simplest explanation is tht you are mistakenly burning retrograde instead of prograde, but I don\u0027t imagine MJ would make that mistake.

When I reach Kerbin orbit, I am left with half an orange tank (w/Mainsail) followed by two nuclear engines on a smaller tank. The original interplanetary burn is calculated to be one minute long by the maneuver node system, but Mechjeb was burning five minutes before the node. I think Mechjeb factored in the extra burn time required for using the nukes (after the Mainsail stage has been dumped); thus, burning too early.

A couple of possible workarounds:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Start from a higher parking orbit, that will give more leeway for a dropping periapsis and the slower orbital speed means the burn will be completed closer to the actual node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Break the burn up into two or more nodes. This is efficient but can require a bit of planning to make the final burn happen at the right time to hit the transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Instead of burning in the maneuver node\u0027s direction, burn prograde instead. The periapsis won\u0027t fall at all, but the resultant orbit will be slightly different than the one predicted by the node, it is likely a bigger correction burn will be required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rework your ship to have a higher TWR.

However, there\u0027s another possibility, although it may not apply to you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a probe core (or manned core) mounted upside down by accident, then your ship will be thrusting in the opposite direction.

I accidentally mounted a probe core upside down. The cores can be tricky to determine which way should be facing up. To avoid this, I try to limit how much I rotate cores when placing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I\u0027ve docked two ships together prior to a burn, and selected the incorrect side of the ship to control from. (Or just forgot to even check which core was controlling the ship.

So again, while the core in use was pointed prograde, the engines in use were pointing retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mention this because it\u0027s very surprising that a prograde burn would cause you dip low enough into the atmosphere to crash, if you start from a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T06:30:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RexKramer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RexKramer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mention this because it\u0027s very surprising that a prograde burn would cause you dip low enough into the atmosphere to crash, if you start from a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s because it\u0027s not a prograde burn throughout the entire burn. Strictly speaking it\u0027s only prograde at the moment you reach periapsis. And you don\u0027t start at periapsis, you start a bit early. The lower the TWR of the rocket, the earlier you have to start. And that can and will lower your periapsis if you start too early.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there\u0027s a point where when your TWR is too low to complete a high delta-V burn in a timely fashion that you have to break it up.

Interplanetary burn takes minutes if you have typical TWR and it is started minutes before periapsis. Then burn pushes you to lower altitude and if you are too low, you fall back to atmosphere. It is good idea to start interplanetary burns from higher orbits. It takes little (or not so little but boosters are cheap) larger boosters, but give more accurate results. Even if you do not fall to atmosphere you turn larger angle around Kerbin during burn which gives more error compared to predicted instantaneous impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther possibility is to program helper software which calculates burns as finite long prograde burns. I have thought it but it takes time and it is easy to achieve enough accuracy from higher orbit. 300 km is good if you have TWR about 0.25-0.35.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ace Eman","CreatedById":136396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T00:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI guess the simplest explanation is tht you are mistakenly burning retrograde instead of prograde, but I don\u0027t imagine MJ would make that mistake.
