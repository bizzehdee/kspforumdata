The same landing produced a 87.8% (-10.2%) recovery factor with a 100% transponder fitting commitment. From this data, it appears the game is calculating the transponder recovery boost by reducing a 90% capacity instead of the 100% maximum capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- From what I can extrapolate, landing 372.4 km (screenshot below) without the strategy would produce a factor of about 81.9%. The same landing with the transponder strategy produced a factor of 75.6% (-6.3%). In this scenario, a 15% increase from 81.9% would result in a factor of 96.9%, but the game corrects for the \u0026gt;90% result by subtracting about 6% from the \u003Cstrong\u003Einitial \u003C/strong\u003Efactor instead of either adding 8.1% (15 - 6.9) or by subtracting 6.9% from the \u003Cstrong\u003Efinal\u003C/strong\u003E recovery factor to stop at 90%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Landing back at KSC with the strategy enabled didn\u0027t affect the recovery factor even when that factor is slightly less than 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Images Link: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=438240005\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=438240005\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T13:08:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 01:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Barking Sands\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T12:54:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually deliberate, the transponder strategy is intended to increase recovery bonuses when far from the KSC, but the penalty is that recovery near the KSC is reduced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barking Sands","CreatedById":143433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T13:06:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was worried about that; thank you for the quick reply.

There\u0027s been a long-standing combat aviation program called DART (Downed Aircraft Recovery Teams); perhaps Squad (or somebody who knows how to add modded contracts) could add in a new DART strategy that either compliments the Recovery Transponder Fitting or replaces it entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could compliment the RTF strategy by adding a DART strategy which increases recovery factors within a 250 km radius of the KSC, but adds a cost to reputation on recoveries farther away to simulate diplomatic complications due to international borders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could replace the RTF strategy with a DART strategy that does literally the opposite of transponder fittings: instead of smoothing out a gradient of recovery factors across the globe, increase that gradient with higher recovery factors within a range of the KSC and lower factors farther away -- this actually rewards players who take the time and effort to plan their deorbit burns to maximize recovery factors and penalizes them when they\u0027re too far off target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current RTF commitment feels more like a penalty for doing a proper deorbit plan, not to mention it\u0027s earned back a negative amount of funds after the 550k I wasted incorporating it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E Went back to the save file and refunded my costs of recovery since it was nice enough to give me the percentage value.

I would love to see a strategy that is exactly the opposite of what the RTF commitment does: increase recovery rate gradient more than the default so that there is a higher percentage recovery factor over a slightly larger area near the KSC, and then it drops off much more rapidly to penalize you when you plop down vessels on other continents, poles, or far-side oceans.
