The stearwing alone is massive and 105 parts, even if you did get this to work the part count would be insane, way too high for my pc. Maybe one of the requirements at a time, but all at the same time would be incredibly difficult if not impossible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T19:20:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BlueCanary**"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T19:50:29Z","Content":"Yeah I did it myself with something like enterelysium\u0027s aircraft carrier\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI scaled it down as you can see"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T20:49:02Z","Content":"Cool, it wasn\u0027t so much the weight as the bulk of the a300 I was worried about, it would have put the part count way too high for me to even try. \n\nNow, time to figure out how 1.0.2 boats work for my entry."},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T16:12:44Z","Content":"I had to change the rules cause now you can say u breakable joints and no crash damage and hack gravity until you get in the water\n\nAnd about the stearwing not crashing the game is cuz I tried this on my friends(sorry but I have to brag) supercomputer which has 32gb ram and the game runs 60 fps even when his minecraft server is running so when he shut the server down his pc could handle a 400 part ship crashing into the ground.
