But there\u0027s a nice workaround to let the time run up to 20 times faster. As this could cause crashes I\u0027ll post it here as a spoiler... \n\n\u003E \n\u003E First, you need a tool named Cheat Engine available at \n\u003E [http://www.cheatengine.org/](http://www.cheatengine.org/).\n\u003E After Installation, start Cheat Engine and KSP.\n\u003E \n\u003E Go to Cheat Engine and press the button in the top left corner (\u0027Select a process to open\u0027) (Be careful, strange things may happen if you do this with an important system process). Find KSP and press \u0027Open\u0027.\n\u003E \n\u003E Now check the box \u0027Enable Speedhack\u0027 on the right side of the window. Enter a number from 1 to 20 and press \u0027Apply\u0027.

I would be very careful with it. If you do multiplayer gaming don\u0027t forget to shut it down first."}]}
