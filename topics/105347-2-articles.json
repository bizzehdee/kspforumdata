And they should be. There is a reason normal turbojets can\u0027t fly to space, Skylons SABREs are one of the promising technologies that might be able to. What we need is scramjets to give some variety.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T10:24:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 10:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Teutooni\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KAP1985","CreatedById":140692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T10:36:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI basicly built a Space Shuttle, slapped a couple SRBs on, and would have, if it wasn\u0027t for it being unstable, I will try again when I have time\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Secuas","CreatedById":126000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T10:39:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis my SSTO I made in KSP 0.90.
