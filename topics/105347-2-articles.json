I just put a giant heat shield on the front of a super skinny \u0022plane\u0022. Then I ramped up the rapier on the rear to full. Of course, the 3.75m heat shield on the nose made it pretty slow at first, limiting me to 300 m/s in lower atmo. It occluded everything else behind it though, including the \u0022wings\u0022. What was just silly was that once I cleared roughly 10,000m the rapier got me up to 700 m/s.. and everything behind the heat shield started exploding at 20,000m.. as the atmo was dropping off, and without the heat shield getting \u0022used up\u0022 at all. This whole system just seems totally wonky."},{"CreatedByName":"Fuzzy Dunlop","CreatedById":27329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T01:08:48Z","Content":"Guys I think I have few tips for when you\u0027re doing re-entry:\n\nFirstly, 10-20 km is kind of a Death Zone, if you are doing anything like orbital speed in this region you\u0027re toast.\n\nThat means you need to slow down as much as possible high in the atmosphere. Drag is now your best friend. On the other hand, if you have a needle-like dart then it\u0027s going to cut straight through the upper atmosphere and then melt lower down.\n\nWith the new areodynamics most planes have very low drag when flying absolutley nose fowards. So don\u0027t. Point your nose as far away from prograde as possible. Nose up is best since you can generate a fair bit of lift which keeps you higher for longer (I think proper skip re-entries are now possible). S-turns can also be used.\n\nLastly I\u0027ve not tried the airbrakes during re-entry but I gather some people are having great results."},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T01:28:18Z","Content":"Re-entry is easy. Getting up there is the problem. Many of the parts melt far too easily in the regions and speeds that spaceplanes normally operate at.

They are very powerful and make the decent a lot easier, (although you may short fall of the KSC even more now).\n\u003E Yeah, rapiers seem easier to use to get a spaceplane into orbit than turbojets but even so it\u0027s a struggle to get up to 1300 m/s with them. Perhaps that just means you have to carry a lot more fuel/oxidiser to get you that extra 1100 m/s for orbital speed. That means a lot of designs are no longer going to be viable?\n\nThe big shuttle wings can store extra liquid fuel. Lots of it. Way too much lift for a Mk2, though."},{"CreatedByName":"sumrex","CreatedById":103753,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:00:44Z","Content":"If they would fix ascent blowing up the NCS nosecone adapter or the crew cabin itself my disposition would be better.
