A picture would really help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like you don\u0027t have enough forward pitch authority, basically you are trying to pitch your entire aircraft with just your rear control surfaces. I suspect this is why you get going at a good speed (Probably about mach .5 on the runway) and when you pitch up your wings get torn off due to a rapid change in angle of attack resulting in a large dynamic pressure on the bottom of your wings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as making aircraft less repsonsive if you hit CAPS LOCK it will turn on fine tune mode, which will dampen keyboard inputs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the CoL being behind CoL that relationship really doesn\u0027t matter too much as long as they are not too far apart. While it\u0027s generally not a good idea to have the CoM behind the CoL it is acceptable within certain margins. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal aircraft have flaps that change the wing shape and increase lift, allowing them to take off at lower speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, while \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis tutoria\u003C/a\u003El isn\u0027t optimized for far, the basic principles are there.

Place your rear landing gear further forward, because what\u0027s probably happening is that when you try to pitch up with that gear on the runway, you\u0027re fighting against a strong lever arm due to gear placement and the plane doesn\u0027t lift. Then, when you go off the end, the runway is removed from underneath, and your violent pitching up causes the plane to tear itself apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an aside, the plane you have now is going to want to yaw all over the place in the air, and it\u0027s only going to get worse as you go faster.

Your CoM/CoL relationship si too far off, slide your rear wings forward a bit to get them closer. You also have way too much yaw authority (Which is probably why it appears that your CoL is off center, which will cause roll issues) I would use the AV-R8 winglets as rudders personally. I would also break up that one large control surface in the rear of your aircraft into two smaller ones. One set of elevons (That control both pitch and roll) and another set of elevators (that control just pitch) I also agree with Jvus in that your pitching problems sound more like misplaced landing gear than control authority issues. The wheel of the gear should be just behind the CoM, if your aircraft wants to pitch tail up on the runway as soon as it loads move them back just a bit, if you cant get off the runway with them moved back consider adding a tail wheel or tail strike (an I-Beam or Girder under the tail of your aircraft)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T19:20:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your plane has too much pitch-up, right-click on the control surface and turn down the \u0022Control Deflection\u0022 a bit.

You should probably just get rid of the two side fins, they\u0027re too close to your COM. Or at least move them back more. The middle one looks good, but could use a larger control surface if you decide to get rid of the side ones.

They are generally inline or near the CoL for the craft, this is to keep them from acting like a leaver and tilting the nose down, this way they create a longer wing area which generates more lift at lower speeds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ailerons and Elevators are different all together. Ailerons are the things at the ends of the wings that control the roll of the craft. Elevators are the things at the end of the aircraft that control pitch. The rudder controls yaw and canards control nose pitch and sometimes roll. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest thing to look at in FAR with designing an aircraft is to look at the CoL vs CoM. If the CoL is to far behind the CoM the craft will act nose heavy, if it is to close it will be \u0022twitchy\u0022. And if it is infront the craft will be uncontrollable in game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding gear placement is the next big thing. You want your rear most gear near your CoL point this is the point of rotation for the aircraft. This way when you take off you rotate around that point. If that is to far back then you could place them just behind your CoM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I see with that craft isnt you need more rudders or larger tail planes, it is you dont have enough real stability in the yaw catagory. It isn\u0027t bad the craft is otherwise pretty good. The tool you displayed is set at altitude of sea level and .35 mach which is about take off speed or landing speed. Which means your craft will have a very minor yaw issue at low speeds and low altitudes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only otherthing I see wrong with it is your CoL is way to far behind your CoM. You should have it a fair bit closer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jLOGWfl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jLOGWfl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
