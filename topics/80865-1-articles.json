Once you\u0027re in Target mode, you can burn in the retrograde direction (the closed yellow marker on the Navball) to slow down relative to your target so you can fly your way over. It\u0027s not the most efficient way to do it, but it\u0027s the way I\u0027d recommend to a beginner at docking until you get a better feel for how performing certain burns in certain directions can affect your velocity vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile you\u0027re at it, feel free to check out some of the Rendezvous and Docking tutorials I\u0027ve listed in the Drawing Board, which is conveniently linked in my signature.
