I\u0027d like it if Squad would have their customers be given the ability to download the previous paid versions, i.e. 0.14 and onwards. And it\u0027s not like that would be very expensive to host, plus Squad has plenty of revenue to fund that. And there is a way to give people the ability to access older versions of games on Steam, too. I really would like to see this happen, because I don\u0027t want to do questionable things to get my hands on old versions(plus some are straight up nowhere to be found).

Sure, keeping 1.05 around won\u0027t make sense at first, but what happens when we hit KSP 3.0 and it has GPS satelites and communications relays and a few other features that add complexity to the game, but someone just wants to fire off some rockets without all that extra stuff. They either complicate your initial game setup by including all these options, or they just agree to curate KSP 1.0 (or whichever one is most stable but close as possible to 1.0, 1.1 will be a different engine so I would assume that disqualifies it) then people can always go back and play the older versions.
