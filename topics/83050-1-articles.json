My goal next is to start running through the motions of establishing some self sufficiency, and moving my focus on not what I can get into space, but what I can actually do once I am in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo physically what I\u0027m thinking is maybe a simple refueling station around kerbin, maybe an LKO karbonite scooper to get some resources flowing for minor needs, like keeping a few starter RCS tugs fueled and operating. Then perhaps reaching out to the Mun to make my first real attempt at drilling, and perhaps set up a surface settlement. Although, I may drop the OKS/MKS mod, for the sake of not killing kerbals by forgetting to pack extra bags of chips.

At least when I build them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) why do I feel building something like this is necessary in the first place? I can understand orbital construction when it comes to interplanetary trips, but all this just so I can launch a vessel up empty and fuel it up in LKO? Of course I love the thought of self sufficiency and the tedious efforts that are somehow entertaining, but I am finding my patience with all this (and my limited hardware issue) is leaving me to grind my teeth and build more things into single launches.

Say you\u0027ve sent up a vessel dry to a 150km orbit, before circularizing you transfer the last remnants of fuel from the booster before decoupling that and let it de-orbit by itself. With your vessel now at 150km orbit and having enough fuel to let you have around 200dV to play with, all you need is plot a course to intercept your fuel-depot which is up at 250km. Unless you really timed your launch, that means doing a few laps around Kerbin before an economic (less than 80dV) window opens. Being above 140km means more time-compression available. So rather than wait several minutes staring at your vessel going round and round at 100x, you\u0027ll spend a minute or less at 1000x.

Easy to read, easy to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For assembling big parts my approach is to use the last stage of the booster with some RCS thrusters bolted onto it. So if say my part weighs 20Tons, I use the 40Ton booster - not the 20Ton booster. That way the last stage got enough fuel to get to where the part is supposed to go, even transfer over some fuel when done bolting it onto the Station or Big-Ship, and have enough fuel to de-orbit the stage. For smaller parts I tend to use an SSTO plus a small RCS tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Getting big heavy stuff to orbit cost a ton in career, so building an infrastructure that can support new missions and vessels for virtually free will greatly stretch your budget.
