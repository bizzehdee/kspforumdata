That\u0027s pretty unusual around here (not that it\u0027s helped you any). Although I do thank you for actually posting logs. My first thought is that it looks like you are running out of memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EError occurred at 2015-02-20_053828.\u003Cbr\u003ED:\\Games\\KSP_win\\KSP.exe, run by Robert.\u003Cbr\u003E[COLOR=\u0022#B22222\u0022]98% memory in use.\u003Cbr\u003E3996 MB physical memory [66 MB free].[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E0 MB paging file [0 MB free].\u003Cbr\u003E0 MB user address space [2461 MB free].\u003Cbr\u003ERead from location 00000000 caused an access violation.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP uses a lot of memory at times, and it does a huge memory grab right at the Main Menu (when everything is fully starting up, and it pulls textures). A few things you can try... Also, I recommend starting KSP from KSP.exe or a shortcut to KSP.exe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make sure you have all other programs closed, as much as possible anyway, to free up memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Either delete your settings.cfg to reset to default graphics options, or edit settings.cfg and find the TEXTURE_QUALITY line. Change it to \u0022TEXTURE_QUALITY = 1\u0022 (or even 2 or 3).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make a shortcut to KSP.exe, and add the -force-open-gl (this may reduce memory requirements, but at the risk of corrupted graphics)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m not sure if you are using any mods. If you are, you might want to remove them and get the game running first. Then add them back a few at a time and keep an eye on your memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully that helps, and again, sorry for the zero replies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
