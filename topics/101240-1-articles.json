Make sure your RCS thrusters are symmetricly placed on opposite sides of your CoM. When docking two vessels, it\u0027s usually easiest to control it from the smaller of the two. Also, make sure you select \u0022control from here\u0022 on your docking port before you start and select the docking port on the other vessel as your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, there is a difference between not having enough thruster power and not having them in the right locations.
