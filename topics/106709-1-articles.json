They only hold power at about 1/3 throttle and it wavers up and down. It also cuts out randomly then cuts back in. I have electric charge. It happens to mechjeb as well.\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxxPower","CreatedById":63117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:28:52Z","Content":"Jet engines or rocket engines?\n\nJet engines require a certain amount of intake air, or they will cut out.

Remember the aero dynamics have changed since mech jeb was designed originally. By turning your rocket you are increasing drag which in turn limits how fast the rocket can move, also know as terminal velocity. \n\nI not sure it\u0027s a bug in mech jeb, I just think its something you can\u0027t really utilize anymore with the improve aerodynamics. Drag was more or less constant before the update from what I\u0027ve been able to figure out.\n\nTest it out. Turn on sas and don\u0027t change direction while you have limit terminal velocity on. Then turn the rocket a bit, you should see the throttle drop. I\u0027ve seen it bottom out entirely when I\u0027ve turned too much spreading drag across the long axis of the rocket."}]}
