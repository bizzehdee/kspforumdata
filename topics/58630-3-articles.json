KSP deserves much more than being a glorified disaster simulator where rockets falling apart and crews being killed is the prime entertainment and the only expected result. The achievements of players who strive to be successful, who create beautiful, well-engineered, reliable designs, should never be devalued, and the opinion that going to space is impossibly hard deserves to be crushed and disproved over and over again. Kerbals are capable engineers and it\u0027s up to the player to utilize their technology well.\u003Cp\u003EThis same mindset is harming the game in many other areas as well.

I see your point here, but to be honest - the problem are not the joints per se, to my mind. Most problems arise from large-small-large diameter constructions (in \u0027real world\u0027 there would be a load bearing hull-structure). This is one example, where i see no other way than simulating this structure with struts (this is btw. the reason I see use of the poodle-engine - she saves me often from running into strutting-out-issues).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther Problems are just construction-issues. Large things wobble; especially with the forces we are talking about. This not really a game-issue, you can see the same IRL with bridges, towers, sky-scrapers, planes and lot of other stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo badly the editor has no information-display concerning lateral forces, maximum loads, and the like. And concerning vertical load something like max-g load (one has to find out about these things, and guessing future constructions). Especially the Mainsail is a beast here, throttle-down is a must if you don\u0027t want to go crazy with strutting. Again, this very real-life-esque. Shuttle e.g. had a max-load around 3g, IIRC. And there was lot of throttle up/down during ascend (to around the lowest setting of about 2/3). And guess what: since i follow similar regimes, my rockets started to be a lot more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMainsail liquid boosters are an example where i say yes to struts (as a rule of thumb i use 2 per booster in a V-shape for taking the load at the bottom).

I think part of the problem is that KSP rockets look OK in the editor when you snap them together, so people think they will work just like they look.
