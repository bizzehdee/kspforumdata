He survived, and for the next 1/2 hour I played with my idea, trying to get lower and lower with Jeb still outside and bring him back inside the ship before he ploughed into the ground. So the challenge is; how low can you go outside of the capsule while reentering (with the kerbal alive afterwards)? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So the rules are: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1: the only craft allowed is the Kerbal X rocket so that the crafts air ressistance is equal for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2: the challenge entry must have a screenshot of ascending, kerbal(s) exiting the craft, the craft dropping below 70km, Kerbal(s) reentering the craft (at any height below 70km to be valid), and the craft landing with Kerbal(s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3: no cheats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4: no use of parachutes allowed. Its freefalling all the way. But you can activate parachutes when the kerbal(s) get inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe score is judged by how far you go before getting into your ship and how many kerbals are outside (and survive). So 1km = 1Point, and 1 kerbal outside = 1 X (amount of points). For example; I managed to go down as far as 39km with 2 kerbals on EVA. Then I got into my ship and flew both down safely. So 70-39=31. And 31X2=62. I got 62points. And I landed all kerbals safely so those points are valid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E i wish you guys luck.
