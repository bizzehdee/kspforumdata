So I have started working through the problems. I want to have precise throttle control as well as control over all three axis without having to adjust my hands to much. Also have dedicated buttons and switches for stage sep, navigation selection, engine start/stop, nav ball heading selection, and a stepped knob for time warp. I was also thing about either a small high res screen with its own nav ball or with a few info screen selection like fuel, Nav info, burn timer etc. But this is something I\u2019ve had knocking around in my head. What are your guys thoughts on a specific controller for ksp?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thundy","CreatedById":208895,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-04T10:43:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been thinking about the same.

I\u2019m currently working on a drawing of it but I also plan to make a cardboard moc up. But it would be a small box roughly the size of a loaf of bread with two limited rotation knobs (4.5in diameter) on either side with 5 buttons on the box its self just in front of the knobs to prevent accidentally pressing one during course corrections. Now to adjust from pitch roll and yaw command a button would be mapped to change input. For the throttle it\u2019s going to be just above the left hand with a pull and push tab mounted at 0 and 100% that way you can have precise control of throttle position with one had with out having to brace with the other hand or forearm. The board I\u2019m thinking raspberry pi but it depends on how they set up the control interface on ksp2 if there isn\u2019t a command sensitivity adjustment then this is and Exercise in futility.

You can account for most differences in software and it\u0027s really more about what you can get better parts for. Buttons and switches are trivial, of course, as each version of Pi comes with plenty of digital IO pins. Alternatively, if you want a LOT of buttons/switches, you can look up how NES/SNES controllers used a shift register to very easily generate a serial interface. All of the buttons on these controllers were read with just 4 wires. Likewise, if you want to have a bunch of RGB LEDs, I strongly recommend using something like WS2811 drivers. You can even purchase them with LEDs already in the package, and you can string any number of them and control them from Pi using just one IO pin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I\u0027m sure the game will support controllers. So your best bet would be to simply use one of existing libraries for Pi to make your PC recognize it as a standard game controller. Which means you\u0027ll be able to send in any of your axis inputs as numbers in [-1, 1] range, plus any buttons as [0, 1] presses. If you do that, you can remap your analog sticks/dials/tabs inputs to that range in any way you want, including adding sensitivity curves, defining dead zones, changing these mappings dynamically, etc. Basically, once you get it into software, I don\u0027t foresee any serious problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get some of the additional functionality, like if you want to have lights that change with game state, you\u0027ll probably have to write\u00A0 a mod. That might be easier or harder depending on what sort of modding tools we get with the game, but technically speaking, it\u0027s a Unity game, so there are known ways to inject a custom DLL and it\u0027d just take some tinkering to find the data you need. So things like gear up/down lights, staging information, and possibly even data for artificial horizon if you want to add a display, should be possible to acquire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut like I said, it\u0027s a project. Be prepared to sink a TON of time into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thundy","CreatedById":208895,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-05T09:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224086787\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206739\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221644021624\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you\u0027ll get better mileage out of using flight sim parts. ...
