Copy sync.cfg.example to \u003Cksp\u003E/Plugins as well, change it so that it contains \u003C/ksp\u003E\u003C/ksp\u003E*only* the directory you want to sync your saves with and rename it to sync.cfg.\n\n**How it works**\n\nWhen the main menu loads, all saves will be copied from the sync directory to the KSP save directory. Any time the game saves, all save data will be copied back from the KSP save directory to the sync directory.\n\nThis can be useful for using Google Drive, Dropbox, MEGAsync or other programs to keep your saves in the cloud.\n\n**Compiling**\n\n- Load the solution in Visual Studio 2013 or higher\n- Add references to Assembly-CSharp.dll and UnityEngine.dll (can be found in\u003Cksp\u003E/KSP_Data/Managed directory)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/ksp\u003E\n- Voila! It should now compile fine\n\nRefer to usage on how to use\n\n**Contributing**\n\nIf you have any suggestions on how to make this better feel free to open an issue or create a pull request"}]}
