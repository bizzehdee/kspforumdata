If you\u0027re like me, the first thing you\u0027re probably asking yourself is: where are the air intakes?! The science for the pair of SABRE engines strapped to either side seems to defy Kerbal logic, mainly because it has a problem with overheating when it\u0027s going at Mach 5 at 28 km above the earth. Apparently air gets kind of hot when you\u0027re brushing past it at five thousand plus km per hour... who knew? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd at those speeds it\u0027s really more important to cool the air down enough for it to be used than it is to get more air into the hybrid rocket/jet engine. Basically there are a series of heat sinks sitting next to some pipes all full of liquid helium. The air passing into the engine goes from somewhere around \u0022OW! Damn it that\u0027s hot!\u0022 to \u0022OW damn it that\u0027s cold!\u0022 (or 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit to about minus 238 for those who don\u0027t speak Angry-Man-anese) Once the air is cooled, it gets sucked into a turbo compressor, mixed with liquid hydrogen and then set on fire... And by that I mean it acts like a regular rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the Skylon gets to it\u0027s max air breathing altitude of some 28,000 meters above the earth it shuts the air intake and switches to a reserve of liquid oxygen kept on the spacecraft. This supped up hybrid engine, the SABRE, is one of those ground breaking type things that could actually make traveling to the other side of the planet a four hour trip, or cut the cost of putting a satellite into low orbit by a factor of ten. Now that\u0027s all well and good, but I have only one thing that I can think of after reading these articles: \u0022I want one!\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatcha think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELINKS! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESABRE: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_(rocket_engine)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_(rocket_engine)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkylon: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_(spacecraft)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_(spacecraft)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the SABRE looks like inside and out: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/82/Sabre-model.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Sabre-model.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I got most of this info from the great and mighty wiki, and the rest from Popular Science... thought I should mention that)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T14:09:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, saw this on Popular Science.

They\u0027re using a near-future-\u0022realistic\u0022 SSTO with scramjet engines to do speed runs from Kennedy Space Center to Ascension Island off the coast of Africa, which is a total distance of 8,200 km. The best times are around 17 minutes from wheels up to full stop, which is incredible if you think about it because it requires an \u003Cem\u003Eaverage\u003C/em\u003E speed of 8 km/s, which is orbital speed. In fact, the best pilots are getting up to 15 km/s (which is greater than escape velocity for the Earth at the altitudes they\u0027re flying) and using the attitude of the craft in the wispy upper atmosphere to keep their trajectory curved around the Earth. The XR2 (the spacecraft being used) accurately models the effect of G forces and heating and dynamic pressure, so these are survivable trajectories. And it has a default Isp of about 4000s, which is only about twice what the wikipedia says may be possible with SABRE engines. Imagine getting from LA to London (about 8700 km) in less time than it takes for your current morning commute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T14:48:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve actually got really high hopes for the Skylon project - they\u0027re currently the only ones, as far as I\u0027m aware, with a halfway feasible plan for a reusable SSTO.
