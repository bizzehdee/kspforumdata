I wanted to make a relatively straightforward demonstration that incorporated all the USI-LS concepts but without using any UKS parts (to keep it simple for new users). So this new document is on the (otherwise empty) USI-LS wiki.\n\u003E \n\nPocketBrotector, I just wanted to say how much I appreciate this. I\u0027ve wanted to get into USI-LS for quite some time, but UKS isn\u0027t quite my style... And it\u0027s incredibly difficult to find information JUST pertaining to USI-LS. Your example helped me to wrap my mind around it perfectly.\n\nI think I spotted a math error... Under \u0022Converters\u0022 you calculated the amount of fertilizer (2.385t) based on the total mass calculated in the previous section (20.267t). But if I\u0027m not mistaken, you should have only used 16.767t for the calculation. It seems like you included the mass of the lab in the fertilizer calculation.\n\nA few questions, if you or someone else doesn\u0027t mind... Well... a lot of questions:\n\n1) If converters are turned on, do they constantly consume EC? Or only when they are actively converting Mulch? In other words, if you have no Mulch or Fertilizer available, do they still consume EC when on?\n\n2) Is Mulch stored somewhere? Or is it just a \u0022ficticious\u0022 resource that instantly disappears unless you have a Converter on?\n\n3) How do Kerbals work when on EVA? I assume they consume at the normal rate and don\u0027t get the Recycler bonus? And I assume that all Mulch is lost? How does EC work? Do they take Supplies and/or EC from the ship, or do they simply not need/use supplies when out and about?\n\n4) It sounds like the Lab is the only stock part changed by USI-LS. Is this correct? I saw your configs for other stock and mod parts. Will these work smoothly with just USI-LS? Seems like they might have some MKS things included, which I figure I would prefer to remove from them before using.\n\n5) Do ALL seats provide 1 kerbal month of habitation? Or just Hitchhiker seats?\n\n6) How does Habitation work for a relatively permanent base? Assuming USI-LS only, no MKS. Does going on EVA reset them or something? Do you have to rotate in fresh Kerbals?\n\n7) It looks like the other Converter doesn\u0027t require fertilizer? It just let\u0027s you redeem half your Mulch for Supplies?\n\n8) Are the numbers/rates for all of these parts posted somewhere? Not seeing it all in the game, unless I\u0027m missing something.\n\n9) Parts... There are three in-line Supplies tanks, side-mounted tanks for Supplies, Mulch, and Fertilizer. And there\u0027s the two Nom-O-Matic converters. Then the Lab, the Hitchhiker, and the Cupola have been modified. Any other new parts or changes to stock parts?"},{"CreatedByName":"PocketBrotector","CreatedById":135814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T22:51:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 minutes ago, jofwu said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E PocketBrotector, I just wanted to say how much I appreciate this.

Or only when they are actively converting Mulch? In other words, if you have no Mulch or Fertilizer available, do they still consume EC when on?\n\u003E \n\nI believe that recyclers consume EC constantly, but converters should not consume EC unless they have all the necessary input resources - like how an ISRU converter shouldn\u0027t consume electricity when there\u0027s no Ore.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 minutes ago, jofwu said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2) Is Mulch stored somewhere? Or is it just a \u0022ficticious\u0022 resource that instantly disappears unless you have a Converter on?\n\u003E \n\nMulch is stored like any other resource. There\u0027s a little bit of Mulch storage in each of the inline canisters for Supplies, and there\u0027s a dedicated Mulch radial pack. (If you really need to store a whole lot of life support resources, UKS has an inflatable storage module that can store an enormous amount of Supplies, Fertilizer, and Mulch.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 23 minutes ago, jofwu said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3) How do Kerbals work when on EVA?

Do they take Supplies and/or EC from the ship, or do they simply not need/use supplies when out and about?\n\u003E \n\nEVA kerbals don\u0027t have access to Supplies or EC, I believe - they instead get an \u0022EVA timer\u0022 (six hours by default), and if that runs out they suffer the \u0022EVAEffects\u0022 specified in the settings config (they turn into tourists by default).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 26 minutes ago, jofwu said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4) It sounds like the Lab is the only stock part changed by USI-LS. Is this correct? I saw your configs for other stock and mod parts. Will these work smoothly with just USI-LS? Seems like they might have some MKS things included, which I figure I would prefer to remove from them before using.\n\u003E \n\nThe Lab gets the recycler, the Hitchhiker Can gets habitat space, and the Cupola gets the habitat multiplier - those are all of the modifications to stock parts. The configs that I made should work fine with just USI-LS. Additional disclaimer here, though - I made them mostly for personal use, so while they are mostly balanced conservatively using the guidelines in LSModule.cfg, folks might disagree with a few of the judgment calls I made (e.g. including recyclers in certain command pods.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 31 minutes ago, jofwu said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5) Do ALL seats provide 1 kerbal month of habitation? Or just Hitchhiker seats?\n\u003E \n\nEach seat on a vessel effectively provides one kerbal-month (thirty kerbal-days) of habitation. The hitchhiker can (and other parts, if you\u0027re using UKS or additional configs) provide additional kerbal-months. Then hab multipliers (e.g. cupola) are applied.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 33 minutes ago, jofwu said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6) How does Habitation work for a relatively permanent base? Assuming USI-LS only, no MKS. Does going on EVA reset them or something? Do you have to rotate in fresh Kerbals?\n\u003E \n\nYou\u0027ll need to rotate crews out periodically. Probably not a big issue for a station around Minmus, but you\u0027ll want a Duna base to have enough hab time to last between transfer windows, for example.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 37 minutes ago, jofwu said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7) It looks like the other Converter doesn\u0027t require fertilizer?

You can check the per-vessel numbers in the life support window, either in the editor or in flight, to see your current status and an estimate or remaining time.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 41 minutes ago, jofwu said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9) Parts...
