It was only because I was tinking with the textures that it caught my eye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first reaction was that I\u0027d screwed up something in making my changes, but I confirmed this wasn\u0027t the case, by first removing all the none stock textures. This gave the same result (dark back of the hands), so not an error I\u0027d introduced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then checked this on different planets (didn\u0027t make any sense, but did it just in case) and found the result was the same, the hands were lit wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also had a look at this in v1.2 and the results was again the same, dark back of the hands. I even dug out the oldest build I have around (1.0.4) and still the hands were wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter playing the game for so long and doing a lot of art work based on screenshots, I\u0027m a bit shocked that I\u0027ve not noticed this before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-03T19:51:12Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2018 07:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by purpleivan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-04T06:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like there is a lightsource in the feet.

I\u0027ve done some more detailed testing of the lighting, with a surprising result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlucky scientist Katdorf Kerman put on the white suit and helped out with this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst I put her on a rig with red, green and blue lighting from different directions, to see what\u0027s happening with the normals (ignore the colouring on the light objects, they\u0027re recieving the light from to opposite lamp).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JrGcQbk.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JrGcQbk.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis looks fine, so I was a little confused, as I expected to see inconsistent lighting on the hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo brave Katdorf left for Laythe via the power of Hyperedit, to join the band of colonists there.

However the male model looks a bit of a mess in the hand area. In fact the arms as a whole have issues, but they\u0027re more noticeable on the hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that I\u0027ve got these results I\u0027ll submit a bug report.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
