If we say that technological advancements and heritage tech eliminate the need for one of the 2 test flights, we have 4 SLS flights necessary.

Since they had cheaper rockets that could launch heavy payloads (Titan IIIC, Titan IIIE\u002BCentaur, Titan 34D, Delta III 3940, and all of which could\u0027ve launched lunar cargo or lunar modules for far cheaper than the extremely cost ineffective, Saturn V.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrion only needs heavier lift because it got bloated with SLS (over 20% heavier now than the 2005 RFP). CST-100 started out as an Orion bid, after all. Man-rating existing rockets (or under dev) is not that difficult if they want it done, they just haven\u0027t bothered because there is no need. Given that people will not fly on SLS until 2023, earliest, they have a little time if required to man-rate anything they like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-29T19:24:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2019 07:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-29T21:12:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am so with tater on this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLS isn\u0027t capable enough to perform any useful mission.
