This has existed for a very long time, I can\u0027t really tell if it got even worse because the memory leaks on OSX are making my game crash evey 20 minutes.

I can tell you I don\u0027t have this problem in 0.9. Also I forgot to mention my ship is a small stock space plane. Which makes it even worst! \n\nThis is one of the lag problem. The other lag problem is the aero effects especially when reaching mach speed at high altitudes.\n\nOverall, looks like squad missed its mark here with optimisation. The loading times are great by the way, but on the other hand the terrible optimisation might be to do with the change of texture formats.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T03:49:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 03:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tempsgk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Morrigi","CreatedById":25077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T04:16:53Z","Content":"I\u0027m also getting much worse performance on this version than any of the previous ones."},{"CreatedByName":"thorfinn","CreatedById":8349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T09:49:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I cannot comment on this atm as im still updating.
