I\u0027m not really sure what to say about myself, but I\u0027m a big fan of figuring out building techniques that look good and function well, and I really like building spacecraft designed to explore low-gravity bodies. Some of my favorite movies are Moon, Donnie Darko, and Alien, and I co-write and co-created a horror ARG on youtube called CodeRadiazione-- I won\u0027t talk about it much here, but if you\u0027re curious I\u0027m always happy to give links and info about it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about it I think, wish me luck here in the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T01:01:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Funkocide, and welcome to the forum. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T01:03:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome onboard Funkocide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood Flights and Explosions to you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaelath","CreatedById":106084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T11:40:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi!
