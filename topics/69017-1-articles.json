However, for those of us who aren\u0027t all that interested in the learning the relatively deep levels of space-related science and math required to be able to do anything beyond building a ship and watching it crash, the game is prohibitively daunting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome form of helper tool is required to make this game accessible to people other than space math/science enthusiasts. MechJeb does that very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there are tons of kids out there, as well as plenty of adults, who would love to play this game but can\u0027t really do much without first spending days or weeks studying actual space flight concepts. I know I\u0027m not inclined to do that, but I still love the awe-inspiring experience of sending a ship into space. The realism of Kerbal Space Program is great, but without some kind of helper like MechJeb it requires actually learning real space science. That\u0027s not within everyone\u0027s capabilities or interest. You game is not accissible to those other than space science enthusiasts without such a helper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it is noteworthy to mention that through using MechJeb I ended up learning some of the basic spaceflight techniques required to do a few things, such as doing a Hohmann transfer and setting up a rendezvous with another ship in orbit... things I would have never figured out on my own without some serious dedicated research, something I would not have done. No, I would have simply never learned that stuff and stopped playing Kerbal Space Program altogether. And now that I know how to do that stuff, thanks to MechJeb, I can challenge myself when I\u0027m in the mood and see if I can do it without the flight planning tools or autopilot. Without that basic knowledge of how to do those things I wouldn\u0027t have a clue where to even start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I strongly suggest that something like MechJeb (a flight helper/autopilot tool) be added to the core program in order to make your wonderful game accessible to anyone who is not already a hardcore space science enthusiast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb does a \u003Cem\u003Egreat \u003C/em\u003Ejob of making the game accessible, so why not just make that an official included part of Kerbal Space Program in the next update... seems the simplest solution to me. MechJeb also has several very useful information panels that would be great to have as standard components to the game. The layout is very good just the way it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you do add what I am suggesting to the game it should probably be something that\u0027s available right away in career mode. Otherwise you make career mode inaccessible (those who need the flight helper won\u0027t be able earn upgrades if they can\u0027t do anything). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it should be a part either (like it is in MechJeb). It should just be a standard interface tool. And you could have a check box in the options menu to turn it on and off. Many people will certainly prefer to do everything on thier own too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf nothing else, do it for the children! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E:)\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T09:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought Mechjeb was the way to make the game accessible, it seems like it did a good job \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I feel Mechjeb becomes a crutch way to easily.

There just needs to be an option to turn that stuff off.

Kerbal wont ever reach Minecraft level of popularity simply because its NOT easy. You can\u0027t really be a \u0022pro\u0022 at minecraft simply because its blocks and some adventuring. Half of Kerbal is a space flight Sim, there will always be better pilots than others. And such there are landmarks for being better. Such as landing on the Mun, to landing on Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember finding minecraft when it was FIRST started and was more of a project, rather than a big indie game. Tt here was very little in the way of awesome stuff. The game went throught a lot of gameplay changes before becoming what it currently is today. Same goes with Kerbal, there still is a lot needed to be added before the game is even close to \u00221.0\u0022. Things such as more tutorials and lessons on basic orbital mechanics are important to learn to go further, but NOT important to just have fun. There are many ways to help a player learn rather than \u0022do the test for him\u0022 by giving him autopilot mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look up any review of the game they all mention the realistic, daughting challenge of flying in Kerbal as a feature.

Our standard policy with items on this list is to close the thread with a reminder that the item has been heavily suggested in the past and that we want to encourage newer and more unique ideas. However, in your case, as you\u0027re being quite polite, you\u0027ve obviously put a great deal of thought and passion into your original post, and your primary concern appears to be more about increasing accessibility to the game rather than strictly adding autopilot for its own sake, I feel like I personally would be doing you a disservice if I didn\u0027t try to address your concerns directly above and beyond what is usual for this sort of discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I go on, I want you to know that, although I\u0027m a forum moderator, I\u0027m not actually a member of Squad myself, and thus I\u0027m not speaking in an official capacity on their behalf; like you, I\u0027m just a fan of the game, just one that somebody saw fit to give a fancy title and extra responsibilities to. What follows is my own opinion, not some sort of official pronouncement from On High.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I believe that KSP is a game for all ages (from five to ninety-five), I do also believe that the game is targeted primarily at space enthusiasts -- the sorts of people who enjoy learning about real-world space exploration, or who tinkers with model rockets in his garage and launches them in a local open field, or who have always dreamed of becoming an astronaut themselves but, for various reasons, never got to fulfill that dream in the course of their life. In that sense, I believe that KSP is something of a niche game by its very nature, like many of the more faithful simulation games out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think you\u0027re also slightly overstating how difficult it is to research and apply manually the techniques you need to get the most out of the game to suit your playstyle. You don\u0027t need to be a mathematical genius or an expert astrophysicist to play the game (though having that sort of background certainly helps to shortcut the learning process); trial-and-error works just as well. Most of the principles involved are counter-intuitive because we as humans live on the surface of a planet with an atmosphere that affects how the things we experience everyday behave, but (and I believe this is where the true magic of this game shines through) once you see them broken down into a simple procedure and see for yourself how they interact in practice, you can pick up on them much more quickly than if you just read about them. Furthermore, there is a great wealth of information available through fan-made tutorials and resources which break things down into easily-digestible procedures and principles that help the player \u0022learn through doing,\u0022 and our own Tutorials and Gameplay Questions forum and the #kspofficial IRC channel are chock-full of people who are both willing and eager to share what they have learned themselves to help others get the fullest experience out of the game. It\u0027s fully possible to learn the game simply through trial-and-error, observing what works and what doesn\u0027t, without needing to learn anything at all about things like \u0022delta-v\u0022 and \u0022specific impulse\u0022 and \u0022gravity assists\u0022 and \u0022Hohmann transfer orbits\u0022 at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, depending on your player preferences, there\u0027s certainly plenty of fun to be had in and around Kerbin, without even going to the Mun and other planets at all. It\u0027s entirely possible to have fun simply by building the most outlandish contraptions you can and seeing how far they\u0027ll go.

Good tutorials should be enough to teach new players ascent, basic orbital maneuvers, rendezvous, docking, and landing. Those are the essential piloting skills to accomplish just about anything non-trivial in KSP. While I think MJ is a useful way to teach those skills to some players, it is certainly possible to learn them through trial and error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission planning is another story. I don\u0027t believe the trial and error method works at all for interplanetary transfers.
