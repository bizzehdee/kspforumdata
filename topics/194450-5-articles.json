If they had, the former management of Star Theory would have taken Take Two to court for violations of their contract terms (canceling a contract without cause is almost universally a violation of contract terms, and neither party would have been stupid enough to agree to a contract without those protections) and half the development team wouldn\u0027t have jumped ship to work for a company that breaks contracts without cause.

It\u0027s now MINE and I can do what I like with it. That\u0027s called Intellectual Property Rights. I want to do something great with this property I bought, so I hire a contractor to make me a salable product that people will enjoy. (and thus spend a lot of money to get, recouping my investment in the property and making even more) I have every right to do this and it\u0027s neither scummy nor shady to expect to realize a profit for my good judgement in buying the property and contracting to make something out of it. My contractor agrees to certain terms, including WHEN the product will be ready for sale. A few months before its supposed to be ready, they tell me it\u0027s not going to be ready for sale on time and in fact they need another YEAR of being paid to make it... at MY expense. My first thought is \u003Cem\u003EThese guys are just trying to soak as much money out of me as they can get... maybe they can\u0027t even do the job!\u003C/em\u003E They have now violated the terms of our contract, so I fire them. (as is my right to do so... says so right in the contract) I \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E want my product though, and I don\u0027t want to have to start over from scratch, (loosing all the money I spent on my now defunct contractor) so I offer the employees of my former contractor a job, doing exactly the same thing they were doing before, but now answerable to ME so I can make sure my product gets done. Again, I have every reason to be suspicious of their ability to get it done because they already missed one deadline, but I give them the benefit of the doubt and \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E blame their old bosses for mismanaging the whole thing. Of course I don\u0027t want to SAY that to anyone, because a) I can\u0027t prove any of it and b) it makes me look like an idiot for hiring them in the first place, so I keep my mouth shut and just trust in the product to be worth all this hassle in the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs that what happened here? Maybe... maybe not. It\u0027s at \u003Cstrong\u003Eleast\u003C/strong\u003E as probable as your opposing theory, but without the plot-holes. (i.e., if Take Two yanked the contract just to ruin Star Theory and poach their dev team, why didn\u0027t Star Theory sue them for breach of contract? Why did Star Theory just take it, roll over, and lay off their entire workforce if they did nothing wrong?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, this isn\u0027t a court of law. People are free to interpret the events how they see fit and use their own judgement in deciding what to do about it... but so far I\u0027ve only seen one narrative, and the known facts just don\u0027t fit it. So I offered a counter-argument that \u003Cstrong\u003Edoes\u003C/strong\u003E fit the facts and point out the inconsistencies in the existing narrative. People are also free to listen to me and others like me and make their own decisions... but I just couldn\u0027t let the prevailing faulty narrative stand unchallenged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYMMV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-29T14:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223827886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194450\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221596032647\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022164553\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RobertaME\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, RobertaME said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, you have the right to believe anything you want about Take Two\u0027s silence on the issue, but when you try to \u003Cstrong\u003Euse\u003C/strong\u003E their silence as proof of nefarious intent,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI explicitly said it wasn\u0027t proof.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, RobertaME said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou say \u0022we look at the available evidence, and consider which scenario seems more plausible\u0022, but you have no evidence short of silence (which isn\u0027t evidence of anything other than silence)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other posts I have mentioned the factors that make me suspecious\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, RobertaME said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s look tat the actual facts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

When negotiations fell through and Take Two pulled the contract, which they really had no choice in as Star Theory claimed they couldn\u0027t complete the contract without more time (and money, of course) and refused to accept the counter-offer that would have resolved the dispute. (i.e. Take Two acquiring Star Theory) They knew their actions would impact the employees and offered an olive branch to the dev team to move in-house to an as-yet-unnamed subsidiary to continue work. \u003Cstrong\u003ETwelv\u003Cem\u003Ee\u003C/em\u003E members of the dev team, including Nate Simpson, the head of the project, accepted the offer\u003Cem\u003E.\u003C/em\u003E That accounts for 40% of the entire company of Star Theory.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir reasons are irrelevant.
