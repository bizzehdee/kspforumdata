Two reasons for this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The biggest threat to many species is simply human encroachment, poaching, accidental or collateral deaths, and habitat loss. Humans are a hell of a lot worse than some slight residual radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Wild animals don\u0027t usually live long enough to develop cancer. Cancer tends to strike the elderly, and elderly wild animals simply die from other causes because they become unfit for survival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContinuing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and the inside of the reactor that melted down is still incredibly radioactive. I also know that this is ionizing radiation, which is much more powerful than the normal radiation we get from the sun (duh, that\u0027s why it kills people). I\u0027m sure there\u0027s some rather obvious explanation to this, but why can\u0027t we try to harness the energy from all that radiation? Inside the reactor, there\u0027s enough to kill a person very quickly, which (I think) takes a pretty non-insignificant amount of energy, so why isn\u0027t this possible? Or if it\u0027s possible, why isn\u0027t it done? Is it not actually worth it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere isn\u0027t much energy there. During the early years, they did have occasional overheating issues (heat was not being sinked out of the decaying radioactive debris fast enough), but those short-lived products have largely decayed now. Secondly, why try to harvest that energy? Do YOU want to go lay pipes to run water through that radioactive rubble? It probably doesn\u0027t even get hot enough to boil water anymore, though maybe there are lumps that are still that hot. I donno.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, as you said, it\u0027s IONIZING radiation. \u003Cem\u003EJust because it can kill you doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s a lot of energy.\u003C/em\u003E For example- stand outside under the sun. You\u0027re being irradiated with ~1000 W/m^2, mostly in visible light and infrared. Individual photons at these wavelengths of light are not powerful enough to break molecular bonds- they are not \u003Cem\u003Eionizing radiation\u003C/em\u003E. A small amount of solar energy consists of ultraviolet wavelengths. Ultraviolet photons ARE powerful enough to break molecular bonds. Frequently, an ultraviolet photon will break the bonds holding together one of your DNA molecules in your skin. 99.9999% of the time, your body is able to successfully repair this DNA damage. Sometimes, however, the DNA repair mechanisms all fail and the messed up DNA starts making the cell behave erratically. I believe the body has additional redundancy to deal with malfunctioning cells- I believe there are self-destruct and immune response triggers, but I can\u0027t remember. (A living cell is a fascinating piece of \u0022nanotechnology\u0022.) However, sometimes, ALL those mechanisms fail, and the cell starts reproducing out of control. You get cancer. Despite the effectiveness of the body\u0027s DNA repair and malfunctioning cell eradication mechanisms, you have A LOT of cells, so chances are quite good that eventually you\u0027ll get cancer. The more DNA damage you accumulate, the higher the chances that you\u0027ll get it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, remember that sunlight that was 1000 W/m^2 of mostly harmless radiation? Now imagine that that\u0027s 1 W/m^2 of gamma rays- incredibly energetic photons that can just decimate a complex molecule, and pass right through your skin, doing their damage deeper inside your body. It wouldn\u0027t take long, even at that to take a lethal dose of radiation where so many cells in your body take severe radiation damage to their DNA that you die in a week or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven worse than gamma rays, imagine that you are being exposed to neutron radiation. Being electrically neutral, the neutrons stream into you, right through your skin, strike the nucleus of an atom, and then make a shower of energetic particles that rip through your body like subatomic shrapnel, ripping apart any biological molecules they find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, understand the difference-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENon-ionizing radiation (electromagnetic radiation at visible light wavelengths and below) just makes you hotter if you absorb it. It can even be good for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIonizing radiation (high energy electromagnetic radiation, alpha particles, beta particles, neutrons, etc.) BREAKS UP THE MOLECULES THAT COMPOSE YOUR BODY. Bad. VERY bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo just because a place contains a dangerous amount of ionizing radiation doesn\u0027t mean there\u0027s much energy there. It\u0027s just that the \u003Cem\u003Etype\u003C/em\u003E of energy that is there is of a type that is very hazardous to the biological molecules we are composed of.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-11T16:51:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2014 04:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-11T17:13:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust to clarify a bit - ionizing radiation rarely strikes important molecules in the body.
