I sent it up with a rocket that had way too much DV and a whole stage of wasted DV I didnt need, but because of that I achieved the optional goal for the probe, by jettisoning the waste fuel stage and adjusting the Probes orbit so the debris never got anywhere near the probe, I have made a failsafe kind of thing for Kerballed Mun landings, so if theres a fuel shortage they can Rendezvous with the tank almost completely full of fuel, and use some KAS ports to take the fuel incase of emergency!
