Couple things you mentioned - the issues you are having with the \u0022adapter\u0022 styled parts/end rings is because they are designed to overlap just slightly in the original models. Unfortunately, when the original overlap gets scaled up, they end up overlapping too much in the scaled versions. The same issues are often true of surface attach nodes when rescaling stock parts as well - the stock attach points are meant to have parts \u0022sink in\u0022 a little bit, but when rescaling something like a 1.25m part to 5m that \u0022slight\u0022 bit that they sink in on the original gets multiplied in the rescale too, to the point that sometimes the attached parts vanish entirely inside the rescaled part! Use the direct multiplied values to get you close, and then you just have to do the fine tweaking by hand (which is a large part of what is eating my time in getting the SLS stuff done - having to reload KSP every time I make a set of changes to re-test them. Unlike with base configs for standard parts, where you can just reload the parts while the game is running, MM configs require a complete game restart to take effect).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, a couple more teaser pics, working out the details for an ATV-derived service module for Orion.

this as a community effort, i could never have gotten the coding info on my own, or had the inspirations, ideas and insights many others have already had and i borrowed.

In the case of RealFuels, it uses metric tons per liter (at standard temperature and pressure for gasses). STP is 0 degrees C @ 1 bar. The units in the tanks are measured in liters (that\u0027s the number you actually see in game when using RealFuels). Also, your rate of oxygen usage is WAY off. The actual average CONSUMPTION of oxygen per day is about 0.835 kg per day per person. This is the amount of oxygen actually removed from the air and converted into carbon dioxide (which is roughly 0.998 kg per day produced). The numbers you are using appear to be for total amount of air (not oxygen) processed, not the amount of oxygen in that air actually consumed/converted.

It was my understanding that KJR is no longer doing basic strengthening though unless you specifically re-add that feature in the config files, because of the stock joint strength based on node size changes. These parts seem to have less torque resistance than a procedural fuel tank of the same size though - not sure if that is because they are understrength, or if the procedural tanks are overstrength, but it causes some issues at launch time. You might try setting the node size to 5 instead of 4 for the main stack nodes and see if that helps (since they are 4.4m parts, 4 would be the correct rounded number...but it might help them stand up better at 5, as well as then having the same base node size for connection to the many real-life 5m rocket part duplicates).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-28T11:06:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2014 11:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RaccoonTOF\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
