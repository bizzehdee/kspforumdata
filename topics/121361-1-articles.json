They managed to land safely - I aerobraked them in and we did a night-side touchdown, coming to rest on a mountainside somewhere on the other side of Kerbin. When the sun came up, the lander was lying on its side, with the hatch fortunately not obstructed by the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob went EVA. He was holding on to the side of the ship, approximately one metre from the ground. When he let go, there was a huge cloud of dust and Bob disappeared. Flight log says Bob crashed into the ground and was killed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had Kerbals fall into the water from suborbital height without parachutes and survive. This one survived about 30 days on Minmus without supplies. Then he is killed by a one meter fall. What gives? Is this a bug? Did I do something wrong? Or does Squad or Fate sometimes just have this cruel sense of humour?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-06T14:39:27Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2015 02:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Clear Air Turbulence\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T16:05:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELots of things can happen when Kerbs are on the surface.
