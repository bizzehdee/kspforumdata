I upgraded to 1.4.1 over the weekend and of course all the settings reset to the defaults. I didn\u0027t realize a difference at first, and then noticed that everything looks very smooth and clean. I then had a great appreciation for this game more than ever before. The game is perfect at what it is and the simple, smooth graphics compliment it like peas and carrots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENicely done, devs, artists and everyone involved!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve played this game for so long and seen so many changes, most of which I liked but the rest I learned to appreciate. My view of the KSP community has been amazing and a couple times it\u0027s been a conversation starter among coworkers (\u0022Bill said you crashed into the moon over the weekend...\u0022). I\u0027ve played with mods and without mods, usually alternating. The modding in this game gives variety and keeps providing humor/amusement/challenge/customization\u00A0all these years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThank you also, modders!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\np.s.

I really hope they continue to develop the game further, and also continue the support for modders. Truly ,modders keep things alive in every game.\u00A0 For the Next DLC, Squad should just ask the community what we really want in the game. There are several mods that should be stock, however, even if they do nothing else. KSP has been one of the best games Ive played.\u00A0 In the end, Squad have done a great job with this game and supplied us a way to ..Get Our Space On.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
