To have simulated gravity, they would have to be attached somehow to, or integrated within your bones and muscle, so that you would basically \u0022become\u0022 magnetic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from that, the concept is generally sound in theory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some other issues, though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The gravity would not be quite as strong, I don\u0027t think. I mean, it could be, theoretically, but it\u0027s just a magnetic field that large would require tons of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Remember that magnetism\u0027s strength drops off much quicker than gravity, and builds up much quicker at close distances. Such a field would be very hard to control. Gravity is a much more gentle force than magnets at a close distance, and much more powerful at longer distances. Gravity is more \u0022smooth\u0022, I guess I\u0027m saying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Power requirements. I mean, like a LOT of power requirements...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-That magnetic field would most definitely mess with all kinds of stuff. The flux lines produced by that baby would be absolutely insane. It would be knocking out pretty much anything electrical, since you basically need to generate a continuous EMP for this idea to work.. So yeah this is pretty much the kill-all. You\u0027re literally EMPing yourself all the time if you want this kind of gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I don\u0027t think it would be cost or effort effective. It\u0027s a battle between sending up a workout gym or sending up a massive generator and somehow not EMP the entire station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EButtttt.. If they were indeed attracted via a \u0022magical fifth force\u0022, then yes I imagine this would work. Here\u0027s why...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink about the particles that make up your bones and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are attracted (as one effective object) toward the Earth during normal gravity, and the Earth is attracted to them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this would be doing is replacing the particles in your legs with nanobots, replacing the Earth with the force receptors used in the system, and replacing the force due to gravity with a magnetic or magical fifth force. This would still exert some sort of stress on your body that it needs to remain resilient. Maybe you could have the nanobots use some sort of control moment inside of them and basically try to \u0022torque\u0022 you toward the \u0022artificial gravity source.\u0022 Or, maybe you could have teeny-tiny gyroscope type devices that resist movement inside of the astronauts\u0027 space suits, so that any movement would become slightly resisted by a force.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"georgexiro","CreatedById":59520,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T21:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, there would be no need for nanobots to simulate gravity.

Why? Because the higher acceleration you can achieve, the more efficient the launch can be. If you use magrail to launch from Moon, you can use shorter rail. You could shorten voyage distances. And don\u0027t get me started on what this can do for the military. Acceleration a pilot can withstand is one of the greatest limitations of modern jet fighters. It\u0027s part of the reason why un-manned anything is so much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two principle problems with using magnetic fields. Yes, you can attach magnetic particles to every single cell. This will allow you to counter effects on flesh. Not having your internal organs crush themselves is definitely nice. But typically, the first problem of over-G is blood pooling in \u0022lower\u0022 parts of the body. You\u0027d have to replace blood with some sort of ferrofluid, and these tend to be too viscous to act as plasma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond problem is purely of mag-field permeability. Human body is filled with water. Water is a pretty strong diamagnetic. That means it actually provides some shielding from magnetic field. The effect is subtle at lower fields, but as the field strength gets higher, it becomes a serious problem. This is something you have to account for in MRI, and that\u0027s just 1-2 Tesla. So if you apply field strong enough to counter high acceleration, you\u0027ll actually be creating internal gradients that are causing problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if all you want is create an artificial 1G, then none of it really matters. Blood will circulate just fine in micro-G, so applying a magnetic force just to cells that make up the tissues will be sufficient to replicate almost all effects of gravity. But as it\u0027s been pointed out, a centrifuge works just fine for that. I don\u0027t think convenience of being able to apply 1G linearly will outweigh inconveniences of working with high mag fields. Then again, with everything moving towards polymer construction and superconductors in space being relatively \u0022cheap\u0022 due to vacuum being a damn good insulator, maybe it can end up being easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, by the way, you don\u0027t need nanobots for any of this. There are plenty of ways to bind magnetic particles to cell membranes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebut it\u0027s just a magnetic field that large would require tons of power.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot if you use superconducting magnets.
