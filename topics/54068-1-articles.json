This first mission gets enough science to open a couple nodes. Now with your decouplers you can make a ship capable of a visit to the mun. I like to set up a free return that takes the craft to within 40km of the mun or so, so that I can get Eva reports from high and low orbits. For this ship I like to bring 4 goo pods mounted horizontally around the bottom of the pod so that I can get goo samples from high and low orbit on kerbin and the mun as well.
