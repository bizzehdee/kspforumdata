I have to admit the sub orbital way of the challenge was much tougher than I thought; that\u0027s one of the reasons it took me so long. I couldn\u0027t justify doing it unless there were faster times to be achieved; the whole reason I wanted to have a go at it was so that I could push the time barrier further using a wider variety of parts and operational parameters. When and if others start making entries for SOD, at some point the question may be raised as to what constitutes entering orbit. Some might say it is when you achieve a periapsis above ground level, or it might be a periapsis above a certain altitude, etc. I suppose exceeding 36 km of altitude during the flight wouldn\u0027t necessarily be considered entering orbit although I was careful to avoid that in my entry just in case. The extreme case of breaking the rules based on the original verbage given, if my opinion were asked, would be to achieve, at any point in the flight, both an apoapsis and periapsis that simultaneously exceed the bounds of the atmosphere. In that case, you would in fact be in orbit in the true sense of the word. However, if you\u0027d like to allow extended trajectories like that, perhaps they could only be used (this is just an idea based on the best I can figure for now) for singular circumnavigations; obviously going round and round with no drag to contend with and/or in the circumstance that you could kill the engine and fast forward time to x number of orbits before decelerating would be silly."},{"CreatedByName":"Maverick_aus","CreatedById":149050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T02:51:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E thats pretty awesome maverick ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E although be warned that you might not be able to go on the board because you used KAX engines.\n\u003E \n\u003E but if you pull it off, you get a cookie ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E anyway, i may be able to do a grand circumnavigation on basics:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/veIs0](http://imgur.com/a/veIs0)\n\n@nicky, \n\nThanks!
