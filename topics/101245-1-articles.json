(MJ is also an autopilot in case you have trouble).\n\nOnce you have several flights going to the moons or other planets get Kerbal Alarm Clock. It allows you to get on with one mission without forgetting the others.\n\nNavyfish\u0027s docking-alignment window or the minimalist navball docking alignment indicator help a lot with docking - which is one of the hardest skills in real-life as well as KSP.\n\nSCANSat is a great mod for making satellites useful and interesting. The parts it supplies will map a body from orbit around it, which can help with science or just picking a flat landing-site.\n\n... and many, many, others deciding how you want to play.\n\nIf you\u0027re happy with all the parts in sandbox mode and don\u0027t need an enforced structure of \u0027achievement\u0027 I\u0027d recommend you start there and get used to building and flying different vehicles. Otherwise, have a go at science mode first for restricted parts and the tech-tree. THE game, in career mode, also requires you to manage your money, contracts and buildings, which can all be rather complicated for a beginner."},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T02:20:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E hehe hello everyone im kinda new to this although i have had ksp for over a year ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) i haven\u0027t had time to play it but now i do ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) i understand most of the physics of the game i think ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) is there any mods that are good for a beginner? \n\u003E thanks \n\u003E \n\u003E \\*wags tail happily\\*\n\nHey another dog on the KSP forums?
