I have \u0022Flown\u0022 my own ships to to Min, Mun, Duna and it satellite (can\u0027t remember its name), several times on Stock. I built a Kerbin space station and I am tired after four hours of unsuccessfully docking the fuel.. well, I am a math teacher and I need to plan lessons, and would like the rather \u0022mundane\u0022 Flying left to auto pilot to prepare for my real life job, and love KSP to the heart, sorry to the die hards...... ANYWAY, sorry for boring you, but MJ is not successfully docking to a station wo MJ, but the fuel has MJ part. It is an AWESOME mod! but it fails in the last few meters. Like the control from here to dock to here is ignored and it seems to want to dock to some center of mass, or something. I believe I have the correct updates, and I only run MJ and KER. Is there something I am missing (of course, i know our guys covered everything in the forums) sorry my question is mundane. But your expertise is welcomed :-) dorky smiley. \\\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBtw, I played for an entire summer wanting to get my Math students into this game but I think my pc was not up to the specs, but now my mac 15 is capable, and I want to introduce KSP in the classroom to my Chinese students as an alternative to the junk they play and as a Math/Sciecne/Learning tool. If you need my OS conditions I can provide. OR just point me to a link and I can read it first.

I admire this program immensely! An\u00A0understatement. Keep up the great work. I read\u00A0the lead programmer move on... No worries, I hope you guys are great. I am not blowing sunshine. But so many winners, and (maybe me too) but its a great undertaking none the less. :-) supper happy this game exists. Btw, I don\u0027t \u00A0mind playing stock, but the mods are very intriguing. I did not not see a MAC install for CKAN, is there one?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-12T15:43:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently nothing has changed over the years...
