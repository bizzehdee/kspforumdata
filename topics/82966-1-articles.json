I wanted to use a high anhedral wing design I had used before because I liked the way it flew and I noticed the plane pulled heavily to the right for some reason. So I went back to the SPH and turned on RCS Build aid in engine mode and sure enough it was in fact indicating a heavy force off the right of the plane. After playing around with it I realized it was the wing position. If I moved to a mid wing, level position it went away. I found this odd, so I went back to one of my other, smaller planes I did same configuration with and sure enough it had a pull too, just not as noticeable I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, is that normal?

To explain why this may be the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen your plane lifts up it doesn\u0027t usually lift up everything at the same time. Your back end may lift up, pulling the two wheels of the ground first, means whole wait is on the first front wheel. Any slight movement which happens with sas or those control surfaces results in an angle for the wheel. This makes it veer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possible reason with wheels is u have to align the front wheel exactly straight with centre of mass like you would do thrust. The two wheels at the back need to be perfectly horizontal with the front wheel. Depending on whether you use circle or hexagon to attach them you end up with the wheels at angles. Causes it to veer. Usually if attached to underside of a wing u use the circle. If you attach from the edge of the wing u use hexagon then 90 degrees rotate it to face down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a common problem.

Control surfaces are buggy, but they produce lift on both sides where appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will say that at face value, it looks like your wheels are too far back. That makes me think you need excessive speed before you are able to rotate. Excessive speed can make a plane jittery, easy to cartwheel, or puts added stress on the gear making it flex. If you are using angled wings, the added downforce can make these things worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also possible that the wings are flexing, which will cause gear flex issues with the wide mounted gear you are using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(.craft file?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Claw\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can say the wheels are in the correct place but looking at the images I see what your seeing. It\u0027s an optical illusion caused by the angle in the image. The leading tip of the gear bay is directly on the center of mass putting the wheels just behind it. It actually lifts pretty easily if I take off from the grass where I don\u0027t have to worry about running off a hill. I might try moving the gear on the SSTO to the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to be clear I was using the little plane as an example, it drifts to the side a little but not enough to be a problem. The SSTO is the concern, I\u0027ll get you a craft file when I\u0027m back at that machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r_rolo1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r_rolo1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy hunch on the rudder was not about the rudder being too small to prevent side slipping, it was about the single fixed rudder you have being a possible creator of that same issue. If you put it even slightly out of center ( and due to the way the game works, that is almost certain ) you will get a resulting force due to the lift created from the rudder beinng outside of the center axis ... and this will get worse with increasing speed. OTOH it might be also a landing gear issue, as others pointed ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll look at it again, I know what you mean I did have trouble getting it right but I\u0027m fairly certain it is straight.
