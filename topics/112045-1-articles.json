As it would be a massive shame to go to all the trouble of having other bodies have heat entry influence but to completely ignor the Sun.\n\nThanks\n\nNote\n\nRealised that maybe i placed this post in the wrong forum. So im sorry for this if its the case.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T09:46:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 09:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jabbashouse**\n  \nPossiblly placed thread in wrong forum"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T10:23:21Z","Content":"Heatshields will not protect you from heat emited by the Sun (If that is even a thing in KSP right now)\n\nAblative shielding is only usefull during reentry as the shielding will heat up and then brake off/ablate from the craft, carrying the stored heat with them before it is even able to conduct throughout the craft.\n\nThere is a little mod called, HyperEdit.
