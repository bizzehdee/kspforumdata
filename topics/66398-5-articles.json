I also really hate that my test environment pretty reliably crashes (in ~2 of 3 tries since 2.2) after preparing around ~1k7/2k8 images due to OutOfMemory but does run though just fine once KSP is restarted. Sure, getting rid of even more always loaded data could be done as well. Offering an easy to use interface to LOD so other mods can load and unload however they want should be easy, but wouldn\u0027t save that much. CityLights\u002BClouds for example take about 60mb, though 40 of them for kerbin and would thus have to be loaded most of the time. Mods like KerbinCity might profit, but only if all of their textures have to be loaded at the same time.

Yes, it works fine, brilliantly even. Though I think my joystick is the issue at times with throttle control (it likes to get stuck at 5-10% throttle as the \u0027base\u0027 and require me to unplug/replug it while running). Even then it will reconnect and the game recognizes it just fine with the throttle back to normal. It is also really, really stable in terms that even a GPU crash can sometimes recover and continue playing a game on the rare chance one does occur (I\u0027ve had Far Cry 3 nuke my video card and Windows managed to restore it, while the game was running, and pick up where it left off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the mod, I\u0027m curious if this would completely negate the use for ATM or not. I haven\u0027t visually noticed any differences in texture quality with it (I run basic and have settings cranked up to silly) but then again, not all texture issues would be noticed when working at medium distances from objects. Even close-up I have not really noticed any significant difference in it, then again I\u0027m sure if the load on demand can be worked to a fine-tune it might just not require worrying about compression. Not to excuse some textures which are far too large though (who makes 1024x1024 textures for a tiny button after all? X.x).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
