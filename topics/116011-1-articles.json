I heard brakes locking up behind me and... had I not accelerated when I head tires squealing... that truck would have hit hard. \n\nOdd thing is... when someone nearly kills or seriously injures you there is typically a reaction of some kind, whether that be panic... fear... anger... I felt nothing. Wasn\u0027t afraid or angry... probably the only thing I felt was disappointment at how easily one person\u0027s distraction could result in another\u0027s death. My reaction to the event was to slowly shake my head, and extend my arm with the palm facing skyward to let him know \u0022he done goofed.\u0022 He did apologize profusely when he passed me, hopefully he will make an effort to reduce potential distractions when driving in the future.\n\nAny other motorcyclists frequent these forums?

For the most part, riding the bike is more enjoyable and lower stress than driving, but I do have my share of war stories. \n\nA lot of the time when problems happen, it is the motorists who aren\u0027t paying attention. They change lanes, pass at inappropriate times, make left turns across my lane, run stop signs, etc, etc. The most dangerous situations occur when they misjudge my speed and do something stupid that forces me to take evasive action. It probably has a lot to do with why I\u0027ve never purchased a motorbike. I might hit a top speed of 50kph on my bike but motorcycles are obviously much faster.

I\u0027ve been a daily rider for twenty years. I owned a car, once; sold it after a year because I never used it. Never broken a bone, never lost a millimetre of skin; apart from one incident of running wide on a corner when I\u0027d only been riding for a few months, all of my \u0022crashes\u0022 have been walking-pace incidents in mud or sand a long way from the tarmac.\n\nBest war stories...there was the time I had to dodge a flying mattress that came off the truck in front of me (glancing blow to the shoulder, no big deal), and the time I took a wrong turn into a particularly dodgy neighbourhood and had a guy try to take me off the bike with a cricket bat...\n\nThe best, though, isn\u0027t a crash story.\n\nI was riding up the Stuart Highway from Adelaide to Alice Springs, on the gibber plains near the SA/NT border. To set the scene: a \u0022gibber\u0022 is a stone about the size of your fist. A gibber plain is a region that is made of nothing but those stones; just red rocks to the horizon in all directions, with the rocks hot enough that they\u0027ll burn you if you pick one up without gloves.\n\nScattered through it are saltpan lakes, where the desert has boiled off the water, leaving a brilliant white crust of pure salt. The land is perfectly flat to the horizon in all directions, resulting in a sky so \u0022big\u0022 you feel like you should duck.\n\nWhat little rain happens out there just soaks into the dust and disappears. But when it hits the road, it first runs off to the side, concentrating the moisture and resulting in a band of sparse greenery on the verge of the road. This attracts the kangaroos, emus and camels. And since the only heavy freight into that region is by road train (trucks with 3\u002B trailers) that take a couple of kilometres to come to a stop from highway speeds, there\u0027s a lot of roadkill.\n\nEvery dead \u0027roo or whatever will have at least a dozen crows on it, and usually also a wedge-tailed eagle. They\u0027re magnificent huge birds, and they don\u0027t mind eating carrion; it\u0027s easier than hunting. But since colliding with a Wedgie at 150km/h isn\u0027t good for your health, you need to hit the brakes and horn as soon as you see the birds, and give them time to get out of the way.\n\nHowever, on this particular day the dead \u0027roo in question had not one but two eagles on it. I did my usual brakes/horn routine, the crows scattered and one of the eagles lumbered off into the air. But the other one just sat there staring at me. You could almost see its crazy raptor thoughts: \u0022I\u0027m the top predator here, *you* bugger off\u0022.\n\nSo I keep slowing down, and I\u0027m down to 50km/h and nearly on top of the \u0027roo when the second eagle finally takes off. But instead of flying away from the road as the other birds had, this one flew straight down the road, travelling in the same direction I was.\n\nAgain, picture the scene: red stone desert stretching to infinity, patches of white salt shining in the sun, huge sky, breathtaking scenery in general. Then add to that the fact that there is now an eagle with a five-foot wingspan, flying in front of me, at eye level, perfectly matching my speed, almost close enough to reach out and touch. I could feel the wash buffet my helmet every time its wings went down.\n\nIt only lasted about ten seconds before the eagle veered away from the road, but they\u0027re ten seconds that I\u0027ll remember until I die.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T08:19:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 08:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T15:57:53Z","Content":"A taxi driver abruptly stopped, I stopped some 3 m behind him, he then reversed into me, got out of the car, took a suitcase from a client he was supposed to pick up, dumped it into the trunk and drove off.

Had I been riding a pedal bike today, I definitely would have been a hood ornament. I\u0027d definitely like to hear of some of your close calls, because to me, it really seems more dangerous to be on a pedal bike than a motorbike on public roads\n\nI guess it is a bit of a mixed bag... It sounds like your quick thinking and your bike\u0027s ability to accelerate saved you from serious injury (or worse), whereas I\u0027d have been screwed even if I\u0027d been quick thinking enough. For that reason, I don\u0027t ever make left turns from out in the middle of the road on my bicycle unless there\u0027s a left turn lane. I\u0027ll stop on the shoulder and then cross like a pedestrian when there\u0027s a break in traffic. At traffic lights, I\u0027ll ride through the intersection then stop and turn 90 degrees by the curb and wait for the light to go green in the new direction. It is a defensive tactic I adopted after similar (although not as severe) close calls to yours.\n\nBut the reason I chimed in on this thread is that those of us who travel on two wheels do share a lot of the same concerns. We\u0027re more vulnerable than cars and, statistically, when we get hurt on the road it is the motorist\u0027s fault more often than our own. I once crashed into a car on the front quarter panel and landed on the hood (bonnet) after she made a left across my lane. Another time, a guy made a right turn just after coming up beside me and caused me to scrape along the side of his truck. Luckily I didn\u0027t fall off and end up under his wheels. Other times I\u0027ve come close to getting hit when people run stop signs (especially so on quiet residential streets) or when they make a right turn on a red light (allowed in much of North America) and enter my lane while I\u0027m already in the intersection.\n\nIn Canada, bicycles have to follow the same road rules as other road users do. They are also entitled to the same rights as other road users have. I have to stay to the right in my lane, but I am also entitled to a whole lane if I need it. On narrow residential streets, it may not be possible for a car to pass me safely because I have to ride far enough out from the parked cars that I won\u0027t get doored when someone opens a door. That often doesn\u0027t leave enough room for a car to get by. That doesn\u0027t stop them from trying though. It has happened often enough that some SOB in a SUV decides to play chicken with me because he can\u0027t wait for me to clear some 1/2 block section of narrow road with cars parked on both sides. He\u0027d have to wait if I was driving a car. Why does the fact that I\u0027m on a bike give him the right to endanger my life so he can save a few seconds? \n\nMotorists need to pay more attention to cyclists and motorcyclists. Sure there are bad apples who flaunt the rules when they are on their bikes and motorcycles, but as I said above, more often than not it is the guy on four wheels\u0027 fault when someone on two wheels gets hurt on the road.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T17:19:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Justicier","CreatedById":89671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T17:49:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This conversation reminded me of this video :\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wiLj3MsLCrw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E .

I\u0027ve seen some cool stuff in my 5 years on two wheels, but nothing close to that. I love hearing stories from bikers in different parts of the world, there\u0027s a variety and social norms that result in things happening that are simply impossible in other parts of the world. Although, I will say, your flight with the Eagle reminded me of my run with the Moose. Nothing spectacular, just a cow moose and her calf running on the road right in front of me for a good minute or so. Not the most majestic sight, but gave me a good chuckle ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnd hats off to you for going 20 years without a scrape, I wish I could claim the same. I\u0027ve wrecked once... a high-side crash at about 35mph during an emergency maneuver. It was a half-success... I avoided getting T-boned by a speeding sport car, but alas, it was a bittersweet victory as I lost the rear wheel traction and attempted to recover by reducing angle and rolling off the throttle instead of clutching (I was still a first-year rider at the time). Obviously, rear wheel regained traction too quickly. It\u0027s pretty amazing how much force a bike exerts to chuck the rider off the top of it like that. Thanks to wearing armor, what should have been a shattered collar bone and head injury turned into nothing more than severe bruising which took about a month to heal. Sadly my first bike was totaled as a result of the wreck, but I\u0027d take that and bruising over getting T-boned by a car traveling double the speed limit any day!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T06:57:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 06:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Justicier**"},{"CreatedByName":"benzman","CreatedById":82512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T21:43:14Z","Content":"I think that motorcycling tends to make the rider develop a kind of \u0027sixth sense\u0027, or more likely, an enhanced sense of \u0027situational awareness\u0027.

I have always likened riding a motorcycle to flying a stealth bomber behind enemy lines. Work on the assumption that everyone around you cannot see you, but if they could see you, they would actively try to kill you. As such, stay alert, mind your surroundings, know your machine\u0027s capabilities, and always create for yourself a way out for when things go wrong. I also encourage the potential rider to take a very introspective look at their mentality. If you have that \u0022Stealth Pilot\u0022 mindset, I think you\u0027ll do well as a motorcyclist, but if you\u0027re easily distracted, are not calm when pressured, or simply don\u0027t have the fine physical skills necessary... then I would much rather break a person\u0027s heart and discourage them from getting into riding than find out later that they were killed while riding.\n\nSomething I do also stress, however, is the fact that we can\u0027t predict everything... and as such, we can\u0027t proactively defend against whatever may occur. An example would be riding mid-day on a lake-side road. If you know the road, you can predict areas where gravel or debris may be a threat, such as on a tight corner with a gravel driveway linked to it. Every intersection I roll up to I scan for threats, assuming that there may be a drunk driver who will blow through the stop sign. There\u0027s still things that are impossible to predict, however, and at that point it is necessary to ask yourself if it is an acceptable risk. After all, hitting a deer that has darted out of the woods straight into your flight path leaving you no time to even blink before impact is far more damaging to a biker than to those in a protective shell.\n\nThis brings me to a sad story that I cannot help but be reminded of.\n\nOn the morning of September 24th, 2011, my best friend was killed while riding his motorcycle up to Canada. Jonny had been riding for about 8 years, and had plenty of \u0022street smarts\u0022 about him. He was taking a route up through the state of Washington with the ultimate destination being Banff. The route he chose was known to be a bit dangerous due to its twisty nature with blind corners. In addition to being a good friend and mentor, he was also likely the most warm-hearted police officer you would ever meet. On that road, he was traveling in the northbound lane behind an SUV. He was wearing full protective gear, and from the reports I saw he was following at a safe distance. In the middle of one of the corners, the driver of the SUV saw a deer standing on the side of the road and panic braked, thinking that the deer would jump out in front of him. Given that it was a blind corner, Jonny\u0027s reaction window was more limited, and his potential escape routes were blocked by oncoming traffic. The evidence suggested that when Jonny saw what was happening he made an attempt to brake and then swerve out of the way. The bike low-sided and he slid into the back of the vehicle. I know he had internal abdominal injuries, and despite the helmet, traumatic head injury. Given that it was a fairly remote area, it took 30 minutes for the ambulance crew to arrive. I was a volunteer EMT for 2 years, and knowing the details of the crash I know that there was no chance he could have survived unless someone began CPR almost immediately after the crash. Given the ambient temperature, brain death would have occurred after only 6-7 minutes lack of oxygen. As far as I could tell from the crash reports, there was no mention of anyone beginning CPR until the EMTs arrived. Even if he was dead on the scene, the responders provided chest compressions and oxygen all the way to the hospital, as per local scope of practice. He was declared dead at the hospital. Given the fact that it was a road with lots of twists and blind corners, even when following at a safe distance and at the speed limit, only a fraction of a second\u0027s distraction is all it could take.\n\nAt the time, I was in my second year of riding... still very green... and it made me seriously question whether or not to continue. Obviously I did, though admittedly it was not for the right reasons at the time. (Girlfriend at the time broke up with me not long after Jonny died, I did not have a death-wish per se, but I certainly didn\u0027t much care about my own safety). It was a pretty rough time... but that incident, more than any other, reinforced to me how fragile life is, and how much every moment matters. Years later, now motorcycling seems almost therapeutic to me... it\u0027s honestly very difficult to describe in words.\n\nThis post turned out to be far lengthier than I had anticipated, my apologies...
