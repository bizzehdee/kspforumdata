Apparently a space agency (Don\u0027t remember which) has decided to make a plasma based parachute (Termed a \u0022magnetoshell\u0022). Now, the basic concept works by 1) Heating the air through reentry. This generates plasma. It then 2) Uses strong electromagnets to create a magnetic field. 3) The field traps the plasma, which is naturally magnetic, shaping it into a a parachute and heat shield. This creates a much larger surface area of the \u0022craft\u0022, slowing it. The plasma envelope also keeps air from directly impacting the craft, keeping it cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe magnetoshell would drain power very quickly. It would be deployed through a ring shaped component, similar to an SAS module. Could also come with a \u0022magentosheild\u0022 (not real) that uses exhaust gas or reentry plasma to make a very strong air barrier (at the cost of CRAZY power consumption). Could be used in conjunction with thrusters (they could easily make plasma) to create a barrier to take some of the load off landing legs (about sixty m/s). The magnetoshell might also shield from up to twenty m/s collision velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould also include a \u0022shock chute\u0022 (basically a glorified airbag that has a large diameter) to be deployed at very high speeds. These have been tested in mars-like atmospheric conditions (simply at a very high altitude.) Once deployed, it decelerated the craft from mach six to about mach 2.5 (I think.) A normal parachute was also tested, and it was torn to little, tiny bits. Maybe add a functionality so that parachutes shred over a certain speed, so magnetoshells and shock chutes must be used for reentry and high speed landings. Also functions as a normal airbag and float.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight also make a good system to shield a probe or station very near to the sun. Uses plasma jets for a shield, and solar panels for power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this would make a cool mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust some ideas, but I would LOVE to have these in game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELord Z\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Concept art)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://rupaper.com/image/news_post30869.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022news_post30869.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GreeningGalaxy","CreatedById":66813,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T18:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the power consumption of a thing like that would be well beyond the capability of any conceivable array of stock generators, but I like the idea.

Apparently, they think they could do it with a cube-sat if they diverted all power generation. Maybe add thermoelectric generators to get power from the heat as well? Could help power the shields.

Or power generation and power capacity problems could balance it. Plus, the coil would have to be nearly as wide as the ship. So when you combine those, it might not be TOO OP. But still a little. The idea, however, is fairly basic. It has been known for a fair while that plasma is magnetic, and electromagnets are nothing new, but for gameplay, maybe have different weight to power ratios? Or different efficiency ratings at different points on the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GreeningGalaxy","CreatedById":66813,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T01:42:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LordZ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LordZ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah.

The thermoelectric generators would work great at first, since you\u0027d have the hot underside of your capsule and the cool trailing side to use as your hot and cold reservoirs. As you get lower in the atmosphere, though, I bet your trailing side would get less cool due to eddy currents and your efficiency would drop, which would mean you\u0027d need to look for a supplemental source of power pretty quickly- like a capacitor bank. Of course, no capacitor or battery has nearly the energy/weight ratio of a nuclear reactor, but I guess I don\u0027t really know enough about this concept to say for sure what your power requirements would be like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does sound like a lot of interesting power management in any case, which only adds to the case for it to become a part of KSPI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordZ","CreatedById":119770,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T00:49:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHuh. very interesting.
