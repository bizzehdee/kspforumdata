You\u0027ll also be using the altimeter, and throttle indicator now and then, and more advanced players might look at their vertical velocity and g-meter once in a while. That\u0027s not sufficient instrumentation if you want to go a long way down the realism path, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re already pushing the limits of the instrumentation we have with 1.0.2 physics. A \u0022pretty standard\u0022 rocket will want to flip if it\u0027s very slightly away from prograde when passing through mach 1. You can add fins to correct for this, but \u0022real\u0022 rockets don\u0027t all have fins. The best you can do in KSP (if you want to fly it manually) is \u0022try to keep it pointing prograde\u0022. But the navball doesn\u0027t provide information at a high enough resolution for you to know that you are a fraction of a degree away from porgrade, which means you can\u0027t fly it \u0022manually\u0022 with the available instrumentation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that bad? Well, only if we want KSP to be a game where you can fly your rocket manually with the instrumentation available. If we don\u0027t want that... ie, if we want a realistic simulator, we\u0027ll probably need to add a lot more realistic instrumentation, and maybe have all our launches be computer controlled. But is that still KSP, or have we just remade orbiter at that point?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis already happens in KSP by the way... people who go with mods that add realism also tend to have more realistic instrumentation (FAR is the obvious example). It seems to me that this is the right way to do things: the basic game should be, well, \u0022basic\u0022. Simplified instrumentation, simplified controls, and along with that an appropriately simplified flight model. If you then want to press that towards a simulation, go with mods that add these features. it makes a lot less sense for the devs to spend a huge amount of time making a high fidelity simulator, and then have players download mods to simplify all of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll fair points, However...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not advocating a plethora of \u0022realistic instrumentation\u0022.
