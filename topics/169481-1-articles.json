I\u0027m my experimenting for a series of large launches to the the second planet, I\u0027ve been experimenting with heat shield configuration to survive the heat of insertion, and trying to determine the amount of delta-v required for a deorbit burn. Anyone familiar with my recent posts will see that i got the heat shields figured out: four in\u00A0front and a wider arrangement of nine in aft to maintain balance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it turns out that I was massively overestimating the delta-v required to deorbit my behemoth lander, by a factor of 4 or 5, maybe 10. My first successful attempts used between 1800 and 2400 m/s from initial orbits of 186 km. Worked, but the crafts experienced worryingly high G-force. Then I tried a 1000 m/s burn from 100 km. This ended in failure due to one of my cats walking on the keyboard. I\u0027m not sure what keys her pressed, but it put the well balanced lander in a flat spin which broke it up. Given the my lander masses more than 800 tons, you can imagine these attempts required a metric f*ckton of fuel. Several Saturn Vs worth. I was racking my brain on how to get the rocket off Kerbin and to Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut just now I tried a far smaller deorbit stage. Two of the largest stock tanks and seven vector thrusters. I also spammed the large panel radiators everywhere they would fit on the lander. The deorbit stage was rated at 430ish m/s, but I used less than half off that. My angle of insertion was very shallow. And the entry went flawlessly. G-force barely touched the red line, heat shields didn\u0027t go beyond yellow, it was over all a much safer operation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all the talk of how hard it is to land on Eve, you\u0027d think someone would mention how little you need to burn to get down.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-11T23:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve has always been pretty easy to land on. \u00A0\u003Cem\u003EAerobreaking\u003C/em\u003E on Eve from orbital velocities (or, Kod help you, trans-orbital velocities) is what has gotten dangerous since 1.0 came out. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-12T00:08:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting \u003Cem\u003Eoff of\u003C/em\u003E Eve is the hard part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-12T00:24:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223265911\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169481\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221515714916\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151656\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zosma Procyon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n24 minutes ago, Zosma Procyon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all the talk of how hard it is to land on Eve, you\u0027d think someone would mention how little you need to burn to get down.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUm, yeah.

Anyone familiar with my recent posts will see that i got the heat shields figured out: four in\u00A0front and a wider arrangement of nine in aft to maintain balance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it turns out that I was massively overestimating the delta-v required to deorbit my behemoth lander, by a factor of 4 or 5, maybe 10. My first successful attempts used between 1800 and 2400 m/s from initial orbits of 186 km. Worked, but the crafts experienced worryingly high G-force. Then I tried a 1000 m/s burn from 100 km. This ended in failure due to one of my cats walking on the keyboard. I\u0027m not sure what keys her pressed, but it put the well balanced lander in a flat spin which broke it up. Given the my lander masses more than 800 tons, you can imagine these attempts required a metric f*ckton of fuel. Several Saturn Vs worth. I was racking my brain on how to get the rocket off Kerbin and to Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut just now I tried a far smaller deorbit stage. Two of the largest stock tanks and seven vector thrusters. I also spammed the large panel radiators everywhere they would fit on the lander. The deorbit stage was rated at 430ish m/s, but I used less than half off that. My angle of insertion was very shallow. And the entry went flawlessly. G-force barely touched the red line, heat shields didn\u0027t go beyond yellow, it was over all a much safer operation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all the talk of how hard it is to land on Eve, you\u0027d think someone would mention how little you need to burn to get down.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/JaK3u5brNKg?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-16T05:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting to Eve requires the least \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for any celestial body, from Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nInserting into Eve is easy if you know how to properly manage heat\u003Cbr\u003E\nGetting OFF of Eve is the hard part, your lander will need a minimum of 8,000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E from sea-level, and a high enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E to lift off the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you check my signature below, you\u0027ll find Mount EveRest, the highest point on Eve at an altitude of 7540 meters above sea level, making it the best place to land, tho tricky.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat makes it the best landing site, is because it\u0027s so high up, the atmospheric pressure isn\u0027t as bad as it would be at sea level, which gives you a small boost to thrust and decreases the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirement to return to orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince Eve\u0027s rotational speed is about 55 m/s, you won\u0027t gain any benefit from landing near the equator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEve\u0027s dense atmosphere makes wings and parachutes more effective than they would be on Kerbin, and winged craft is the best mode of transportation, provided you have the means of propulsion, there\u0027s no oxygen for jet engines to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for Tylo, you\u0027l need a two or three stage lander to land and return, the high gravity and no atmosphere will require at least one jettisoned descent stage. don\u0027t overlook the oscar-b tanks, they\u0027re quite useful as you\u0027ll see in my Jool 5 video if you click the picture in my signature below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
