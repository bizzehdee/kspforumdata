The trailer looks very nice, and what I\u0027ve seen from gameplay so far it looks very promising aswell.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever after the initial extacy of excitment had passed I did have a couple of concerns for the new game that I wanted to vent here to see what everyone thinks and maybe if some people have the same.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. The release timeline.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the IGN interview with Nate it was stated that the release for KSP 2 would be sometime in spring 2020. Now that is less than a year away, and although I would be very excited to have it playable that early, I\u0027m also a bit concerned.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt seems to me that if KSP 2 were to live up to the status of the first game, whilst also expanding on its scope, 8 to 10 months of devlopment time would be to little to achieve that. Now I realise that the developers aren\u0027t starting at the same point as Squad did in 2012, but I still think this game needs at least a solid year and a half of development time from where its at right now to be a worthy successor.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m afraid it might dumb down or even cut some of the more advanced features that are in KSP right now, in order to get things like interstellar travel in there on time for release.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPersonally I would be happy with a game that is the same size as the original KSP but with enhanced visuals and all the same features on release. And then have it slowly grow overtime like the original game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Multiplayer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want to come across as someone who doubs the ability of the developers at Star Theory. From what I\u0027ve gathered they are a group of very capable game designers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever I don\u0027t feel like they have a grasp on what makes KSP fun when they mentioned multiplayer. I am personally not sure wether KSP is the kind of game that even needs multiplayer. Not every type of game is improved by having multiplayer in it, and it feels more like a forced feature to boost hype and potential sales of KSP 2.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP being the game that focusses more on the methodical, trial and error type of gameplay. That\u0027s usually a bit slower and not as well suited to multiple people playing as at once. I fear that it might not work out at all.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI just don\u0027t feel like KSP needs multiplayer. Have a social element to it by all means, but multipalyer itself, I\u0027m not feeling that.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis concern is reinforced by\u00A0the fact that it seems like the developers at Star Theory themselves don\u0027t seem to have and idea of how they want multiplayer to take shape in KSP 2 either. It is simply mentioned as a feature but there\u0027s not info on how its going to work or what we can expect.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt comes back to the short release schedule aswell. If they are planning to finish this game in 10 months and they have no idea or prototype in place for multiplayer what is this going to mean for the rest of the development? It would be a shame to both have a half finished uninspired multiplayer component and a less than exciting singleplayer component.

I might update my post with more later, but for now those are the only ones that I can think of.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain I don\u0027t want to come across as negative or pessimistic. I think its fantastic that the KSP franchise has a future, especially since for me the first game had become a bit stale. And I am very excited for this. But I also want to see it succeed as well as the first game, and therefore I wanted to vent these concerns here.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d love to know what you think, if you share some of these concerns or if you have your own.

The release timeline.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the IGN interview with Nate it was stated that the release for KSP 2 would be sometime in spring 2020. Now that is less than a year away, and although I would be very excited to have it playable that early, I\u0027m also a bit concerned.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt seems to me that if KSP 2 were to live up to the status of the first game, whilst also expanding on its scope, 8 to 10 months of devlopment time would be to little to achieve that. Now I realise that the developers aren\u0027t starting at the same point as Squad did in 2012, but I still think this game needs at least a solid year and a half of development time from where its at right now to be a worthy successor.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m afraid it might dumb down or even cut some of the more advanced features that are in KSP right now, in order to get things like interstellar travel in there on time for release.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPersonally I would be happy with a game that is the same size as the original KSP but with enhanced visuals and all the same features on release.

Perhaps they want to easy a bit the burden of launching a new, unproved product on the Xmas seasons (as it happened with KSP 1.6).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a way or another, KSP has a tradition of incremental features deliverables.

From what I\u0027ve gathered they are a group of very capable game designers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever I don\u0027t feel like they have a grasp on what makes KSP fun when they mentioned multiplayer. I am personally not sure wether KSP is the kind of game that even needs multiplayer. Not every type of game is improved by having multiplayer in it, and it feels more like a forced feature to boost hype and potential sales of KSP 2.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP being the game that focusses more on the methodical, trial and error type of gameplay. That\u0027s usually a bit slower and not as well suited to multiple people playing as at once. I fear that it might not work out at all.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI just don\u0027t feel like KSP needs multiplayer. Have a social element to it by all means, but multipalyer itself, I\u0027m not feeling that.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis concern is reinforced by\u00A0the fact that it seems like the developers at Star Theory themselves don\u0027t seem to have and idea of how they want multiplayer to take shape in KSP 2 either. It is simply mentioned as a feature but there\u0027s not info on how its going to work or what we can expect.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt comes back to the short release schedule aswell. If they are planning to finish this game in 10 months and they have no idea or prototype in place for multiplayer what is this going to mean for the rest of the development? It would be a shame to both have a half finished uninspired multiplayer component and a less than exciting singleplayer component. I\u0027d rather have a solid game that I can play on my own.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDesigning a game, and implementing that game, are two tasks that usually are better tacked down by different people with different expertises. But since the best engineers never goes to the Space, I will not dare to even cogitate that we saw all the development team on that Video. So my speculations on the matter ends here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think, and frankly I don\u0027t know if I want\u00A0to be wrong or right\u00A0on this, that KSP2 will be a somewhat different game than KSP1 - besides sharing a common conceptual base. It will not, definitively, be the same game and that\u0027s already a fact. Colonies will grow by reaching milestones, not by management over time: you do something remarkable, Kerbal Babies are born. I don\u0027t exactly like this approach, I\u0027m more an \u0022design and manage\u0022 kind of people. But there\u0027s always the Sandbox - let\u0027s see how they managed (if available) a Sandbox game option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really mind KSP2 having a multiplayer option. I agree with you, and I will probably not use it all all after one or two sessions. I\u0027m a bit concerned about the tight time window they have to do all of that, and also a multiplayer mode - but as I already said, KSP has a long tradition of progressive deliverables - and perhaps these features will be added in successive releases. Perhaps a \u0022final product\u0022 would be ready only for Xmas after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also agree with you on the user\u0027s expectations concerns. They do that progressive release of features the wrong way, they could get somewhat burn when the Big Season comes. But this is a risk on both ways, so perhaps this early access approach ends up being the best (or lesser worst?) option. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223657719\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187570\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566578234\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002221888\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CyclonicTuna\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, CyclonicTuna said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are my 2 major concerns I have for KSP 2 right now.
