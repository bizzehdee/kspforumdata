I have a ship (Left in the pictures), with a robotic arm and claw attached to dock with a mobile refinery (Right in the picture). When I arm and grapple the ship it works fine, I can transfer fuel and stuff. As soon as I disarm the claw it\u0027s like it \u0022disarms\u0022 itself from the ship and the ship suddenly floats away. The ship becomes almost completely uncontrollable. trust and turning do nothing. I also can\u0027t go to the tracking station or switch ships because its moving. Would love some advice on what parts of this I\u0027m doing wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope I\u0027m doing this right.

I tried to get an explanation 1 to 2 years ago but never could get anyone in the know to answer. It is the program Module itself, not the part that is to blame. I have seen grapples made by other modders have the same problems. One of the weirder ones is when it causes the part it has grabbed to stop being affected by gravity. When the part is let go it just floats slowly away and can\u0027t be grabbed again. I have had it happen to a one Kerbal cockpit and been able to have the Kerbal EVA and hang on to the side as it drifts away. Another one is when a wing gets grabbed and it detaches from the main craft.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThis stuff seems to happen randomly, so you never know if it will happen the same next time.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
