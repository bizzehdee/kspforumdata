Also, Squad should hire a music composer / artist. Nothing against Kevin MacLeod personally, but because anyone can use it anywhere, it makes it less special and unique to KSP. Squad has probably gotten successful enough at this point, financially, to be able to afford this, judging from their recent staff expansions.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T22:26:06Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Xavven\u0027]Perhaps each celestial body should have its own theme music.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;d go further and suggest theme music that can be fine-grained: per body, per situation (space, flying, landed), per biome. Or per event, such as first touchdown on a body, first orbit, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0026#39;s not to say that I expect Squad to completely fill out that tree (which would require dozens if not hundreds of songs)... but a good start would be to set up the framework to make it easily moddable/expandable. For example, each song could be a file in the GameData folder in whatever standard format. Then the config nodes would be set up so that various situations and events identify (by ID) which song goes with them. That way, Squad could initially start simple (e.g. one song per planet, moons use parent planet\u0026#39;s song), then gradually fill it in. And it would be easy for modders to fill in the gaps or replace stock music as desired.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T23:05:57Z","Content":"\nAt a minimum, each celestial body should have (where applicable):\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.

What I mean by this is, no continuous loops. Silence sometimes is the best form of music, playing in a continuous loop makes the brain tired of it much more quickly, but if random length pauses (in terms of minutes, no more than about 5 to 10) are added it makes it that much more enjoyable when it does start. The actual pause lengths or even the existence of them needs to be weighted, how long are you expected to be there? If it\u0026#39;s the tracking station or the admin building probably no pauses at all, while the VAB and SPH definitely pause sometimes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll the current music needs to go (except the main theme of course). There is nothing wrong with it, we are just sick of it, we needs something fresh. There is plenty out there even if you choose to keep the license free stuff. Other stuff by the same composer would certainly be fine, just different.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, the icing on the cake would be a nice system that allowed you to easily mod the music built in to the game. This can be done by a pre-defined script format that points to the locations of the music files and the locations they are to be played.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n(If you can\u0026#39;t tell I\u0026#39;ve actually thought about this a lot)\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-25T23:13:38Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2015 11:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T23:22:30Z","Content":"\n[SIZE=5]Obligatory plug for UpsilonAerospace\u0026#39;s music[/SIZE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88869-KSP-Plugin-Songs!-%28Current-Song-SUN%29[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe OP in that thread can only hold 5 linked videos, his latest track, \u0022Sun\u0022, is on page 10\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think these tracks should be in the game, once Upsilon finishes all of them.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T23:41:27Z","Content":"\nI like BagelRabbit\u0026#39;s music, but it\u0026#39;s too... similar. Just because it is in space doesn\u0026#39;t mean it all has to be slow light music. There should be a greater mix of styles. The idea is to vary it enough so that you don\u0026#39;t get bored. Eve for example, I think of it as a harsh mistress, something like this would be perfect (but not this, because it is licensed, unless Squad wants to buy a right to use it).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[video=youtube;8MrvCH6BaOM]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MrvCH6BaOM[/video]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy point is, the music needs to more accurately represent your perceptions of the planet. Eve is well known as a dangerous place to visit, because once you get down there only a small chance of getting back up. Each planet and moon in KSP has it\u0026#39;s own personality (except Dres, nobody cares about Mun 2.0) and the music should reflect that better than he (she?) does IMO.
