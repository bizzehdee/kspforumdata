No pressure cracks that would occur if you had air pressure inside a blocky shaped ship. Really any streamlining is better than a hard edge when it comes to holding pressure. In that sense, spaceships are really like glorified balloons that house crew that need to live in the balloon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSaucer: It is good for spin gravity. Although you could also do the same with a spaceship shaped like the letter H. Only with a LONG bridge between the sides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlocky: Pressure cracks at corners will stress hull sooner or later if you put air pressure within the blocky hull. If you ony put air pressure in spherical or cylinderal roons inside the blocky ship you avoid that problem. Thus blocky ships would be great for drones or robot ships that do not need air to breath and thus won\u0027t have lots of air inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCylinder: You get most of the benefits of the sphere plus it is better for bulk storage of plenty things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside the ship: Although the captain and chairs on the bridge is popular, spanning many imitators, it is is really a sub-optimal design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey could likely save the energy they put into gravity generators by simply accelerating up instead of sideways. I know weightlessness\u00A0is bad, and for times the ship is not accelerating the saucer is optimal for centrifuge spinning for 1g. It would be cheaper even if gravity generators were possible, since anything we already have a. grasp of is not considered very advanced in a scifi setting and should be thus easier to come by if advanced tech like gravity generators are\u00A0available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShip purpose: What a spaceship is made to do also has a bearing on optimal designs. Astetoid mining ships, if they do any processing of their own, practically\u00A0beg for a shape that will allow spin gravity. Since processing and refining ore is easier with gravity than without.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor ships that are \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s, compact designs have less drag, but if fuel is not a concern because the setting has super tech propulsion, suboptimal designs would have other reasons for existing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure the ship creates more drag than it needs to, but if it has antigravity to fall up, then it could reach space in about 2 min just falling upward from earth at 1g.\u00A0Which is a huge improvement. The ship would still need to use some other propulsion to maintain an orbit, but at least there would be little to\u00A0no air resistance in LEO, thus increasing fuel efficiency of rockets. And that is if rockets are even used as a main source of sublight propulsion in a scifi setting. They certainly do not\u00A0have to be, as the only limitations are the ones a writer imposes on their work and self.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I love saucer spaceship design, because antigravity makes it at least practical,\u00A0\u00A0and while it may never be as optimal as a cylinder or a sphere for holding pressure, it is optimal for spin gravity at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-16T10:17:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting topic here. Personally, in terms of spaceship design, I prefer functionality over aesthetic. A research ship might be nothing more than centrifugal habitation pod with sensors and gizmos sticking out of the hull. An interplanetary relay is nothing more than a radar dish with thrusters, a space gun is literally just a gun with thrusters around it.

The reason to pick a cylinder is that cylinders are easier to build and launch than spheres. A torus would be equivalent to a cylinder in terms of surface area to volume, but more expensive to build, so it would really only be useful if you\u0027re going for spin gravity.
