But I was able to do it, and now they get to go on their own paths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_DRlxHfqtEU/VFKwg5rUh3I/AAAAAAAAAts/iFbcyGkBwdw/w346-h208/Rover.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Rover.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis little guy was a bit of a challenge to land, but he\u0027s all in one piece. Turns out our Ion engine actually exploded on touchdown, so we don\u0027t have to decouple it! Although we could have recovered it eventually... but now it\u0027s garbage, so we\u0027ll move on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-iOmeXFXi7Pk/VFKxFWKjFKI/AAAAAAAAAuQ/tSW2gPXKmd4/w346-h208/Lander.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Lander.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s not necessary to post this now, but I wanted everyone to know that it look cuter when its landing gear is up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-d4Dqw1YxZPg/VFKxjM-riMI/AAAAAAAAAu4/CZl9RhogWFo/w346-h208/Landed.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Landed.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, apparently my solar panels exploded sometime in the fairings, so I now have a right to say: CONSERVATION AT ITS FINEST! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IQGaqDGmaXU/VFKx_P4LVjI/AAAAAAAAAvo/rtuNC3aWqzU/w346-h208/Time%2Bto%2Broll.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Time%2Bto%2Broll.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a bit of offscreen roving (2 hours), we found sight of our lander. We will get close, and use the docking ports to bring them back to the main ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-UMV7QTnx9GI/VFKy_79DLfI/AAAAAAAAAwY/DQncLkPZ260/w346-h208/Broken%2Bspacecraft.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Broken%2Bspacecraft.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is, if we still had a main ship. Unfortunately an ongoing glitch in the game wont let me see my fuel supplies, and that makes it impossible to check my electric charge. We have enough to deploy the panels, but they aren\u0027t doing anything. On top of that, ASAS isn\u0027t responding, and our engines aren\u0027t working either. Looks like this mission was a failure... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut hey, I\u0027d still love to see everyone else\u0027s tries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
