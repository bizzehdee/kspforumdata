SSTO aerojets are going to be a lot tougher now. I haven\u0027t upgraded to the later versions of 1.0 yet, but I\u0027ve been hearing drag was greatly increased.\n\nI do take issue with parachutes. It\u0027s great that their partially deployed state has had its drag increased dramatically, but it was increased a bit too dramatically and now it slows the craft almost as much as a fully deployed drogue. Drogues are about worthless now because when they fully deploy, it barely makes a difference. I just use a single small parachute instead, as that seems to function much like a drogue should when used on a larger vessel. Now when you\u0027re screaming in at over 2000 m/s above 30km and your parachutes suddenly partial-deploy, they can save your ship from re-entry heating but also cause tremendous g-forces that ought to severely injure or incapacitate the crew. I\u0027ve watched ships slow from 2500m/s to under 500m/s in under 5 seconds, which means they may be experiencing over 50 Gees of deceleration at some points.\n\nMy suggestion for parachutes is cut their partial deployment drag to 1/10th of its current value--I\u0027m not sure how that\u0027ll work because I don\u0027t know how the calculation is done, but I think if they have about 1/10th of the slowing power it\u0027d be great. Then drogue chutes would be useful, too.\n\nP.S.: A bit off-topic here but I\u0027ve always been bothered that I can\u0027t set my parachutes to deploy at any altitude below 300m unless I set it to 50m. It won\u0027t hit the values between because it sticks to the bottom until I slide it all the way to 300m. 50m is too low to have time to slow the ship, but I almost always want 100m or 150m, so I don\u0027t have to spend 30\u002B seconds waiting on 4x time warp for the craft to reach the ground.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T03:14:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 03:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness**"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T05:01:50Z","Content":"Cheers, claw. I\u0027ll put just one topic here because I\u0027m sure there\u0027ll be others to talk about re-entry, stability, etc. It\u0027s not a comment on the physics config as such, but more about the relationship between jet engines and aero.\n\nJet engines have a bit of an odd curve with speed and altitude. The sound barrier does actually have some \u0022barrier\u0022 to it, which is good. But as you gain a bit more speed your acceleration skyrockets. You can easily build a craft that has trouble getting through mach 1, but a few seconds later is starting to overheat due to the speed at which it is flying. Then just a few seconds after that (and just a few thousand meters higher) your engines run out of thrust because they have exceeded their peak power output and because of what seems like two rather significant steps in air density that seem to happen at ~20,000m - 27000m. Put all of this together and it makes aircraft a bit weird to fly. Now, there may not actually be two significant steps in air density in that altitude range, but that\u0027s kinda the point.... whatever is going on, it just seems odd. \n\nThis impression might be exacerbated by the huge step in technology between the basic jet engines and the turbojets/rapiers. Basic jet engines seem pretty OK, but turbojets will easily push you to speeds that will cook your aircraft. Compare this with real jets, where the limiting factor for your engines is almost never that the aircraft is going to overheat... it\u0027s that the engines just can\u0027t push you any faster. The only aircraft with engines that even come close to the performance of KSP\u0027s turboramjets would be the SR71, and yeah, that thing got really hot and had to be made out of titanium because of it. But check out the engines on that thing! Each of the Pratt \u0026 Whitney J58 engines puts out 35,000 pounds of thrust, and are very specially designed around their bypasses and intakes for super high speed flight. The F100 engines on an an F15 each put out 14000 pounds of thrust at a TWR of about 7 to 1, and the F15 is itself known as an energy fighter (very high power). The General Electric CJ610 engine (used on, eg, a Lear Jet) puts out about 3000 pounds of thrust.\n\nSo if the basic jet engine sorta matches the Lear Jet, and the turboramjet sorta matches an SR71, there\u0027s a pretty huge gap in the middle that represents engines for the kinds of planes that many people want to build, and this might be messing with the perception of aero."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T08:02:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This impression might be exacerbated by the huge step in technology between the basic jet engines and the turbojets/rapiers.

Considering the fact that there are only two air breathing engines, and a third if you throw in the rapier. It\u0027s not really practical to expect such a small number of engines to provide the performance needed for Mk1, Mk2, and Mk3 sized craft. They are all significantly different in size, weight, and drag. So, with so few engines, they are stuck in this middle ground of being too powerful for Mk1 craft, but a Mk3 craft ends up needing tons of engines. Definitely tough to balance with so few options.\n\nAlternate options would be to add more engine types (such as SCRAM) or even just multimode the current engines to provide some sort of \u0022feel\u0022 as if there are more of them.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T16:03:34Z","Content":"One thing that might help a great deal would be to throw in afterburner characteristics. Not only would this create a separate \u0022class\u0022 of engine, it would also naturally balance that new class due to the decreased efficiency when on burner.\n\nThe whiplash turboramjet in KSP must, surely, be an afterburning engine to be able to provide the performance that it does provide. But if that were really the case then fuel consumption should increase massively when you push it into afterburner at, say, about 90% throttle (with an appropriate effect to let the user know that they are in fact now in afterburner and guzzling fuel).\n\nThis creates room for three jet engines: basic (high ISP, mach 0.5 - 0.8 for a \u0022normal\u0022 looking Mk1 aircraft), advanced jet (mach 1 - 1.5 for the same aircraft, higher altitude, slightly lower ISP at sea level) and the turboramjet (average ISP at sea level off burner, capable of extremely high speeds and altitudes on burner at a tremendous efficiency cost)\n\nYou can then start re-tweaking the complex relationship between thrust, speed, drag, heating and altitude against that set. I don\u0027t know nearly enough about the numbers to say what that relationship should be, but I reckon the most advanced jet should probably get you to about mach 3.5 on burner at ~20,000m, with drag being a hard limit, and a slow overheat entering as a soft limit at about mach 3.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T16:07:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran**"},{"CreatedByName":"DoToH","CreatedById":68428,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:20:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Aero:\n\u003E 1.0.2 is spot on for blunt objects, but too draggy for pointed ones.

Heat should be much more localized to the place where the heat is generated. In what reality does the cockpit of a spaceplane heat to 1500\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C from burning a rocket engine? Sure, the engine might get hot (well, actually, just the nozzle and combustion chamber of the rocket will heat or else there will be serious problems...), but now -my entire spaceplane- becomes glowing hot. Also, most parts should have much much lower heat resistance (say, 600C or so), but, decreasing the heat resistance of parts (that shouldn\u0027t have heat resistance) is not really possible, as these parts would then be destroyed as the spacecraft becomes \u0027uniformely hot\u0027 during an LV-N burn or re\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ABntry. The solution is obvious: increase the thermal capacity of parts; decrease the thermal conduction between parts; then heat will become much more localized and only then the heat resistance of some can be decreased. That would also make reentry more interesting, so only parts that are designed to resist heat can be in the airstream.\n\nAero feels pretty good. I like it a lot that breaking the sound barrier is really hard. SSTO\u0027s should definitely -not- be made easier. I like that it is pretty hard to build a decent ([like this !\\[;)\\](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) )](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119655-Yet-another-mk3-SSTO-UPDATE?p=1925036#post1925036) SSTO. The only thing is that the wings need re-balancing in my opinion. Right now a plane barely needs wings and can glide with 40m/s. I\u0027d suggest reducing the lift of wings (so more wings are needed), but also reducing the weight and drag of wings to compensate, so basically the same performance spaceplanes as now are possible, but with larger wings (so they don\u0027t look so rediculous as some do now). Also, IMHO, the mark 2 parts generate too much body lift. I like lifting body\u0027s, but right now mk2 planes don\u0027t need wings at all...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T15:19:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 03:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chris\\_2**"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnV","CreatedById":79006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T02:02:20Z","Content":"I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153m not good at aerodynamic, but I never saw any plane fly in fire at mach 2~3, only in KSP"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T09:50:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153m not good at aerodynamic, but I never saw any plane fly in fire at mach 2~3, only in KSP\n\nmaybe because few planes fly that fast?
