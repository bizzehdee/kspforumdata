Nobody\u0027s going to force you to play multiplayer, and any server admin worth his salt should be making backups on a frequent basis. This isn\u0027t going to be a Half Life server.

MP is really a time waster made only for the people who want PvP. ( if your intents are different than that you are already wrong. There will be nothing you could do to prevent the inevitable). So introducind MP will bring weaponry and \u0022alien\u0022 all in one. Point 2 aside the really unfriendly time sync, I have problems having a 300 part ship and it become annoyng playing when 1 game sec is 4 real secs how the hell they think there will be a way to coordinate let\u0027s say 4 players with a 100/120 parts craft that try to fly closer each other. MP is like something that only few can andle. point 3 if there will be no mods in MP the 90% of the people who is claiming it now will change opinion. Point 4 i don\u0027t really think Squad know what is talking about, even graetest company have troubles with MP with simplier games. Point 5 there are too many open doors that need to be closed before proceding wasitng time on such project.

As in, you can only use so much currency or budget on any single rocket or spaceplane. So if you have 20k, you can build a ship with up to 20k worth of parts. And then you can do so again. And again. Once you complete contracts or do something that otherwise increases this cap, you can build and launch more expensive ships (i.e. ships that are either bigger, or which have better and more efficient/advanced parts). I don\u0027t want to have to worry about running out of money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there could be modifiers to your current cash availability based on various events. For instance, if a rocket with a nuclear part crashes or if some kerbals die, you might suffer a temporary penalty for some time as a form of PR backlash. If Kerbals have newspapers, you could even have one appear to denounce dangerous rockets. Likewise, temporary boosts may be gained through certain events too. There could also be randomized events for this too that aren\u0027t directly related to your performance. Plus, just think of all the fun Squad could have making those newspaper covers, and the fun we\u0027d eventually have reading them. A great way to add more enjoyment and even flesh out the Kerbals and their world a bit to boot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think it would be cool if you could actually purchase/upgrade the buildings at the space center in some way (using either science, or some third currency apart from the science and budget stuff). For instance, there could be two or three \u0022levels\u0022 of runway, and upgrading it would improve length and material a bit. Upgrading a construction building could increase the dimensions of what you build there. Getting certain structures may allow for special parts to be used. For instance, a large power station could allow for special propulsion parts to be used like vessels where ground-based lasers supply heat ablate the bottom of the vessel for propulsion (this is a bit out there, mind you, but mods could easily add their own buildings and structures to build). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the sake of mods AND just making KSP that much more interesting, it would be nice if you could physically choose where the building or facility is placed when you get it, within the boundaries of the KSC (its also for the sake of mods because you won\u0027t need to worry about physical location conflicts that way for different mods that add a special building of some sort).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-08T11:15:04Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2014 11:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ryu Gemini\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RatchetinSpace","CreatedById":65526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T08:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love it!
