When it happens, it normally lasts at least for the duration of that editor session. Sometimes it lasts until I quit and reload, which I /think/ resets it. It seems as if there are some other triggers for resetting it, but I can\u0027t work out what they are reliably - but sometimes it starts working again while I\u0027m in the editor, sometimes it starts working again after doing things outside of the editor and going back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027s not right-clicking broken entirely - it still works to look at the part info in the sidebar (although it behaves a bit weirdly when this happens) - it\u0027s only for the context menu you get when right-clicking a part that that\u0027s been placed in the editor. And when you try to do that, it lags horribly for a bit, but the menu just never comes up. Sometimes the lag doesn\u0027t go away until you pick up a part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight-clicking outside of the editor normally continues to work, I think, although it\u0027s still laggy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and this seems more likely to break if the part you\u0027re right-clicking is a command module, possibly just for any module with crew space, and possibly it doesn\u0027t like root parts, although that might just be co-incidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m running an awful lot of mods, so finding out what\u0027s causing it is liable to take forever, but I just thought I\u0027d post to see if anybody else has ever had an issue like this, to see if it\u0027s a known problem, or even just to see if anyone could suggest what /sort/ of mod is likely to cause it, so I can maybe narrow it down more easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny info would be much appreciated! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull mod list is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/NGJj0JQH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/NGJj0JQH\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"baldamundo","CreatedById":138417,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T11:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems as if what often happens, is I\u0027ll try to right-click on a command module, and that seems to break it, with right-clicking on any other modules also broken thereafter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T11:38:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly thing I can think of is that there\u0027s so much UI clutter that the mouse events aren\u0027t being registered, it\u0027s known that KSP has UI problems in Unity4x, and all the additional UI elements added by mods means there\u0027s more calls to update the UI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA badly made addon UI or modified action menu can also cause lag due to excessive redraws.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you take a look at the support stickes and provide the necessary logs then people may be able to see if something is going on, there may be a lot of logspam exacerbating the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may also help to reduce your mouse polling rate or DPI, as that can also cause issues, check your mouse software and OS documentation for how to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"baldamundo","CreatedById":138417,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T22:07:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA bit more testing seems to confirm that it\u0027s specifically right-clicking on a command module that\u0027s breaking it.
