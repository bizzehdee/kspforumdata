In trying to use an advanced grabbing unit to pick up an object, I found that the AGU doesn\u0027t care whether it\u0027s grabbing onto another vessel or its own. So I tested further. Sure enough, you can build a robotic arm, have it grapple onto your vessel, and then separate the other end and it will remain attached. This might?? happen with docking ports but my tests were inconclusive and inconsistent. In the first test, ports seemed to dock, but when the original docking port was disconnected all the others disconnected as well. In the second, a docking port on an arm held to the vessel by a AGU refused to connect and instead clipped through. As is, it seems like AGU-based arms are the way to go, although they may not be useful for berthing.
