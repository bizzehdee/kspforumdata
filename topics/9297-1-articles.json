Designed to make quick and efficient ballistic flight to other continents with only one rocket engine. Landing gear has not yet been put on (I have no clue how people land planes... The wheels break off when I do it.) so the occupants must drop to Kerbin in a capsule like a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore and more will be put into this, but so far, flight is really straight forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=10215.0;attach=16837;image\u0022 alt=\u0022index.php?action=dlattach;topic=10215.0;attach=16837;image\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nooblet68","CreatedById":11784,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-07T21:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E basic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Millst0ne MK II","CreatedById":13384,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-07T21:55:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENothing wrong with it tho, I like it.

With landing gear, what you do is not level it out, but try and get your descent speed as slow as possible. Even if your forward speed is something whacked out, if your landing gear is stable and your down speed is low, you shouldn\\\u0027t have a problem landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just drew this for you on Paint.NET.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R1d83.png\u0022 alt=\u0022R1d83.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \\\u0027Gentle Leveling\\\u0027 is where your rear gear has touched down, but because the aircraft is angled up, the front gear wants to slam down. On a heavy craft, this can be disastrous. Make sure the gear goes down slowly. Same principle as landing as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there are craft like my VA \u003Cem\u003ECrescent\u003C/em\u003E, which will pull wheelies for ages, and take off if you leave SAS off even after landing, because their front ends generate so much lift.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-10T21:08:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProblem is, the incomplete stalling model at the moment makes it very difficult to get anything but a diving (dangerous) type descent because once you\\\u0027ve burned off some fuel, most aircraft become almost lighter than air. I can only land one of my aircraft without diving until a second before landing then cutting the throttle. If I flare during the landing, I just go up again, even at the lowest feasible velocity of the craft...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
