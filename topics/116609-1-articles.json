The devs have no desire to change this model, its a moot subject. \n\nYour ball should not move in a precise ellipse. The only way it moves in a precise ellipse is a two body problem. Mass is moved to a point at the center of the galaxy. In a spiral galaxy masses are surrounded by matter, in fact even at the furthest radius stars are still interacting with dark matter. N-body problems of the galactic scale are not solvable, and this does not factor in unknowns like:\n\n1. red dwarfs with current technology are only visible at close distances to the observer, many go undetected\n\n2. Neutron stars and such are virtually invisible past a certain age, you would need a graviton telescope to see them. \n\n3. Gas dust and protoplanetary disks may only be visible in the late stages of star genesis. Of course the nebula from which they from are with the proper level of backlighting stars. \n\n4. Most of what is in the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud is invisible to us. \n\nYou should look up papers on the deviation of star motion from predicted in the Milky Way, it is one of the factors that supported the existence of dark matter."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T03:07:31Z","Content":"^ All of this is true, but this being intended basically just for aesthetics, I\u0027m fine with (I\u0027d actually prefer) simplifying it to KSP\u0027s level of precision or lower.

Instead, a graph of the actual orbital velocities shows, if anything, a somewhat rising orbital velocity, the further one gets from the core of the galaxy. This discrepancy was the first indicator that what we can see of the universe is far being all that there actually is, and this is how the various theories about \u0027dark matter\u0027 gained their starting point. Also, last I read on the subject (it\u0027s been some years now), the spiral arm structures were thought to be caused by a sort of gravity wave.

In real life, the object\u0027s velocity would be constantly changing--and computers can\u0027t do that. At any given point in time, a computer can only store a fixed value for where an object is, what direction it\u0027s going, and at what speed.

That equation should be able to spit out the star\u0027s precise position at any point in time--which IS a fixed number the computer can store without introducing any errors into the motion of the star.

Apparently orbits of different eccentricities follow markedly different patterns of motion, and the eccentricity affects the true anomaly (position at a given time) in a strange, unconventional manner.

There was a paper written recently that actually shows that dark matter doesn\u0027t exactly avoid matter, it is simply indifferent to its existance except via gravitational forces, as a consequence it tends to concentrate as well around gravitational clusters as point masses and thus there should be an intersteller density profile that can be developed. You note that matter stratifies itself in objects (solid dense cores, less dense mantle crust, atmosphere, interplanetary space), dark matter just flies right through this as if it does not exist, very fast and then slows down and lingers in interstellar space. A good example would be an SP3 orbital of a C-H bond where the electron speeds alot of time (in a classic model, not the proper quantum mechanical model - which we know that the position of the electron is not defined until we try to observe it) lingering between C and H and a small amount of time in the nucleus and on the other side of the atom. In this case we can propose that for 1000 bonds the electrons are at distances from the nucleus 0-.1A, .1A to .2A, but given quantum mechanics its quite unneccesary to do that we don\u0027t ever need to know the exact position of the electron, just its probabilities. In the same way since dark matter is indifferent to matter and since it appears to be composed of isolated darkmatter, and not clumps of matter, you really do not need to know positions, just probabilities. \n\nWe have to think about it this way, if dark matter is say (just saying) half the mass of a galaxy, but exists not only where stars are but also where stars aren\u0027t such as in the extremes and well above and below the galactic plane, then its average density in a spiral arm relative to matter is much lower. Then we factor in the density between stars versus within the sun\u0027s heliosphere. And then you reach a realization is that the amount of dark matter in a stellar system is a tiny fraction of the dark matter in the galaxy."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T14:53:05Z","Content":"BUMP, I say!
