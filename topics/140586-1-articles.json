What my question refers to is how it\u0027s much cheaper to change or match inclination at whichever node is at the highest altitude. And yeah, my head is starting to hurt from trying to grasp this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit : me thinking out loud : while it costs more to bump apoapsis from 10Mm to 80 Mm, circularizing the orbit at 80Mm is so much cheaper than it is at 10Mm, that it actually makes the total dv budget less to get to the higher circular orbit, hence my origianl comparison to the inclination change thing. I need a nap now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtis, inclination changes are cheaper to do the bi-eliptic transfer if you\u0027re changing more than 45 degrees or so. (this is where you go eccentric to the TOP of the SOI, change your inclination almost for free at the top of the orbit, and then recircularize at periaps). So it\u0027s kinda a similar concept in a way. I believe below 40 degrees it\u0027s cheapest to just change your inclination at the current orbit by burning normal/anti-normal\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T16:24:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLots of good explanations in this thread, but it\u0027s not clear to me that we\u0027ve quite hit the \u0022sweet spot\u0022 for making sense to the OP.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159462-kerbonaut257/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022159462\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159462-kerbonaut257/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Kerbonaut257\u003C/a\u003E:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I\u0027m in a low circular orbit, and I want to go to a higher circular orbit, I have to do two things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBurn when I\u0027m in the low orbit, to raise my apoapsis up to the target altitude.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAfter I arrive at the new apoapsis, do a 2nd burn to circularize there.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBurn #1 is \u003Cstrong\u003Ealways bigger for a higher target orbit\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 This is simple and intuitive.\u00A0 It\u0027s also what\u0027s confusing you, because this is what you\u0027re mainly thinking of, and why it seems weird that a higher circular orbit would ultimately be cheaper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the important thing to remember is that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eit\u0027s nonlinear\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 The higher your Ap, the less extra dV it takes to raise your orbit further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, suppose you\u0027re in LKO.\u00A0 From there, it takes around 850 m/s of dV to raise your Ap up to the height of the Mun, at 12,000 kilometers.\u00A0 That\u0027s a pretty big chunk of dV, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow suppose you decide you\u0027re going to Minmus instead.\u00A0 Minmus orbits \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efour times higher\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E than the Mun does.\u00A0 But it takes less than 950 m/s of dV to raise your apoapsis up that high!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words:\u00A0 Raising your apoapsis the first 12,000 kilometers takes a whopping 850 m/s of dV, but raising it an additional 33,000 km takes less than 100 m/s!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, it\u0027s more expensive to boost up to Minmus\u0027 height... but it\u0027s only a tiny bit more expensive.\u00A0 So getting the extra altitude only takes a little bit more for burn #1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, yes,\u0022 I hear you saying, \u0022okay, it\u0027s only a little bit more expensive.\u00A0 But it\u0027s still \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emore\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E expensive than the lower orbit, right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re right-- but don\u0027t forget about burn #2, your circularization burn.\u00A0 The difference in burn #1 between \u0022go to the Mun\u0027s altitude\u0022 versus \u0022go to Minmus\u0027 altitude\u0022 is tiny, less than 100 m/s.\u00A0 However, burn #2 changes by a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Circular orbital velocity at 12,000 km is 600ish m/s, and you\u0027ll need to supply a big chunk of that because your velocity at apoapsis will be pretty small.\u00A0 However, the circular velocity at 45,000 km is much smaller, only around 300 m/s.\u00A0 So reaching that requires less dV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what it boils down to is that when you\u0027re transferring to a higher circular orbit,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nyour first burn gets a tiny bit more expensive\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nyour second burn gets a lot cheaper\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n...and that\u0027s why the higher orbit becomes cheaper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T17:13:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125662\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Snark\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0said covers it pretty well. \u00A0If it helps, think of it like this: the Oberth effect works because you are adding energy to the system at the point of highest velocity (the lowest point in an orbit,) right?
