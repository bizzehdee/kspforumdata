At some point I\u0027ll also add the capability to transmit power from nuclear reactors included in the mod but the logic to perform this is different and ships that have both power from solar and nuclear reactors would be particularly complicated to implement (have to split the power into two sections, one dependent on line of sight to the sun, the other not).
