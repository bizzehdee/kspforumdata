As a pilot many instruments are there to accompany me whilst flying a real aircraft but one thing you do not have in KSP that you have in real life is ground rush and feel of the aircraft. It is to my understanding paramount to have tools to accompany this lack of feel for aircraft aerodynamics. Would it be possible to add a GLS or instrument approaches to the HUD of KSP during low altitude on approach to the runway? A GLS will add so much when landing even off runway toggled manually or an automatic feature when near runways. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
