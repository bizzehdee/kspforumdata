The initial problem is once my KSPI jets are out of Atm I didn\u0027t have enough thrust to get orbital speed before being pulled back into the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo added some more LqdHydrogen and 155kN of thrust to the wings using TweakScaled down to .625 ATILA, X48 tank, nosecap. I have no idea if this is enough because I couldn\u0027t even get it going fast enough to have overheating using the jets. Without the boosters I had to be really careful not to explode due to overheating, running with around a dozen heat gauges, several in the red, balancing speed vs heat. I could get it so fast that the height reached was over 100km with just under 1.5k dV needing to be added before dropping back to 90km to get into orbit. The 80kN was too slow, so hoping 235kN will do it quickly enough if I could actually get higher than 60km with the extra engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The weight doesn\u0027t explain it, it\u0027s actually slightly lighter since I took 1.6t off before adding the boosters. The only explanation that I can think of is the drag. It certainly seems to have changed more that I would expect by adding 2 .625 tubes with aerodynamic cones on front. If the drag calculation is seeing two massive 2.5m tubes that might account for this kind of drastic effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if TS scales the drag cubes now, could it be broken with the KSPI parts?
