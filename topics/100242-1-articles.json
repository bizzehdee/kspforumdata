She was up there not to be a BadS, but to prove to the world that Soviets regarded both genders as equally capable of entering the workforce, because Communism!\n\nShe did just as well, if not better, than many of the male cosmonauts who flew the early space missions. And yet, the next Soviet woman to fly into space was Svetlana Savitskaya, and *she* didn\u0027t fly until 1983. Sometimes these things just ain\u0027t fair.\n\nAnyways, very nice drawing Little Katie!
