Since my rocket have a few mod-parts (mostly for science but also some RCE thrusters etc.) I have not been able to remove all of my mods, but very close to, and still the problem persist. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I remember correctly, its the following mods this vessel depends on:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel Tanks Plus - 0.11.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVenStockRevamp - 1.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand one or more of near future mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll mods installed via CKAN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also tried to reinstall the game 2-3 times with no luck.

I tried numerous different settings below stage 5 as boosters and engines and all with same problem, but at different altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried with SAS and RCE disabled and enabled, same problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried both manned with pilot and as a probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried my upper stage (including and above stage 2) with only one single stage mainsail engine and a long single line of rocketfuel and managed to get the rocket up with no problem.
