Since my rocket have a few mod-parts (mostly for science but also some RCE thrusters etc.) I have not been able to remove all of my mods, but very close to, and still the problem persist. \n\nIf I remember correctly, its the following mods this vessel depends on:\n\nFuel Tanks Plus - 0.11.1\n\nVenStockRevamp - 1.8\n\nand one or more of near future mods.\n\nAll mods installed via CKAN.\n\nI have also tried to reinstall the game 2-3 times with no luck. And tried the game in both x64 and x86, I normally run on x86. \n\nOS:\n\nWindows 7 pro x64, with all the latest drivers in a HP elitebook laptop.\n\n8k RAM\n\nIntel core i5 2520-M quad @ 2.5 ghz\n\nIntel HD graphics 3000 with dx11.\n\nAll my addons are up to date and match with release 1.0.2 with KSP.\n\nAddons I use: (but as mentioned before, I have also tried with a minimal of mods running)\n\nKSP: 1.0.2 (Win32) - Unity: 4.6.4f1 - OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (6.1.7601) 64bit\n\nFilter Extensions - 2.2.2\n\nCapCom Mission Control On The Go - 1.0.1.1\n\nCommunity Resource Pack - 0.4.2\n\nContract Configurator - 1.3.3\n\nContract Pack: Anomaly Surveyor - 1.2.2\n\nContract Pack: Field Research - 1.0.4\n\nContract Pack: RemoteTech - 1.1.4\n\nContract Pack: Unmanned Contracts - 0.3.10\n\nDMagic Orbital Science - 1.0.4\n\nFuel Tanks Plus - 0.11.1\n\nInterstellar Fuel Switch - 1.11\n\nKAS - 0.5.2\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux - 1.0.16.6\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement - 3.1.3\n\nKerboKatzUtilities - 1.2.9\n\nForScienceContinued! - 1.0.4\n\nKIS - 1.1.5\n\nKSP-AVC Plugin - 1.1.5\n\nNear Future Electrical - 0.5\n\nS.A.V.E - 1.0.1.672\n\nRemoteTech - 1.6.5\n\nSpacetux - 0.3.4\n\nStageRecovery - 1.5.6\n\nTAC Fuel Balancer - 2.5.1.7\n\nTextureReplacer - 2.4.6\n\nTweakScale - 2.1\n\nVenStockRevamp - 1.8\n\nKSP Interstellar Extended - 1.1.20\n\nBelow I will explain the problem only focusing on this one vessel with two very similar design, but I encountered the same problem on other designs and previously working rockets as well, so don\u0027t mind the pictures below show some minor design differences:\n\nI have my spacecraft with asparagus staging, perfectly synced with symmetry mode and angle snap on all vital parts. I tried numerous different settings below stage 5 as boosters and engines and all with same problem, but at different altitude. \n\nI tried with SAS and RCE disabled and enabled, same problem. \n\nI tried both manned with pilot and as a probe.\n\nI tried my upper stage (including and above stage 2) with only one single stage mainsail engine and a long single line of rocketfuel and managed to get the rocket up with no problem. So everything seems to work, but not together.\n\nThree pictures of rocket setup and staging, you can find here:\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/fLuJU](http://imgur.com/a/fLuJU)\n\nTwo pics when all is good and working on my way to higher altitude:\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/JDTEQ](http://imgur.com/a/JDTEQ)\n\nHere on this picture at about 14k altitude there comes a \u0022swish\u0022-sound (same sounds plays at around 7k meter, not sure if this changes depending on velocity and such) and then the rocket starts to move up outwards of the screen but it starts to flip out of control before disappearing, and you see on the following pictures how my vessel lost camera focus, even tho I swap between \u0022orbital, Locked, Free\u0022-camera modes etc.\n\nI manually stage the rocket to split in parts, to further show how the camera is not focusing on my vessel, and even if I manually look for my vessel its not in the center.\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/w2MmV](http://imgur.com/a/w2MmV)\n\nPlease let me know if I can provide any more information or if you would like a save file to try the vessel for yourself (need to get some mods, or remove some parts).\n\nThanks in advance, I\u0027m really looking forward to enjoy the game again!"},{"CreatedByName":"Jozy","CreatedById":146541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T12:21:23Z","Content":"Here you might see few pictures of center of mass/lift/Thrust.\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/cgv7C](http://imgur.com/a/cgv7C)\n\nI also tried to change atmosphere back to 1.0.0 but problem still persist, even tho I make no gravity turn and go straight \u002200\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T06:51:03Z","Content":"I can almost guarantee that this is a mod. In fact, it\u0027s very probably a conflict between two mods. Unfortunately my best advice is binary search; remove half the mods, see if it works. If not, remove half the remaining mods and see if it works, if it does, put half the removed mods back. Faster than going one by one through them ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIn my case I\u0027m relatively sure that having two mods with different versions of kspapi.dll didn\u0027t help me any. Still testing... :/"}]}
