The\u00A0stars were by now a distant memory in the memory banks, and the view outside was pure, utter blackness, penetrated by only the dim, blinking lights of other habitats in visual range, which, without any air to block the view, was billions\u00A0of miles. One light, however, was brighter than the rest, and stayed constant, without blinking. Alas, this was no star, but the power station\u00A0for this sector of the orbit. Huge\u00A0panels,\u00A0millions of miles across, captured the feeble Hawking radiation from the black hole and beamed it, via microwaves, to all habitats in range. The habitat carrying the remnants of humanity carefully fired its EM thrusters, coming in for docking at the station for repairs. Not the habitat\u0027s repairs, mind you, one of the converters on the station had failed and needed repair. Habitat #15,345,279, being the closest to the station when the failure happened, had been asked to assist. J\u0027Louver, being the most competent engineer in the hab, was assigned to repair duty. As they closed in on the station, J\u0027Louver grabbed their toolkit and went to the airlock. When they heard the resounding click of the docking ports connecting, they opened the door and went through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the repair was done and J\u0027Louver was back on board, the habitat undocked and returned to its assigned orbit.
