Fact is I ask a lot of questions because I want to learn more about the game from a developer perspective. Anyway, I hope this is the right forum for this topic, if not I apologize in advance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, having messed around with the new (stock) resource collecting system I quickly discovered that drills(2) and an ISRU running at the same time generate quite a bit of heat; quickly throttling back the efficiency to almost nil. I did some research and found that the new system allows for heat to be transferred from part to part and solar panels help to remove heat from the craft. Consequently the \u0022radiators\u0022 from Near Future Electrical and Interstellar did nothing. Then, I got the bright idea to take a peak at the CFG for a stock solar panel (gigantor) were I discovered some parameters which appeared to specifically address the heat issue. Namely...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EthermalMassModifier =\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EemissiveConstant =\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EheatConductivity =\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich are not specifically defined in the CFG File Documentation on the wiki, yet. So, I decided to add them to the CFG for the radiators from the Near Future mod. This seemed to have worked to a degree. Having played around with some different values I seemed to have accomplished my goal, at first. Now the craft seriously affects my frame rate. I have attempted to minimize parts that are known to reduce frame rate; such as lights, solar panels, RTGs, ect. This has helped slightly but I\u0027m still only getting 20fps at best when focused on this craft; which makes it painful to fly anywhere. I don\u0027t really know what I\u0027m doing, I have an IT background and some basic programming knowledge, but I\u0027m not specifically familiar with what is happening on the back end to optimize this. If anyone has any insight as to what I could/should be doing to make this work better I would appreciate it tremendously. My end goal is to have the large universal radiator from Near Future Electrical be about twice as efficient at heat removal than a Gigantor solar panel and the small conformal radiator about twice that of a 1x6 / 2x3 solar panel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour input eagerly awaited,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A.A.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
