We encourage you to post information about your game as early in the development process as you are comfortable with. Greenlight will let you define whether you are posting your game as a concept/early build or as a playable game that is nearing completion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe ask that you only define your game as \\\u0027playable game\\\u0027 if you have a playable build that demonstrates the gameplay mechanics and at least one level of your game. Otherwise, please classify your submission as \\\u0027concept\\\u0027 until its far enough along that the community can reasonably evaluate the mechanics, scope, and style of your game. Either way, you will probably get great feedback and a good start in building a community of fans around your game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you guys think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tiger336","CreatedById":5175,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T01:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit might work i have a few steam games myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T01:24:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t think so, and it may be along the lines of why the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/notch-explains-why-you-cant-find-minecraft-on-steam/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edevelopers of minecraft decided not to do this\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, it\\\u0027s not like it couldn\\\u0027t happen, but I don\\\u0027t know for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tiger336","CreatedById":5175,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T04:19:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMIGHT\u003C/span\u003E because of the fact that minecraft coght on youtube vary fast\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flaillomanz","CreatedById":8088,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T07:16:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tim_Barrett\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tim_Barrett\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t think so, and it may be along the lines of why the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/notch-explains-why-you-cant-find-minecraft-on-steam/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edevelopers of minecraft decided not to do this\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, it\\\u0027s not like it couldn\\\u0027t happen, but I don\\\u0027t know for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I always saw steam as infallible before seeing this. :\\\u0027(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP works brilliantly with the steam overlay, if you can excuse the shift-tab causing the throttle to stick on full.
