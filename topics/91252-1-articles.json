On Kerbin this is just a shade over 6 hours. The result is that the satellite appears not to move and is always directly above one place on the surface, meaning this satellite can always stay in contact with KSC, forever. With three such satellites, equally spaced around the planet, you can cover almost the entire surface of the planet with a reasonable degree of overlap - this is the minimum number of satellites to ensure continual coverage at the equator, but you could use more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere may still be places close to the poles that can not always draw line-of-sight to a satellite in an equatorial geostationary orbit, mainly because a satellite in equatorial orbit seen from the poles will appear to be very close to the horizon, and the surface of a planet has hills and mountains that might get in the way. Consequently, placing bases very close to the poles with \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ea dish to track whichever of the geostationary relay satellites is not obscured by mountains\u003C/span\u003E should ensure that you should always have a connection back to KSC, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eas the targetted satellite will never move and become obscured, and will relay signals \u003C/span\u003Ewith the other GS satellites, one of which will be in contact with KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Edit: had to change the underlined part because being very tired made me be dim.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy also outfitting these bases with antennas, you can extend the relayed signal to crafts within a radius of the pole that can draw line-of-sight to the base. If they are far enough away that the polar relay base is over the horizon, then they should already be far enough south to receive directly from the satellite relays. If you find this isn\u0027t the case, you can boost the surface range by building your antenna on the top of a radio tower to extend it\u0027s coverage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that clears it up a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-25T23:08:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2014 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T23:19:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember, the important thing is your orbital period.
