The \u0022ejected from pod on EVA\u0022 bug is still around, apparently. It\u0027s *mostly* fixed, but I have had Valentina launched spinning at high velocity away from a basic Mk1 pod with a small parachute on top. It only happened the once. The camera spun around a fair bit on exiting to EVA, too, and it took a good 30-40 seconds before she stopped ragdolling through the void. I suspect it has something to do with the angle of the hatch vs what the game considered \u0022up/down\u0022 (i.e. the orientation that an EVAd kerbal locks to in free-flight). Possibly also affected by the interstage faring on the heatshield below the pod, since the new part sticks out a bit."}]}
