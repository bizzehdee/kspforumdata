This happens with any jet engine and i have no mods installed. Any ideas are appreciated\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YargJay9991","CreatedById":143494,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T01:20:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey man! I\u0027ll see if I can help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you got fuel lines to the engines on the wings? If you don\u0027t you can attach a fuel line to the main tank and then to either the wing the jet is connected to, or the engine itself. Make sure you have symmetry on and that the fuel line is going the right way (fuel follows the arrows).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour info is a little bit vague so I have made quite a few assumptions here. One more thing you can try is after the jet \u0022Flames out\u0022 you can right click on it and check what it says. It will either say something like: \u0022Not enough intake air\u0022 (if so add some upward facing intakes) or \u0022No liquid fuel\u0022 (for this use my first method).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf these don\u0027t work please post again. Maybe we can see a few pics so we can take a look at your design.

The air intake will work more as you gain speed, but in the case of a VTOL, the initial vertical movement is actually slow, so vertical air intakes will most likely not have enough air speed. Also, I do believe that fuel lines do not transmit air intake, so even with an horizontal movement, it is likely that vertical engines will shut down. As VargJay9991 said, having screenshots of the plane would help, and you can right-click the engines to know the reason for the flame-out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
