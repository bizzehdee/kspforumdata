Anyone whos been on the forum for any degree of time knows how hostile some people get when something gets announced or talked about and then gets pushed or tabled. As a result they need to keep things quiet just to avoid the backlash. Harve could have said 6 months ago that he was working on 64bit and people would have been getting on his case the whole time as they are now about the other OS 64bit versions. Or he could have just saw the modders pull it off and figure why not put it in. Either way it seems like he cant win against some people so they choose to keep things quiet so that speculation stays that way until they are finished something so they can confirm it once its done. Sucks for us who are curious but some spoil it for the rest of us. This is just my theory and im sure it will draw flak but if people didnt react so poorly to things then we might actually get more information.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T23:21:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LethalDose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LethalDose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEarlier this year, the devs announced the goal was to get the game \u0022scope complete\u0022 (all major features implemented) by the end of 2014.
