Of course, nothing would stop a player from just building a KSP monstrosity and visit the outer worlds with a 400 ton vessel (**plus** the fuel).\n\nFor the probe itself, it\u0027s easy enough to make one as it is (you might have to get RemoteTech for the dish).\n\nI\u0027d love to see an all-included probe body covered in gold foil. Some reaction mass, electric charge, some experiments (I\u0027m told you cant mix two experiments on a single part...), some reaction wheel control (like, almost none), some monoprop, included RCS blocks (small, weak) and, of course, absurdly priced. \n\nI\u0027ll probably eventually make a custom config (or new/dupe parts) for RemoteTech so I don\u0027t have to use the XBOXHUGE dishes. In real life, small dishes are more than enough to receive data from the earth. I might give them absurd prices and kill the data transfer rate for science to nerf them comparatively to bigger antennas, though."},{"CreatedByName":"DirtyFace83","CreatedById":131509,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T02:04:50Z","Content":"I came across thos [New Horizons Probe 3D Model](http://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/new-horizons) a while back when I was looking through NASA\u0027s website.
