Due to the introduction of larger aircraft carriers there was no need for them. So lets see what you can do. Your goal is to re-create this innovative machine. you can use any mods needed (I recommend B9, and Firespitter) as long as you list the mods you used. also the plane must be able to reach mach 1 (approximately 300 m/s) and be able to land and take off on water. I hope to see your creative ways of getting around the water landing. unlike my previous Re-creation challenge I posted, the F2Y has alot of data on it and as such you should easily be able to search any pictures and specifications needed to help you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOW THE CHALLENGE!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonce this craft is made your goal is to push this craft to its limits include pictures of the fallowing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(buzzing the tower)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(flying low to the water/ground)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(landing on water with great speed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edepending on the distance/speed/height from these pictures scores will be combined with the crafts overall resemblance to the actual plane and its ability to meet the speed and water landing requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etop 10 scores\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe best of luck and happy building\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-AtomicSnails\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-30T05:02:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2013 05:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by AtomicSnails\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded the challenge part to the thread\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"occar","CreatedById":15056,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T15:47:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a request and not a challenge.
