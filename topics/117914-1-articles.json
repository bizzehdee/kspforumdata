The game would have to keep track of each and every section of everything that is or isn\u0027t painted. This could potentially slow the game down to seconds per frame instead of frames per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever one could do it along the lines of B9 Aerospace. Cycle through a number of pre-painted textures each with their own set of ablator settings. This will limit your options slightly but in turn keeps the game playable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
