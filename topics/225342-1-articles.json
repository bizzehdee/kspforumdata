I run the game as usual, I get the main menu with options to resume my game, start a new game, training scenarios, etc. I click Resume and try to resume my save, but KSP closed on me after I clicked it. Now, I have a feeling that this may be related to two (2) crash issues I had this week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first one was a few days ago. It happened when I was flying my Duna expeditionary vessel and I had about 50 other active flights. My delta-V margins were pretty slim so I sent an engineer out on EVA to remove stuff that I didn\u0027t need. These don\u0027t get classified as debris but are considered unknown objects instead. I tried going into the tracking station to delete them but the game crashed there. I assumed that it was the game getting overloaded going from ~50 objects to 90\u002B in a span of about 5 minutes. I know it was more than 90 objects because the next time I played my save the following day, it said that I had more than 90 flights active. I went into the tracking station and destroyed those objects, bringing them back down to around 50 flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second time was also the day after the first crash. I delete all the unknown objects in the tracking station successfully and go back to fly around Kerbin because I recently installed Kerbin Side Remastered and wanted to check the new launch sites out. I spawned a plane from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and flew to my first destination just south of the Island Runway. It wasn\u0027t showing up on my launch sites list so I did some rejigging there with Kerbal Konstructs. It probably saved. However, my plane crashed and lost its engines taking off to continue on my journey, so I decided to recover it. The game crashed again a few seconds after I clicked \u0022Recover\u0022 from the top menu bar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat brings us to today, where I have 52 flights currently active (1 is probably that plane that crashed). I booted up KSP as usual, hit resume, and tried to play with my save, but the game crashed then and there without me ever seeing the space center. All these crashes have been almost instant, like the game doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s actually crashing\u2014no pinwheeling mouse cursor, no white screen, no \u0022KSP.exe has crashed and needs to restart!\u0022 messages at all. What\u0027s going on here? I have more than 100 mods, but that shouldn\u0027t be the cause here, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would provide my log file but it\u0027s more than 13 million characters and 92,000 lines long. I can\u0027t paste it anywhere without issue, so if anybody knows how to upload that, I\u0027ll edit this post accordingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"marxman28","CreatedById":229237,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-08T00:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBump, help pls\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
