HURRAY!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, I cannot figure out how to steer a compass heading. I will being going in a straight line and watch the nav ball heading stray all over the place.

Is the navball almost all blue? If so, the controlling part of your rover is rotated 90 degrees pitch-up from the direction you\u0027re driving, so it thinks the rover is rolling around on its back. As the vehicle tilts, the orientation of the navball will seem to flail around. You may not be able to fix it on that rover, but if you add a probe module or docking port at the \u0022front\u0022 of the rover in the VAB and send the modified version to Mun, you can later right-click on that and choose \u0022control form here,\u0022 and the navball will make sense again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: in this pic, there is a probe module facing up at the top of the rover, and another probe module facing forward at the front of the rover, and I switch to the lower one after detaching the rover at the destination. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2EcHtcS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222EcHtcS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-20T07:29:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2013 07:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T01:00:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
