Its on the heavy side with a takeoff weight of 40T but I had no problem getting it to 60K\u002B and 1600m/s two days ago, but now every time I hit about 12K it noses down. I\u0027ve tried changing the CoM and CoL relationship, as well as shifting the fuel locations to better balance the craft as it gets used up. Unfortunately the solution eludes me... Any help or tips would be appreciated, I\u0027ve torn it down about 50 times just adjusting mass-lift relationships but I just can\u0027t figure out where I went wrong. Normally the problems start at 11K, and 450-500m/s. Until that point I can climb at 45 degrees and still accelerate on just the jet engines. If I kick on the rocket engines early instead of at 20-25K when the jets flame out I can then pull the aircraft at any vertical inclination but it soon spirals out of control until it drops to about 8K at which point I can kick the jets back on and fly it back for a landing... Generally ASAS will have this thing fly at whatever elevation I tell it to, but nose down at about 11K. Once the rocket motors are lit ASAS will go nose up until its doing back flips all over the sky... It actually lifts off at about 80m/s a third of the way down the runway. I appreciate any tips or help you can give me, I know I need to keep lightening this thing and remove some extra struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs my CoM shifting and throwing off stability? Why didn\u0027t I have this issue before and why can\u0027t I fix it by altering tank positions to shift CoM and CoL?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it in some way aerodynamic? Do I not have enough flap to pull up even though I have them all trimmed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs my fat, overweight aircraft just to big?
