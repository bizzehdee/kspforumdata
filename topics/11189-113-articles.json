The only difference is the cargo attachment point and the relative wing position for aerodynamic re-balance based on the fairing setup.\n\n[https://kerbalx.com/Aeroboi/Hearts-Chevron-96-Cargo-Lifter-2375MC](https://kerbalx.com/Aeroboi/Hearts-Chevron-96-Cargo-Lifter-2375MC)(Picture above)  \n[https://kerbalx.com/Aeroboi/Hearts-Chevron-96-Cargo-Lifter-75MC](https://kerbalx.com/Aeroboi/Hearts-Chevron-96-Cargo-Lifter-75MC)  \n[https://kerbalx.com/Aeroboi/Hearts-Chevron-96-Cargo-Lifter-25MCP](https://kerbalx.com/Aeroboi/Hearts-Chevron-96-Cargo-Lifter-25MCP)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-31T11:27:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2019 11:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Aeroboi**"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-31T15:38:10Z","Content":"[@Aeroboi](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/186653-aeroboi/) thanks for sharing your large ship design.

Thanks for your mission reports and welcome to the K-Prize party guest list aka the roll of honour. Looks better with intact fairings IMHO.\n\u003E \n\nThank you, I finally feel successful in life.  \n\nI will use both badges as a sign of perseverance.  \n\nI agree with your opinion, it does look sleeker with the fairing.  \n\nThank you for this challenge, it has been great and very difficult simultaneously.  \n\nI will complete your other challenge soon.\n\nEDIT: It\u0027s way out of my league. Can you do me a favor and add my previous failed attempt with the original Infernal to the List of Infamy?  \n\nThanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-30T21:11:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2019 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by HyperDraco**"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-31T09:31:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, HyperDraco said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT: It\u0027s way out of my league.

The most vehicle effecting payload I\u0027ve used was a 4crew hab and half size 2.5m fuel take I used to take it around the mun on a flyby.

Did the craft reach orbit \u003E70km PE every time and land safely without losing parts x14 ?\n\n4.  Did the craft carry a payload to Kerbin orbit and release it every time X14 ?
