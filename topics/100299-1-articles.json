Please let me know what you think of it, if you would use it, if somebody alraedy made something like that, or just anything that pops to your mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be a site for \u0022personal plugin management\u0022 - features would go something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- you choose what plugins you use in your KSP and what KSP version you use\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- whenever new KSP version comes out, you can have a quick look there to see which plugins are available for the new version, and which are still not (would save you some time that you would have to use by manually looking at them)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- if you already upgraded a plugin, you would just check it off so it wouldn\u0027t tell you when a new version is available\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- unless it proves problematic, the community could decide \u0022when a plugin is compatible with new KSP\u0022, what plugins to include into the application (i.e. if it\u0027s not in the list, you can just add it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- of course all plugins in there would have link to their forum, curseforge and stuff, for faster information, downloads and stuff...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- if enough people use it, it would be a great source of plugin statistics - what plugins are used most, what plugin combinations are used etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think of it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T00:26:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDropping this in Add-On Affairs, as it seems to be discussing a third-party idea rather than something for our official sites \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, the idea of a \u0022download manager\u0022-type program specifically for KSP mods is something that\u0027s been brainstormed in the past, but I personally haven\u0027t really kept my finger on the pulse enough to know if anything concrete ever came out of those discussions.
