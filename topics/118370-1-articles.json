Did you account for that?\n\nIt only accounts for horizontal speed, and gravitational acceleration is not horizontal, so it\u0027s accurate. However, it\u0027s not optimal considering you\u0027ll have to burn off the vertical speed gained, but you have to do that anyway. It will put you on target however, and being much better than t=v/a, this means I don\u0027t have to eyeball the landing anymore. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n(Using mechjeb or other autopilots is not an option for me. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))\n\nAlso, if you you want to avoid the \u0022burn-horizontal-until-stop, then straight down at 70 m/s\u0022 thing, you can start a bit before 43 seconds to account for the loss of horizontal acceleration due due to pointing at the retrograde marker instead of the horizon.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI just realised, for those of you who use KER, this means setting a maneuver node that will kill your horizontal speed, and then looking at the \u0022time to burn\u0022 field in the orbital menu. Burn a few seconds before this should make it pretty accurate. Not as accurate as any autopilot, of course, but landing manually in kerbal is all the fun! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nActually, you don\u0027t burn for 43 seconds. 43 seconds is just the construed marker of time to node of when you should start the burn. The burn time (for horizontal movement) is actually double that at t=v/a=560/6.5=86 seconds. This means even more vertical speed will have built up, so you have to compensate more in the vertical, and probably begin even further ahead of \u0022time to burn\u0022.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T15:41:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LostOblivion**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T16:50:33Z","Content":"Yes, and that\u0027s why it\u0027s unoptimal - and why you should always take quite a bit more delta-V for landing than absolutely necessary.\n\nQuite recently I was in a situation where I underestimated my fuel amount needed (KER counted the delta-V of carried rovers into the total, and the way they were mounted and the way I was unable to pilot both at the same time made them useless for landing), I did have to perform one perfect suicide burn on the Mun to land the carrier with the rovers in one piece.\n\nLet me tell you no matter how precisely you estimate the time to surface at impact point of where your trajectory would bring you, the actual altitude of the landing site varies wildly depending on a fraction of second when you start the burn. I think I crashed into terrain past the edge of the crater good fifteen times, and crashed into the bottom of the crater another ten times before I got the timing good enough that I ran out of fuel only some 30 meters above the surface and with maybe 15m/s on the clock.
