Basically what I said before but you eject - it seems - on the prograde or retrograde side of Kerbin\u0027s orbit moving a bit radially sideways (and very slow) relative to Kerbin. If you eject prograde, you\u0027re moving inward toward Sonnah, so you natually speed up away from Kerbin and meet Aptur when it\u0027s on the inside track, 180 degrees (Relative to Sonnah) away. If you need to meet Aptur when it\u0027s outside Kerbin, you eject retrograde with some outward motion to keep yourself from speeding up and catching back up to Kerbin. It seems that the sweet spot is 5m/s more than you need to escape. You generally need about 760 from a 100x100 orbit, so I tested at 765 and it was perfect to get an encounter with a cheap (Like, 50-60 m/s) orbit insertion burn at Aptur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this time I actually did it to make sure and it worked like a charm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus, getting home for about 50-60m/s (from Orbit) seems pretty simple, and can be done most any time. All you need to do is set up the node and then use precise node to go forward a few orbits until you get a Kerbin encounter. That encounter will always be low speed, so your periapsis will be close (if not well in) the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m filling in my personal dV chart with LKO \u0026lt;#--760--\u0026gt; Escape \u0026lt;--5--\u0026gt; Aptur Transfer \u0026lt;--50--\u0026gt; Aptur orbit for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(# means aerobraking is possible)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-18T09:29:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2015 09:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Pandas","CreatedById":144476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T11:56:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zeropositivo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zeropositivo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have played over 500 hours of KSP, 60 hours into my NH carrer, and I STILL haven\u0027t figured out an easy way to get to Aptur (that doesn\u0027t involve changing my orbit to that of the mun, change inclination, and wait 3\u002B days for an encounter, for an average of 1500m/s \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V)\u003Cp\u003EI love the feeling of being a noob again\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe technique I used, (which i highly doubt is the most efficient, but at least it got me there), is I exited kerbin into orbit of sonnah, adjusted my inclination to match Aptur, then orbited around Sonnah until I was just far enough behind Aptur that I could set a waypoint that would intercept Aptur\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T13:14:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYay!

Basically what I said before but you eject - it seems - on the prograde or retrograde side of Kerbin\u0027s orbit moving a bit radially sideways (and very slow) relative to Kerbin. If you eject prograde, you\u0027re moving inward toward Sonnah, so you natually speed up away from Kerbin and meet Aptur when it\u0027s on the inside track, 180 degrees (Relative to Sonnah) away. If you need to meet Aptur when it\u0027s outside Kerbin, you eject retrograde with some outward motion to keep yourself from speeding up and catching back up to Kerbin. It seems that the sweet spot is 5m/s more than you need to escape.
