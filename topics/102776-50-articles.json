It seems that the sweet spot is 5m/s more than you need to escape.

All you need to do is set up the node and then use precise node to go forward a few orbits until you get a Kerbin encounter. That encounter will always be low speed, so your periapsis will be close (if not well in) the atmosphere.\n\nI\u0027m filling in my personal dV chart with LKO \u003C#--760--\u003E Escape \u003C--5--\u003E Aptur Transfer \u003C--50--\u003E Aptur orbit for now.\n\n(# means aerobraking is possible)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-18T09:29:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2015 09:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Pandas","CreatedById":144476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T11:56:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have played over 500 hours of KSP, 60 hours into my NH carrer, and I STILL haven\u0027t figured out an easy way to get to Aptur (that doesn\u0027t involve changing my orbit to that of the mun, change inclination, and wait 3\u002B days for an encounter, for an average of 1500m/s \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC V)\n\u003E I love the feeling of being a noob again\n\nThe technique I used, (which i highly doubt is the most efficient, but at least it got me there), is I exited kerbin into orbit of sonnah, adjusted my inclination to match Aptur, then orbited around Sonnah until I was just far enough behind Aptur that I could set a waypoint that would intercept Aptur"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T13:14:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yay!
