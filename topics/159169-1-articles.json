I absolutely love this game.\u00A0I feel like Squad hooked us up with an unlimited supply of super-powered LEGOs or something! The freedoms...\u00A0It\u0027s incredibly entertaining... but today I wish\u00A0to personally introduce RNG to my kraken-fist!\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, so here\u0027s the breakdown:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy ultimate goal is to vacation the surviv--\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E uh, I mean Kerbals\u00A0of my space program to Laythe. Naturally, there\u0027s a few things we\u0027ll need to truly enjoy ourselves on Laythe... You know, boats, jets, spider-bots and submersibles... the usual. However, for ease of transit and a larger margin of error, I decided that a Minmus refueling station would be, not only necessary, but PERFECT for such a feat. Not only does the super-low gravity prove simple to beat, but Minmus is also the furthest satellite from Kerbin, naturally\u00A0nullifying a great deal of the deltaV required to escape Kerbin\u0027s gravity. That\u0027s going to come in handy with this career later, as well, considering my plans of sending many heavy toys to Laythe to play with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebs and Vals, I assure you I have done similar\u00A0Minmus bases\u00A0before, many times in past, now-deleted game saves. Never ONCE was I disappointed until this very evening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter starting a new career and establishing a communications\u00A0constellation around both Kerbin and then Minmus, spending a few hours in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E designing a beautifully mobile and minimalistic Minmus refueling\u00A0base, then building the launcher for it, it was finally time to send a probe to survey the minty planet. I didn\u0027t. Instead, I tested out the full potential of the refueler, from launch to landing to ensure a later success. After a near-perfect flight, I landed the base safe and sound, ultimately deciding it was no test flight at all.\u00A0No time later, that surveyor\u00A0launch was underway, and without failings of any kind (other than my inefficient piloting.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E) Soaring over the north pole of Minmus, my capture burn was a success, so I deployed the probe\u0027s scanners in haste, ready to move on with the next phase of the operation. I could always move the refueler to the nearest ore concentration, if necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd RNG kicked me right where the sun don\u0027t shine. Minmus was practically dried up. No more than 4% ore content at the hottest concentration, and that makes mining ore ridiculously lengthy, no matter how many BadS, 5-star engineers you have aboard. I\u0027ll time-warp through a day of mining, sure. No problem. Warping through years of mining? Forget it. It\u0027s one thing to have to stop the drills so the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E can catch up... it\u0027s a whole \u0027nother headache to stop the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and wait for ore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood thing I have so much experience in starting careers from scratch, because this will be the fastest-deleted game save I\u0027ve ever started... having only spent about 6 hours in total, from beginning launch to surveying the prune that is\u00A0Minmus. Hopefully the career I just started will be more like what I\u0027m used to seeing-- averaging around 12% ore concentration, and generally in the Flats areas, where landing is even easier...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck to you, my fellow kerbonauts!
