I imagine this has been covered before. And I\u0027ve also read my fair share of relative forum posts, but I was kinda hoping to get some input and perhaps write up a specific run-down of events and the corresponding calculations. So, lemme get to the point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow does one plan their lander / rover missions?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore specifically, I\u0027m wanting to know how to most efficiently calculate the minimum TWR and DeltaV necessary so that the most efficient process is the starting point. We\u0027re all familiar with the whole \u0022MOAR THRUST!!\u0022 approach to getting things done, or simple trial and error and rough estimation.

A nifty calculation that uses a great many of the basic equations necessary for this kind of rudimentary space flight planning. Through this you can make a considerably accurate estimate of battery life and solar recharging rate requirements.

I just think it\u0027d be cool to have as simple a break-down as possible for say, Minmus and or the Mun, for KSP\u0027ers like my son. I\u0027m just kinda curious if I\u0027m missing anything, or if anyone has a point in the right direction to this already done to some extent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T01:58:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best example I have made is in the design of \u0022Long Tom\u0022, in chapter 5 of the tutorial in my signature. But then the whole 100-odd pages is about how to plan and design for missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically it talks about what has to be recovered at Kerbin, what it takes to get that back from Mun/Minmus, what\u0027s needed to land it, what to get it there and, as a separate launch-vehicle, what it takes to get that into orbit in the first place. Summary: I recommend planning in five stages, backwards through recovery, return, landing, transfer and launch. Building one rocket-stage per mission stage is a matter of preference; launch vehicles are usually large enough to require more than one stage while even a convenient transfer stage can also complete the landing, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t bother too much with orbital darkness - your vehicle is going to be spending a lot more time without sunlight while it\u0027s on the surface and, if it\u0027s a rover, will need a lot more while driving than while in space. You also need to plan for coming out of Mun\u0027s shadow, for instance, slap into a solar eclipse courtesy of Kerbin, which lasts until your next orbit. If you do specifically want to cover that point I wouldn\u0027t concentrate on Kerbin-system because even a z100 battery is sufficient for most light vehicles. Maybe talk about the comparative effectiveness of solar panels out at Eeloo orbital distance from the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR is also only a significant issue when you\u0027re launching through an atmosphere - everywhere else it\u0027s \u0026gt;1 for launch and \u0027as low as your boredom threshold allows\u0027 for transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
