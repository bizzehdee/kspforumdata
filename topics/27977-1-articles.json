The thing is that this is slightly unbalanced. By a ridiculous small thing. And This is rather large, so the best way to send it would be via skycrane. But it being unbalanced makes the whole thing tilt to the side, and impossible to land. So I just wanted to know if anyone got times on how making this better balanced nad making it flyable and if there would be a better way to send it to prevent the spinning out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T21:35:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdeally you want your center of thrust lined up with your center of mass as close to perfect as possible.

I\u0027ve been fine tuning the components to the closest possible I can get, trying to align the center of mass directly in the middle. What I\u0027ve been doing is what has been said above, putting a decoupler, a truss and then a skycrane, all with gimbal. I tried using 4 rockomax 24-77, and it was always tilting somewhere after a few meters in the air. And then I tried with the two larger radial engines, the white ones, I never remember their name, and again it was going off course. I did have an ASAS, and it was pushing the yaw to the max. It\u0027s a single millimeter off and the who thing goes out of control. The thing is if I want to land with it, I don\u0027t want it to start going sideways in the descent... And I planned to send only one, it\u0027S a single rover mission. I thought about strapping two of them to a rocket to even it, but The second one wouldn\u0027t be needed .-. I\u0027ll take more pictures and post them\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T02:43:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your engines are higher than your center of mass, gimballing engines attempt to correct in the wrong direction.

Up went to down, down to up and left right inversed just as much.
