This requires docking which I\u0027m still familiarising myself with. However, I\u0027m encountering an issue which I have trouble explaining. I\u0027ve built a simple demonstrator craft which has a command pod and a lander can, both with docking ports. I get it into LKO, decouple, so that I can then spin the lander can around and try to dock it. The moment I decouple, the command pod starts spinning (no pitch or yaw it would seem, just spin) like crazy, with or without SAS on. Any suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T19:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPhantom forces like this are sometimes caused by clipping parts.
