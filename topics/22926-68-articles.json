It doesn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t matter which mod you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ve installed. At a certain amount of parts I think the game stops loading parts and stops showing parts inside the VAB/SPH. As I see in the debug toolbar the game loads every texture, but not every model. The part counter stops around 930.
