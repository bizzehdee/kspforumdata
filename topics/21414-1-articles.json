But now the crew is still in the ocean and I already launched another crew in space in orbit. For some reason, I figured if I just went back to teh space center it would automatically bring back the original pod and crew. I noticed after I lauched, there was a second pod on the map view.

When you return to space center from a flight, your other flight stays in operation. You have to select end flight to return the pilots and remove the pod from the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
