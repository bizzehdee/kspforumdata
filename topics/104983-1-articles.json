There are a ton of things that can be different from launch to launch, aerodynamics can give you lift but also drag, and dropping stages and changing throttles manually can make differences too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I just do a launch or two (or 85) and see how much dV I have at the start and once I\u0027m in orbit. Then I tweak so my launcher has a little bit less than that amount (so it falls back into the atmosphere). Then I do a launch or two (or 85) to make sure the changes I made didn\u0027t affect the dV to orbit very much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

Just look up the Goddard problem, for example. Let\u0027s just say it\u0027s not something that was solved with mathematics at the undergraduate college level. It is very dependent on things like your TWR and how it changes as you burn fuel, and when you stage (and how that affects your TWR), as well as how much drag your rocket experiences at each stage and point in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, it\u0027s hard enough to estimate delta-v needed on \u003Cem\u003Eairless\u003C/em\u003E bodies.
