There are a ton of things that can be different from launch to launch, aerodynamics can give you lift but also drag, and dropping stages and changing throttles manually can make differences too.\n\nPersonally, I just do a launch or two (or 85) and see how much dV I have at the start and once I\u0027m in orbit. Then I tweak so my launcher has a little bit less than that amount (so it falls back into the atmosphere). Then I do a launch or two (or 85) to make sure the changes I made didn\u0027t affect the dV to orbit very much."},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

Just look up the Goddard problem, for example. Let\u0027s just say it\u0027s not something that was solved with mathematics at the undergraduate college level. It is very dependent on things like your TWR and how it changes as you burn fuel, and when you stage (and how that affects your TWR), as well as how much drag your rocket experiences at each stage and point in time.\n\nHeck, it\u0027s hard enough to estimate delta-v needed on *airless* bodies. Just look at some of the delta-v maps that have been made for KSP. Boy was I in for a surprise when I tried to land on Tylo using the recommended Delta-V on those (hint - they were way off compared to how I built my landers)."},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

Obviously in real life you\u0027re not gonna be doing that, so you have to keep that in mind."},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T00:50:30Z","Content":"By usual consens in the forum it takes about 4500 m/s to get from Kerbins Spaceport to a 70x70km orbit.\n\nTo get from a 70x70km to a 70x450km orbit it takes a single burn with about 236 m/s.\n\nTo get from a 70x450km to a 200x450km orbit it takes a single burn at 450km with about 83 m/s.\n\nSo in sum you will need about 4500 \u002B 236 \u002B 83 = 4819 m/s of Delta-V to get into a 200x450km orbit.\n\nI used the [Vis-Viva equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation) to calculate the needed Delta-V for the two transferburns.\n\nIt might be the case that a direct launch to the target orbit needs a bit less Detla-V but it should be of the same magnitude."}]}
