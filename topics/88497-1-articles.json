Like the X-1 - X-15 planes? I mean these are key parts of the development of the space program. Im talking a FASAesquie pack with really good replicas of classic rocket planes that started the American Space program on its path to the moon. I am not a modder or a coder. I am strictly a consumer but would anyone be willing to take up this task? Im not talking about stock replicas. I am talking about high fidelity replicas of the X-1, X-2, X-15 and even a B-29 that could drop the vehicles just like in real life. I feel that would be a really awesome pack of models and it would probably be very popular. With FASA, all the soviet and American Probes, Soviet Stations, American Stations, being available, I think if someone wanted to play out an historical type of sandbox mode having the rocket planes would be a cool addition.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voidryder","CreatedById":57308,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T21:17:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI echo the desire for a quality X-15 replica and reasons.
