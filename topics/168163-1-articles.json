This doesn\u0027t seem to be an issue on Kerbin, where day/night cycles appear to be working fine, but the Mun is just as dark during the day as at night. I can play with the vacuum ambient light turned up to see, but it doesn\u0027t look great that way. Has anybody seen this issue before? I\u0027ve searched these forums and Google but nothing turned up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can post my full mod list once I get home, just thought I\u0027d check if someone knew what causes this off the top of their head. I am playing with Kerbol Star Systems with up-to-date Kopernicus and I had scatterer/eve/planetshine installed until I removed them to try and troubleshoot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: The solution was found, the problem was due to the new\u00A0Kopernicus update not being fully compatible with KSS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-03T20:44:14Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2017 08:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Lifeisgreasy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
