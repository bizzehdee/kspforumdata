I like to use girders to space things when this is happening, it also gives more parts for f3 to squawk about. Parts that are clipping into each other can also react with violent disapproval when they are loaded like this, just because they dont mind being merged in flight, doesnt mean they wont blow if 1 shifts and the other doesnt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T12:52:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at this.
