I\u0027m sitting on the launch pad with engines deactivated and the throttle at zero, yet the thing\u0027s belching smoke like nobody\u0027s bidness. \\*\\*edit: I\u0027ve just tested all of my engine welds, and they all do this.\n\n![sI3MKrSh.png](http://i.imgur.com/sI3MKrSh.png)\n\nSecondly, I was wondering if someone could advise as to how to create a drag cube for my centrifuge that makes it challenging to launch to orbit, but not impossible. Essentially I\u0027d like my absurdly unrealistic drag cube as realistic as possible without eliminating all possibility of getting it aloft. It\u0027s about 12m in diameter I believe.\n\n![jmnKUDBh.png](http://i.imgur.com/jmnKUDBh.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T04:02:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 04:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by little square dot**"},{"CreatedByName":"little square dot","CreatedById":42920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T02:12:42Z","Content":"Also, my welded capsules are sinking in the water, which they certainly didn\u0027t do pre-1.0.

Via MODEL{} you can position, rotate, stretch and scale stock parts to your heart\u0027s content.\n\nIn regards to FAR, FAR might be a good testing ground to quickly gauge what he should be aiming for, but that brings him no closer to getting it to work under stock aero.\n\n@little square dot, I dunno enough about how the drag cubes work to give sound advice. When you do get it, however, I would be much curious so I can apply similar properties to my welded meteoroid shield."}]}
