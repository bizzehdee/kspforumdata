I have never successfully landed on Moho and returned to date, I always somehow underestimate the delta V needed. So having taken a bit of inspiration from the original Project Mercury I present\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EProject Moho\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe team at KSC after a hard nights celebrating of their first semi successful unmanned sub orbital flight have announced that their next project is big one. We are going to Moho. Unfortunately in the cold light of day after the hangovers cleared they realized what they had committed themselves to. But if you are going to have a first manned mission then why not make it a big one\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Challenge\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will recruit 6 new rookie Kerbonauts, (This must be their first flight) and send them to land on 6 different biomes (with all 6 on the ground at the same time) of Moho and return them safely to Kerbin. However as Project Moho is the first manned mission being carried out by the new team at KSC there are a number of limitations that apply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommand Pod Mk1 only \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 No external seats, no lander cans, no hitchhikers, the Command Pod has been specially developed for Project Moho and it would be a shame not to use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo docking \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 The techniques for rendezvousing and docking have not been practiced yet and there is no funding to fly the missions to train anyone. This means 1 launch only, and what they land on Moho in must get them back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo SAS modules \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 You are welcome to use the SAS built into the Command Pod but no further assistance is permitted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo probe cores \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Due to the concerns raised during the unmanned mission it has been declared that everything is to be actively manned at all times, and there is to be no reliance on automation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo Ion engines \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 The wonders of Xenon have not yet been harnessed by the time that Project Moho starts so Ion propulsion is not available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll 6 on the ground at the same time \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Obviously I am not seeking synchronised landings but I do require a synchronised Moho walk\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

You can hack science points and funds in a new savegame to have all parts and enough money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. All Kerbals must be rookies and must do all their travel in a Command Pod Mk1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. All the landings must include a spacewalk and each spacewalk must include a picture showing absolute time. To show that all are outside at the same time I will expect to see a picture of each Kerbal taken within 1 minute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.

All major events must be documented: This includes the ship in the VAB, the launch, and every 30s of the ascent at both Kerbin and Moho, every maneuvre node on the way to Moho, sufficient pictures of Moho capture to get a real feeling for it, 3 or 4 of the descent process and any others you feel help explain whats happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11.
