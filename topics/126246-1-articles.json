There should just be one, \u0026#39;rocket fuel\u0026#39; (along with liquid/jet fuel and mono-propellant). If different engines used different ratios, or there was a tank that held only oxidiser, or they were they were different densities, then it would make some sense or have some function. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I think would be interesting is have different engines use different ratios, and fuel and oxidiser have different densities. Tanks would have a fixed volume and could be filled with any combination of fuel resources you want upto that volume (this is what would happen in real life anyway). But I\u0026#39;m certain this will [I]never[/I] happen in stock, so why not just scrap seperate fuel/oxidiser and have \u0026#39;rocket fuel\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;jet fuel\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;monopropellant\u0026#39; etc?\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-23T06:53:48Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2015 06:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jf0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T08:13:18Z","Content":"\nBecause there are situations where after SSTO spaceplanes deorbit itself it would still have some rocket fuel (read: correct mix of oxidiser and liquid fuel) left where it actually wants to use the liquid fuel for its air breathing engines to extend the atmospheric flight range, in addition to any pure jet fuel storage it has remaining after climbing to orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSame with nukes.
