Solution seems\u00A0simple, allow\u00A0players to create their own categories and sub categories and place vessels in to categories.\u00A0Making this visible in map view and tracking station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrent categorization structure becomes unmanageable very quickly, and it is very annoying to keep looking for that vessel you put in orbit of ike and just cant find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least allow separate categorization via orbiting body, ie - select Duna and show vessels only relating to Duna in their respective categories, or select Ike and see only relevant vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally I think you should be able to create thumbnail for your vessel and have it appear in map and tracking station if vessel is selected, so you can easily identify it visually. This opens the ability to identify and even rename and re-categorize\u00A0vessels from tracking station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here are my suggestions to the point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) When in map or tracking station, player can open category interface and add categories, vessels could be droped in to category or subcategory. For example, I can create category called Communications Network, and then create sub category for Jool then place some communications satellites\u00A0that are in Jools SOF in that category. I can also disable whole category from being displayed on the map, so these satellites do not interfere with orbital maneuver planing, but they can be found quickly when needed. I think this level of control for player in required for career mode to truly develop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Taking picture of the vessel and making that available in Map and tracking station view, ability to take screenshot that disables interface and ties the photo to given vessel. This photo can then be seen in map and tracking station view for easy identification.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-04T15:46:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be a very cool idea.
