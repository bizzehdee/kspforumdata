RCS placement is a design task and I want to be able to place them where I want \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhile\u003C/strong\u003E scratching my head to reduce the total number. If I have a long block of two modules, I\u0027d rather try to place just a set in the middle instead of one on each part, or one set on each part rather than two sets on each part\u0027s ends. Additionally, I don\u0027t think every module should be RCS-capable on its own. Finally, you would need a unmanned command module each time you want to control a FusTek module. I prefer keeping thrust, flight control and miscellaneous facilities well separated. If I build a symetric station with no RCS on the modules, and later want to add some, then it\u0027s time to rethink the design and either upgrade (replace) the modules were RCS would be optimal, or expand the station by adding small RCS engines and command modules in strategic locations.\u003Cp\u003ETo build stations without RCS thrusters on the modules, in order to keep the part count as low as possible, I\u0027ve used a reusable RCS robot, with adjustable RCS position to match the center of mass of the object to move (see below), and I\u0027d be frustrated if such strategies would become useless/counterintuitive if all FusTek parts were autonomous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://reho.st/http://i.imgur.com/lmJ1UpSl.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://reho.st/http://i.imgur.com/lmJ1UpSl.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://reho.st/http://i.imgur.com/QeM49Vhl.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://reho.st/http://i.imgur.com/QeM49Vhl.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://reho.st/http://i.imgur.com/ZUlp5AMl.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://reho.st/http://i.imgur.com/ZUlp5AMl.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also prefer having mini-tugs / robot arms help assemble my stations.
