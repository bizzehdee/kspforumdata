They allow you to reach M 4.8 at 20km with the help of the RAPIER and then Nukes they will give thrust until 40 km at Mach 5.5 , even in rare atmosphere, because the speed you reach will give enough air to the engines. Shutting down RAPIER at 24km and lighting Nukes you will reach orbit without burning only fuel. There is an Oxy reserve you can use with RAPIER.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97525-1-0-4-WIP-OPT-Space-Plane-v1-7](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97525-1-0-4-WIP-OPT-Space-Plane-v1-7)\n\nThe SSTO is equipped with Karbonite detector,drillers and converter in another hold and is completely autonomous, provided you launched a Scansat satellite to search for Karbonite. With this device, you do not need any refinery nor installation. You can fly directly to Laythe, launch a ScanSat satellite to detect Karbonite and then land, mine and refuel. Drillers are deployed by mean of Infernal robotic rails and hinges. The SSTO and all wings are reinforced with struts.\n\nIt is modulable, you can replace hold by Mk2 passengers parts or equipped hold with science..;etc....\n\nShare and explanations in my kerbalX later.\n\n[![616739screenshot0.png](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/616739screenshot0.png)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=616739screenshot0.png)\n\n[![548223screenshot8.png](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/548223screenshot8.png)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=548223screenshot8.png)\n\n[![325796screenshot14.png](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/325796screenshot14.png)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=325796screenshot14.png)\n\n[![793065screenshot21.png](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/793065screenshot21.png)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=793065screenshot21.png)\n\n[![922088screenshot42.png](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/922088screenshot42.png)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=922088screenshot42.png)\n\nAlbum here\n\n[http://www.hostingpics.net/album/gilflo-248925.html](http://www.hostingpics.net/album/gilflo-248925.html)\n\n[http://www.hostingpics.net/slideshow,gilflo,248925.html](http://www.hostingpics.net/slideshow,gilflo,248925.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T15:09:55Z","Content":"I\u0027m amazed nobody commented on this.

It\u0027s doable, I think (heck, my Javelin would do it even if it has to be by way of Minmus), but the payload fraction must be abysmal.\n\nRune.
