that will save you a bit of fuel, as well.\u00A0 If you could miraculously start at a higher circular orbit--for example, 250 km instead of 80 km--then it would cost less fuel to go to the Mun from that higher orbit because you\u0027re already partway there.\u00A0\u00A0However, since all rockets ultimately start from the launchpad, the total cost is higher to start from a 250 km orbit because it costs fuel to circularise that 250 km orbit, which is an extra, unnecessary step.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThere are situations where it would be to your benefit to start from a higher orbit, drop down to 75 km, and make the bulk of your burn there, but they still have\u00A0the problem of getting to that higher orbit in the first place.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI will add that in addition to the extra fuel efficiency involved in capturing to low Mun orbit (it\u0027s called the Oberth effect, as already mentioned, and is worth about two semesters\u0027 worth of study in itself), it sets up a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0more fuel efficient landing to begin in low Mun orbit.\u00A0 That may seem counter-intuitive, because while you\u0027re lower in altitude, you are also moving much faster, but it\u0027s true.\u00A0 Your orbital motion\u00A0is a combination of components, and for a snapshot of a tiny piece of your orbit (the piece which you will use for landing), we can approximate those components as vertical and horizontal.\u00A0 Perhaps you\u0027ve heard the analogy of an orbit as moving sideways quickly enough as you fall that you miss the ground (because it curves away under you), but the point is that horizontal velocity doesn\u0027t cause you to hit the ground unless you set your periapsis too low and find a mountain.\u00A0 You can dissipate it largely at your leisure; so long as you keep a balance between it and the vertical component, you will have easy landings.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EVertical velocity, on the other hand, is a problem, because it does cause you to hit the ground, and, what\u0027s more, it keeps increasing because of that whole gravity thing.\u00A0 Some people get the wrong idea about Mun landings and take their landers to high orbit where the orbital velocity is low, cancel that velocity with a tiny burn, and simply fall whilst trusting their engines to keep them from crashing.\u00A0 The problem with that is that it\u0027s extraordinarily difficult to get that correct, and while the initial de-orbit burn is cheap, you end up burning to fight gravity nearly the entire trip down.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIf you come in to a low orbit and burn to cancel your horizontal velocity, then it will stop you dead with as little as 100 metres left to drop to land.\u00A0 That is a lot more controllable and you don\u0027t need to fight gravity nearly so much.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-03T14:58:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2019 02:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-03T21:17:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmong other reasons, #2 will save you \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Efuel\u003C/abbr\u003E braking into orbit thanks to Herr Oberth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-04T11:51:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223628702\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186021\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221562122763\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/3/2019 at 3:59 AM, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 is better for fuel, both for arriving and leaving and landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 is called a \u0022free return trajectory\u0022.
