More generally, Luke is now a legend to that new generation of Force users. He\u0027s the Last Jedi that saved the Rebellion through nothing but pure mastery of the Force.\u00A0And because he\u0027s dead, he\u0027ll always be remembered for his strengths, his triumphs and what he was perceived to stand for.

Bear in mind that we\u0027ve only ever seen the Jedi from their own point of view and very rarely from anybody else\u0027s. It\u0027s slightly trite but one person\u0027s Freedom Fighter is another person\u0027s Terrorist. \u00A0We don\u0027t ever find out how the Jedi came to be guardians of peace and justice for over a thousand generations, or what their version of peace and justice really entailed. Justice is another notoriously slippery concept. Even on Earth, concepts of justice vary quite widely - imagine extrapolating that to a Galaxy of thousands of star systems and hundreds of sentient species. Now I\u0027m quite prepared to believe that the Jedi ideals\u00A0didn\u0027t include outright rule by fear and blowing up planets with super-weapons but at the end of the day, being the arbiters of peace and justice in the Galaxy does mean that you\u0027re imposing your will on the Galaxy. \u00A0Likewise we only see the Sith in one light and we only really see one extreme example of the Sith.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Obi-Wan said, the truths we cling to depend very much on our point of view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, yes,\u00A0the films present the Jedi as the Good Guys and the Sith as the Bad Guys but you don\u0027t have to think about that for very long to see that it\u0027s a simplistic generalisation at best, presented from one point of view. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 Consider the Sith Code for example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPeace is a lie.

It\u0027s by no means the only one though. \u003Cem\u003EThrough Passion, I gain Strength\u003C/em\u003E. This could equally well apply to the Rebel Alliance. They have their cause to fight for and it gives them strength. \u003Cem\u003EThrough Strength I gain Power.\u003C/em\u003E A bit of a truism - and power to do what? Power doesn\u0027t necessarily mean power over others. It could be the power to inspire (as Luke became). It could be power over ignorance and fear. \u003Cem\u003EThrough Power, I gain Victory\u003C/em\u003E - again victory doesn\u0027t have to be the victory of the conquering army.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the last lines are really ambiguous. They imply an overcoming of personal limitations but without knowing what those limitations are or what a person does once they\u0027ve overcome their limitations, it\u0027s hard to see those lines as unambiguously good or evil. In fact you could you could apply almost of all of that Code to Luke\u0027s personal journey in the Original Trilogy and latterly in Episode VIII.\u00A0He certainly overcame his limitations as a Force user and in the end the Force did free him, as it did to Yoda, Qui-Gonn, Anakin and Obi-Wan.

Justice is another notoriously slippery concept. Even on Earth, concepts of justice vary quite widely - imagine extrapolating that to a Galaxy of thousands of star systems and hundreds of sentient species. Now I\u0027m quite prepared to believe that the Jedi ideals\u00A0didn\u0027t include outright rule by fear and blowing up planets with super-weapons but at the end of the day, being the arbiters of peace and justice in the Galaxy does mean that you\u0027re imposing your will on the Galaxy. \u00A0Likewise we only see the Sith in one light and we only really see one extreme example of the Sith.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Obi-Wan said, the truths we cling to depend very much on our point of view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, yes,\u00A0the films present the Jedi as the Good Guys and the Sith as the Bad Guys but you don\u0027t have to think about that for very long to see that it\u0027s a simplistic generalisation at best, presented from one point of view. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 Consider the Sith Code for example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPeace is a lie.

They imply an overcoming of personal limitations but without knowing what those limitations are or what a person does once they\u0027ve overcome their limitations, it\u0027s hard to see those lines as unambiguously good or evil. In fact you could you could apply almost of all of that Code to Luke\u0027s personal journey in the Original Trilogy and latterly in Episode VIII.\u00A0He certainly overcame his limitations as a Force user and in the end the Force did free him, as it did to Yoda, Qui-Gonn, Anakin and Obi-Wan.

The peace of the Jedi is the peace of a droid army - emotionless, ruled by passionless logic, with every individual in their correct place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL: DR, \u00A0I think any characterisation of Jedi values as Peace and the Sith values as Murder, is a bit simplistic. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Also most of this is just me thinking aloud.

Wasn\u0027t it Kylo who told her that? Wouldn\u0027t he have good reason to lie to her? To make up some BS in an attempt to undermine her confidence? We\u0027ve seen that Kylo is a master of deception in the way he simultaneously positioned the light saber in his hand along with the one on Snoke\u0027s throne\u0027s arm rest to face both his enemies.

If I say it,\u00A0your reaction would be similar too Rey\u0027s she is terrified. Plus we see that in Force Awakens in her vision that a ship drops her off and the chubby food guy grabs her. All evidence based on her reaction, Kylo, and the Vision point to it being true.
