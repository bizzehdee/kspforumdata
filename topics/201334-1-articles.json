That were the most basic ones I managed to get running on 1.8.1. Now I wanna move up to at least the latest version where BDarmory works and many more of its addons too like the nuclear thingies, along with the said previous mods and NEAR, but I cannot find them/some I managed to find were scattered on different websites.\u00A0 Is there any place I can get the latest version of them, without doing the manual moving of files (I have heard of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, but I havent ever used it) and some advices too since its been a long time since I last played.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
