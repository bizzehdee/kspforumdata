But when I command KOS to turn a certain direction it seems unable to do it. It just doesn\u0027t turn. Even though i can manually turn the rocket KOS cant without the reaction wheels. Also when i look at the gimbal when KOS is controlling it it seems to jiggle wildly. When giving KOS control of RCS it just fires them all in every direction and the rocket doesnt turn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it really not able to control rocket gimbals?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T06:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC kOS was never officially updated for .23.
