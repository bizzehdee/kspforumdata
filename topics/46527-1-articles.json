In the end, what really matters is \u003Cstrong\u003Eenergy\u003C/strong\u003E. It takes energy to change speed, and energy to move radially in a gravitational field. There are various ways you can express that energy budget, and delta-V is one of them. The reason it\u0027s used a lot is because \u003Cem\u003Edelta-V is a measurement that is independent of the vehicle mass, or the celestial body you\u0027re circling\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course you could say \u0022you need 25 MJ/kg to get into orbit\u0022 or \u0022It takes 75 Ns per kg in one g\u0022 or whatever, but in the end delta-v is a measurement that allows you to quickly figure out what you\u0027ll need with the only variable left being the mass of your spacecraft (and a few more things \u003Cem\u003Eabout\u003C/em\u003E your spacecraft if you want to figure out how much fuel you need to burn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you have to keep in mind is that it\u0027s a shortcut for energy calculations. A low Kerbin orbit needs on orbital speed of, say, 2200 m/s, and a higher orbit only needs 1500 m/s. But you\u0027ll also be in a higher orbit and that takes energy too, which is why going from one to the other takes for instance 200 m/s delta-V, despite the fact that you end up going \u003Cem\u003Eslower\u003C/em\u003E when all is said and done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lego8_bit","CreatedById":58076,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T17:27:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok Delta T Delta A Delta V are Time, Acceleration, and velocity this is basic physics and physical science on a college level if you want to calculate for speed its for expamle V=D/T\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T17:34:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nairou\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nairou\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks, that part makes sense.
