However, despite physics being improved compared to the first version of the program, there are probably more accurate and comprehensive simulators out there. I have had a look around and could come up with several that seem to have various goals and performance when it comes to physics and graphics. I found programs like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.mpl3d.com/index2.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMPL3D\u003C/a\u003E, which seems like a Universe Sandbox competitor, and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.astrograv.co.uk/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAstroGrav\u003C/a\u003E, which seems a little more concerned with accurate physics and less with a snazzy user interface. Of course, another option is to write something yourself, but that is something easier said than done if you want to do it right and probably overshooting the mark a little bit for most people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can imagine more people have been tinkering with this, so I curious what you came up with.

It does not have to run real-time - maybe it is even better if it does not - and graphics are required only as far as they are needed to view results in an understandable manner. Of course, it should be capable of running on (fast) consumer grade hardware, no sense in fiddling with something that can only be run on supercomputers or large farms (although I would love to hear about software that does).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-28T22:17:04Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2014 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-12T17:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know people are fooling around with these, so I would love to hear what you are using \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mangekyou-sama","CreatedById":83517,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T17:17:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELately I\u0027ve been playing with Universe Sandbox 2 for my simulations (featured in my other thread).
