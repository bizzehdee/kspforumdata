(For example: USI MKS parts distinct mostly in inscriptions on their walls).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) To edit a cfg file and to attach an existing 3d model is much easier than to create a 3d model from scratch. Especially without any artistic talent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, looks like a special (detail\u002Bplugin) mod would be useful: a Wall Plaque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI.e. like a flag, but a plaque. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBasically\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simple 3d-model and a popup window where you can edit description text and maybe (and would be cool) select an image or texture \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC as Procedural Parts textures).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlacing in VAB/SPH (but maybe also with KAS \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC no matter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditing content as a flag text or a procedural texture is being edited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHovering it with a mouse you can see a tooltip with description.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking from aside you see either image/texture, or text, or at least a color \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC and can quickly distinguish them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPurpose\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u003Cstrong\u003EDistinguish similar modules.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A long, long time ago there were three little piglets: Jeb, Bill and Bob. And they had built three cabins\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you build three similar cabins, placing a plaque on each of them, then write \u0022Jeb\u0022, \u0022Bill\u0022, \u0022Bob\u0022 and select some image or color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see by image, text or color which cabin belongs to which piglet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.\u003Cstrong\u003ECreating custom modules\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay, you use USI and its really useful converter plugins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to add some ingenious technology. For example, convert Biomass to Whiskey, and then convert Whiskey to LqdFuel. Or to convert Compost into PlasticBricks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo problem adding a Whiskey resource. Conversion also is no problem: you can add Roverdude\u0027s modules in cfg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut your hands are too wry (as mine are) to create 3d model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, instead of asking: \u0022please, make me a Biomass-to-Whiskey plant model\u0022, \u0022please, make me a Whiskey-to-LqdFuel plant model\u0022 you just:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Create cfg files for any part you need;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Write a path to, say, a stock ScienceLab model \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC so no additional textures used;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Write into cfg all (conversion) plugin modules you want;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Invoke you part in VAB/SPH;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Place a plaque on its wall and describe there, what this station module is: \u0022Whiskey plant\u0022, \u0022Compost bricketing facility\u0022, etc. And select some visual sign as an image/texture or at least a color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you have added to stock just a plaque model \u0026amp; textures, but your station has gotten a wide set of technological modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUgly? No, a standard.
