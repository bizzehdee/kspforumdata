First post on the forum (besides the introductory one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering, is there a way to do mass relays that launch a small spaceship into a transfer window? Cause I\u0027m tired of planning and doing calculations and then having a failed mission xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I only use stock so I don\u0027t have things as kerbal engineer or mechjeb (I like to play it like that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final idea is to have two kerbalian mass relays, one in kerbin, and the other in duna. The small spaceship goes into the mass relay, and travels into duna. then it uses the duna one to get back into Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m doing one already for fun, with kerbodyne engines \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?

I\u0027d recomend testing how far you can launch a test weight with that giant kerbodyne engine. The big problem with mass relays is size(no pun intended). How much velocity the launched craft picks up depends on its mass vs the thrust of the engine. the heavier it gets the less distance you get. Unfortunatly its hard to scale up relays as keeping the mass down necesitates a small craft. a tiny craft may not be big enough to be hit by more than a single engine. Makeing it biger to be hit by more adds mass reduceing the benifit of extra engines. you might also send the craft off at an unexpected angle if you use more than a single mass relay engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T11:12:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to go out on a limb here and say incredibly impractical, probably impossible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust get a small, non-invasive mod (KER) and quickly check it now and again. There are online tools (a quick Google) for calculating Phase Angles if you don\u0027t want to add Mechjeb.
