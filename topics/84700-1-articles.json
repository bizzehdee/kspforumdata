The thing is though that if there\u0027s a new or important contact (like the explore ones) then it\u0027ll take priority, so it\u0027s not like the repetitive ones are blocking you from getting a good contact. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad are still tweaking the contract system so I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s any changes planned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
