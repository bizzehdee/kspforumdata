Normally the entire craft spontaneously ceases to exist, but in this case I managed to somewhat mitigate that outcome by pausing immediately after quickloading and unpausing after a few seconds. Turns out that every single time I quickload this particular instance, the Big-S inevitably falls off after a few seconds.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso to note, this craft used to completely destroy itself half the time I teleported it to Derbin\u0027s surface.\u00A0 The flight logs indicated that the wheels had collided into the fuel tanks (to be fair, they were clipped into each other, but the catastrophic collapse only happened about half the time.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParadoxically, I managed to (so far, anyways) completely prevent this from happening by moving the rear landing gear outboard, which apparently prevents the landing gear from \u0022colliding\u0022 with any other part of the craft.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am no physics expert in this game, but I thought the collisions were taking place due to a part falling off and then colliding with another part. In contrast to this hypothesis, just moving the gear outwards,\u00A0 which should have made a structural failure more likely since it was now attached to an outboard wing, completely solved the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpontaneous disassemblies also happen when staging, though I suspect that one is probably from the staged parts grazing against the accelerating craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-16T15:00:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeird stuff unfortunately happens reloading vessels traveling at high speed in dense atmosphere.
