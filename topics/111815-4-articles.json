This would allow them to be set up more like ground buildings, possibly even as skyscrapers.\n\nI\u0027ve been considering adding main front entrances on all the housing, etc. but I wasn\u0027t sure what others would make of it. I was planning to make doorways that look more like the sort of door you might find on a civilian ground-based building, but which would also look appropriate in space. They would be lower-down on the buildings, but not in danger of being obscured by stacked parts. On the 25 and 60-kerbal homes, I was thinking of something like an expensive hotel entrance combined with an airlock. All except the smallest two houses would also get emergency escape hatches.\n\nAs for ground-based buildings, what kind were you thinking of?

When mission crew show up, we can assume that any civilians have been consigned to their bunks. Although the inside area would be purely cosmetic, the IVA additions would be practically zero. And it would be easy to make an exterior-only version for those who really want to strip out the extra visuals. This part would also be a good candidate for the RPM visible interiors feature, so you can observe your crew lounging around when they should be doing something mission-critical. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T02:05:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A picture of some kinda of refrence to what you may be looking for would be much appreciated.

Otherwise, it\u0027d mean spamming the assets folder with even more textures. I\u0027ve put together some larger textures to each replace 3 or 4 existing ones, as well as adding specular or emissive layers into the textures with could use them.
