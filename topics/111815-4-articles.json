They would be lower-down on the buildings, but not in danger of being obscured by stacked parts.

When mission crew show up, we can assume that any civilians have been consigned to their bunks. Although the inside area would be purely cosmetic, the IVA additions would be practically zero. And it would be easy to make an exterior-only version for those who really want to strip out the extra visuals. This part would also be a good candidate for the RPM visible interiors feature, so you can observe your crew lounging around when they should be doing something mission-critical. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T02:05:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rabidninjawombat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rabidninjawombat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA picture of some kinda of refrence to what you may be looking for would be much appreciated.
