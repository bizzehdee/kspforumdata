The only way to really improve FPS is to use a part-welding mod or technique to reduce part count, or to get a faster/fewer-core CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruedii","CreatedById":57704,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T05:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on your system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is largely limited by CPU and/or memory bandwidth do to the poor optimization on the part of Unity.
