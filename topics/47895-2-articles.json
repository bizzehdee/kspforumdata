French Guiana is not exactly a population density capital of the world, but Kourou is actually one of the denser areas in the country. So while there are places around it that have higher populations (the cities of neighboring countries will likely overshadow its night time light output). CSG is located at ~5\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u00C2\u00B0N, so is very close to the Equator. French Guiana is mostly jungle further south, so operating a space center further south, away from the coast, is complicated beyond the normal level by logistics, as well as by needing to overfly other countries to achieve eastern-bound orbit. Kerbin Space Center matches the location of this space facility best, being smack on the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBaikonur Cosmodrome is literally located in the middle of nowhere. The nearest built-up area of any kind is a non-descript railhead called Tyuratam, and the city of Baikonur is some 200 km away. Otherwise, you pretty much get black on a night map - bare Kazakh steppe. Being located at ~45\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u00C2\u00B0N is not fantastic for equatorial launches, but is about as far south as is practical within the bounds of the former Soviet Union.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKennedy Space Center is further south than Baikonur, at ~28\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u00C2\u00B0N. It is at the southern end of Florida, near some major urban areas (Miami, Jacksonville). It is different from the two others in being very close to such major urban developments (Kourou is only populous by Guinanan standards, and Tyuratam is all but deserted). This gives it excellent logistics, and given the launch direction, it\u0027s pretty much all water downrange. In many ways, Kerbin Space Center seems to match this positioning best - an eastern coast, major sea downrange for eastward orbit trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether you look to CSG or Cape Canaveral for an example, I think the result will be good. Baikonur is a bad fit for the standard space center, but matches KSC2 well (out in the back of beyond, continental).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T12:07:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really hope this goes somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T12:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow that I\u0027ve watched\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xzo0XcVl1ZA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E I must say I really, really like the \u0022overpopulated\u0022 areas far more than the unpopulated areas.

One suggestion I would make, based on the shader snippet you posted earlier. Currently, it looks like you\u0027re using the standard lighting equation (NdotL), but inverting the value, so the lights turn on when NdotL = 0, which means the sun is right on the horizon. IRL, people tend to turn the lights on before the sun sets, so maybe apply an offset and scale to NdotL before you use it.
