Then, once you\u0027ve pulled out the opposite solar apsis until it touches the planetary orbit of choice, trying rotating the maneuver node around the circular orbit and adding some extra delta v and see where that gets you. Generally speaking if the planet is too far behind when you reach its orbit, don\u0027t change the ejection angle and just increase ejection delta v. Of course you should aerobrake wherever available. If the planet is too far in front, rotating the ejection angle towards the sun makes you cut across the inside of Kerbin\u0027s orbit, which should allow you to nail an intercept with the planet later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot exactly anything to do with transfer windows, but I hope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T15:20:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI added an edit to my earlier post, and would like to further clarify that whenever possible you should do your inclination burn at a node, it\u0027s just not the end of the world if you don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAh, I see.\u003Cp\u003EWell, it wouldn\u0027t work anyway since Eve itself won\u0027t be anywhere near the point of contact, so the window is likely way off anyway \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E Was just wondering if the relative positioning of the nodes had any significance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you already launch the ship?
