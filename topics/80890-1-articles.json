I\u0027m mostly in the design phase at the moment, but the success of the commnity-driven development of Karbonite has me thinking that emulating that approach might be extremely productive - and so I\u0027m making this post to solicit feedback, ideas, and (very shortly) content. I know that RoverDude had some well-recieved mods under his belt already, and thus had significantly more \u0027street cred\u0027 than I do, I\u0027m hoping that this mod can evolve into a community effort as well. That being said, I want to establish some overall direction before publishing code and opening it up to PRs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0027tl;dr\u0027 version of the overall goal is to implement \u0027legacy\u0027 MCE-style missions in the new contract system. I want the player to have access to (potentially) narrative-driven, manually created and paced contracts. I want the non-programmer to be able to create mission packs, either narrative or procedural. I want to reduce the amount of repeated coding effort required to create contract mods, in much the same way that ORS seeks to reduce the repeated effort required to create resource-based mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat OMS is:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission packs\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E will be defined as XML documents, defining certain attributes which determine the nature of the missions. The primary dichotomy in types of missions will be between \u003Cem\u003ENarrative\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EProcedural\u003C/em\u003E. One mission definition document will only be allowed to define one type of mission, but may contain many (unlimited?) individual missions of that type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENarrative missions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003Ewill be presented to the player in an (optionally) defined order, will (optionally) reappear if declined, can be dependant on a previous mission being completed (ie, don\u0027t show this mission if preceding one was declined), and are exactly as procedural as the mission author wishes them to be. This type of mission could be used to define a \u0027grab bag\u0027 of standalone missions, such as challenge missions. (visit minmus and return a sample using a craft that masses less than 10T at launch as an example), or it could contain \u0027series\u0027 of missions meant to be completed sequentially (see the MCE \u0027bootstrap\u0027 missions as an example). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProcedural missions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E are very similar to the existing squad missions, except they are constructed out of pre-defined mission objectives in novel combinations. An example mission definition could be the equivalent of \u0027Land on \u0026lt;random planet\u0026gt;, retrieve sample from \u0026lt;random biome, if applicable\u0026gt;\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Objectives\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E are the \u0027meat\u0027 of the plugin. I want to implement (and eventually provide a way for other plugins to implement) generic objectives which can be referenced by the mission definition documents to build new missions. This is the section that I\u0027m particularly seeking feedback and suggestions about. The idea is to break any task down into the minimum \u0027units\u0027 so that they can be potentially reused as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently planned objectives are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOrbit \u0026lt;Object\u0026gt;, with optionally defined parameters (inclination, ap, pe, eccentricity)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFlyby \u0026lt;Object\u0026gt;, with optionally defined pe\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELand on \u0026lt;Object\u0026gt;, with optionally defined biome\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReturn sample from \u0026lt;Object\u0026gt;, with optionally defined biome\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EVessel mass range, optional minimum or maximum.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMinimum or maximum crew.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPart or PartModule required on vessel.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMission duration\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat OMS is not:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOMS is not intended to be a replacement, or even a compeditor to such fine mods as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43645-Mission-Controller-2-Preview-Version-2E-%28KSP-24-2%29%28New-Custom-ComSat-Contract%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMCE\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88445-0-24-2-Fine-Print-v0-5a-Formerly-Extra-Contracts-%28July-27%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFine Print\u003C/a\u003E.
