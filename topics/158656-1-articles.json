Four (!) years ago I started a little project, a small raspberry pi based rover,\u00A0which I kept on my shelf for ages\u00A0once the technical stuff was working. Now, a few days ago I picked up the loose ends and finally wrote some simple code to actually *do* something with it - and it didn\u0027t go *boom* either. So, here\u0027s a little clip showing you what I\u0027m talking about.

The motor controller was already assembled and ready to run so I just needed to get two level shifters and some wires to connect it all. Well, I did some experimenting using a breadboard, so I could check out how WiringPi and softPWM work, but despite that all\u00A0I had to do was add pull-down resistors to the level shifters (otherwise the wheels would start\u00A0spinning once the Raspberry Pi is powered on).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-04T07:00:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2017 07:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by lodger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
