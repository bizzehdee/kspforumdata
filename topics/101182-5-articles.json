After all, it\u0027s happened with nearly all previous releases, and some of these introduced only a small fraction of what 1.0 is going to.\n\u003E \n\u003E What SQUAD is trying to do is to not only fix *all* of the bugs introduced by the 0.90 update (I\u0027m still surprised that there was no 0.90.1 patch to take care of some of this), but it also must introduce an enormous number of new features. *All* of these features must be less buggy than usual, and *all* of these features must be extensively tested. As much as I respect the QA testers, I simply think that this is too much for any small group of people to test in any reasonable amount of time.\n\u003E \n\u003E So!\n\u003E \n\u003E While some of the new features are really good, I actually cringe when I see them, because I think that they will have some really nasty bugs.
