Their mission was the 25th of the Space Shuttle Program. By the time they flew, the Shuttle had already shown itself to be a finicky beast. Mission STS 51-L illustrates this as well as any; NASA had originally scheduled its launch for 22 January, and it was rescheduled, scrubbed, or held six times before it finally lifted off from Launch Pad 39-B.\u003Cp\u003EAfter Challenger, NASA sought to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfix\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 the Shuttle and make it \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csafe.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 It did this in three ways: it altered procedures and reset limits; it modified or eliminated hardware; and it abandoned many of the missions for which the Space Shuttle had, ostensibly, been built. The faulty Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) design that destroyed Challenger was modified. Nearly all planned satellite launch or repair missions went by the boards. The Manned Maneuvering Unit, which had never performed quite as well as hoped, was consigned to storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Centaur G\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 upper stage, long a political football, was cancelled. It had been meant to fly for the first time later in 1986. Those robotic planetary missions that could abandon the Shuttle\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s payload bay moved to expendable rockets; those that could not \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Galileo, Magellan, Ulysses \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 waited for years to depart Earth. The Department of Defense cancelled most of its planned Shuttle missions and abandoned plans to launch Shuttle Orbiters from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. Launch and landing weather conditions became an obsession at Kennedy Space Center. Light blue jump suits gave way to bulky orange pressure suits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenger also kicked off the messy Space Station redesign process. NASA unveiled its massive, 500-foot-wide Dual-Keel station design months after the accident, and it was instantly and loudly derided as unrealistic given the Space Shuttle\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s revealed frailties. The Space Station shrank in size and capability with each new annual budget cycle and was almost cancelled outright in 1993.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this means that, after Challenger, we settled for a reduced space program.

The real problem is that NASA is a large bureaucratic organization divide into many factions each pursuing their own interest and each having their own stakeholders with different agendas. In 1959 NASA started with a program to put a \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EKerbal\u003C/span\u003E man in orbit.
