Now when I regenerate contracts I will not get anything but the Spacewalk contract even though I have literally accomplished nothing else after initially getting the Minmus contracts. This leads me to believe that whatever algorithm is being used to generate these particular contracts needs necessary triggers or events and then generates the \u0027easiest\u0027 contract. Or at least something that is close to predictable progression. I had assumed that getting to Minmus or Mun were similar in difficulty if not progression. Though if I had to pick one, it would make more sense to me to at least fly by Mun before getting Minmus. I understand that there is a bit of randomness to the contract generation, but I assumed that regenerating the contracts using the debug menu as akin to re-rolling the dice. Which again takes me back to thinking that I consistently miss some sort of necessary trigger or event.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-08T02:00:12Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2017 02:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Stratickus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DD_bwest","CreatedById":164906,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-08T02:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222948329\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156068\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221486518750\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167609\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stratickus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, Stratickus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan I ask how you typically progress?\u00A0It may very well be that the way I do my initial progression inevitably drives me to Minmus and not Mun.

They used to be entirely random, but that is not the case anymore. I\u0027m not going to get into specific details, but here is the gist of things. They look at what you have done on the planets you have been to. They will keep offering you objectives on those planets up until a certain point of progression has been met on that planet before offering the next planet. However, if you \u0022skip\u0022 a planet, and visit Duna, for example, then the game will assume that you are capable of reaching Duna, and start offering things there as well. Just because they start offering a new planet does not mean they stop offering things on an older planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdvanced objectives for the old planet, such as rendezvous and docking, will appear alongside more basic objectives on new planets, such as flybys and orbits. They will always appear in a logical fashion. You won\u0027t see a return from flyby before you see a flyby, and you won\u0027t see a request to planet a flag before you\u0027ve been asked to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese contracts also keep track of what you are capable of, so for example, they aren\u0027t going to ask you to place a flag on the Mun if you\u0027ve never sent any crew to the Mun. They aren\u0027t going to ask you to EVA if you don\u0027t have the facility upgrades to EVA, and they aren\u0027t going to ask you to dock without docking ports researched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-27T11:34:36Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2017 11:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonide\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-27T12:17:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222969260\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156068\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488195249\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002232604\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arsonide\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n38 minutes ago, Arsonide said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, nobody\u0027s ever asked me, so that would help.
