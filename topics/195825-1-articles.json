Six years ago I was not playing video games, however at the time when\u00A0I became interested in space again, I was playing video games, so\u00A0I decided to find a reasonably realistic space game to play. My interest six years ago, in hindsight, was mainly about space history as opposed to any of the science, so I have a lot to learn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am very impressed with the Positive Forum Movement and the Good Conduct guide. The internet seems to be filled with arguments and insults, so it is very nice to see such an effort to keep discussion polite and friendly. I look forward to becoming a part of this community!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-23T21:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe try to be a friendly place, yeah. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWelcome to the forum.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-24T23:34:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yes, we leave our hostility on Earth!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
