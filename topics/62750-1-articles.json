I can either buy another science item (barometer) or save (Im halfway) and get Unmanned Tech. This, with using MechJeb, will allow me more precision in getting other places, which will result in more science in the long term. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote this involves using a mod. If you hate mods, I respect your option. But please make it a valid argument. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I respect if you think I need to \u0022learn the basics\u0022.

Then again, you can go do the same thing on Minimus better with Mechjeb (though probably only one or two biomes per trip) and you\u0027ll get quite a bit of science that way ... all things considered, though, I\u0027d go with the science boost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, whatever you do, you should add MOAR BOOSTERS!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T11:25:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsidering you can easily do everything in the game without needing a crutch like MechJeb - go for the barometer. Not because the barometer is particularly good, but because the next thing it unlocks (the seismograph) is.

However unlocking that node alows access to other nodes containing science that will greatly increase your science income speeding up your progression. You dont really need Mecjeb for mun/minmus landing missions as they are easy enough to seat of the pants plan and return from. A few of those with the seismograph and gravity detector along with the basic goo/materials and the surface samples will net you tons of science to unlock the rest of the tree. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb for precision landing really only shines for trying to specificly target those last few small biomes on mun/minmus you missed on the initial sweep when paired with a maping mod. It can be helpful for ploting interplanetary manuvers if your not so good at that but most of the easier targets dont need it and you can fill out the tree without ever leaving the local kerbin system. that and in the time it would take to send a mission to another planet you could send dozens to the moons and clean them out for more science than a single biome planet/moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jank","CreatedById":97123,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T18:26:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScience first.
