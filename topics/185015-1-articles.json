However when dealign with hinges and rotors there are a lot of symetry issues, in this case for example the rotor is attaching on the left-side node in both cases...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am also havving issues where it looks fine in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E but when I deploy to the runday for testign some hinges disconect... the hinge and attached parts then just behave as physics would dictate for a disconected part... but it;s still drawing power and commands from the larger vessel. I have not been able to trigger this bug very reliably though. I do have a particularly pathelogical test rover to share if you need s test file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
