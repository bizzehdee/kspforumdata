I\u0027m hoping some people here are more knowledgeable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember reading on Atomic Rockets that even humble modern sensors have a phenomenal recovery rate. They can get blasted in the face with high level radiation and be back online the moment the radiation stops. I had my doubts, until I saw this vid by ThunderFoot where he actually puts an iPod (with camera) inside a neutron beam. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/IaQI21LwueM?t=3m01s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/IaQI21LwueM?t=3m01s\u003C/a\u003E You can actually see the neutrons striking the camera, blanking out individual pixels for a short while, and the camera recovering near instantly. And this is an iPod... I imagine a military spacecraft of the 22nd century would have something better. So this proves that space jamming would be pretty difficult, to say the least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut most sensors simply operate using electromagnetic radiation, no? So how hard would it be to take some sort of laser/maser/radiowave cannon, aim it at the enemy ship and shoot at it continuously with sufficiently strong energy to blind them? I acknowledge it would be pretty bad for proper stealth, since you\u0027re effectively shining a giant flashlight in their faces (should be easy to track where you are based on that). But while they\u0027re blinded you might be able to deploy missiles or dock with an asteroid or do something clever. They\u0027d know where your ship is, but not what it would be doing. Then when the job is done you turn down the beam, they get their sight back, and you high-tail it out of there before they can unleash retaliation on you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how crazy is this idea, and why wouldn\u0027t it work?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-14T03:27:20Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2014 03:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ignamious","CreatedById":60779,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T04:12:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell... Without getting into any specifics about something that is illegal to do outside of the military...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJamming is actually very easy. when it comes to the EM spectrum (thats Light -\u0026gt; UHF -\u0026gt; Microwave) ect. all sensors read a \u0022wave\u0022 that bounces back. Thats how the Stealth planes work. I\u0027ll talk about the F-117 because it\u0027s old stealth technology. Basically it prevents the EM signal from bouncing back to the source thus preventing it from being detected. there is also EM absorbing materials. Those are known as \u0022Passive Stealth\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow also some old technology is the IR Jammers. they were played with in the \u002770\u0027s\u002B Basically you get a very bright IR Source and Blast it out \u0022Blinding\u0022 the Targeting source. Now... the basics of IR... it\u0027s not heat. it\u0027s molecular motion (kinda)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow... a \u0022Cannon\u0022 won\u0027t work. We\u0027ll take your 2.4ghz phone as an example. What is the Actually frequency it uses? We don\u0027t know, so what we will do is Blanket the area with with 2.3ghz all the way to 2.5ghz just in case. Well what amplitude is it using? how powerful? can the Target just increase it\u0027s gain to get away. can it employ ECCM? (Electronic Counter Counter Measures) with your ECM (Electronic Counter Measures) be able to stealth? Because a VERY simple ECCM method is to just Blow up the ECM. you can VERY easily build a tracking system to target that MASSIVE Radiation coming from you. so as long as your jamming them there missile / turret / Bullet is whizzing right at you following your jamming signal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is more to it, but much of it is classified and VERY illegal to do. You make a Jammer at home and your toast (it\u0027s very easy to triangulate)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJamming is more about fineness then brute force. Look at the AN/ALQ-184 and the AN/ALQ-131 Both currently used and operated by the USAF. I can\u0027t go into detail about them but wikipidia as some fun info to think about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_jamming\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_jamming\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_countermeasure\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_countermeasure\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe info there is public info and something to think about. In space, there is a lot of background radiation. so ECCM will be FAR superior. as for visual... There is always a way to see, it\u0027s called frequency shift. Also known as signal processing if your IR Viewfinder is being jammed use something else. Every object emits some sort of EM radiation. so if the IR range is being blocked try UV or something else. look at the pictures nasa gives on the sun! 4 other views none of which are the visual light scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot saying you can\u0027t Jam the target with raspberry but you best know what the target is using before jamming and make sure you can block it all if you want to \u0022blind\u0022 them, and thats a LOT of power... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that the \u0022Can\u0027t be done\u0022 is over... how to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, by using a very sensitive direction receiver to receive the active signal from the target vessel, you can active a ECM program, and using a separate system as an ECCM you can counteract the Targets ECM and ECCM to try to maintain the Diversion. as for passive devices (cameras, recovers, ect) thats were intelligence comes in. You need to know what they have, and try to block it, you could use a phasing Light pulse Quickly ranging the Spectrum of light in pulses it won\u0027t permanently blind them but it will give a very fast strobe effect reducing the ability of the target to get a clear shot (think of moving with a strobe light, thats similar to what it would be like) by using broad spectrum jamming as well as more precise methods at the same time you could denny the target a few sensors at a time. You would need many systems targeting the different components at the same time. A single fighter could not achieve this feat, however a squadron or flight of them could. assuming each bird was responsible for a different subassembly. a larger ship (Similar to a C-130J) could do more but be less manuverable. a few of them could do the same as many smaller. if you had a destroyer sized vessel you could theoretically have most if not all the ECM / ECCM on that ship, providing telemetry and information to the less hardened fighters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could go on, but i won\u0027t. The ECM field is large and very interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaveofDefeat","CreatedById":58539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T04:26:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E So how hard would it be to take some sort of laser/maser/radiowave cannon, aim it at the enemy ship and shoot at it continuously with sufficiently strong energy to blind them?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d rather build some sort of laser/maser/radiowave cannon and shoot at it continuously with sufficiently strong energy to KILL THEM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ignamious","CreatedById":60779,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T04:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMicrowave won\u0027t do that, and Radio wave won\u0027t do that...

Radar, if used in space will certainly be vulnerable to these very techniques just as it is now. I will also skip passive systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to begin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActive sensors work by sending out a structured signal specifically designed in such a way as to be indistinguishable from noise so that you know with certainty when you hear an echo(found something). A very good example pretty much everyone is aware of is Sonar. Ping! You make noise, and you hear it echo off the target. Radar does the same thing, but instead of sound, its radio waves, and its quite a bit faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis signal needs to be indistinguishable. You don\u0027t want random noise generating a spike that looks exactly like a target. Known as the false alarm rate, this is the ration at which the system will falsely identify noise as a target. So you use a structured signal that is just complex enough that the odds of nature every producing it when your listening for it are so low as to be effectively zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats all well and good, but what about when you have two units near each other with the same system, they\u0027ll hear each others echoes and transmissions, and wont know whose echo is whose, and whether the transmissions are targets(since the other guy can hear your transmission, and vice versa) or not. So you need to make the different enough to distinguish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you use different frequencies. A radar might be designed with a frequency range from 9.8ghz to 10.1ghz for example. So if you encounter significant interference on 9.85, you switch to something else, like maybe 10.05. Its somewhat more complex than that, but that\u0027s sufficient an example. this allows you and many friends to use the same radar near each other without blinding each other with interference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that covered, how would a jammer disrupt it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are quite a few ways actually, and not all of them are easily tracked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirst and foremost, lets begin with intel. We need to know about our enemy and their capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf we do not know anything at all, we have very limited choices for jamming.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf for example, you don\u0027t know where your enemy is, but you know they are near and they must be jammed, then you cannot aim an antenna at them, as their location is not known. you must instead use an omnidirectional transmission. This hurts your effectiveness since power at the target point is greater reduced, but it allows you to jam a target whose location is not known.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we do not know their frequencies in use, then we are further hampered. We must now jam a very wide range of frequencies in an attempt to also cover the frequencies they are using. This further hurts our average power at the target, as power is being spend on frequencies other than those used by the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESuppose we do know where they are, but we don\u0027t know about their systems.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you can use a directional antenna to great effect. the antennae might give you, say 35dBsm of gain, well, that\u0027s 3162.28 times the signal strength, pretty significant. This allows either that much more noise at the target point, or the same noise at a target point that is roughly 7.5x further away. pretty big deal. This also applies to their sensor. The antenna magnifies their signal, it also magnifies received noise just the same. They also aren\u0027t perfect, they still hear some noise from directions other than where they are pointed, but good antenna hear VERY little of such noise. Still, sufficient power will influence the system even when its not aimed at you, this can result in completely blinding the system no matter where it points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBarrage jamming is pretty inefficient as far as the other types go, so lets up the intel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuppose we also know their approximate frequency bands in use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you can focus your power into a tighter range of frequencies. This has advantages other than in jamming as well. if you must barrage jam from 1ghz to 20ghz just to ensure you have an effect on a potential target, then you might be detected by a passive sensor that is sensitive to 4ghz to 6ghz. If your target is only using 9.8 to 10.1 and you know that, so you jam from 9.75 to 10.15, that same passive sensor will not detect your jamming now, as your not using a frequency it is sensitive to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis tightening of the frequencies increases the noise the target experiences because you aren\u0027t spreading it around anymore on frequencies you don\u0027t need to jam. Im fairly sure the math is incorrect, but the principle at least is correct: if you had 1Mw of jamming spread across 1ghz your putting 0.1w per hz, if you tighten that to 9.75 to 10.15, your focused into a 400mhz band, 2.5w per hz for a noise increase of 25x. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBut what if we know even more about our target, suppose we also know the rotation speed of their antenna?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOlder systems must track back and forth predictably. The signal goes where the antenna points, so you listen to their radar, and you can tell its rpm by the detections per minute, since it will only hit you with strong signals when its aimed at you. Phased arrays can electronically steer the beam, so they can aim the signal at points other than where the array is pointed, which can make this impossible to achieve since the hostile radars pattern of painting you might be very random.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you can upgrade to spot jamming. Same basic idea so far, but you don\u0027t have to spend all of your time transmitting, now you can transmit only when they look at you. This allows you to take advantage of something they might have done in the design of their own ship. They don\u0027t really want their passive sensors that detect radar to also hear their target echoes from their own radar, so they might not be sensitive to those frequencies. A simple solution is to be sensitive, but ignore returns on the same bearing the radar is aimed at, so now your jamming might be ignored since your jamming will only be detected when the radar is aimed at you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA more advanced system will still detect your jamming, as they used a very specific signal structure for the radar, and you\u0027re transmitting noise, they are easy to tell apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eif you know when the radar is aimed at you, its frequency bands, and its transmission length, you can go even better still.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow you can perform sweep jamming in conjunction with spot jamming. This is where you do not continuously jam a range of frequencies, instead, you \u0027scan\u0027 through them with your noise. You do not stay on any one frequency at a time, so you do not completely blind a system, but you also become harder to detect and localise as your noise is not all in one frequency making a nice big spike, nor is it a block of frequencies. You may even cross into frequencies they can\u0027t listen to causing them to lose your noise intermittently as well. You could randomly bounce(frequency hopping) from frequency to frequency while spitting out noise, causing interference and potentially making the error correction systems on the target go nuts. This can make the system decide its false alarm rate is too high so its become defective, and throw error messages which can mislead crew into not trusting the output of a good sensor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYet we can still do even better. What if we know the target\u0027s signal structure as well as everything else?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now that we know exactly what the target systems transmission will look like, we can offset our jamming by 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 in phase. A quick explanation is in order. Picture waves in the ocean, they are very similar to electromagnetic waves in radar for example. All frequencies do this, all signals do this, you can influence it a bit, square it more than leaving it a smoothly curving peak, but it still must have a peak. A well designed jammer can throw noise that is perfectly inverted, where there were peaks it throws troughs and where troughs it throws peaks. The result is noise. They will still detect something, plenty of power will go back to the radar(you did just double it), but it looks nothing like what they sent out, its noise. They know something is that way, but not how far, or fast. This is the same principle as that behind noise cancelling headphones. And since the noise only happens when the radar is pointed at you, the definitely know a jammer is somewhere in your direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBefore I proceed to an even better result, i\u0027ll diverge with a quick bit of ECCM.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey know you will try these tricks, and so they design radars with some neat features. For example frequency hopping and large bandwidth. The very simply version of bandwidth, is that is the range of frequencies in use simultaneously by a system. For example if the above system were to use 9950mhz as the center frequency, with a bandwith of 40mhz, it would transmit and listen across everything form 9930mhz to 9970mhz. if you can only jam a band that is 20mhz wide, then the best you can do is to blot out half their signal with noise. At best that\u0027s only a 41% decrease in their effective range against you if your just throwing noise. If they can frequency hop, they can simply change to 9970 to 10010 for the next pulse and not experience any noise until you adjust to match, then change again when you do. it could be purely random, 9970-10010 one pulse, 9704-9744 the next, and 9872-9912. if they can do that every pulse, you\u0027ll never match them without also know how the number generator is picking its pseudo-random numbers, so your stuck with covering a range to hamper them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to jammers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESuppose you know where they are, what frequencies they can use, that they cannot frequency randomly hop from pulse to pulse, can cover their full frequency range and bandwidth, and know precisely what their signal looks like.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you have some neat tricks you can pull. In effect you can talk directly to their radar, and lie to it, because you can now form a signal that looks exactly like that receive wants to see as an echo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a little more detail on how they work. In order to detect a target behind another target, use what is called a range-gate. The easiest way to explain it is to think of the radar scanning with a grid. Everything from 100,000meters to 100,005m for example, is maybe considered to be one target, so if it receives two returns that are 4 meters apart, it might not see them as separate targets, it might only see one target that is twice as big, since its detecting two echoes as one echo. the range gate is related to the wavelength of the radar, and its signal structure as there are tricks to improve range resolution. So knowing that, here\u0027s the next trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeception jamming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn deception jamming you have to be very quick, and very capable, and know very much of your target system\u0027s specifics. if you do, now you can start lying to it. In effect, you can read their signals to learn what you need to know, for example which direction they are in, maybe how far away they are(by looking at how strong the signal you received is-modern LPI radars can modify that on the fly per target, so its useless there), and where they think you are. This is not worth it if they haven\u0027t found you already for certain. there is no point to giving them a good track when they have none and are unaware you are near. The best indication they have found you will be a switch in the radar signal to a firecontrol frequency/pattern, or a sudden increase in the energy directed your way to provide a stronger signal, or more frequently being painted as the radar spends more time keeping an eye on you specifically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen what you do is on the next pulse once your ready, you spit back an inverted signal turning it to noise but not quite as strong as theirs. the goal isn\u0027t to produce noise at the full strength, but to weaken their signal enough that they lose it in the noise that\u0027s already there. Then at nearly the same time you send back a signal that is identical to theirs, but stronger and delayed just a tiny bit. Because you weakened and disrupted their signal, you hope that is dropped, and by giving a signal of your own that is stronger, you hope that is accepted by the system as the true signal. By transmitting a bit after initial reception, you also imply that you are further away than you really are. They can tell sorta where you are by your jamming, but not precisely enough to shoot at with guns/lasers, or to guide missiles to you. the missiles own radar can be mislead exactly the same way, and it will believe you are over there when really your right here and it will miss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you possess enough transmission power, you can also mislead them in the other direction, into believing you are closer than you really are because you can make your signal strong enough to be believed as an echo from that close in. You just need to increase your apparent approach rate by gradually transmitting a bit sooner and sooner while turning the real echo to gibberish and trying to keep it from being accepted as a target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eits important to note the doppler effect at this time. Not only does your timing of the signal matter to where the radar thinks you are, but the doppler effect is very important in determining how fast you are, you need to use this to lie as well. the radar is very likely to reject your signal if you move your self 1000m in 1 second, but the doppler says you only moving at 300m/s. The mismatch will be noted, and it will likely follow that very weak signal that you tried to make it ignore, because that still says 300m/s and is where it expected to find it. Your signal was too different to be believed. you gotta take it slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of Doppler, you can also lie about your speed. The radar can track you step by step and work out that its wrong, but a missile is likely to work with what it gets per pulse, which means while you won\u0027t defeat a tracking radar, a missile might believe you are moving much faster than you really are, or much slower and use an entirely incorrect lead angle. Coupled with an incorrect range-gate and the missile is almost certain to miss. Still, the missile might only care about bearing, and that can be hard to fool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethere is still one better that can be done that i\u0027m aware of. Its merely the combination of both sweep jamming, and deception. Once you have the radar fully deceived and tracking your ghost return you can start introducing noise in an attempt to make the error correction freak out, and if you can manage it, the system will then paint your track as erroneous and drop it, and because it has stopped tracking your real return and its lost in the noise, you are now effectively gone. its easier to keep a weak track than to find one which is why this works, make it stop actually tracking you by lying to it, misleading it with its own signals, while making yourself too weak a return to be redetected, then break up the ghost with noise and mislead the operator into thinking the system has malfunctioned and make him less likely to trust it until it has been checked and found to be operating fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 to 1, you can screw anyone up right good if you can jam them effectively. they\u0027ll be unable to determine your exact position even if the jamming itself can give them an approximate position. if they must rely on a guided weapon at this point to complete the kill since those can be sent to approximate locations and then search on their own, if you can also mislead that, it too becomes useless against you, and in the end, whether they know you are jamming them or not, it matters not because they can\u0027t locate you well enough to hit you, they might as well be blind for all the good it does them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif your capable of achieving enough width, rapidly enough, on enough frequencies with sufficient power simultaneously, say multiple independant jamming systems, or one spectacularly capable system you can simultaneously do this to multiple sensors at once, and blind multiple units, and then even triangulation is ineffective at more than \u0027somewhere near there\u0027, which isn\u0027t enough to shoot at. They then need either enough systems to overwhelm your ability to jam them all, a system that operates outside your specialties so they can remain unaffected, or a sensor that can home in on your jamming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eits worth noting your jammer can pull all the same tricks the radar can so that a seeker that\u0027s homing on your jamming may need to listen over a very wide range to effectively home in on your jammer since you might be chasing target radars across many frequencies seemingly at random. This means the bandwidth on the seeker may need to be large to accomodate your potential frequencies and keep you detected, this means a lot of noise, which reduces the strength of its detection. if its tightly focused it might not hear much of your jamming and will have difficulty keeping a lock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eof course, you could always stop jamming for a moment to see if the missile switches to an active sensor. If it does, reach into your bag of tricks and lie to it to, it\u0027ll keep using the radar not realising its being lied to, and will miss. if it doesn\u0027t, resume jamming until you must stop to blind the weapon, then maneuver. they\u0027ll get a good lock, but your distant, they\u0027ll need time to hit you, you need only a few moments to evade, then resume jamming efforts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put the ball back in the radar\u0027s court, AESA(active electronically scanned array) systems make much of this useless. They can almost as a rule frequency hop at random, they can steer the beam allowing for randomising the time between transmissions aimed at a given target, they can use potions of the array for different tasks simultaneously allowing for directing energy at more than one target, or at the same target on very different frequencies or patterns, or to be a jammer and radar in effective operation simultaneously, and they can vary the power output so that the signal is never stronger than it needs to be. These can make detecting the system incredibly difficult, and predicting it near impossible. if you can\u0027t predict it, you can\u0027t deceive it, nor cancel it, nor effectively counter it with noise on the same frequencies without covering a much wider band.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey aren\u0027t immune to the above techniques, just very capable of working despite them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll approach the ending with a word on passive systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are troublesome. they never give you anything, and use what you give them against you. it doesn\u0027t much matter what you give them, because its always something. There are few ways I am aware of to deal with such systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBarrage jamming it with so much noise it cannot find targets. But this leaves a great big spike in the right direction, and if you can\u0027t throw energy down the bearings of multiple sensors, you can\u0027t blind them all, and they only need them to cross to know sorta where, and two to cross that aren\u0027t jammed to know exactly where. Your problem is know where they are, because they are passive, they give you nothing to help you find them unlike with radar that must transmit first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eideally you will know what range to expect them to be able to detect you, and shortly before that you blind them. they are going to know something is over there in a moment anyways, why let them know who, what, or how many?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on the system, and how it functions, it may be possible to flood it with false positives much like with radar, but being a passive system, they don\u0027t really care what they see, just so long as its something much of the time so good luck with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is the concept behind IR jammers, they paint the seeker head of a missile with the laser and watch the scintillation of the return then try to keep the laser painted on the same spot on the seeker head to mislead the missile as to where it needs to go. Since the point is off center, it thinks it needs to turn, and with tracking the seeker head, it continues to turn and then loses the original target entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, turning left and climbing while painting the lower right of the seeker head so it dives and goes right. Timed right it might be unable to correct and hit you even if it never did lose sight of you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, your left with burning it out. if you can throw enough energy at it, you can potentially damage the electronics which are very sensitive and may not be able to handle it, which is a semi permanent solution to the problem. An array will fail gracefully, which means as pieces fail capability diminishes rather than an abrupt termination of function. Think of that like the pixels of an LCD dying one by one instead of the whole screen crapping out in one instant.

The problem lies in what are sometimes called two color seekers, or rather, those that can use both long and short wavelength IR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe long wavelength, 3-5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5m is the more common, and has been in use since the beginning, and this is what flares fool with relative ease. in fact, early sidewinders were known for deciding they liked the sun as a target better than whatever they were shot at. These are limited to tail shots though, as they require a very hot source to home in on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore modern seekers can use the short wavelength IR frequencies, from 8 to 13\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5m, and this allows them some seriously upgraded capabilities. For one they can detect the difference in temperature between the surrounding air and the targets skin. These are what allowed for all aspect missile shots, since they don\u0027t need to see the hot engines to lock on, they can see all they need easily enough from any angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlares can be made to trick the 8-13\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5m wavelength seekers, but those are near always paired with the 3-5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5m wavelegnth capability as well, and fooling both in one flare is nearly impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorse still, truly modern seekers use what is known as IIR, or imaging infrared, they don\u0027t just see a hot spot, they see shapes, they know what a plane looks like, and flares aren\u0027t it. These seekers are especially dangerous given that they can selectively hit whatever part of your aircraft they want to. Want to put the missile down the intake, you can do that, if your missile is agile enough and the angles allow for such a shot. Want to always aim for the pilot, you can do that too. Prefer center of mass, that\u0027s also doable, and even though its offset from the significant head sources, its usually pretty easy to determine where that is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ausairpower.net/USN/000-AIM-9X-FPA-seeker-300-S.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFor example, this is from an AIM-9X seeker during testing. if they\u0027ll share this much, i\u0027d wager it can do considerably better now\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAIM-9x, Iris-T, Python-5, AAM-5, or R-73, either of these decides it likes you for a target and you have some seriously huge problems, because flares are iffy at best, useless at worst. There\u0027s a reason why you throw lots and lots of flares in the hopes even one provides a good decoy. if you think you\u0027ve thrown enough flares, throw more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eregarding dishes vs arrays, keep in mind that sometimes an array is straight up overkill and definitely far more expensive. This may not be sufficient deterrent, but i\u0027ll provide an example. a firecontrol illuminator. They generally only need to light up one target at a time, and they need to light them up real good so the weapons being launched can see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be fair though, things only get cheaper with time, and beyond a certain point, the cheaper dish isn\u0027t really that much cheaper to warrant giving up the strengths of an active array, so I can see the dish finally dying out. I wouldn\u0027t see a near future spacecraft with only arrays in use as unrealistic. maybe a tad more expensive than it needs to be, but, unlike with ships, I don\u0027t think the radars will be a major part of the cost. Currently the electronics suite of a combat ship can actually exceed half the total cost of the ship. The cost of building a ship in space might change that balance significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed on burning out sensors. its not easy. Pretty much the realm of lasers, or giant emitters with high gain focused on a small little receiver that simply cannot deal with the power its being given, think SPY-1 or bigger putting everything it has into something as big around as your head at ranges of less than 10km. Issue there is that you need the average power to get out of hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadars and ESM\u0027s are designed to handle pulses, but if you can get the sustained energy level above what you it can cope with, you can damage it. I don\u0027t know near enough to hazard a semi accurate guess as to the ranges and power levels that would take, but I suspect if any modern system can do it, it\u0027d be SPY-1. Brute force and a tightly focused beam, its the magnifying glass of radars. 6000 times more power than your microwave, and it can focus that into a spot the size of your microwave.........I think the only question is at what range can it fry electronics as opposed to whether or not it can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOff topic but neat fact. They actually had a problem when they first started using the SPY-1 system. it was too good. Seriously. It was tracking non-targets, such as insect swarms.

Your opponent will be able to locate you with the same precision from greater range in less time, even though this may give his presence away. Unable to accurately and very rapidly determine range, its almost impossible to judge the target speed and how much lead your weapons need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be fair, of course you could have your ships stay in groups and triangulate together. Your accuracy will still be less than with an active sensor given the techniques that can be utilised to improve resolution beyond what wavelength alone can provide, but it may be sufficient for combat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, consider that you know your target relies on IR to see you much as you do to see him, how important will reducing IR signature be in the design of new ships? A specially designed canopy or plating at the front of the ship, with an active cooling system to manage the temperature and as a result the difference to your surroundings could result in making the craft invisible to an IR only sensor. Given that IR is line of sight, they could have enormous radiators hidden away behind a thermally controlled canopy. From the side or behind, you couldn\u0027t miss their approach, from the front they are impossible to see as line of sight only allows you to look at the thermally controlled surface of the canopy, which near perfectly matches its surroundings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s tricks like approaching with a star at your back to hide in the emissivity of the star. you may need to actually increase your own emissivity to match so that you don\u0027t become a dark spot to an IR sensor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr killing a ship that\u0027s known to be planned to go to you, and jamming their communication attempts to alert you. you detect a craft approaching at the right time, and by the time you can see that its not who you thought it was, it may be too late to adequately respond to the attack. kinetic weapons launched at a facility from long range are such a situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust communication alone may be reason enough for jamming to be alive and well, and still very useful since it is a send/receive type of system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think relying solely on passive systems would be asking to get blindsided. Instead i think its more likely that active systems will still have their place to work in harmony with the passive systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefeating EM emissions is challenging, but doable.
