Instead I would just post short stories or short multi-choice interactive short story posts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy now, I know enough to do orbital dynamics some justice as well as conservation of energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you all for your kindness,and answers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I know I have said I would be gone and have come back within a month. I guess I enjoy the knowledge, and actually writing scifi is hard and requires a lot more committment than playing around here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet it is what I want, and I have enjoyed learning the craft of writing before. Scifi itself is a distraction ironically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I will actually need to unplug myself to create.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that is a trait-creativity, that I admire greatly anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI rather do that than consume whatever the powers that be call scifi nowadays, even if some of it is garbage to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo on that note....when or if I return, I will be different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood-bye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-12T04:41:48Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2021 04:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-12T05:02:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/197504-spacescifi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022197504\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/197504-spacescifi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Spacescifi\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Good luck and take care!
