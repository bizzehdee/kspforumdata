I tried rotating and thrusting, but nothing happened (my lander was happily burning through the decoupler). They must\u0027ve eventually drifted away since I ignored it and warped to my next node and when I got there, the fairings and decoupler was gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw the bit about the retro rockets -- will that help with this?

You should have a payload coupler at the bottom of your payload and the fairings attach to this. There are special attach nodes in the couplers to allow this to work properly. Don\u0027t fret if there is \u0022dead space\u0022 inside the fairing. This happens even with the real thing. Make sure your fairings are their own stage. This will prevent decoupling occuring at the same time you are activating an engine which can result in some odd behavior as the program tries to calculate multiple different changing physics vectors at the same time. Real rocket staging typically has the payload fairings separating shortly after 2nd stage activation. This allows for the prograde acceleration to stabilize so the only \u0022new\u0022 acceleration you are adding is the lateral force of the decoupling device. This is what gives a smooth and predictable separation of the fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Absolution","CreatedById":4156,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T01:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made this video a while ago and I have no idea why I took it down but here it is again.
