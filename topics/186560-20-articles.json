People for example, proclaiming that SpaceX will beat NASA to the moon when SpaceX has no way to accomplish such a goal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPot, meet kettle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA has literally accomplished nothing at all with SLS so far, and they accomplished testing the Orion heat shield such that they changed it for the next flight---which has as the primary purpose testing the \u003Cem\u003Enew\u003C/em\u003E heat shield. Unless you refer to the actual gal of SLS (see below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat doesn\u0027t mean they won\u0027t accomplish anything, but SLS will have accomplished something \u003Cem\u003Eonly when it actually flies\u003C/em\u003E, not a moment before that. Orion is not even complete for the Artemis-1 flight, so that doesn\u0027t get much in the way of accomplishment until they fly it all-up the first time (Artemis-2).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see many people saying SpaceX has no hurdles, quite the opposite. I do, however, think that my chances of seeing anything really interesting happening in space while I\u0027m still around over the next several decades have very little to do with NASA. I used to feel the other way around, then I watched nothing interesting happen for decades (Shuttle never interested me that much, and I was paying attention from start to finish).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA will not be going to the Moon without SpaceX, BTW.

Yes costly- but we can blame politics. If Starship were to be put through the same political hurdles and delays SLS has- it\u0027d evolve into a nasty beast just like SLS. SLS is more a product of it\u0027s leadership than engineering design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said- it still offers something that no other agency can offer. Manned capacity to the moon and the possibility of a landing by 2025. Something SpaceX and no other agency can do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSucceeds? Sure, the goal of SLS is accomplished by existing. The goal of SLS... the mission of SLS---is to build SLS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole benefit of SpaceX and Blue Origin is precisely the fact that they are not forced to bend to political whims. They can pursue goals with clean sheet designs, where they try to at least optimize over parameters they choose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a realist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarship is moving forward, and I\u0027ll be stoked to see it fly. I\u0027ll be more excited if it actually works. NG is supposedly moving forward, and I\u0027ll be super excited to see that fly as well. Both because reuse is the silver bullet for really interesting things to happen. No reuse---and in the long term I mean complete, operational flight to and from space---and nothing interesting \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eever\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E happens. People can argue if current efforts will achieve that goal, but there is no arguing the goal. Throw-away rockets can fly business as usual payloads, maybe even a lot cheaper, but we\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E a spacefaring species with expendable rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLS is definitively a dead end in that regard. That\u0027s not a problem, so was Apollo, and Apollo was awesome. If SLS could accomplish something really great before it gets superseded I\u0027d be very happy. I\u0027m just unsure what that might be. Sending people sorta kinda near the Moon is not terribly interesting, I\u0027ve seen that before, indeed I\u0027ve seen people land on the Moon, live on TV. That\u0027s my benchmark for interesting. Is there a decent chance SLS is PART of such a project in the next few years? Yeah, there is. The money shots will have SLS/Orion not even in the picture, and utterly uninvolved I\u0027d wager, however, as the lander is not an SLS launch, IMHO. SLS/Orion will be required, mind you, critical---but so was Michael Collins, and most people only remember Neil and Buzz.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-25T00:17:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150444-50calbmg/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022150444\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150444-50calbmg/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@.50calBMG\u003C/a\u003E on a bunch of those recent points, BTW (can\u0027t \u0022like\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am a fan of space efforts that I think move the ball forward in a meaningful way.

The current goal, a polar Moon base, is actually pretty decent.

The SLS primarily exists for their use; any additional usage on the side is simply a bonus. It really is more similar to the philosophy behind CCrew and COTS than you\u0027re giving it credit for.
