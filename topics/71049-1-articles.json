The game is so far away from release-ready at version 0.23.x.

My dinosaur home PC has 4GB of memory (it\u0027s original motherboard died, replacements that didn\u0027t require new CPU and RAM only had 2 ram slots), and it runs terribly. KSP takes several minutes to load, there are lengthy load times between any scene, even just going to map view and back.
