It\u0027s a 4 shot weapon with a Muzzle Velocity of ~150m/s. Not super amazing, but I didn\u0027t want to go overkill on my first operational version of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also designed it so it can be reloaded in space (always a win)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i758.photobucket.com/albums/xx226/chunkblaster/KSP%20-%20Baldr%20Mk1%20Frigate/screenshot8_zps19f6e065.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot8_zps19f6e065.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tested it against other craft, and it\u0027s great fun to blow stuff up with it. The railgun is very reliable and the rounds are sufficient to destroy at least part of another ship, sending the debris flying in all directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts not a railgun in the truest sense of a magnetic accelerated weapon (Stock KSP doesn\u0027t support that as of yet) but it works off of the same principles. The idea of the thing came from the old mass relays or \u0022kerbal cannons\u0022 people used to build. I simply said \u0022hey, if 1 booster makes the object fly away at this speed, what happens when it\u0027s accelerated by multiple boosters?\u0022 the concept definitely works when Applied correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also working on a new lifter for craft like this, based off the one I designed for the Baldr:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i758.photobucket.com/albums/xx226/chunkblaster/KSP%20-%20Baldr%20Mk1%20Frigate/screenshot11_zps323eba09.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot11_zps323eba09.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is pretty rough and inefficient for what I usually can do, but I rushed it together at 2 in the morning last night.
