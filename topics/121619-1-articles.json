And using SEP! This is just ludicrous. Even the EMPIRE missions needed less IMLEO.

This will not happen, and I think everybody knows it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssembling in lunar orbit when lifting everything from Earth... nuts! If you took out the stupid requirement to use SEP, I\u0027d bet you could put \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E mass on the martian surface with \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E launches following an EOR model. One SLS lifts a 100mT payload (50mT surface element with descent systems, or a 50mT transhab with a chemical return stage), then another one or two, the chemical stage(s) to inject the payload to Mars. There, a Mars mission in six-nine launches, using the three classical payloads: the ship to move your guys there and back, the lander to make the descent and ascent, and the surface hab. Not so damn difficult, right? And with much less items to develop! But that would be a sane Mars mission, and a myriad of those have been proposed over the years, so you know, insert your favourite Mars mission proposal here... it can\u0027t look worse than this one (90-day plan excluded).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe timeline is just the same nonsense that we always hear about. Somehow the money will materialize from nowhere, and they will be able to fly the SLS several times a year, while developing the myriad systems in the plan.

The only problem? They don\u0027t fit together: you can\u0027t stage your mission from an orbit that only makes sense if you have fuel depots, without having fuel depots. You can\u0027t use SEP with the premise it will save mas due to efficiency, when it\u0027ll \u003Cem\u003Ecost\u003C/em\u003E extra mass on account of the chemical kick stages, the requirement to leave from a high-energy lunar orbit, and using it for a truly minute portion of the mission. ISRU is there, but again, it\u0027s used in such a marginal fashion that it won\u0027t actually \u003Cem\u003Esave\u003C/em\u003E anything, just increase the complexity of the mission. Orion, nobody knows clearly what it\u0027s there for, I guess only a clone of Apollo can move people to lunar orbit. What is clear is the \u003Cem\u003Ecompletely artificial\u003C/em\u003E requirement to use a staging orbit only the SLS can reach with meaningful payload. Because hey, the best way to kick-start this whole exploration thing is to \u003Cem\u003Eexclude any other launch entity in the world from possibly contributing to the project in any way\u003C/em\u003E.
