Sorry if this has been asked before at some point, I tried looking and couldn\u0027t find anything on this. Could have been asked before the forums got reset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had KSP since spring 2012 and if I can add it to my Steam library great, if not I\u0027ll be keeping the KSP Store copy for the time being. For those wondering why I want to keep the KSP Store copy, I don\u0027t want to have to deal with Steam patching the game automatically and losing mods and/or saves. Yes I know auto patching can be disabled but I\u0027ve seen games where I had auto patching disabled and they still got patched.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaze 9X","CreatedById":102732,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T01:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only way is to buy another copy from steam.
