Just your basic gravity-turn, 45-degrees-at-10km, lob-it-to-parabolic-suborbital, do-a-burn-at-Ap-to-circularize type of launch, with the added wrinkle of recovering the first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m usually a three-stage-to-orbit kinda guy (e.g. \u0022Thumper, Swivel, Terrier\u0022 or \u0022Thumpers, Skipper, Poodle\u0022 or \u0022Kickbacks, Mainsail, Skipper\u0022), which averages out to 1000\u002B m/s per stage (admittedly, not evenly distributed among the stages). Going to two stages from three means it\u0027s 1500\u002B m/s per stage instead of 1000\u002B ... but that\u0027s still a far cry from the 3000\u002B m/s you need from an SSTO. Both mathematically and in the \u0022feel\u0022 of the launch, it\u0027s much closer to a conventional three-stage-to-orbit rocket than to an SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy fuel efficiency was just fine. I also played around with using air-breathers (bunch of radially attached Whiplashes, this was before Rapiers were available on that career) on the first stage of the vertical-launch rocket, and it actually worked pretty well-- gave \u0027em just a brief initial jolt from the LFO main engine to help get them spooled up, and then they worked great. Got the best of both worlds: the high Isp of jet engines, without the dead weight of lugging them all the way to orbit. Would be a pricey design for a throwaway first stage (jet engines are expensive), but worked pretty well with recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo from an engineering and economic perspective, it was a win. The reason I only did it briefly was mainly because it got tedious really fast: I do a lot of launches, and I \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eenjoy\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E doing launches, but babysitting the 1st stage back to earth was eating up time and was really dull for me. The most precious commodity in KSP (for me) isn\u0027t funds, it\u0027s my own time, and I want to spend that time doing whatever I personally find to be fun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(And besides, for completely irrational reasons, I just didn\u0027t enjoy it as much.

It\u0027s a story that speaks to me on every launch, never gets old, and-- simple though it may be-- is a big part of what keeps me hopelessly addicted to KSP. Stepping out mid-launch to pick up the pieces was like cutting away to a mutual-fund commercial right in the middle of a show\u0027s climactic action scene. It was a total buzz-kill for me.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T15:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure a space shuttle replica would be a good solution, but the mk3 spaceplane I built out of stock parts in sandbox mode is great.

Even in a type 3, can be awkward getting stuff in the cargo bay. Tried making an aircraft with twin tailbooms, leaving a place to attach a load with fairing at the end of the mid fuselage, but stuff doesn\u0027t want to snap in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Takes longer to get to orbit. It\u0027s a lot of fun, but yeah with a rocket it\u0027s over much sooner, one way or another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. In career mode, aircraft techs are too far away. Retractable undercarraige came in the 1920s, before the Apollo program. The first kind of jet engine was the turbojet, which is actually better at high speed/altitude than the turbofan, went to mach 2.8 on the mig-25. The SR71 blackbird was a turboramjet, 1960s/70s tech, top speed/altitude limited by skin heating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. In career mode, there are no airports other than the KSC. Many of my early space planes were sub-orbital, first stages for the rocket interplanetary vehicle. They\u0027d land off-airport on the opposite side of the world from the space centre, so i\u0027d only recover 25% of the cost of the plane , even though it is completely intact and just needs topping up with jet fuel to come home. Would actually work out cheaper to use disposable rockets :-(\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
