This was my first time really messing around with TAC LS so I mostly just wanted to get something into orbit around kerbin so I can find out if I\u0027m forgetting something important. Everything seemed to work out fortunately.\u003Cp\u003EI have NEAR installed which has the side effect of needing less dV to get into orbit, so I\u0027m not sure how you want to count that. I mostly have it in for the space planes. Other mods: RPM, Alcor Pod, MJ, VesselView, MKS/OKS, Karbonite, EVE, TextureReplacer, RCS Build Aid, Engineer, ScanSAT. Also Tweakscale and Infernal Robotics, but I didn\u0027t use any of those parts on these out of fear of having the station explode randomly. Active Texture Management helps the game work despite my crippling mod addiction. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B15300 153 tons in orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-1722 861 tons on launchpad/runway over 3 launches\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B900 9 Crew\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B3500 3 cupolas (x1), 3 hitchhikers (x4), 2 OKS Habs (x10? correct me if I\u0027m wrong)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B500 Science Lab\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1000 TAC LS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1000 Dedicated Shuttles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1000 Shuttles \u002B Escape Pod for returning to the surface (~850 dV on the escape pod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1000 Shuttles can mine/distill karbonite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B22478\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex 0.25 Orbit around Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5619 Points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has the OKS modules for recycling and a good number of spare parts, but I have no idea how to tell if it will last 50 years so I\u0027m not counting those points yet.

Normally I\u0027d keep the plane landed long enough to fill up all of its fuel tanks, then bring back the karbonite and make whatever the station needs at the time. It would be a slow process but it\u0027s better than nothing. I\u0027m going to try and build a heavier shuttle that can mine as well, but we\u0027ll see how that goes because my computer probably can\u0027t handle a much larger station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ihtoit","CreatedById":78942,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T12:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etwo of my smaller stations.

So I will have a complete space base on Gilly of 10 kerbals and another 6 on the surface base that can live for a long time (or 16 on the space ship), the harvester had a Karbonite energy generator (the bigger one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was finishing the last base but a bug made to disappear one of the landing ships with one kerbal inside, and the lag on the Gilly base made horrible to play there... I learn enough to make a mk2 ship, but I play only one or two hours at day and to make the mk2 colonization system I will need another week or more... So I wanted to show the first attempt here.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-27T02:52:18Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2014 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by obi_juan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thegab","CreatedById":100563,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T13:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@ obi_juan\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s called \u0022The Grand Orbital Space Station Challenge\u0022 it\u0027s about bases in orbit, so no point for your landers, that\u0027s a different challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus the use of mechjeb should cost you points, as many of us do their manoeuvers manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T17:12:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EObi_juan, thegab is partially correct. This challenge is all about space stations in orbit, not ground bases on the surface. Your ground bases, while laudable, generally won\u0027t count towards your point total. The only real exception to this would be if the ground base was part of the refueling infrastructure for the orbital station (such as what I think you have on Gilly), in which case you\u0027d get a few thousand additional points for the refueling capability. Please attempt to come up with a score that only takes into account the orbital components of each of your stations. I think I also need to see a few more photos showing other parts of the mission, such as the transfers to Eve and Gilly, and a Gilly refueling run. I don\u0027t think that the Eve surface base is going to count for anything, since there\u0027s no way to bring any Kerbals or fuel back up from the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThegab, mechjeb is the first mod listed as being specifically allowed in the stock(-ish) division.
