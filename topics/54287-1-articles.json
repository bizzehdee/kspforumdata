The question is whether by \u0022SSTO\u0022 people mean spaceplanes; an SSTO rocket plays just like a regular one, albeit with a bit less efficiency. So most of the discussion on SSTOs focuses on the issues of spaceplanes. (And it\u0027s implied that we\u0027re talking about on Kerbin.

Building something that sheds layers as it goes up is fairly easy, and lets you build as big as you want. Bigger is better with conventional rockets, but with something designed to go single-stage, you often want to stay small. That doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t make ridiculously huge SSTOs (my main heavy lifter, \u0022The Brick\u0022, is an 8000-ton SSTO rocket I use to lift my 700-ton space station), but designing an SSTO spaceplane encourages you to prioritize what you REALLY need and learn to construct efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; If and when we get an economy, there may or may not be a downside to discarding stages where they can\u0027t be recovered.

Their resource management is more difficult (IntakeAir), and they have to be balanced around an additional axis. Any sort of symmetry guarantees a rocket\u0027s center of mass will remain in front of its center of thrust, but with a spaceplane you also have to worry about center of lift, the location of your control surfaces, and so on. Even how you place ladders is more difficult; landing a spaceplane on an airless moon either requires a VTOL design or the ability to land on your tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; SSTOs, by their very nature, leave no debris to clutter up your space. You can make zero-debris rockets that use multiple stages, but it\u0027s inherent to the SSTO concept as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5\u0026gt; It\u0027s a challenge. (Yup, one more time.) Spaceplanes require a lot more hands-on work to get to orbit, whereas a regular rocket just tips over part way up and circularizes at the top. By going SSTO, you also have to spend more effort managing action groups, since you can\u0027t just dump the inefficient stages once you no longer need them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6\u0026gt; There is NO number 6!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7\u0026gt; Most regular rockets tend to look pretty similar after a while; everyone\u0027s used to the basic concept of tapering stages, or an asparagus setup. The specifics might differ, but the basic designs will be similar enough that there\u0027s not much point in showing off your own constructions. But go look through the SSTO thread in the Spacecraft Exchange, and you see a bunch of designs that look almost nothing alike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(To make this more pronounced, the stock rockets are decent starting points, but the stock spaceplanes are lousy.

Sure, that empty tank only has 1/9th its original mass, but that still adds up to an awful lot when a typical rocket has a ~15% payload fraction. Whereas if it dropped that weight as soon as the tank emptied, it\u0027d use less fuel to get the same capability (or more importantly, get more capability from the same amount of fuel) simply due to the remaining stages\u0027 rockets having less mass to accelerate. A true SSTO rocket also wastes quite a bit of weight on engine power; a design that gets the necessary 2.2-2.3 TWR at sea level will have far more engine power than it needs once it gets to near-orbit (not because things weigh less in low orbit, but because most of your fuel will be gone). This is especially true if your design is g-limited, such as lifting a fragile space station. You\u0027ll throttle down continuously as you go, to keep the acceleration manageable, and that wastes even more mass since you now could have used a much smaller engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd again, the line you quoted was purely regarding SSTO \u003Cstrong\u003Erockets\u003C/strong\u003E.

I mean, that 8000-ton booster has only ~440 parts; added to the 735 parts of the station, I\u0027m right at the limit of my processor capability when I launch the thing. If I had to use stock tanks it\u0027d take three or four times as many parts for the booster alone, which\u0027d force me to keep things much smaller just to keep my sanity. (Although Whackjob\u0027s made an art form of gigantic constructions with mostly stock parts...) The last major barrier to giant constructions, maneuverability, was removed when they switched to the new flywheel system. So I now use 830-ton stations, 400-ton Mun rovers, a 300-ton Kethane-refining lander/depot... and 27-32 ton spaceplanes. Like I said, smaller is a good idea for spaceplanes, and unmanned ion probes, but not much else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
