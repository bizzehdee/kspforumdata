I\u0027ve bitten off just a little more than I can chew and I\u0027m looking for some direction. I have been tasked with designing a custom image storage application. I\u0027m not a programmer but I am familiar with coding at a basic level and can usually figure things out with enough Googling and trial and error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBackstory: We are celebrating service anniversaries at work and have over 750 people included. Each of these people need to submit 1-3 photos. They typically email these and you can imagine how complicated that is to keep track of. I suggested \u0022Why not create a web app where people can just upload their pics with required data to a shared server?\u0022 So I get to make this. It has to be simple (the entire page should only be about uploading an image from their computer and subsequent data fields).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve thought about using cloud features like Google, DropBox, Flickr, etc. and am only concerned that the added functionality of these services will over complicate the process for the end-user. I literally want a web page with simple controls, a database to hold the images and meta, and an API between them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHTML/CSS/JavaScript should get the front-end taken care of pretty simply and I think I can handle that side. I just don\u0027t know which language would be best for the API or what database to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T20:55:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a pro, just someone who used to work as a php programmer in college.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPHP has an API for uploading stuff, including images. You can have it uploaded through that (there is even a HTML input type called File for that). Then, you simply upload any data about that thing into a MySQL database. When you want to load the thing again, you loop through the database and load a div for each one. I might even write a snippet, if you want me to?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex Mechs Robot","CreatedById":83406,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T21:11:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the reply. I should probably install something to get me the ability to test PHP and MySQL projects. This is all so over my head that I feel like a noob lol. HTML and CSS are easy to test in any web browser without any hoops to jump through but that isn\u0027t the same with PHP and MySQL so I don\u0027t really know where to begin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what I was thinking anyway since I want it to be a web app so thanks for confirming that.
