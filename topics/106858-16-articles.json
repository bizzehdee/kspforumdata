Coding is a pretty hard job, and it takes some time to fully understand what you\u0027re doing, writing configs is pretty easy, and if you have some experience, you shouldn\u0027t even need to fix bugs, because either the config works out of the box, or you notice your issues while testing the config. I have to agree with Borisbee and Ashley: Test your configs before releasing them. It is a shame that a great mod is buggy as hell, because nobody checks the config, and releases get rushed out before they are properly tested. And honestly amarius: You can\u0027t complain that you have too many mods, I\u0027ve seen people who maintain 10 mods or so and still have a job and a family. If you can\u0027t ensure, that your mods reach a specific level of quality, let someone else maintain them. But, if you really want to maintain them all, you can\u0027t use this as an excuse for your faults, and you need to make sure, that your mods are playable. Otherwise, I\u0027d suggest to remove all Download-Links, put \u0022[Heavy WIP]\u0022 in the title and to move this to Addon-Dev until you can fix EVERY single bug with the configs, because I\u0027ve already got PM\u0027s from users who think that Kopernicus would break KerbolPlus, and that annoys me.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk thanks... the reality is just that I don\u0027t have time for anything.
