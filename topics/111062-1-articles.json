Anyway, at around 12km to 17 km, it starts to wiggle, not side to side, but like small minute roll commands, but this happens ith SAS and without it. I\u0027m playing with (don\u0027t kill me) stock areodynamics. This eventually gets so bad that I lose control, and spin out. I checked my thrust on my engines, and they are the same. I would appreciate any help.

Its slightly like the diagram in the article, but the central body of the plane still roughly remains in that red circle, until I try and counter the problem, then it goes out of control. Doing nothing still eventually leads to spinout though. It just takes longer that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T22:58:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) If you have any wings or control surfaces which are large enough to flex at all, then you can get roll or other anomalies. Perhaps if you have large wings or heavy objects mounted on them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStruts can sometimes help relieve that problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) If you have angled control surfaces then yawing can cause roll and vice versa. This can make STS ineffective, and with STS off attempts to counter roll may make it worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to have issues with yaw causing rolling and vice versa. Dedicated control surfaces that don\u0027t serve dual purposes helped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially same thing you have on real planes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAilerons: These are the controls on wings. Disable Yaw and Pitch, leaving only Roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElevators: These should be far back on the plane. Disable Yaw and Roll, leaving only Pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERudder(s): These should be far back on the plane. Disable Roll and Pitch, leaving only Yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElevators should not be angled, and rudders should be perfect 90 degree angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can probably find a way to work outside these guidelines, but you got to know what you\u0027re doing. If you try to put two rudders on top at 45 degree angles so they can double as roll/yaw, then a roll will generate some yaw, and yaw will generate some roll. In such a situation STS will fight itself, and with STS off you will be fighting yourself as you correct for yaw you will then have to correct roll, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T23:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt can happen for the fuel consumption that cause your nose to be lighter and yaw in one direction or another.
