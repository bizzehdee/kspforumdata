However, most players don\u0027t seem to know about it one way or the other and it has game balance implications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first noticed this method in 0.25 and took some pics, which are shown below. This method makes it much easier to complete test contracts for a wide variety of engines, including solid rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI accepted a contract to test the LFB in flight. The LFB has to be activated via the staging sequence. After launching, I edited the staging sequence in flight to add an extra stage event. This allowed me to \u0022activate\u0022 the LFB by pressing the spacebar when I reached the required conditions. This allowed me to complete the contract using nothing but the LFB for propulsion. I then recovered the LFB close to the KSC, meaning that I got most of the cost of the craft back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was playing on custom difficulty, but it was still a huge payday for my programme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QdwlahC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QdwlahC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Gkog0GL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Gkog0GL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K9IZgFt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022K9IZgFt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wYJd2SI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wYJd2SI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s another example from a later save. The contract asked me to test the LFB on a Mun escape trajectory. Most of the propulsion needed to complete the contract came from the LFB itself. Note that I was doing some other contracts on the same flight, which is why the ion engine and decoupler are attached to the nose. I completed the contract and recovered the craft to the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HCKxKU3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HCKxKU3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OmvSRip.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OmvSRip.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z7vahu0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Z7vahu0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince 0.90 was released, a lot of players have been commenting that they had to abandon contracts like these because they couldn\u0027t afford the cost of the enormous rocket they think they need to launch the part to meet the conditions.
