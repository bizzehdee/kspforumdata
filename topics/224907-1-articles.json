I just downloaded the ps5 version after my main save on ps4 became unrecoverable, only to be met with the game not even launching when you press start new game? Am I at fault here or have the devs really done a doosie and put out a halfbaked game you can\u0027t even launch. I\u0027m already mad about my 100\u002B crafts disappearing into the void let alone not being able to launch my native version. There must be a fix please help me!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-22T23:08:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI regret to inform you that work on KSP1 concluded a while back and currently the fate of KSP2 is in doubt. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
