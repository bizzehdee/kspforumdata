Also, check your center of thrust and make sure it\u0027s in line with the center of mass. If there are parts on it that aren\u0027t perfectly symmetrical it could cause this. If you have tail fins, it could also cause this. Depending on what control surfaces you\u0027re using, those could also be a major cause. One last probable issue that could cause this to happen, is that the plane might not be properly supported on it\u0027s landing gear, meaning that the weight sags down on the wings and could cause the plane to tilt and then it goes off the runway. If you post pictures of your plane, everyone will be able to help you more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T08:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould be the landing gear sagging.
