My main concern right now is KSP has crashed twice when clicking \u0027Recover Vessel\u0027 at the top of the screen after splash-down/landing. Once in Career Mode, once in Sandbox Mode. As you can imagine, this happening right at the end of a long complex mission can get annoying. However, usually by that time KSP has saved the game.\n\nI\u0027m using Windows7 64-bit but running KSP 0.90.0.705-32bit. I have the following mods installed; the only mod that has any updates available which I haven\u0027t yet installed is KerbalEngineer:\n\n000\\_Toolbar\n\nBoulderCo\n\nCrewXfer\n\nDistantObject\n\nEnvironmentalVisualEnhancements\n\nKerbalEngineer\n\nKerbQuake1.21\n\nUniverseReplacer\n\nI\u0027ve also downloaded the latest AMD drivers for my video card (haven\u0027t installed them yet), but I\u0027m wary of upgrading these as it usually causes more problems than it solves and I don\u0027t update them if I don\u0027t have to.\n\nHere\u0027s the link to the error log zip file.[https://www.dropbox.com/s/oq6grir0vrpgp9j/2015-04-01_015432.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oq6grir0vrpgp9j/2015-04-01_015432.zip?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"RobotsAndSpaceships","CreatedById":122975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T05:25:08Z","Content":"Why are you still using UniverseReplacer?

(Due to the underlying game engine \u0022Unity 4\u0022?) which caps the memory to about 3.5gig. So even if you have 200g memory on your computer. once the game reaches 3.5 gig of space used on the computer it crashes...\n\nATM - The FIRST time you run ATM it will take a long time to load the game. (More mods installed increase the time) Thats because the ATM mod is compressing all the image files into a format that will use less memory.\n\nOnce it has completed that the first time, future launches of the game will load the game just as fast as it ever did before. BUT now it will take less memory to do it.\n\nYES You want to get ATM if your crashing due to out of memory issues.\n\nAnd hopefully the 64bit version will be fixed soon.\n\nre: force-opengl\n\n add -force-opengl to your shortcut used to launch the game\n\nie. go into properties, and edit the line that calls the game. and add -force-opengl \n\nso for example instead of the:\n\n\u0022C:\\Games\\KSP .90.705\\KSP.exe\u0022 \n\nit would now say:\n\n\u0022C:\\Games\\KSP .90.705\\KSP.exe -force-opengl\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"spacedoctor42","CreatedById":138696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T01:14:05Z","Content":"I don\u0027t mean to hijack this thread but I\u0027m having the exact same problem.
