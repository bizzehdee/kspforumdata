I\u0027m running KSP on a heavily unoptimized laptop that was \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E built for gaming. It\u0027s stupid, I know, but it\u0027s what I have at the moment. well, okay, I do have a super computer of sorts down-stairs, but this thing is mobile and I have yet to set up a stable and secure way to remote in from my college, so there it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I\u0027m running several mods that reduce textures and what-not. I don\u0027t see how any of them could conflict honestly. The mods I\u0027m using are Texture Replacer (harmless to mods that add new textures, especially if you don\u0027t use the compression system), DDS loader (unless I convert your textures to that format, there aint nothin\u0027 happenin\u0027 there), and LoadOnDemand (currently this is my only concerning one, but I need it to keep my performance up even with super compressed textures.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this is what I\u0027m experiencing. When launching from a runway (and only runways, launch-pads are not affected) the models for the runway and buildings themselves are textured with no problems, but the surrounding terrain is all screwy. From certain camera angles it randomly switches to a super low-res texture and when turning the camera around I get a high-res texture. This is not the main problem, because the high-res texture itself is where it gets worse. Instead of the normal higher-res texture, I get this solid color with these blurry black lines going through it, like someone replaced the texture with a grid-texture that they exported to a heavily compressed 5x5 resolution bitmap. Returning to the same spot without the runway (other building do not create this effect) the terrain goes back to normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that some parts of the models being used are made up of terrain-like slabs that are meant to reduce the sudden drop off the side of the runway and/or whatnot. if my suspicions are correct, then it is the textures upon those models which are freaking out in this way. I\u0027m still testing combinations and configurations, but I thought I\u0027d throw this out there and see if this is being experienced by anyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Holy Jeb\u0027s Ghost, that post was longer than I thought.
