Currently have (OK, had) three \u0022ships\u0022 flying, each with three Kerbals:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. One enroute back from Dres to Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A Jool expedition armada, one ship along with two other robot controlled units (a tanker and a probe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. A Duna expedition, landed on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that it was time to arrive at Jool, because my expedition is about 20 days out, I went to space center, tracking station, and selected Jool expedition ship. It started to load and...wtf? Black screen, altitude numbers rolling 888,888 ... 111,111 etc. Nothing seen in map mode either, except text saying \u0022Focus gibberish,\u0022 certainly not \u0022Jool Expedition.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I exited out of KSP, loaded it again. Now the Jool ship and its Kerbals have vanished. Yikes, must be right into the Kraken\u0027s maw. I\u0027m glad there\u0027s a name for this phenomenon, it gives me a way of dealing with it stoically. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other Jool expedition ships appear to be OK, so at least I get some science from the deal. (This is my first visit to Jool.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is the Kraken, no?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Reading the wiki, the bug I encountered resembles the \u0022Hell Kraken\u0022 however I had no EVAs going on, nor had I been time warping with any of the Jool ships. In fact, I had been leaving them alone for weeks while I tended to other missions in progress. Yet, the ship with Kerbals in it was destroyed, and nav ball had disappeared, as in the description of the \u0022Hell Kraken\u0022 bug.
