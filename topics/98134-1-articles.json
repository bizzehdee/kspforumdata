I would absolutely love to see a new camera view which pins to the apsect angle to the ship and the orbited body. However you drag the camera, it will maintain the same angle with relation to the ship and the orbited body. This means the camera is constantly rotating with the position of the ship as it orbits a body, thereby keeping the body in view (if that\u0027s how you set it) at all times. The ship could spin around its own axes without affecting the camera.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
