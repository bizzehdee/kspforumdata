Either to select just a maneuver node or a apsis (periapsis or apoapsis) it\u0027s really getting old trying to constantly click click clickity click in just the right spot to only select the one thing i want to see/change when there is this entire other mouse button to make use of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly it would be nice if the maneuver being created defaulted to the current orbit in the case of having an orbit that transitions through a SOI, so there is two separate orbits that are very close to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso seriously why the *Bleep* isn\u0027t there a Key mapping option yet or at the very least an in game \u0022What the *\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#$\u0026amp;$ are all the keyboard commands\u0022 at this stage of development.

You have been playing for 2 years witouth noticing that you can rotate the map not only with the arrow keys but also with right-clicking? Before making this suggestion, have you tried that what you are going to suggest is whether already implemented? Or somehow you can\u0027t rotate the camera by right-clicking? Anyway, that selection stuff sounds great. Altough it couldn\u0027t be done by right clicking, it could be done by left clicking, as there\u0027s no action for dragging while left clicking. And the two orbits that are close to each other? That\u0027s a real problem, as well as placing a maevuer close to you, after entering the SoI of a planet. That\u0027s very buggy at me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T15:25:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree.
