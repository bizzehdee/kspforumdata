Did not know of its existence since a couple of days. For me its the best game i purchased since 2012!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe learning curve is quit steep for new people but YT is full with tutorial vids that are very helpfull to bring a spaceship into orbit. In my first attempt i shot a kerbal right into the dark, deep space going nowhere. Poor guy (or girl). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully there will be some apps in the future to use my Ipad mini for cockpit view or as instrument panel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat job so far!! Keep on doing the great work!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T07:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Mr. or Ms. Polar-eX.
