Now, KSP provides us with empty and full fuel masses, but does not disclose the cost per litre of fuel/oxidizer, or the cost of an empty tank, so we cannot use regular methods to calculate the cost of fuel per volume. Additionally, the cost of the tank also increases as the volume of fuel also increases, as the tank must get bigger to accommodate more fuel. If anybody has spent the time to find out, it would be much appreciated if they could tell me or show the method to calculating the cost per litre of fuel. I\u0027ve already used the method used in the Millikan oil drop experiment with no avail. If anybody can help it would be great!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperWeegee4000","CreatedById":71621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T02:29:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, a liter calculator would be nice.

That costs $925 per metric ton right now according to the IATA (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.iata.org/publications/economics/fuel-monitor/Pages/price-analysis.aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.iata.org/publications/economics/fuel-monitor/Pages/price-analysis.aspx\u003C/a\u003E), so call it $1000 per ton. Liquid oxygen is cheaper than that, so I would just use $1000 per ton of fuel/oxidizer. Those are real dollars, not kerbal dollars, which I have no idea how to convert, but the point is that even large rockets running on RP-1 aren\u0027t going to have even $1,000,000 in fuel costs, while the cost of a large rocket launch is often in the hundreds of millions of dollars range.
