It\u0027ll be really interesting to see what approach squad is going to take for aerodynamics.

There can be so much to do in this area. Aerodynamics may also be cool, if we had a real weather system for example.

It\u0027s just too much for being a game rather then a simulator. My guess is it will be something like the \u0022stock drag fix\u0022 mod, or maybe a bit more into what NEAR is.

Infa gliders shouldn\u0027t be able to exist and you should be punished for building wide shallow rockets. Nose cones also need a purpose outside of looks. Beyond that It doesn\u0027t really matter to me or most of the players of this game. There is always mods to make things more realistic, but the game currently is so unrealistic its to easy to \u0022cheat\u0022 physics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources should be kept simple. Plenty of mods show promise, such as Kethane, on how a simple resource simple can be fun and interesting. I also feel Squad should do their own version of it. Their original idea was simple to complicated. I\u0027d rather have a very simplistic resource system thats fun to manipulate and use rather than a complicated real one. Leave that to mods, this IS JUST A GAME. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth show great promise and are perfect starting points for the Beta stage of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
