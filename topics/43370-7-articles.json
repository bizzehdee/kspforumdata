We\u0027re already on the cusp of leaving radio behind ourselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what if the Milky Way is .5 billion years younger than the rest of the universe? It still would have to go through an entire generation of stars before any of them were capable of producing the elements needed to form proper planets with sufficient resources for life to form. So, 6 or 7 billion years for enough stars to have burned all the way to carbon or iron and gone boom? Another billion or so years for new stars to form out of the ashes of the old with planets that can properly support the formation of life, having the necessary ingredients.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother 3 billion years for that life to reach a point where it can begin moving out from its home. So, we\u0027re up to about 4 to 3 billion years ago, roughly, when the first civilizations could reasonably have begun to explore space. Still within your time window. But I think you\u0027re being too generous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt .1 c, it\u0027s a nearly 50 year trip from here to the nearest star...and that\u0027s just the trip. Right now, we ourselves are looking at a minimum of 50 years just to build a ship that could get to the true edge our solar system within a human lifetime. At .005 c, they won\u0027t colonize anything. The only thing anyone will ever send, are probes...and probably not even that, when it\u0027s going to be an 800 year trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk then, so scratch that. Every civilization is going to fully infest its homeworld before it even gets to the rest of its solar system. For us, that\u0027s about now, so we\u0027ll stick with the numbers we\u0027ve used so far. In which case, it took us 50,000 years about, to get to that point. Considering how things have gone in the last few centuries, we could probably truly fully take over the solar system in about a thousand years, if we become hardcore expansionists and do nothing else. That\u0027s not really worth including in a billion-year timescale, so we\u0027ll mostly skip it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce they get to that point though, they\u0027re still staring at a trip that\u0027s going to take the better part of a century in a best-case scenario. (warp drive is off the table because, even if it works, it can\u0027t be used effectively) And they\u0027re certainly not going to be flinging colonists out there willy nilly (if they want them to succeed, anyway). So to really fully \u0022master\u0022 a given colony world (a necessity before attempting to master another star system, itself a necessity before attempting to colonize another star), you\u0027re looking at at least another thousand years...plus another thousand to get the system under control. Now, at that point...you have two systems with which to support a third, so you could do it in about 1500 years total instead of 2000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re still looking at 50 year trips in between, though, and that\u0027s on the good side...assuming habitable worlds are that close together. Otherwise you\u0027re looking at having to engineer special habitats or terraform colony worlds from the very start before you can even put a reasonably large population there...tack on at least another thousand years to the colonization process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u0027re we up to now? To get 9 other star systems fully developed along with the home system (and we\u0027ll go with a drop of 1,000 years development time for every two systems colonized, to simplify), you\u0027re looking at at least 11,000 years or so (I didn\u0027t go through it all in my head)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after a certain point, the inner systems of this empire will no longer be viable for establishing colonies, since they\u0027re much too far away from the colonial frontier to contribute anything meaningful within a reasonable amount of time. And then we have a new problem anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce this empire hits about 20 ly across, it\u0027s going to stop expanding. Because if it expands any farther, it hits the same issue as every pre-industrial empire before it...communication. You can\u0027t build an empire when you can\u0027t talk to it, and when it takes 20 years just to make a statement and get a response, you\u0027re done. At that point, you have to turn over near complete autonomy to each star system, and not all of them are going to want to play ball with colonization anymore. And that applies even if they manage to develop some magical type of shielding that lets them safely travel at .999999999 c. The communications barrier will stop them at a diameter of around 20 to 30 ly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they develop FTL propulsion of some kind, that changes things, but not by much. Consider, to even double the speed of light, even with White\u0027s revisions to the warp drive, would take enormous resources. At double c, it\u0027s a 2 year trip to the nearest stars. At quadruple c, it\u0027s one year; at 8 times c, it\u0027s 6 months, etc...we all know that, right? But then, you still have to spend thousands of years fully mastering all those systems to support the energy-intensive and complex drives that you\u0027re tooling around with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd even so, you still run into the communications problem. At even 8 times c, you only double the diameter of your empire, at best, which by then becomes 40 to 60 ly...80 if your set-up is really good. That\u0027s a 5 year trip to get from the homeworld to the outer colonies, 10 to get form one edge to the other. And it requires physical travel, not merely a \u0022call\u0022, which is going to take even more resources, and still takes too long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, but no, you have to have serious FTL capabilities to even consider conquering a whole galaxy. Otherwise, all you\u0027re doing is breaking your own civilization into pieces and hoping the other pieces don\u0027t decide the original piece were real jerks. And best-case scenario, it only applies to local space. No one will ever colonize vast swaths of space at sublight...period.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T16:40:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tharios\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tharios\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe\u0027re already on the cusp of leaving radio behind ourselves.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI read until there.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T16:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExept for short-range transmissions, such as cellphone calls and WiFi, and perhaps a few long range things like GPS, radio isn\u0027t going to stick aroung too much longer.
