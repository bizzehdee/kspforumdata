We got early access releasing Feb 24th, you might have missed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, both games are in Unity, so modding should be pretty familiar to ones who are experienced. However, the way that KSP2 functions would probably mean that mods built for KSP1 can\u0027t be chucked onto KSP2 and simply work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoldForest","CreatedById":77770,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-26T06:20:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224190948\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666764415\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022217752\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Watermel00n\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Watermel00n said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello.

Parts mods will definitely need to be remade as KSP 2 uses new PBR textures, which none of the KSP 1 mods support atm. Config files will also probably have to be remade as the setup/code for KSP 2 will more than likely be different then KSP 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
