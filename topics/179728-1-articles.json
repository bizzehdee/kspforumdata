No language package nor mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen running from an administrator account KSP works fine. When running KSP from an account\u00A0without admin privileges it stalls during loading. \u0022Loading Asset Bundle Definitions\u0022 is displayed and loading does not proceed any further. (To be precise: In the admin account loading pauses for about three seconds at that stage, too, but then goes on; in the non-admin account loading stalls for minutes until I quit the program.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have searched the forum and found the suggestion to move the KSP.app to the desktop (or any other place, I suppose) and back in order to avoid the Gatekeeper issue which has been mentioned. This does not help for the non-admin accounts. The problem persists. All other suggestions to similar problems did not seem to fit our situation. (Sorry if I missed something.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe log file says basically the same as what was reported in other posts and indicates that part of the contents within the KSP.app package as well as some files in subfolders could not be opened. (I can provide more log file info if needed, but I am on a different Computer\u00A0now.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried setting the permissions of the KSP.app for everyone from read-only to read\u0026amp;write, but that did not change anything either (same freeze). Changing the permissions of all the subfolders and the files seems to be unpractical (could only do it one by one).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anybody have any ideas or suggestions beyond moving the KSP.app?\u00A0Any help would be deeply appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PonderS","CreatedById":193150,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-12T08:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems like I have stumbled across a possible solution.
