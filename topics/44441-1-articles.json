You\u0027ll make each nozzle its own object (name them nozzle1 and nozzle2) and then when you import them into unity you\u0027ll create two empty GameObjects, both named thrustTransform (names are not unique, though object paths must be for certain things, more on that in a minute)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll only need ModuleEngines in your config file, the maxthrust and such will be halved (or divided by three if there are 2 nozzles) and your FX entry will be applied to each transform identically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only tricky part is if you want to animate the heat glow on the engines or want them to gimbal. For that you need to create another layer of objects (since your nozzles need to be parented to the transforms for gimbal to work)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enormally its PartToolObject -\u0026gt; YourEngineModel -\u0026gt; thrustTransform -\u0026gt; nozzle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have 2 nozzles then it would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPartToolObject -\u0026gt; YourEngineModel -\u0026gt; thrustTransform (object 1) -\u0026gt; nozzle1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPartToolObject -\u0026gt; YourEngineModel -\u0026gt; thrustTransform (object 2) -\u0026gt; nozzle2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is going to confuse unity when it comes to animations and such, since it will look for the 1st instance of \u0022thrustTransform\u0022 and use that in the \u0027file path\u0027 and your 2nd one will never work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou solve this by adding another empty gameobject to your tree:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPartToolObject -\u0026gt; YourEngineModel -\u0026gt; Engine1 -\u0026gt; thrustTransform -\u0026gt; nozzle1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPartToolObject -\u0026gt; YourEngineModel -\u0026gt; Engine2 -\u0026gt; thrustTransform -\u0026gt; nozzle2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine1 and Engine2 are just empty gameobjects created in unity, no mesh, no script or anything added. Think of it like a sub-folder for organization purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe workflow to set it up is a little annoying. You parent the Engine1 object to your 1st thrustTransform and zero out the x, y, and z location transforms so they share pivot points, then drag the engine1 object back so its parented to YourEngineModule (and don\u0027t touch the translation numbers) then you drag the thrustTransform to be a child of the Engine1 object and finally parent the nozzle1 object to that. Repeat for each nozzle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt definitely works, I\u0027ve made engines with 8 distinct nozzle objects, and there is no limit in theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way you should be able to have more than one ModuleEngines in your config, so long as they have different thrustTransform object names defined.
