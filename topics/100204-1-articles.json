I know theres SAS and RCS for halting rotational movement, is there anything I can do to halt extremely small amounts of linear movement? I tried with RCS but I did not place nearly enough, and its not throughout the hull so when used it kind of rotates the station sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond question, when docking in the future I might have issues where my craft docks too quickly and imparts some linear momentum onto the space station, kind of ties back to my first issue is there any way have a more stable space station?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StormKat","CreatedById":126927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T14:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERCS will work in this case as well.

That\u0027s one of the hardest things in the game, and once you can do it, the rest of the game is open to you. You can now build massive structures in space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA tiny lateral speed change will only change the orbit a little bit, you might aswel ignore it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for controlling docking speed: You can change your speed with RSC with H and N (H is forward thrust, N is backward thrust). Similarly, you can do all lateral movements with RSC: I is down, K is up (reverted controlls, like airplane) J for left, L for right. All this is relavent to the Navball. In order to also get these controlls relative to the screen, change camera mode (V key) to Chase mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good way to practice docking is to send up a single rocket, with a tip you can seperate from the rest of the rocket (with docking ports). Set the tip up with RSC. Make sure it\u0027s light and ballanced: Probe body, RSC tank on either side, RSC thrusters 4 way symetry on each RSC tank, and docking ports on each side. This is a perfectly ballanced RSC probe, very easy to manouver. Perfect for practicing. Don\u0027t forget some static solar panels, and maybe some small batteries so it has power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust fire it up into orbit, decouple the probe and practice flying around the rest of the rocket and docking (make sure the main rocket also has a probe body, and both can use SAS to keep it stable. Don\u0027t forget some solar panels/batteries on the main rocket either)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strongest_2hu","CreatedById":67784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T04:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember that quickly entering then leaving timewarp is an easy/cheaty way to stop all vessel rotation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that according to your description the station is fairly unmaneuverable, you probably should reconsider maneuvering it to your tug rather than the other way around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
