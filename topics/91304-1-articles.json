Answering your question if we have resource system in place it is easy to make KSP even more challenging and interesting. For example install EPL, install ISP difficulty scaler and modify atmospheric ISP to be more inline with reality. If you play career with funds you now have very big incentive to build rockets on moons / planets without atmosphere since it\u0027s much cheaper to launch heavy expedition ship not from Kerbin. Add to that rare metals and exotic minerals recovery from ore concentration process and there you go - you build self-sustained exploration-mining programme (which is about right since missions after a while are too repetitive).

Since Water isnt easy to come by with interplanetary mining, i can foresee wanting to recycle all of it we could. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso im not sure if you\u0027ve seen the latest MKS release, but Roverdude added in a production chain for rocket parts with his latest release. Might be worth a peek. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway Keep up the awesome work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks:)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve exchanged thoughts with RoverDude in the beginning of planning phase and I\u0027m still thinking how to introduce additional complexity to MKS / EPL without too much of it at the end (so using CRP materials when needed etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed that water is scarce so water (or chemicals) usage will have to be super small (closed cycle for cooling), dunno about refinery usages yet.
