Hit 45degrees at ~28km up, and slowly bring your nose toward the horizon. Should have 1/3-1/2 of a LFT, as well as about 1/2 of each jet fuel tank.

I got it into orbit with plenty of fuel to spare like you said. Reentry was smooth but it felt a bit wobbly flying with a joystick. Would have been nice to have some kind of ASAS. Otherwise, nice job.
