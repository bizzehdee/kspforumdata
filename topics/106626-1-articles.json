The problem is:\n\n1) The vast majority of site survey contracts are going to stick at least one node at super-high altitude, which is far too high for early aircraft.\n\n2) As you get more reputation and more difficult contracts, the distances move out, and flying for ages in a plane is kind of dull.\n\n3) That\u0027s basically the only contract you can do with aircraft.\n\nPlane-based contracts that require you to fly around, land somewhere, drop someone off, fly back, or hit specific targets or *whatever* would be nice. Especially since the Tech Tree has been made much less imbecilic with regards to aircraft, it makes early planes more viable. Unfortunately without contracts, there\u0027s little point."},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:34:52Z","Content":"I\u0027m betting that the typical 18-20km altitude requirements on the Kerbin survey missions are leftover from pre-1.0 when it was relatively easy to fly that high on basic jets.\n\nI\u0027ve still managed to do a couple of those, but I had to put a rocket booster on my plane to give it the push from 10km to 20km, and was only good for one survey before needing a refuel."}]}
