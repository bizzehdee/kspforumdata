It\u0027s just an illusion that you\u0027re going \u0022backwards\u0022. In fact you\u0027re standing still (floating still?) in space and Kerbin is rotating under you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if you retain the 250 or whatever m/s of Kerbin\u0027s surface rotation, it is moving 250m/s around its relatively smaller circle, while the 250m/s you retained is around a much larger circle up in space. When it\u0027s rotated halfway around, you\u0027ve gone 10% of your orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-24T13:01:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224096027\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207031\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221645669715\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022188491\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JERONIMO\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, JERONIMO said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s more of a physics question probably but why does the rocket after launch starts moving (or lagging behind) kerbin?
