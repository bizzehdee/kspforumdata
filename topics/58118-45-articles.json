However/ unfortunately, he stepped on luminous frogs. Thus, he squelched to eat - the koalas drank bleach. This killed several hamsters which were on top of the sun. This killed several Jebediahs while he danced to dubstep, causing him and Sophia to suffer horribly without Bill, who was punished by God For treason Against kraken Mcpuffin. Henceforth, trilobites tossed children emphatically under ground where they imploded into nothingness then somethingness maximus horse meat, loathing the orangutans who postulated why they require boosters betwixt two, now exploded, Kerbals named Phyllysiumb O\u0027Explosiory and Hnrrngh Eggbertoodison. With wrenches and rovers, kerbals decided that jelly could be used as monopropellant to adjust the orientation Kraken. Feared, Jebediah The Great Duckerbal gained superpowers that medwedianized parents, causing entropy to expose McShnazzlehauffer sucking black-holes blasting pneumonia which meant to ensure Bob\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s snacks is constantly burning bagpipes and rocks. So Kirrim Kerman ate peanuts that extrapolated killing Zombieland causing rabid ignorant politicians to decide the outcome of apocalyptic nightmares. However, Jeb trembled with fear but, had a chainsaw that ridded pineapples with a firery burrito kitten that ate Dawton Strudelston defecated underneath KSC Launchpad causing chickens for extreme rocketry powarrrr. Then a pokemon killed adjective burner. Then zenzizenzizenic suddenly inverted gravitation weaponry crackled violently and deconstructed scientific facilities on the farm of a kerbal actress who exploded into sub-sandwiches. Partikles which ate the brains and the eyes and which aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t flamin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 right. Or submerged by a duckling who eliminated handsome mudkips although while kerbals are edible a SRB will destroy Curse creators because Curse isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a radioactive floopooldooper like mine leader who was secretly fluffy on Saturn. But suddenly, Jebediah Jackson decided to explode with baconey nukes. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMeanwhile, a wild grue ate his snacks through the awfully tiny thisisnotasentenceorsomething. Therefore, the very gentle kerbal ate snacks! Causing, the game to crash. Then he nullified the current position while singing Kerbobeiniki/Kerbobeiniko causing explosions everywhere including Laythe, Tylo and Bop. Sadly, anyone who does not nibble cookies will die. Therefore, undead whales can be happy even though they killed many birds whilst swimming and dancing breakdance. Sadly they love polka shaped astronaughts and ducklings. Then it happened and aliens destroyed the Tylonian kerbal cop-robot because demand for robocops has miss McShnazzlehaufer (the daughter of BaconMaster McShnazzlehaufer). Jeb was completely scared by stupidity of Idontfreakingknow\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s mother-in-law who always eats bagels coated rockets with lemon of another tree got severe explosionitus, meaning \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 to cure could spell echinoderms must be rich as a mlp pebble. Bacon ate \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003Epnumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. The rockets made derailment a large threat to life of kalipoopers that singin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 a lovely mermaids song. Then cows that kill Doug Tennapel mischievously grew into carnivorous monkeys that defecated over bananas that ate monkeys children. Luckily, a politician doggie has uranium which compensates nukes idunnolawl radioactive fallout causing death including muffins with suicidal cake that being technical modkips caused explosions. Jeb decided to evacuate MRtenchars a noble mailman who nibbled upon giblets from space. This led to severe anthropology and happiness was kinda creepy somewhat egalitarianism with sigh of exasperated gratitude expend expelled a hot warning duckie that will achieve lowliness. Tetris\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2te McBobakins IX was some hairy potato chip that smells like potatochips and bananas with small pizzas. But, no kerbal ate sacred inquisition but BaconMaster said \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI shooooouuuld buy many mousepads from Microsoft opportunity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.

Then, an historian super exploded!!!!! And lived happily ever never/after until Jebediah Schloopenheim ate butnuts from the cake was not a lie. However, it was a bored elephant that BOOM SHAKALAKA shakefuboomboom caused a hyperspace explosion above the planet but the explosion was too small to vaporize the cheeseballs becausetheydecidedtomergewithsaturnandmakesaturncheesier. Afterwards Russia nuked Saturn usingthepowerofthekraken 2 take my word from Steve so he won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get muffins that are gladiators from Enceladus. While Russia\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s army eats planets for Obama.

But also slapped Billy-Bobbles while burning inside the furnace which also had sharks. The guns shot Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh Kerman (causing) asphyxiating all heuristic cheesecakes. Eating pie and hippopotomonstrosesqipadiliophobia-related products including veryscaredhippopotomonstrosesquipadiliophobics. Later watermelons Danny charged the purchase. Furthermore, Jebediah backstabbed Bill for Bob\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s honor. However Jebediah (was fired) becauseareasonandthiswillprobablyaddanextraspacetoruinthegame gurgle. Russia and Ethiopia obliterated Reichtangle and I exploded!!! Then Ika McShnazzlehauffer forcefully fed Jebediah Kerman but he misspelled horribly wrong and capitalizes every cheesecakes out sandalspontification. Then \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Murica danced all minute on Dr. Vanhicktenstein\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s grave. Space has stopped being sufficiently spacey, although maybe it was dead or just sleeping. Can Ethiopia into lithosphere and Jebediah, and Danny2462 Kerman exploded with their jaws broken.

Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobic rainsans gave upstairs apartments building!!! Why does Jeb break the rainsan thingymadoodlebob and logic defying Sputnik. This Ethiopia was disturbed by Paraguayan foreigners from Kazakhstan located deep underground. So, what did you think about my cream? Wait, that printer Stalin and Putin, who shrekt and danced into a turd colored turd salubriously. Meanwhile GreeningGalaxy stood naked whilst eating general desserts. But overfloater and the Sovieeeeetsssss were exfoliating GreeningGalaxy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s putins with bohemian underwear that were burlap lunchboxes made from GreeningGalaxy that combusted. Nakedness has to conjugate. So Shrek ate everything blue Mun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit that deorbited into Mir. The spacebar destroyed Saturn. Then, page 100 imploded due to have killed dinosaurs. Then, direwolfed. Later, the Pegasi vomited rainbows on General Crappyness Blew The Nukes while marshmallow horses engineered boosters trains of mass less bread. Hippopotamuses spontaneous combust has likes cheese fungus and fungal infection damages the administration igloo. Overfloater then ate pizza with Gereral Rarity during the equestrian apocalypse which littlepip danced infinitely to static electricity induced bacon system feathers. Later, lazorshootingroflcopter explodes into one extremely dense vacuum.
