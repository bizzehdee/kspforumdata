That said, I know that isn\u0026#39;t going to be a small update and it may take the team some time to get it up and running. I\u0026#39;ve been thinking about trying out 1.0.5 in the meantime, but lacking x64, I\u0026#39;m wondering if I\u0026#39;m just going to run into the same problem with memory I used to get with 0.90. I\u0026#39;ll admit freely that I\u0026#39;m a mod addict and basically want the visuals, extra planets (maybe even RSS), and a whole slew of parts and utilities to make things interesting, but that always leads to my client running close to the edge of memory limits and forcing restarts at least every hour or two. Have there been any improvements to memory handling from 1.0 onward to help mitigate this problem?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythic_fci","CreatedById":58577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T04:17:23Z","Content":"\nI run a similar amount of mods, and I haven\u0026#39;t had any crashes since 1.0.
