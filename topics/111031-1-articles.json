Basically, it\u0027s starting from normal, real-lifey rockets, and then moving into the more Sci-fi stuff, and ending by using a GN Drive to simulate all of these far-future spaceships that can fly in atmosphere almost the same as in space. And yet I want to have some sorta challenge to all of it.\n\nSo, this here is my current list of mods outside of quality of life.\n\nB9 Aerospace (Only the colossal HX parts)\n\nBDArmory\n\nCivilianManagement\n\nExtraplanetaryLaunchpads\n\nGlowStrips\n\nKAS/KIS\n\nKerbalFoundries\n\nGN Drive\n\nLack Luster Labs \u002B Extra\n\nMechJeb2\n\nScanSat\n\nUSI Warp Drive \u002B USI Life Support\n\nInterstellar Extended\n\nIs there anything more I could add, for the full experience? Or do you have any suggestions that would work with it?"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T20:03:51Z","Content":"RSS/SKY/some other config to make the planets larger?\n\nI know I\u0027ve been wanting to try and make a RSS save with futuristic engines to do an Earth-Mars-Earth single stage (huge) ship."},{"CreatedByName":"DestinyPlayer","CreatedById":143980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T20:20:11Z","Content":"Yeah, that\u0027s a nice idea. I think that there should be enough RAM/Processing power to cram in some scale-up stuff. Are there any mods out there that allow you to configure just how much scaling up is there going to be?"},{"CreatedByName":"Minwaabi","CreatedById":91050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T23:29:27Z","Content":"What about MKS? It might qualify for Hard Sci Fi, but its still Sci Fi for our current tech/experience level. \n\nAlso, I\u0027m not sure how SCANSat is SciFi, but maybe I haven\u0027t gotten that far in my tech tree."},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T23:42:32Z","Content":"You could use a proper tech tree, there are many floating around on the forums and all of them are much better than the stock one.\n\nFor example my version (SETIctt) starts with probes, link is in my signature."}]}
