It is typically (not always) 100-300 days after escaping Kerbin (if you use low energy transfers). When you execute that maneuver you set a new one about 100 days before entering Jool\u0027s SOI. Wait until you are near that point. Then you focus to Jool and adjust orbit so that periapsis point is on Pol\u0027s orbit. If your midcourse correction was correct it should not take more than 20 m/s. Wait until ship enters into Jool\u0027s SOI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck periapsis and adjust if needed. Put maneuver to periapsis and adjust retrograde and normal velocities so that you have eccentric elliptical orbit somewhat larger than Pol\u0027s orbit on Pol\u0027s plane and periapsis at or very little inside Pol\u0027s orbit. Then put another node with zero dv on that orbit couple of days after periapsis. Map view should show target and your positions at closest encounter now. Use the first node and adjust orbit larger (decrease retrograde and keep inclination) so that you get encounter or near passing near periapsis. Wait and execute burn. Second node was because sometimes map view can not predict close encounters without it and you can now remove it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter burn plan new midcourse correction which gives encounter with Pol, if burn was inaccurate. Pol\u0027s SOI is small and large burns are typically not very accurate. And few days before entering Pol\u0027s SOI adjust periapsis where you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are not the most dv saving instructions but this is basic level which must be understood and learned to execute before more advanced gravity assists, distant plane change maneuvers or timing arrival so that you encounter moon at optimal position to brake. I recommend mods (I use MechJeb, Alarm Clock and Transfer Window Planner) because the stock map view is not very good and certainly not intended to this kind of accurate maneuvering. Squad\u0027s philosophy is moar boosters and harsh eyeballing and less nerdy stuff. I do not expect that it will change in any version. Fortunately the game is moddable to be fun for engineers too. But if you are purist it is possible in stock too.

designed just to get to Mun.\u00A0 And it works pretty well for that,\u00A0but it has major inadequacies when the node and the destination are separated by interplanetary distances.\u00A0 Despite much complaining from the community, the system has never been revised to address this.\u00A0 But this horse is far from dead.\u00A0 With Squad updating the UI, now is the time to register your opinions on the failings of the existing system.\u00A0 So sound off loud and proud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, the\u00A0biggest problems with the maneuver node\u00A0system are\u00A0as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ENode Collapse\u003C/u\u003E:\u00A0 Any time you change camera\u00A0focus (say from ship to planet)\u00A0or click on anything other than the node (such as a Pe marker), the node handles collapse\u00A0 And at even the distance from Minmus to Kerbin, it\u0027s often hard to get the node to open up again without major camera moves, especially if you have other ships already in orbit near the node.\u00A0 It\u0027s also quite possible to accidentally delete the node when trying to reopen it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EInaccessible Node Handles\u003C/u\u003E:\u00A0 The node handles are 3D things so Z is a factor.\u00A0 Often times at interplanetary distances, when you\u0027re fine-tuning your Pe at the destination, you can\u0027t reach the retrograge (or some other) node handle due to other handles being \u0022stacked\u0022 on top of it.\u00A0 This is PARTIALLY ammeliorated by the (relatively new) ability to use the mouse wheel in reverse on the opposite handle but even that is difficult when the node\u0027s back at Kerbin and you\u0027re eyeballing Jool or something from short range.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ENon-Linear Mouse Wheel Inputs\u003C/u\u003E:\u00A0 The amount of change in the burn you get from moving the mouse wheel is dependent on the speed at which the mouse wheel turns.\u00A0 This means you have to be VERY, VERY careful to move the wheel only 1 detent per second or so, otherwise you WAY overshoot the small change you wanted and then you have to waste a lot of time hunting for where you were before.\u00A0 The mouse wheel should give a fixed dV change per detent regardless of wheel rotation speed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a fix, I recommend making a pop-up window for each node that you can drag anywhere in the map view.\u00A0 This way, the node never collapses until you close its pop-up.\u00A0 The pop-up would give access to all handles for large-scale pulls/pushes and small-scale mousewheel tweaks, PLUS have text boxes for each component of the burn where you could directly type in new values instead of fiddling with the handles.\u00A0 And you\u0027d also be able to slide the whole node forwards and backwards along your path from the pop-up.\u00A0 That way, you could have full control of a distant node while having the camera focused in close on the planet you\u0027re trying to go to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatched conics also have several problems:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe patched conics projections of your future path completely ignore the effects of passing through atmospheres so setting your Pe for aerobraking is totally a trial-and-error process using much F5/F9.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou are unable to get patched conics to display more than 1 encounter at a time (such as entering Jool\u0027s SOI, then Tylo\u0027s).\u00A0 No, you have to wait until you\u0027re inside Jool\u0027s SOI before you can target Tylo and get the closest approach markers and such.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere are multiple draw modes for patched conics but you can only change between them by editing the settings.cfg file.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou can draw a variable number of patched conics but can\u0027t change the number without editing the settings.cfg file.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThese just require a whole new
