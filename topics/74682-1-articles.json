Here I will describe how I did it using the program GIMP on my macbook. Further down this page of the thread Windows programs are discussed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I duplicated the part here because I also turned an intake fan into an engine, but it\u0027s not necessary to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Find the part you want in the GameData folder. Could be any part you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Duplicate the stock .tga usually named something like \u0022model000\u0022. What I do is rename it to \u0022ForStockName_model000\u0022 in case I ever release the craft I\u0027m working on. If you do want to release your craft with it\u0027s custom colors, create a GameData folder in your zip. Then create the tree all the way down to the part you have changed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameData\u0026gt;squad\u0026gt;Parts\u0026gt;engine\u0026gt;skipper or whatever, then add your tweaked .tga and the renamed stock one into that folder. That way if the person who downloads your craft wants the custom colors, all they have to do is merge the GameData folder with their own. Then they have the custom color and an easy way to change it back. Still include directions in your thread or a README though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) So now you\u0027ve duplicated a backup. Now you can open the .tga with a editing program of your choice. Like I said I use Gimp on my mac, and it works perfect. It has a feature called \u0022colorize\u0022 which tints the whole file without eliminating the part details. Like So.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0nKSInq.png\u0022 alt=\u00220nKSInq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Then save the file and the stock model000 will be a different color. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dfH2vME.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dfH2vME.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIf you just replaced the color of a stock part you\u0027re all set, but if you duplicated a b9 part, and moved it somewhere else in your gamedata, you must open the .cfg of the part and change the \u0022model =\u0022 to wherever you put your new part.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you\u0027re all set, you can change the color of any part you want. Remember you don\u0027t have to restart the game every time you tweak a color.
