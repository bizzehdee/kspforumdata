Why do we need robot-Kerbals anyway?!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood question! Glad ya asked!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a variety of reasons: Perhaps you want more crew, but don\u0027t want to send additional crew command pods (or you don\u0027t want to upset your delicate Life Support balance.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps you\u0027re going places where ordinary Kerbals are too important to go (Eve?), because losing a RoboKerbal doesn\u0027t damage your reputation. [We may even have a crash-dummy like experiment gained from recovering them]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using a DeepFreeze or other Cryo-mod, you can do EVA stuff while your crew of Kerbals hibernate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those of you whom do not revert, these will make for excellent Test Pilots, and Crash Dummies!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of this thread is to introduce into the game a new kind of Kerbal (Robotic), with a new profession (Crew Assist.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are the goals and aspirations for this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntroduce new Kerbal Names into the game. This is done, because each Kerbal Name is (currently) hard wired to their profession. So, with new names we can make them hard wired into the new profession (Crew Assistant.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoboKerbals are semi-disposable crew, that do not use Life Support (other than power), and are to take on simple tasks, or assist real kerbals with more complex ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Crew Assistant Profession is designed to help other Kerbals during EVA activities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Crew Assistant profession will be able to perform some simple tasks of the other professions: repair some damaged things like an engineer (but not all) [And count AS an engineer for KIS/KAS], provide some very basic flight assistance (less than a proper pilot, but still some), and like a scientist they can multiply science discoveries (but not reset experiments.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be a true assistant, they work best with other Kerbals. When helping Engineers the RoboKerbal has some internal KAS storage, which will allow the Engineer to have a self-motive equipment bin (which also can carry heavier things than a regular Kerbal) When helping a scientist - not only will they both increase science yield, but the RoboKerbal can make some experiments repeatable when they would not normally be.
