That is, a mod that would fulfill all these conditions :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The mod adds ridiculously\u00A0high isp engines for interstellar travel. (Several hundred thousand seconds would be great)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Said engines are not FTL warp drives, or teleporters, or wormhole generators, just super efficient newtonian engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Said engines can be used at low thrust during time warp, just\u00A0like some KSPIE engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Said mod isn\u0027t KSPIE (mostly because I\u0027m tired of it always changing and making all your carefully designed ships utterly useless every once in a while, and also because I already have mods for power, comms and all that stuff and I mostly want a late-game, standalone, proper interstellar drive)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions ? If it doesn\u0027t fit all 4 of the criteria, you can still throw it in there and I\u0027ll have a look at it. But basically does anyone know\u00A0if any mod apart from KSPIE satisfies condition number 3 and how hard it would be to make a mod that does ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-20T19:22:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNear Future propulsion has a selection of ion engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
