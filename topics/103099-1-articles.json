Load \u0027em up (1 to toggle the ladders), climb up the ladder and board the seat from the ladder. Once strapped in, stage and start driving. The trailer has no brakes, so slowing down will take some time. It can, and will, roll if you drive it like you stole it. There\u0027s a probe core at the front for Kerbal-free driving. And the trailer has power and a probe core too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/rov1hztjhh7whpd/Artic-HGV-Flatbed.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/rov1hztjhh7whpd/Artic-HGV-Flatbed.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2M9Z23n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222M9Z23n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T03:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECouldn\u0027t you just use the trailers breaks to slow it down? or does it still suffer from bearing separation that way as well?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T13:25:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately not.

So I hadn\u0027t yet figured out the way to make stock bearings work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI revisited the truck idea briefly in August so I tinkered with a bunch of different designs and I found that the simplest one works best for me. No moving parts, just put the peg in the hole sort of thing, and uses the airbrakes to lift the trailer - those things can lift a decent tonnage. It can handle turns up to about 18/19ms and can haul I think it was around 18t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIgnore the ramp, I never did finish that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I am on tenterhooks for the rover wheel update.
