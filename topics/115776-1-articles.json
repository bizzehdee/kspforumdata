I\u0027m also not getting any aero effects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason, even after replacing the Physics.cfg file with the original one (fro the Linux thread and also tried by redownloading it with Steam), my convection factor is being reset to 1.100, instead of 6.000; it only happens after entering my saved game. In the main menu, the convection factor is 6.000. That is what I noticed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have set the Physics.cfg file to read-only after replacing it and the convection factor was still 1.100 instead of 6.000 after entering my save-game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are my files (Physics.cfg, Modulemanager.Physics, some screenshots, settings.cfg): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.4shared.com/get/ORNmZ6Lxce/KSP_files.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.4shared.com/get/ORNmZ6Lxce/KSP_files.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything was fine with aero and heat effects until a few days ago. I also encountered a heating bug, in which a component would suddenly overheat and explode. It was suggested to change conduction to 1 and back to normal and it fixed the bug. I think after that the aero and reentry heat broke. Here is the topic with the bug if it helps: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126664-MAJOR-Heating-Bug?p=2069825\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2069825\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126664-MAJOR-Heating-Bug?p=2069825\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2069825\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: It seems that in the alt\u002BF12 menu, the database used for physics was modulemanager.physics, instead of physics.cfg.
