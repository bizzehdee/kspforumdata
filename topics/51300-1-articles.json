You get nice visualization of spacecraft motion patameters and very handy maneuver node planner mechanism. Mods like MechJeb, Kerbal Engineer, etc also provide you with plenty of flight data and even automate some tasks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really helps people to enter the game and easens learning curve whilst also taking away some challenge and realism. So I thought that it would be nice to have a mod which emulates onboard flight control equipment in a more realisic fashion. It would give some challenge in performing space flight. There is wide spectrum of ways how this idea could be implemented, starting from simply chopping off some functionality from MechJeb and addig some low-tech artwork to it, and finishing by thorough implementation of some real world computer design with all of it\u0027s internal workings and multipage operation instructions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you think of this idea? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you like to have more realistic and more challenging flight controls? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much of realism and challenge do you want? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr should we leave it for hardcore guys who play Orbiter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny feedback is appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lazarus1024","CreatedById":65276,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T13:45:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has some merit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP I think has the perfect balance of realism and challenge already. I don\u0027t want an actual simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be interesting, depending on what future additions KSP has, to have something vaguely like Mechjeb as an option/unlockable part. I could see it with especially probes if SQUAD ever adds remote control and light speed time lag to the game (even at 1/10th scale for the solar system that it is now, Kerbin to Duna is still, what? About a minute time delay?). You can control probes and rovers and stuff directly, but at greater distances that\u0027ll be hard, so you can just program them to do something instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d only really see it IF remote control WITH delays are added. I do kind of hope at least remote control is added for probes down the line. IE you MUST have a working antenna of some sort, with different ones having different ranges. You can relay through satellites if you want to extend range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jsfalconero","CreatedById":89120,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T13:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think there are already a few mods that can give some of the limited instrument data.
