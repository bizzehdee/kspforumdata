So let me introduce my mod : Action Group Manager (AGM).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was looking for an opportunity to develop a mod for KSP and look a little in the engine of the beast. One of my main frustration in KSP is the fact that it\u0027s impossible to modify your action group outside the editor. Forget to put a part in a custom action group while launching for your interplanetary mission ? Docked two vessels not primarily designed to be docked together, and your new composite vessel have all his action groups mixed ? Maybe this mod is for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically the mod is a two tabs window. One is used to look at parts and assign them to new action groups. The other tab is a recap of what a specific action group controls, and eventually remove an action from this action group. The mod is usable but in an early stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent features list :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Add, modify, remove part and actions to any action group at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Parts can be filtered by stage. Only show parts which appear as stagging icon. (Experimental)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Parts can be filtered by categories\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Parts can be filtered with text\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Parts list is updated in real time (update delay can be modified in the settings, default is 1 second). Stagging, docking, Kerbal Attachment System junction, switching vessel (from space center, map, or even near switch) will update the mod accordingly. If you encounter performance issues, real-time update can be turned off, Part refresh will be done with a button in the settings window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* When the window is closed and the real-time update turned off, the performance footprint should be negligible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The current selected part or actions is highlighted in blue in the game (and highlighted in the staging bar if applicable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* In the part panel, if a part is attached to any action group, it will appear in yellow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* In the action group panel, the number on the side of each action group is the number of part attached to this action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Mods friendly (In theory at least, i use KAS, kethane, KWR, VOID).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Window can be hided, dragged (not resized yet). A floating button stay on screen to show the window at any time. The floating button can be moved (drag and drop) and locked in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Window position and preferences are saved when you quit the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImages :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/IVbJ8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
