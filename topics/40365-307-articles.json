I docked my kethane probe to my space station, and it maxxed out it\u0027s solar panels waste heat from the station. Now if I undock the probe, its solar panels are at max waste heat and won\u0027t work! The probe doesn\u0027t have radiators as it didn\u0027t need them for just solar power. \u003Cp\u003EHow do I prevent docked vessels from absorbing all the waste heat?

The ship can be little more than a probe body some RCS and the radiators sandwidched between 2 docking ports and you just leave it on the probe. Those radiators are not all that good in space but they are plenty for keeping a couple of solars cool. That should at least let you get the solars redeployed asumeing they are deployable ones. I think theres still a stock KSP issue where flat panel ones can still trigger the retract shutdown but theres no way to fire them back up later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to how to avoid it in the future... pretty much don\u0027t dock something that depends on solar with no radiators to something with high heat generation like that. Even a single radiator on the probe would have made it so waste heat was not over 95% max when you undocked. probably still would be high but it would cool off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SeventhArchitect","CreatedById":80982,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T21:14:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, as I see it, only VERY SMALL probes could use a Nuclear drive efficiently.

The reactors are in 400x400km orbit and the relays are in 1000x1000km. There is pretty much always at least one station in the line of sight with the ship, so i guess thats why the relays won\u0027t connect? I was hoping to get the power of the entire grid, but i guess it doesnt work that way. Anyway, the recievers constantly say they are at 85% efficency, but the power changes acording to how i orient my craft, wich makes sense i guess. I dont understand tho, why the last time the power just dropped form around 200MW to 1MW instantly, and i couldnt get it back, but it still had the same ammount of connections to satelites. Also, that power drop thing on the transmiters also boggles my mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: i forgot to mention, all this happens in LKO, i never took the test ship over 300km yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-21T13:20:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2014 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by gorkyporky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Korn Sarum","CreatedById":25037,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T12:05:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone been able to get the thermal turbojets to work with HotRockets and Smokescreen?
