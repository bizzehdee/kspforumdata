What it means is that a company is giving you access to their computers/consoles for all the processing power you need for a game. What you get is a video stream from that game. This makes it possible to run any game (supported by that service) on any device that is capable of running the client application. So you can, for example, play Crysis on a mobile phone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only serious cloud gaming company I\u0027ve found in recent years is the OnLive company (which is being rebuilt after some bad CEO decisions). They already have games installed and ready to play on their side, you just have to download their client application, create an account and play any game from their library. Most of those games have 30 minutes of trial period, after which you can purchase access to that game. All saves and data is stored on their servers, so you don\u0027t have to worry about your disk space (very important on smartphones).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQUESTION:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a possibility to develop such a platform for KSP to at least make the game run on a PC of your choice (to which you have access, obviously) and then being able to connect to that computer through the Internet and play in a similar manner? If not, then do you know any companies that provide cloud gaming services capable of running KSP, or companies that just allow to upload your own game? I remember that my friend found a service on which you could run your software, something similar to VPN, but it was slightly different in functionality. I can\u0027t get in touch with that friend, so I really can\u0027t ask him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EREASON FOR ASKING\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP seems to be very needy in terms of computing power. It requires quite a lot of CPU resources and RAM. RAM problems won\u0027t be solved by that right now, as it\u0027s due to bad memory managment and lack of proper x64 support, but it might be a nice foundation for future versions and it would help users with worse computer systems to get all the joy of KSP. For example, my CPU keeps failing after 6 years of exploiting it (no overclocking ever), I get bluescreens due to improper clock interrupts when that CPU is overloaded. So I am basically unable to run lots of mods, cloud gaming would give me, and most likely a lot of other people too, an opportunity to take everything that KSP gives me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think about this concept? Is it possible to move KSP to a cloud gaming setting?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T01:08:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe the KSP \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/eula.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEULA\u003C/a\u003E allows only for installation/use of the software on your own PC, so any service offering remote access to KSP would probably be considered against the terms of the license.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never heard about an official version of KSP conceived to be run on a server, though a number of add-ons allow to take control of KSP running on one machine of yours throught some other networked device.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pe-Ter","CreatedById":132208,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T01:58:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you think that it would be hard to create such a mod?

The thing is, this way of playing wouldn\u0027t be obligatory. You could still play this game in a normal way. While using OnLive I experienced very low lag on my 6Mb(it) connection. Now I am using a 30Mb connection and the lag was even lower (below 50ms). To be honest, it\u0027s not always the bandwidth that causes lag, it\u0027s mostly your location in the world and how close you are to the ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022[color=#3E3E3E\u0022 data-cite=\u0022[color=#3E3E3E\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECaptain Sierra;]\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3E3E3E;\u0022\u003EI think what the OP is going for is this scenario:\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3E3E3E;\u0022\u003EI have a very beefy brand new gaming desktop with a 3.5GHz 8 core processor and a Radeon R9 270 GPU which runs HEAVILY modded KSP Win64 flawlessly.
