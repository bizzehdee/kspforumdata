At infinite speeds, a jet engine (including rockets) gives infinite kinetic energy with the same fuel use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLets forget jets for a moment. Jets have to take in air, and that becomes less and less efficient at high speeds. Lets talk about rockets. In vacuum. Because, in vacuum, a rocket engine really does put out the same amount of thrust at any speed. And consequently, power output of a rocket standing still is zero. Power output of a moving rocket diverges to infinity as speed gets higher. It actually happens way before \u0022infinite\u0022 speeds due to relativistic effects. Rocket engine\u0027s power output is infinite at \u0022mere\u0022 speed of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut lets set aside infinities and relativism. The reason rocket has more power at higher speed is because you don\u0027t just get the chemical energy of the fuel. Fuel is also moving, and so it has kinetic energy. And because of how kinetic energy changes with speed, when you fire the engine, you actually get to use some of that kinetic energy to get more power out of the engine. Conversely, when rocket is standing still, all of the chemical energy just goes into kinetic energy of exhaust, and zero energy goes into moving the rocket. The sweet spot, where power out is exactly chemical power in, minus heat losses,\u00A0is at g*I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E/2, because KE of fuel/oxy = KE of exhaust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets get back to the jet engine. Exactly the same principles apply,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eexcept\u003C/em\u003E, most of the exhaust mass is air sucked in by the engine. We don\u0027t have that kinetic energy to begin with. We must take incoming air, accelerate it to the engine\u0027s speed, and then we get to use part of that kinetic energy to get extra power when it is exhausted. So yeah, jet engine produces more power on output, but all of that energy first has to be put there by the same engine, which comes at the cost of drag. If instead of looking at just the net thrust of the jet engine, you take thrust minus\u00A0drag produced by the engine, suddenly, you don\u0027t see power going to infinity anymore. Just the opposite, due to additional heat losses at high speeds, power of a jet engine increases for a while, peaks, and then starts going down as the speeds get higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore interestingly, different kinds of engines will peak at very different speeds. That\u0027s why you see high bypass turbofans on airliners, low bypass or turbojets on fighters, and ram or scram jets on hypersonic aircraft and missiles. The later don\u0027t have compressors at all, because they are trying to get the air to flow through the engine with as little resistance as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDestroyer111","CreatedById":160216,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-02T09:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222738776\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472766101\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryten\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Kryten said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s like asking why food packaging doesn\u0027t specify that the mass given is the rest mass.
