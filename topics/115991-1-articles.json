You run it and in a given biome it gives you science, but I would like it to display the actual R/hr it\u0027s measuring much like the other gauges give you temperature and such. [http://radiation.fallout.cz/htm/radmeters.htm](http://radiation.fallout.cz/htm/radmeters.htm)\n\nI found this for stock modules. [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Module#ModuleEnviroSensor](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Module#ModuleEnviroSensor)\n\nI wanted to know what it would take to add a new module GIGER to the sensorType and have it display an actual number for the R/hr.\n\nThe **numbers don\u0027t have to be accurate or realistic** and I don\u0027t want to create a radiation generator. I would like to use a combination of the other numbers the stock game generates.\n\nHigh TEMP and GRAV would indicate higher levels of radiation, while high PRES would lower radiation. This would give higher levels close to large and hot gravitational bodies while being in an atmosphere would lower it considerably.\n\n![R1YOzs6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/R1YOzs6.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"simon56modder","CreatedById":119640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T22:59:26Z","Content":"Maybe having a KSPField ?\n\nThe formula should be something like :\n\ndouble rad = 1 \\* (this.vessel.temperature / 2) \\* this.vessel.geeForce / this.vessel.atmDensity / 2;"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T04:40:04Z","Content":"It would be much easier to write a small custom module for this than to copy the stock module entirely and then add the functionality (you can\u0027t add things the code doesn\u0027t support, so to make the sensor module handle it you\u0027d have to make a new sensor module that copies stock but handles this too).\n\nAlso, you\u0027d have to figure out how to calculate the radiation level."}]}
