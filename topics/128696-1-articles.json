It seems no matter what I do, my pitch controls are inverted from what they should be. I have two sets of elevons on the basic swept wing. Both the inner and outer elevons are set to control pitch, and the outers are also set to control roll. The vehicle rolls in the expected direction, but pitch is inverted. I\u0027ve tried changing the \u0027deployed\u0027 and \u0027inverted\u0027 settings in the right click menu, but that just changes which way they go in flap mode, not control. I\u0027ve also tried using the rotation widget to rotate the elevons by 180 degrees thinking they were on upside down or something, but that also didn\u0027t change anything. I\u0027ve also double-checked that my WASD controls are mapped correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?

Sgt_Flyer - I made sure the center of lift was pointing upward, and the elevons are behind the center of mass. Also, there is no probe core, just the Mk-I cockpit... kind of hard to put that on upside down. I managed to make a better looking and performing plane using the basic wing connectors instead of the swept wings, so I guess I\u0027m happy. That bug is really weird though...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
