So now it\u0027s at 7 or 8 launches per year. Once every six weeks and less than one-tenth the wear on the station for docking. I\u0027m sure we could do a back-and-forth about how much work the crew does moving supplies, but also consider you\u0027re exposing them to one-tenth the docking risks.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomebody already thought of this. With the Aquarius\u0027 space tug, which was part of the (very reasonable) $700 million development proposal, you could have actually delivered LARGER cargo packets than 13 tons, at reduced frequency, for reduced wear and docking risks to the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Claw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Claw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, if the system relies on using the launch pad every three days, what happens if one of those failures wipes out the pad? Sure, that\u0027s always a risk with any launch platform. So you\u0027d need a backup. But now we also have to consider the frequency of the launches as well as the failure rates. That\u0027s more risk to the pad, not to mention the resulting cleanup and rebuild. Extra launch pads and infrastructure aren\u0027t free.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you might need to review the description of Aquarius again. It doesn\u0027t launch from a launchpad- it makes use of sea-based launches (and the consumables would be scheduled to launch \u0022ahead of need\u0022 to the LEO depot- so a handful of launch failures in a row wouldn\u0027t deprive the ISS of needed consumables). The ocean is the Aquarius\u0027 launchpad, much like the Sea Dragon. Now how are you going to break THAT launchpad? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Claw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Claw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI suppose that all sounds like I\u0027m arguing against cheap vehicles. I don\u0027t mean to sound overly negative about them because personally I think we should be willing to back down from \u0022top of the line, state of the art\u0022 from time to time. That philosophy itself becomes crippling. Hopefully I was just bringing forward some other things to think about. Efficiency isn\u0027t always about \u0022the cheapest thing,\u0022 but also about the stuff that surrounds it. The bits I mention above are just a few of those things.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the potential issues for an Aquarius-style Big Dumb Booster you brought up are valid- but were already addressed, and satisfactorily resolved, years before I ever created this thread.
