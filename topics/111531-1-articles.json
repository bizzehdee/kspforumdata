In other words, they\u0027re not procedurally (or however) generated to actually connect two tanks, making them completely useless (except for a tiny slowdown in framerate, I guess).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve long since abandoned trying to fix this issue. I haven\u0027t seen any mention of it on the forums (it doesn\u0027t help that the words \u0022fuel\u0022 and \u0022duct\u0022 are very, very common). There doesn\u0027t seem to be any coherent pattern--sometimes, fuel ducts will actually be modeled correctly, sometimes after loading a space craft from save, sometimes from the VAB, sometimes not. It seems more common an error in larger spacecraft, but I\u0027ve seen it happen to small ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m left wondering is--how difficult would it be to use Module Manager to take the particular function from fuel ducts (for me, a buggy, irritating part to deal with) and simply apply it to any radial decoupler (rather than all decouplers, as that could wreak havoc on staging). Ideally, the option would exist to turn it off as desired in the VAB, but all in all, even \u0022universally on\u0022 seems less a pain to deal with than fuel ducts that don\u0027t model correctly 3/4 or more of the time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be appreciated--hopefully this is the right place to mention this (I considered putting it under \u0027Suggestions\u0027, but it seems like this would alter the vanilla game model enough to be reserved as a mod).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merill","CreatedById":136069,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T11:59:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can try with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76499-1-0-CrossFeedEnabler-v3-3-May-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECrossFeedEnabler\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synthesis","CreatedById":26557,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T05:10:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Merill\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Merill\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can try with\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76499-1-0-CrossFeedEnabler-v3-3-May-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECrossFeedEnabler\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow, thank you!
