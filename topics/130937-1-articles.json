Of course joint reinforcements help, but I can get a wobbly ship to orbit while MechJeb blows it up. I think it could do with some more damping, or some kind of detection of wobble. It looks like it gets into dynamic instability, overcorrecting for position deviations and making the oscillations larger. When I\u0027m flying manually, and the ship is wobbling left-right, I actually give a right input when the ship is pointing to the right (and needs to go to the left) because I know it will go to the left by itself and I just want it to slow that motion down. MechJeb will give an input to the left and increase the amplitude of the oscillation. But I know this is not an easy thing to program, so I can\u0027t really be too harsh on MechJeb for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Where is that precision rate setting? I don\u0027t remember setting a precision rate anywhere, I\u0027ve just now tried to look for it but I can\u0027t find it in any of the windows. In any case, I don\u0027t see any need to cycle between full throttle and idle. When I want to fine-tune the apoapsis, I cut the throttle just before, and then add a tiny little bit of thrust to add the last few meters. I actually get better precision than MechJeb (on a simple rocket that MechJeb doesn\u0027t blow up).\u00A0Why would you ever go back to idle, back to full, back to idle, back to full again, etcetera in rapid succession? I\u0027m not exagerrating, the large rocket blew up because of longitudinal compressions (not bending but squeezing)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Indeed, once I figured that out it worked correctly. Although you need to use some common sense: today I asked it to execute a maneuver to escape\u00A0from Kerbin orbit with nuclear engines, it started 10 minutes before the maneuver. pointed the nose towards kerbin (since it was about 90 degrees before the node), entered the atmosphere and burned up. I kind of guessed it was going to do that and sure enough, it did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. I\u0027ll give that a try, thanks. Inserting to a safe speed first, then switching on the precision landing part for the last bit only, sounds like it may work rather well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. I see it regularly after take-off. A bit of blue orbit comes off of Kerbin, then there\u0027s a gap, then the top part of the orbit curving back down, then another gap exactly symmetrical to the first, then the last bit of orbit down to the surface. I don\u0027t think I ever saw it before installing MechJeb. Doesn\u0027t really bother me, it\u0027s just strange.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut once again, it really is an extremely useful tool as long as you remember that\u0027s what it is. It helps you a lot, but you still need to be a pilot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unlucky","CreatedById":159388,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-27T12:43:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if you didn\u0027t install Mechanical Jebediah correctly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this happens to me, i extract the folder again to be sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(NOTE: \u0022MechJeb\u0022 is actually called \u0022Mechanical Jebediah\u0022)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snowstorm","CreatedById":154376,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T17:28:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know why people keep responding to this....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s like a month old! \u00A0(Also the problem was solved)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
