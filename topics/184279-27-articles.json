Once a player has returned from the Mun and Minmus the rest of the kerbol system should open up. It may take a little restructuring in Mission Control but these missions really need to be up front and persist so players get that they are the primary goals of the game and have the ability to get advances and weigh the rewards.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other thing I\u0027d love to see as a way of solving the conundrum of time-based rewards\u00A0(something thats even more important now that we have duration based experiments,) would be World First Bonuses. If you land on the Mun or Duna before X date you get a bonus reward in funds and reputation. Its just a gentle, scalable incentive process that would cause players to question time warping to get rewards, and could make the inclusion of other time-based mechanics like construction and research time more meaningful than just another thing to warp through.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd for LS I personally prefer \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E. I feel like if you\u0027re gonna go for life support we should really make it something special,\u00A0with separate parts for recycling and greenhouses and a habitation mechanic to give meaning to station and base hab parts. Just like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E it should start gently, so you barely have to think about it going to Minmus or the Mun. Its later when you start going interplanetary and builidng up long term bases and stations when a little more noodling is required. Add a few fancy VASIMR engines and some reactors and you\u0027ve got a pretty solid DLC.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you\u0027re suggesting is pretty much what I said about career mode.
