To travel to the other space-potatoes. Until now this seems to have been an impossibility. But recent advances have brought this into a new frontier. Maybe even the final one, but we can\u0027t say that or we\u0027ll be sued by Kerbalmount Pictures.

But one thing is for sure. Whether it will use chemical or atomic propulsion, it will be a rocket that will break the space frontier. In researching the history of the rocket, we found that the rocket isn\u0027t such a new idea after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast year, at the battle of Ko-fung-oof, where two battling eachother over how they could get the vanilla cotton candy in the sky, an anonymous Kerbal in a paper-mache suit of armour connected a lot of gunpowder cartridges to go upwards.

This development was then put into consideration by the STEADLER Engineering corp, where they invented the first rocket powered by Propelium-Peroxium, a liquid. It may be used in future to control spaceships using a sort of Re-Action Control System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was at this point when we began to see feeble experimentation among the rocket community.
