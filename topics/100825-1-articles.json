I\u0027m Walt Kerman. Everywhere we look, we see the impact *science!* has upon our daily lives. Discoveries that were miracles a few short days ago are commonplace now. Many of the impossibilities of now, will become impossibilities that we tried to make possible tomorrow.\n\n![portrait-of-the-milky-way-galaxy-jon-lomberg.jpg](http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/portrait-of-the-milky-way-galaxy-jon-lomberg.jpg)\n\nOne of Kerbal\u0027s newest dreams is the conquest of the heavens. To travel to the other space-potatoes. Until now this seems to have been an impossibility. But recent advances have brought this into a new frontier. Maybe even the final one, but we can\u0027t say that or we\u0027ll be sued by Kerbalmount Pictures. The frontier of interplanetary space.\n\nHere is Mortimer Kerman, director of this picture.\n\n![med_1411532189_image.jpg](http://ell.akamai.coub.com/get/b5/p/coub/simple/cw_timeline_pic/c3d95432e22/ba04b76036b5a2d6c2a21/med_1411532189_image.jpg)\n\n(No not the image, I mean the *motion* picture.)\n\nThere has been many concepts of what a spaceship to the planets will look like. But one thing is for sure. Whether it will use chemical or atomic propulsion, it will be a rocket that will break the space frontier. In researching the history of the rocket, we found that the rocket isn\u0027t such a new idea after all.\n\nLast year, at the battle of Ko-fung-oof, where two battling eachother over how they could get the vanilla cotton candy in the sky, an anonymous Kerbal in a paper-mache suit of armour connected a lot of gunpowder cartridges to go upwards. Needless to say, he did not survive.\n\n![maxresdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TpJNbjoGvzs/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\nThe astrophysicist Sir Ike Kilonewton then described this peculiar action of the cylindrical gunpowder charges, stating that, among other physical laws, For Every Action Force, there is an Equal but opposite Re-Action Force. This development was then put into consideration by the STEADLER Engineering corp, where they invented the first rocket powered by Propelium-Peroxium, a liquid. It may be used in future to control spaceships using a sort of Re-Action Control System.\n\nIt was at this point when we began to see feeble experimentation among the rocket community. There were rocket planes, rocket trains, and even rocket cars.\n\nRocket powered automobiles were fast, but they presented quite a flight problem.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

It is comprised of a control section, a fuel section, and a propulsion section.\u0022, Bob\n\n\u0022How exactly does the propulsion work?\u0022, an artist.\n\n\u0022We have the fuel flow through the main engine to cool it down so as not to let it melt into vaporized iron, and then we flow it into the motor. It then produces a continuous explosion through a column of incandescent plasma.\u0022, Bob.\n\n\u0022You mean a miasma of incandesent plasma, right?\u0022, another artist.\n\n\u0022Yes. And onto this next topic. Just last week, space history was made, when the payload of the V-2 was replaced with a small gunpowder charge. The object became the first man-made object to reach space. it was a two-step, or two stage rocket.\u0022, Bob.\n\n\u0022Now is it possible to build a three-stage rocket?\u0022, another artist.\n\n\u0022Yes as a matter of fact this is the next step.\u0022, Bob.\n\nHere is the concept of the Instrument Carrying Rocket, a three stage vehicle. Here is the footage of the launch taking place right now.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
