It\u0027s definitely something that oughta be put into any revised tutorial system, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to start off in a new career mode game, you only have access to an extremely limited set of parts. You can unlock more by earning science and going into the new R\u0026amp;D building to examine the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first, your only sources of science are crew reports and EVA reports. Crew reports you get by clicking on your hatch and selecting the option; EVA reports requires a kerbal out of the capsule. You can also pick up surface samples. So far as I know you can collect multiple crew and EVA reports per mission. Each different location you can get them from will grant science - repeating the same locations over, less science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin itself has multiple types of locations you can get different results from - mountains, poles, shore side, etc. Which is good, because with the initial parts you may only manage suborbital hops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you go up the tech tree, you\u0027ll unlock new science parts like the mystery goo and materials science bay, which you can also do experiments with in all sorts of different locations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting your science back to Kerbin is important. Two options here - transmitting, via antennae, and landing the experiments back on the surface. Transmitting is less valuable - you typically only get a fraction of the science back, but it\u0027s also easier. Also recall that transmitting takes hefty amounts of power! But if you manage to get your craft back to Kerbin, you can recover it and get full science value back via the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-17T09:34:57Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2013 09:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Lheim\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T09:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd now there is a tutorial.
