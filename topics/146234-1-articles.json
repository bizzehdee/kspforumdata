Either way it\u0027s unlikely to work, there have been rather large and comprehensive background changes to the workings of ksp, a lot of parts were changed, every bit of plugin code had to be changed.\u00A0 And if you are looking for support for 1.0.5 it could be hard to find, almost every mod has now updated to 1.1.3 as it\u0027s the sensible thing to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iPat","CreatedById":152771,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-21T07:10:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sorry if that was not clear.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI meant to state that I had a game in progress in 1.0.5, that was fine one day.

Have you updated any of the mods in that save? if so that\u0027s a problem.\u00A0 AS mods for the current versions are not compatible with 1.0.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s not that, grab a copy of the log for that 1.0.5 install and zip it up and I\u0027ll take a look. Might not be anything that can be fixed, but it may just be something silly, are you 100% sure that you didn\u0027t change anything in that install?
