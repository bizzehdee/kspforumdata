That\u0027s going to be the easiest and it\u0027s 400\u002B per trip, even without many advanced science instruments - surface sample and material bay are the biggest contributors, where one is just upgrading a building and the other you should already have."},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T20:20:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d agree with General Contstruction, if for no other reason than that most of the early (pre-90) techs are generally useful.

We choose to go to the Mun in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are fun , because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too\u0022*  ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI want my Kerbal land on Mun using MOR (Munar Orbit Randomizes) \n\nNow i also consider what to upgrade laucnh tower is already upgraded, so what chose VAB, Mission Control, Tracking Station, Kerbonauts training facility or administration?"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T21:02:32Z","Content":"Okay then...Munar landing. That being the case, the next three techs I\u0027d go for (after General Construction; get that first) would be Electrics, Landing and Fuel Systems (in that order). Electrics gives you batteries, rudimentary solar panels and lights (which come in handy when you want to land on the Mun for judging how far it is to the deck). The OKTO probe is also a very nice \u0022not a lousy Stayputnik\u0022 core if you want to do unmanned things. Landing will give you big chutes and lander legs - the second of which is nice to have - and then Fuel Systems will get you fuel ducts and some bigger tanks; the fuel ducts make asparagus and onion staging possibilities, which you may or may not prefer depending on how much cash you\u0027ve managed to generate so far.\n\nBuilding-wise, I\u0027d say getting the Tracking Station to Level 2 is probably your first priority, followed by Astronaut facility to level 2; the first upgrade gives you patched conics and maneuver nodes, while the second gives your Kerbals the ability to make EVAs and plant flags - both of which can produce money and/or science."}]}
