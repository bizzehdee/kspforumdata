I mean, absolutely anything will eventually evaporate in absolute vacuum, technically even the solids, but conventional liquids evaporate a lot faster because you have to be pretty close to binding energy for things to behave as liquids in the first place. So if you want a fluid to stay fluid something has to prevent particles from leaving the mix, and ionic liquids achieve that by having ions instead of molecules in the mix. A single ion can\u0027t break off and leave, because that results in an overall charge strong enough to pull that ion back. And pair of ions getting enough energy to leave together is far, far less likely, resulting in very low vapor pressures and slowest evaporation in vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypical use of ionic liquids is lubrication in vacuum pumps, so that should give you some idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T21:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know for sure that sodium-potassium alloy is liquid in space (at least over reasonable timescales-it\u0027ll boil away, but over thousands of years)-the soviets used it as coolant in some space-based nuclear reactors, and to this day there\u0027s droplets of it whizzing around in LEO after a couple developed leaks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T22:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Holo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Holo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrom what I recall, Earth had an atmosphere made mainly of Hydrogen during its early formation.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat hydrogen was not in vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Holo","CreatedById":39606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T15:58:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat hydrogen was not in vacuum.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor example when lava covered the early Earth, above that lava ocean was there the vacuum of space or some kind of rock vapour atmosphere?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was answering this question.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
