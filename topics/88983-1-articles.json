I have taken the liberty of doing a bit of a diagram (don\u0027t laugh) to illustrate the concept I have in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i113.photobucket.com/albums/n216/TheREALGabe/Moddiagram.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Moddiagram.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe red arrows represent the thrust, the black arrows represent attachments. There would be a variety of straight and curved pipes, and maybe a long bay and a short one, to accommodate different engine sizes. In my mind the nozzles are flat and wide, but I guess there could be a few varieties too, to suit different aesthetics etc., or maybe the different types could even have varying performance aspects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s my idea.

I used radial mounted engines from the Bobcat HOME pack mounted on Infernal Robotics rotatrons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI learned that you want to have a lot of pitch torque available, but roll and yaw don\u0027t really matter much.
