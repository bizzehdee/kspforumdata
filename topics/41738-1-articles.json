This causes rather big problems with center of mass as the fuel gets used up. When i first started my plane would be leveled and then 10 minutes into the flight the nose would not stand down. Well i\u0027ve figured out the routing to prevent that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my example i will use my plane. The B2. The plane has 1 jet engine and 2 Aerospike engines. The Jet engine is to be used on the planet and the aerospike engines are to be used in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets get started. In my plane i have a fuel tank in the front, a large fuel tank in the middle and at last a fuel tank in the rear. Now this is important as the center tanks cannot store the oxidizer from the outside tanks however they can take the liquid fuel part from them. The aerospike engines cannot run without oxidizer. Actually worse. Once you run out of oxidizer they will take the remaining fuel and use it up in seconds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways without further delay i will explain. You want a fuel line from the front one to the center tank and another fuel line from the rear tank to the center one. This is the yellow lines. This will keep the fuel in the center and use it up from the ends. Now with just those fuel lines it will run however once you use up the rear tank it will stop therefore you need a fuel line from the center fuel tank to the engine. This is the blue arrow. At last the green fuel lines. You want those as a backup. Yes you want both a fuel line in each direction, let me explain. Say you\u0027re on the planet using your jet engine. The bottom green lines will feed the fuel to the center tank. Anyways after 20 minutes you\u0027re in space and you shut down the jet engine. At this point your outside tanks will be near empty. If you turn on your Aerospike engines they cannot run without liquid fuel and will use up any oxidizer you have in seconds. This is where the upper set of green lines comes in to play. It will take the necessary fuel it needs from the center tank and supply it to the aerospike engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR? Just do your fuel lines like they are in the picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s205.photobucket.com/user/Triple88A/media/Video%20Games/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot0_zps211c51a7.gif.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i205.photobucket.com/albums/bb210/Triple88A/Video%20Games/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot0_zps211c51a7.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0_zps211c51a7.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this explains it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETripzter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-09T06:32:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2013 06:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tripzter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded further info.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exothermos","CreatedById":41827,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T02:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm so essentially you can think of it as the center most fuel tank is the bottom, and you set it up so that fuel flows down hill, and your jets pull from that tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripzter","CreatedById":75335,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T18:18:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFuel flows to the center so your center of gravity stays pretty much the same so your ship remains the same as fuel gets used up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T20:28:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose fuel lines going in both directions don\u0027t cause problems for you?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripzter","CreatedById":75335,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T03:11:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dkmdlb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dkmdlb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThose fuel lines going in both directions don\u0027t cause problems for you?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, just the opposite, they solve problems. When you\u0027re using the jet engine liquid fuel goes from those tanks to the center tank. So eventually they will empty from the liquid fuel. Say you\u0027re ready to switch to the rocket engines, if you do not have the 2nd line the rocket engines will flush the oxidizer in seconds and then you\u0027re screwed. Sure you can transfer fuel and you\u0027ll be ok but thats an extra step you HAVE to remember to do. Having the opposite fuel line will feed the rocket engines the necessary fuel they need so you dont need to do a fuel transfer or anything like that. The rocket engines will just take the necessary liquid fuel from the center tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-22T03:14:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2013 03:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tripzter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
