But... there are three new multi-axis solar panels that I finished up today (upper-right of the image, small, medium, and large):\n\n![Y8p5Ng0.png](http://i.imgur.com/Y8p5Ng0.png)\n\nFolded view:\n\n![m6jVa2C.png](http://i.imgur.com/m6jVa2C.png)\n\nI think that will be it for the rigid/folding solar panels for now.  All use the same mesh/geometry for the mount, so are easily compatible for the panel-switching setup on the DOS parts (or other parts in the future... modular probe core or service module?).  May well make up a few more variants in the future if I find they are needed (and potentially make replacements for the SC-A and SC-C solar panels).  Will also be making an entire lineup of blanket/cloth style solar panels as well, though those are probably a few weeks out from being started.\n\nOther updates for the next upcoming patch will include textures for the COS parts and HUB-COS (shown earlier in the week).  Still working on figuring out the hand-rails situation on those... may or may not be finished for the next release.\n\nSo.. basically... the next release is solar panels.  Lots and lots of solar panels."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-08T21:33:22Z","Content":"I love the multi axis panel!

This points to a config error that needs to be corrected;  make sure there is a valid resource specified.  RocketParts *should* be valid as long as you have CRP installed (comes with the SSTU download), so I\u0027m not really sure what is going on there.  Maybe try clearing the module-manager cache and re-starting... has cleaned up many a strange error for me before.\n\nThe second null-ref, regarding \u0027updateCrewCapacity\u0027 -- is a bug in the code.  Noted and fixed, will be available with this weekends update.
