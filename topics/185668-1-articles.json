I\u0027d ballpark the one I made with a medium motor and three small blades at 10kN.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo here are some thoughts about propellers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe propellers will products a constant max torque and consume a constant maximum amount of power. It\u0027s not very much power so I won\u0027t focus at all on how to make more efficient propellers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is no way to make more thrust by consuming more power from a given motor. It\u0027s as if they\u0027re driven by a constant current supply (real motors can consume more power until they overheat)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thrust generated is maximized when the prop is spinning at it\u0027s maximum RPM, all other things being equal. Max RPM is limited in two ways:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Spinning too fast may destroy blades because they stretch away from the hub and either hit the ground, or break off. The craft does not self-collide though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. There is a point where the counter rotational drag on the blades exceeds the torque coming from the motor and RPM decelerates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt rest, for a given pitch (discussed below) the counter rotational drag on the\u00A0blades is\u00A0proportional to the thrust they\u0027re giving you. So you want to add more of it until it\u0027s almost equal to the torque your motor can apply. You\u0027ll know you\u0027ve succeeded at this if your propeller takes a very long time to spin up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe counter rotational drag on the blades will increase with the total amount of wing area of the blades, the distance from the center hub of that wing area, the air pressure, and the angle of attack of the blades, and the speed of the blades through the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus if you have enough wing that counter rotating drag is nearly equal to torque, you\u0027ll find max RPM limited not by the slider, but by the drag of the blades themselves. As the blades spin faster, this drag\u00A0increases until it exceeds torque and your blades slow back down. This is what you want your RPM limited by for maximum performance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s another irritating limit on max speed - the fact that the blades will stretch away from the hub and either hit the ground or break off. You can limit this by using lighter blades, making blades out of a s few parts as possible, and keeping blade COMs close to the hub\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAmount of wing area can be increased with number of blades or\u00A0bigger blades. consider these interchangeable. You can see that there is a tricky design trade off between having a lot of blade wing area far from the hub, and minimizing stretch. Especially since it\u0027s not just stretch you\u0027re probably concerned about but the effective diameter of your prop so it doesn\u0027t hit the ground.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe angle of attack of the blades is\u00A0very important. At a stop, blades at a high angle, say 45\u00B0, would create the most force (and thus require less blade area to do the same job) but as your craft speeds up, the effective angle of attack of the blades decreases. Imagine them screwing into the air. at some point, your blades are spiraling through the air at exactly the angle they\u0027re mounted at and applying no force (but there is virtually no counter rotating drag either) Then, if you were to go faster than that, say by diving or turning on a rocket engine. They\u0027d actually start causing drag on your craft, even when the motor is spinning at max speed. Worse, the air spins up the propeller faster than it\u0027s designed to go, and they usually destroy themselves past 500 RPM.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nInstead of measuring the pitch of the blades in degrees, it\u0027s helpful to measure it in the distance in meters that the blade would screw through in one revolution, a blade mounted at 20\u00B0, with it\u0027s center (the place where KSP applies all forces) 1m from the hub, would travel a distance of 2\u03C0 meters, up at a 20\u00B0 slant. The forward travel\u00A0is then tan(20\u00B0)*2\u03C0 = 2.29m. So if it spins at 360\u00A0RPM, (six\u00A0revs per second) then it wants to screw through 2.29*6= 13.74 meters of air per second. if the craft moves forward at 13\u00A0m/s, it produces a little bit of thrust until the craft moves forward at 13.74\u00A0m/s and\u00A0it produces no thrust. If we\u00A0reached this speed and want more trust we have to either spin the prop faster, slow the craft down (booo) or change\u00A0the pitch. My formula says increase it it but this is the part I don\u0027t quite understand. What would a pitch of 89\u00B0 give us? at 360rpm the blades would want to screw through 2159\u00A0meters of air, which is a respectable flying speed, but somehow I know it\u0027s not going to work. they\u0027re practically paddleboards at that angle and most of the force they make would be counter rotational drag, which would limit the max RPM we can reach, probably nowhere near 360.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis craft airspeed at which the blade\u0027s angle of attack becomes 0, and we can\u0027t increase the RPM any more will end up being our cruising speed. The counter rotating drag on the blades at this speed should be zero, since they\u0027re just cutting through the air without doing anything. Since blades seem to function this way, it would seem they\u0027re much better suited to hovering than to winged flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ideal pitch depends on many factors that change during flight so aim to use the movsble fins as your prop parts. How can a control input be mapped to the blades independent of their orientation on the craft? airbrake function?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to increase the number of blades until the counter rotating drag produced is enough that it begins to limit my max RPM, not the slider. At craft speeds close enough to my pitch-determined maximum, ultimately the slider will limit my max RPM\u00A0no matter what, and I want that speed to be high, which means I want the pitch to be close to 90, which would mean high counter rotating drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat exactly is the drawback to having a pitch close to 90 anyways?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-20T15:23:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2019 03:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by nhnifong\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-20T15:25:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Breaking Ground Discussion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngrybobH","CreatedById":165814,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-20T19:09:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223622302\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185668\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221561044177\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212196\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nhnifong\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, nhnifong said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow can a control input be mapped to the blades independent of their orientation on the craft? airbrake function?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nput a servo motor on the rotor first then attach your blades. map the target angle to the translate up/dn or l/r or f/b. set your min and max desired angle and translate speed.

Think about a plane flying near level. It produces enough lift to stay flying when at the right speed. Take that plane to 45 degrees nose up at the same speed. You will climb but also lose speed. If you where to go to 89 degrees(instantaneously) you would produce nearly all drag with your wings and nearly no lift. You don\u0027t need to worry too much about this in KSP because the rotor will stall long before you get to 45 degrees. Most of my helicopter designs rarely get to 7.5 degrees blade pitch before the G11 rotor runs out of torque. Granted a helicopter main rotor is much bigger than an airplane prop but I was also having similar problems with the tail rotor with ~20 degrees pitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-08T14:48:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are some lessons I\u0027ve learned from prop design -\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nA prop where the blades are connected directly to the spinning collider of the motor, and are one part only is the lest likely to self destruct, though it still won\u0027t hold up under 2x time warp.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMultipart blades stretch too much at max RPM, it doesn\u0027t matter what kind of parts they are, cubic strut, servo, fin, etc. Stick to a single part for the blades.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe part which makes the best blade for me is the basic fin because\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s light and therefore doesn\u0027t stretch out as far\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nhas the best lift/mass ratio of any lifting part\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nis small to fit in more fairings.
