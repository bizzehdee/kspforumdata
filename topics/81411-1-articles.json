A (real, non-physician, PhD) doctor is someone that\u0027s had enough training at an academic discipline that they\u0027re qualified not just to do that thing (Master) but also to teach it to others (Doctor).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround the time of the Renaissance, there was competition between a few different factions in England and western Europe about who were the \u0022real\u0022 healers. Physicians studied the theory of medicine, whereas the College of Barber-Surgeons (the \u0022barber\u0022 thing was because in Medieval times, the local barber was the one guy who could be relied on to have a good sharp razor) had a more practical and empirical approach. Apothecaries were kind of in between the physicians and the surgeons. Village herbalists and midwives actually did the bulk of the hands-on care for most of the population, but they were generally ignored by the authorities on account of being mostly female peasants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysicians went to University where they read (wildly inaccurate and lethally misguided) ancient Greek and Roman books about medicine, whereas Barber-Surgeons were trained by a hands-on apprenticeship.
