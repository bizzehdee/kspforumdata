Including Aircraft, ground vehicles, naval ships, and military space craft.\n\nThe problem is that besides BDarmoury, I don\u0027t know many mods out there that cater to this kind of play, was hoping my fellow KSP\u0027ers could help me out.\n\nI am looking for weapon mods, naval mods, aircraft part mods like B9. Anything you think would fit in!\n\nps.
