They do appear to be in my save game persistence file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was attempting various contracts at the same time. I sent a probe to the Mun and rescued Corsen Kerman, who was stranded in orbit, and then landed Corsen for an EVA to collect science. An odd thing to note is that trying to produce a crew report errored with \u0022Crew Report requires the Mk1 Command Pod to be manned\u0022. This was with Corsen on board. (fyi I\u0027m not sure if engineers and scientists can also do crew reports and if Corsen is not a pilot). The probe then piloted the craft back to Kerbin and was recovered OK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed at this point that none of my contracts were completed and I earned little money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy contracts (IIRC) were to rescue Corsen, fly-by the Mun, collect science from space around Kerbin and I think collect science in some way from the Mun (surface sample.ect). I had other contracts but these were my goals for the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some reading of the forum I backed up my save game directory (attached) and then restored my quicksave.sfs \u0026gt; persistent.sfs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe save is immediately after rescuing Corsen while in orbit next to Corsen\u0027s Scrap. No contracts are visible in-game but they are documented in the persistence file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone can help me restore my save game file that would be awesome. If you can fix the bug then doubly awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave game folder and output_log.txt download link:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/0xndtnffhbqjsw1/Del_KSP_files.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/0xndtnffhbqjsw1/Del_KSP_files.zip?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did launch and quit KSP a few times before making a copy of the output_log.txt. The saved game folder is immediately after the mission ended and I realised something was wrong.
