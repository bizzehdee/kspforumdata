It might take a few design iterations to get both the propellant fraction and TWR where you want them, but it\u0027s more systematic and less prone to failure than pure trial and error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, download either MechJeb or Kerbal Engineer and use the VAB data readouts to quickly and easily see your dV and TWR information on the fly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T11:15:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI generally just build the core stage and then check my TWR (mechjeb or kerbal engineer) and start adding stages until it gets where I want it to be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said you need approximately 9 kN to lift 1 ton (real world not sure how that translates to game) so if you were trying to lift something that was say 10 tons (including fuel/engine weight) you would need at minimum a 90kN engine.
