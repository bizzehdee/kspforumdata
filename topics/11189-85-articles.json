This particular one is a bipropellant tanker designed to lift fuel and oxidiser to orbital propellant depots.  \n  \n![294gjyb.jpg](http://i65.tinypic.com/294gjyb.jpg)  \n\nClimbing to orbit on closed cycle.  \n  \n![16kxnrk.jpg](http://i64.tinypic.com/16kxnrk.jpg)  \n\n75km x 75km orbit reached and approaching the propellant depot.  \n  \n![8w06kn.jpg](http://i63.tinypic.com/8w06kn.jpg)  \n\nDocking to depot completed, ready to transfer propellant. Total transfer to the depot was 2852L of LiquidFuel and 3473L of Oxidizer, which is a tiny bit more Oxidizer than the optimum mix. I kept 360L of LiquidFuel and 440L of Oxidizer in the spaceplane for deorbit burn.  \n\nTotal delivery to depot comes out at 31.625 tons, plus some spare monopropellant. Payload fraction 23.83%  \n  \n![347cpq8.jpg](http://i68.tinypic.com/347cpq8.jpg)  \n\nDisconnecting from the propellant depot to perform deorbit burn.  \n  \n![33x7sk9.jpg](http://i66.tinypic.com/33x7sk9.jpg)  \n\nPeak heat load during high alpha reentry. The lifting body fuselage which provides something like 50% of the lift during level fight is acting as a giant airbrake here, hence the relatively low heat during reentry.  \n  \n![21b0ga1.jpg](http://i64.tinypic.com/21b0ga1.jpg)  \n\nGliding towards KSC.  \n  \n![2ilr20.jpg](http://i67.tinypic.com/2ilr20.jpg)  \n\nFlaring just before touch down.  \n  \n![2me2skz.jpg](http://i63.tinypic.com/2me2skz.jpg)  \n\nStarlifter stopped on the runway, ready to be recovered.\n\nFully fuelled this spaceplane costs $168,064, empty it\u0027s $158,340. The cost of the propellant delivered to the depot was $2,906.74, so the cost ends up being $215.57 per ton to orbit.  \n\nBeing a workhorse design, it\u0027s also available in LiquidFuel tanker for refuelling atomic rocket engined powered crafts:  \n![18ez52.jpg](http://oi68.tinypic.com/18ez52.jpg)  \n\nCargo carrier, capable of carrying 34 tons to orbit:  \n![51afy1.jpg](http://oi68.tinypic.com/51afy1.jpg)  \n\nAnd a orbital passenger plane variant, with a capacity of 32 passengers:  \n![j67sz9.jpg](http://oi67.tinypic.com/j67sz9.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-02T04:42:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2016 04:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar**"},{"CreatedByName":"manni01","CreatedById":109903,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T19:23:31Z","Content":"I made this nice little Mun SSTO\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/pl3DXfXnBo4?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/rr42H/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T10:52:09Z","Content":"Congratulations to...\n\n[Bill Zarr](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/11189-the-k-prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2328522)  Advanced Pilot Precision Award 1st Class with Peregrine.\n\n[Gojira1000](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/11189-the-k-prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2329054) Utilitarial Commendation (42t), Pilot Proficiency Medal with Mule-1.\n\n[madster](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/11189-the-k-prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2339648) Advanced Pilot Precision Award 1st Class with Dumb 2.\n\n[sieve](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/11189-the-k-prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2341233) Advanced Pilot Precision Award with Hubble Service Vessel.\n\n[Temstar](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/11189-the-k-prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2345319) Advanced Pilot Precision Award 1st Class with Starlifter.\n\n[manni01](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/11189-the-k-prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2346138) Astrokerbal Distinction (M\u00FCn), Advanced Pilot Precision Award with Mun SSTO.\n\nEvermore Alpaca  - Advanced Pilot Precision Award with [Bill Kermans\u0027 SSTO](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/11189-the-k-prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2341323) (minimalist record holder 4.792t).\n\n... for completing the K-Prize mission successfully and each with your own style and kudos.

I suppose if i used the 45t of fuel that is cargo the ship could get to even greater orbits but I am using it to construct a space station in orbit at 80km.  Take off weight is 142t without a payload.  \n\nThe ship includes a small service payload that I include on most trips this sits behind the small payload bay doors and includes monopropellant, batteries, large stabilizer, X200-8 tank and a large solar panel.\n\nCosts of the ship are 142,426 without a payload and on landing you get around 130,000 back meaning to orbit and return costs are 12,000.\n\nThe ship needs to start on 4 engines due to air intake requirements but once its moving all engines can be started.  This is because the ship only has 2 shock cone intakes,  these provide sufficient air to power the 4 whiplash and 6 rapier engines at full throttle up to mach 4.4.  \n\nAll parts are stock only plugins i use are Kerbal Engineer and Docking Port alignment indicator.\n\nIf anyone is interested in the ship file I will happily upload somewhere.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/8UHx7/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-13T12:22:04Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2016 12:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by stewis**"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-13T21:29:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 hours ago, boolybooly said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Mechjeb is fine because it doesnt break the rules by changing flight characteristics.

The challenge is about comparing spaceplane designs, so they need to be on a level playing field. You can use any mods which dont alter flight physics from stock eg robotics, skins, mechjeb. Using mods for engine parts, wings, tanks or physics tweaks like FAR will be given a gatecrasher listing! The choice is yours...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Any mission report which demonstrates the K-Prize mission was completed including images or videos or just the written word is fine, we are on the honour system here. To qualify a report needs to be of a mission that was actually flown from start to finish, not just a theoretical mission or stringing together several partial missions. You have to actually do it! The report needs to state or show the objectives completed, info also in the [first post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/11189-the-k-prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=165892).\n\u003E \n\nWell, I\u0027ll be dipped.
