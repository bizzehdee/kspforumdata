I used it as its considered the standard. I still think it\u0027s fun to speculate about how you might store so much even if you don\u0027t really NEED to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a couple of issues here, let me start with the most abstract.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEvolution is really fast (and if need be it can accelerate also), in 500 million years human descendants (500 million years ago, fish did not exist, something like tunicate that had a free swimming stage), if we survive, we be nothing like people today, so that our needs today may not represent our needs tomorrow. More to the point if we started having children in space, overtime humans would evolve to be compatible with life in space (zero gravity tolerance, more tolerant to radiation). Provided an ample supply of nutrients species can adapt to anything, e.g. chernobyl.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the idea here is that in 300,000 million years the Earth and all similar yellow stars will expand and wipe out all the species living on those planets, so how do species survive . . . . .go interstellar, prevent your star from expanding . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem here is efficiency. Where you are at, a yellow star, we could think of a yellow star as a nursery, this is where life is more likely to start, the goldilocks zone has a sure point in which life can arise and produce sentiency, where as white blue stars produce to much UV (although species could adapt, the problem is that the light gasses in the atmosphere cannot, they evolve into space), Red stars produce more heat than useful radiation, to be close enough to the star to get photosynthesis basically burns off alot of water. Thus the goldilocks zone is actually a zone where life might exist, if even transiently, but a much much smaller zone where sentients evolve.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 The next issue is preserving your star, but why? there are so many long-lived red stars, why not just move to one of those. Red stars are mostly unstable, but as they age they stabilize and they then burn for 10s of billions of years with very predictable outputs. Moving into orbit around red stars is a solution. But what are the problems. Heat, there is alot more heat than photovoltaic radiation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ne = h\u003Cem\u003Ef\u003C/em\u003E there is more energy to be gained in higher wavelengths and easier to obtain, current modern PVs can be stacked to absorb at three wavelengths, getting efficiency up to 42%, but this is star relative efficiency. If we moved those to a red star, efficiency would drop. The second problem is to make use you have to get so close to the star, you have a heat problem, and panel weights increases . . . . .HUman need to become grossly more efficient at managing heat before we could even make an interstellar ship (the fusion problem) or live around a red star.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo basically extracting hydrogen from a yellow star turns it into a red star, thus by that time you are so good with fusion, you don\u0027t care about solar. If you are good with fusion you are good at managing heat and extracting energy, so the heat is not a problem either. But just because you can extract heat does not mean every thing goes cold, it just means you get work out of it (somewhere along the line moving the heat from one system to another), the heat is still there. If we are doing it properly we take infrared radiation and release energy CMBR temperature and red shows up where we are working probably somewhere out in the system where it dark.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou could use the heat to convert say helium back into hydrogen and dueterium, or iron back into lighter elements (we don\u0027t know how to do that, particularly, but you could store energy in hydrogen). You could be using the energy you store to create photonic racetracks that use solar and heat conversion to propel craft between the stars (which increasing looks like what interstellar travel will be, slow generational ships carried on rivers of photons). Somewhere (sooner rather than later) however the energy of the star needs to be given up as heat and increase entropy or the system doesn\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the bottom line is that humans descendant species (if we survive) will leave Earth and venture the stars . . . . . .and to do that we need to manage (exploit, manipulate, otherwise exploit physical systems and redirect the minutia of entropy) energy in our solar system better and a dyson swarm is one solution. Another solution is you exploit only enough to leave and find a more stable star(s). Dyson swarms and star farming is something that involves fusion. Three things 1. we have to get it to work 2. it cannot be dumping huge amounts of energy into the craft but power that can be easily transferred where needed 3. And do this without a prohibitive amount of mass. Otherwise all the energy produced will be sunk into pushing the mass around.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223313469\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171817\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221520527681\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002274091\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022p1t1o\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, p1t1o said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yes, the Kardashev scale certainly is that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I disagree about the \u0022human terms\u0022 part, if anything\u00A0the scale is designed specifically to identify things that are nothing like humanity.
