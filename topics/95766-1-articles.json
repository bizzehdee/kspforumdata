Also tilt them so they rise as they get further from the fuselage, which makes roll self-limiting (roll left; the left wing will gain lift and the right one will lose lift, so you\u0027ll level out without touching the con).

Roll is self-limiting, so you won\u0027t get much turning.

Yes its slightly more efficent to just give the wings an AOA but you can split the difference a bit. if you need a 10 degree AOA can do 5 on the wings and 5 on the core. You\u0027ll still have the issue of the plane wanting to climb higher as fuel load drops but when you get too high you\u0027ll start to stall and drop. the probe will follow the prograde down but because its angled slightly off it will actualy be pulling out of the dive naturaly. I\u0027m just concerned that pure AOA on the wings wont always be enough to pull out of the dive while the tilted probe will force a bit of steering correction as well as your tricking it into aiming your direction of travle a bit above prograde. It will experience more extreme oscillation as the aircraft lightens but it should keep going till out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T07:49:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, in KSP there isn\u0027t really any \u0027stalling\u0027 mechanism.
