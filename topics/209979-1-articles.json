Or terrorism. Most natural causes could be excluded on their own since they can\u0027t (reliably/targeted) hop star systems, but with human/alien help they could of course. Those would be my top \u0027most likely\u0027 options. Grey goo and/or rogue Von Neumann probes could be a less evil/intentional but still intelligence-caused option. Related to that, evil AI could do the trick (Roko\u0027s Basilisk?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor purely natural causes anything that could wipe out an entire multi-stellar civilization is liable to destroy the entire universe. There\u0027s Strange Matter/Strangelets for example (think cosmic Ice-9). Then there\u0027s False Vacuum Decay (or a \u0027Vacuum Metastability Event\u0027), basically a phase transition of the entire universe to a more stable quantum state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s the geometric cut-off suggested by eternal inflation theories, this gets a bit above my pay-grade in maths and statistics but basically, in order to make the probability calculations in quantum physics work physicists have to use some boundaries because in an infinite universe/multi-verse with infinite space-time every event happens an infinite number of times and therefor the probability of any event happening is equal to the probability of all other events happening, throwing sand in the quantum probability machinery. It has been suggested that these boundaries may actually be real rather than just a mathematical tool which would mean time would simply end some time in the coming 5 billion years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome people might suggest a galaxy collision/merger but the reality is that these events rarely involve actual stellar collisions, it would definitely change the night sky but it\u0027s unlikely it would wipe out an entire civilization assuming they are somewhat spread throughout their home galaxy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course universe ending catastrophes aren\u0027t all that interesting to explore because there\u0027ll be nobody around to talk about it around the water cooler anyway. Besides the water has probably turned to ice because of the Ice-9. So my vote for the most likely cause would go to some form of sabotage/war/terrorism on an interstellar scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming such a cause, some pockets would be likely to survive due to isolation, and although rebuilding might take a long time, that\u0027s only \u0027long\u0027 on human scales, not on cosmic scales. The science has all been done, it\u0027s mostly a matter of building back up to whatever level of development allows you to produce the presumably exotic materials needed for your interstellar engine magic before the whole story starts over again.

Although technically you could claim a species is interstellar as soon as they colonize their second star, that does not quite make it a civilization yet. I\u0027m thinking Kardashev type 3 or close to it here, which is pretty much where you\u0027d have to be to be considered an interstellar civilization to me. After all the concept of a \u0027civilization\u0027 implies that you have some sort of organization that ties all these stars together under a single (or shared) authority, just letting some seeds blow along on the wind isn\u0027t quite enough.

Still, assuming that the people on the receiving end are at a similarly high level of tech from our point of view, I certainly concede they might be able to detect it before it hit. Stopping it is another matter altogether though.

Still there are plenty of options for that, a \u0027shotgun blast\u0027 as you mentioned could do some damage, or you might be able to mess with their star and swamp the system with radiation.
