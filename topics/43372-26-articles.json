First, our habitation simulations revealed that crop growth, if large enough to provide 100% of the settlement\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s food, will produce unsafe oxygen levels in the habitat. As a result, some form of oxygen removal system is required \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 a technology that has not yet been developed for spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the ISRU system sizing module generated a system mass estimate that was approximately 8% of the mass of the resources it would produce over a two year period, even with a generous margin on the ISRU system mass estimate. That being said, the ISRU technology required to produce nitrogen, oxygen, and water on the surface of Mars is at a relatively low TRL, so such findings are preliminary at best. A spare parts analysis revealed that the mass of spare parts to support the ISRU and ECLS systems increases significantly as the settlement grows - after 130 months on the Martian surface, spare parts compose 62% of the mass transported to the Martian surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the space logistics analysis revealed that for the most optimistic scenario considered, establishing the first crew of a Mars settlement will require approximately 15 Falcon Heavy launches costing $4.5 billion, and these values will grow with additional crews. It is important to note that these numbers are derived considering only the ECLS and ISRU systems with spare parts. Future work will have to integrate other analyses, such as communications and power systems, to capture a more realistic estimate of mission cost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, technology development will have to focus on improving the reliability of ECLS systems, the TRL of ISRU systems, and either the capability of Mars in - situ manufacturing and/or the cost of launch. Improving these factors will help to dramatically reduce the mass and cost of Mars settlement architectures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T21:38:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow hard can it be to remove excess oxygen?
