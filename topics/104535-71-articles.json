There was some breaking changes between KSP 1.2.0. and 1.2.1. for many mods, so it is hard to say if it will work properly with 1.2.0. Even harder to expect developer support for obsolet KSP version, while work on latest is still unfinished.\n\nIf you expect stable version for longer career gameplay, you should be patient and wait for official update in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).
