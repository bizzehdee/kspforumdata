The debug thermal info showed that their actual temperatures were increasing as expected.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, I built a little \u0022test rig\u0022 with some physicsless target parts (cubic struts, landing gear) to see if maybe this was a change in 1.05, that perhaps physicsless parts didn\u0027t change colour anymore. Below is a screenshot of the result. Anyone had this before? All of the parts used in the pictured craft are stock.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00222QeLZbF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2QeLZbF.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
