I fly my rockets using FAR and KW fairings. When is it best to drop them. In other words, where does it begin to cost me in delta v to carry the mass of the fairings more than I gain from the decreased drag. Currently, I am carrying them up to 70km and dropping them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T07:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease consider carefully where you place new threads, this one was in the wrong subforum. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064-Community-Rules-October-27th-2013\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERule 2.4 is in effect\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThread moved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T07:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce atmospheric drag is 0, I would suppose.
