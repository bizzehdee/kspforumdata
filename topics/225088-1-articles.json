During flight my rocket controls start out performing well. Then, without anything new happening to the rocket, no staging taking place, no collision, all of the sudden I will try to steer in a direction with my joystick and my rocket ends up going in the opposite direction. This occurs with pitch, yaw and roll controls. Sometimes just one of the 3\u00A0 but could also be 2 or 3 of the 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
