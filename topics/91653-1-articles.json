You have a very wonderful product here which has brought me (and the world at large) much smiles and loss of productivity with household chores. However there is one recurring issue which should be a real easy fix for the programmers there. While in the spaceship construction building, at the top of the screen where it says that your vessel\u0027s name is \u0022Unnamed Vessel\u0022 or something. When I go to type in a number like \u0022Science Vessel 3\u0022.. the number \u00223\u0022 doesn\u0027t really stand out and is actually quite smallish compared to the other letters. So perhaps change the font to Arial or another style, please? Not a biggie, and should only take a second or two to fix. That\u0027s the only downside I\u0027ve experienced with your astronaut game. Well, probably could use a few more surface lights.
