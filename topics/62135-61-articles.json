To give you a rough idea, a mod I made in 2009, was still getting updates and support in 2013. With KSP, that\u0027s really something that depends on several factors. If Squad changes something internally that our plugins rely on, that would fall on Nazari. Same goes for anything that relies on internal Unity related changes.

Performing automated maneuvers works great... for about 90% of the maneuver execution. It\u0027s in the final 10% where things get a bit screwy. Specifically, the orbiter appears to lose its guidance as if S.A.S. was abruptly disabled (it\u0027s like it\u0027s \u0022oversteering\u0022 at the tail end of the operation). Mind you, this is in orbit-outside the influence of atmospheric drag-with only the Omnimax 40Ts engaged (the Thrustmax 200s perform markedly worse, as to be expected). I\u0027ve tried disabling/locking the gimbals as well as the trim, but that only seems to exacerbate the issue. I\u0027m presuming this may have something to do with the engines being slightly offset from the center of mass? I really have no idea. It\u0027s quite strange that it only affects such a small portion, and not the whole. My work-around is to simply disengage/re-engage the maneuver, or just ride it out and hope I don\u0027t expend too much deltaV or go too far off the intended course. It\u0027s not game breaking, just slightly frustrating when trying to perform complex operations like rendezvous.\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I hope that was helpful.

That won\u0027t work, especially with MechJeb. The KSO, like the real shuttle, has it\u0027s engines gimbaled so that it does not actually thrust in the direction the nose of the orbiter is pointing. You need to take the gimbaling into account and point off-center to get the \u0022correct\u0022 thrust vector.

I prefer empirical evidence and I haven\u0027t seen any pictures showing your cockpit in poor quality as the result of texture compression.\u003Cp\u003EIn fact I use it myself and the cockpit looks fine to me, but if what looks fine to me is actually bad quality then I figured I\u0027d uninstall the compressor and start the game to see what it really looked like. And honestly I can\u0027t tell the difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have an outdated copy of the texture compressor, from back when it was actually called... texture compressor. (it\u0027s Active Texture management now, or something). So I re-downloaded it, the \u0027aggressive\u0027 version and checked the cockpit again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures below. Can you tell me which one is uncompressed, compressed with the older version and compressed with the newest aggressive version? Because I can\u0027t even tell you which one is which. The only difference I see is when I look at Task Manager. (2 GB, 2.5 GB and 3.2 GB). But, I can guarantee you that 2 are uncompressed (standard KSO download, not alternate low res), 2 are compression using the December version and 2 using the most recent Aggressive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/06cOl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/06cOl\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you misunderstood me saying texture compression versus texture halving.

The issue is with the Alternate Texture download v1.13. That one is a fast solution that really just halves the texture sizes and it was designed for people that do not have the texture compression mod you are using. You then have folks that are using that texture set in addition to the texture compression mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m an avid supporter of the mod and many times brought it up to Naz that I wanted (and still want and may eventually) do away with the alternate texture download entirely.

Math errors result. The problem is in stock KSP and affects the perceived position of the nodes and MJ relies on what KSP tells it. So as the remaining burntime drops under 1 (normal) it gets increasingly inaccurate. That\u0027s why you end up \u0027chasing\u0027 the marker. Nothing to do with gimbals, which are just for steering and for compensating for off-axis thrust. You can control their pitch btw independently of the steering aspect.
