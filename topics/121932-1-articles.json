Landed it, but when I taxi to within a few hundred meters of the pole itself, every part instantly overheats and explodes. So it\u0027s specific to that location. If I tell it to ignore max temperature in the Debug Toolbar, everything goes instantly red, but doesn\u0027t explode (as instructed), and other than the heat showing maxxed out, behaves normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else seen this?
