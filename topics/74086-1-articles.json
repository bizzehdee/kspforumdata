I have a wireless keyboard that has been dropped a time or twelve and its missing the spacebar (I\u0027m actually at work right now) and other keys I have managed to mostly replace with keys from the number pad. It also has a habit of dieing at random intervals and not working until it is shaken back to life. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis turns everything from run of the mill launches, transfer windows, and especially landings into white knuckle moments where anything could go wrong. I like to think of it as an equipment failure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had launches go straight vertical, burning all the fuel in the first stage and sailing uncontrolled for some period while I frantically struggle to regain control. I\u0027ve missed manuver nodes completely, or even better...burned all of my fuel at a particular node, vastly overshooting my target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunnest of all though, I\u0027ve had landings go hilariously awry because of this. Two nights ago I was doing a routine crew transfer at my minmus mining base and I lost control with the transfer stage still attached just after completing a burn to intercept minmus with a periapsis under the surface, I do this to keep my system clean. Typically I ditch the stage so it hits the body I transferred to and then correct with the lander into an intercept course. I had no idea my keyboard was dead until I tried to come out of time warp, massively overshooting where I wanted to be. When my controls came back I had to ditch the stage and do a suicide burn to nuetralize my vertical speed. I manage to successfully pull out of the doom dive about 30 meters above the surface, still travelling a good bit horizontally and my keyboard dies again. As I am vigorously shaking my keyboard the ship skims sideways across the surface and clips the top of a hill with the engine, ripping it off entirely. Control comes back, no engines, no rcs...still travelling sideways. I flip it around, pointing the fuel tank retrograde and hope for the best. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took two kilometers and a lot of scattered debris to stop but Sonzan did survive.
