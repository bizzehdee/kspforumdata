I am not sure if it is intentional that the thrust at sea level isn\u0027t even enough to pull its own weight anymore, but for now I assume it.\n\nBUT the animation of the 909 at sea level looks really crap .. as like as the engine would run on 10% (or less) ... even in orbit it looks only like ~ 50% ... that can\u0027t be right.\n\n... the sound effects, too btw.."}]}
