(I think it was Scott Manley! Failing!) I then spent several hours trying to find \u0022Herbal Space Program\u0022 or something like that.

Before that, I had found a copy of the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0old game where I built ridiculous \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E stacks, in\u00A00.14, (I think) and I was amazed that the demo had\u00A0landing gears and quadcouplers and fairings..\u00A0I then busied myself making a rocket to go to the Mun, which involved serious part clipping as I used\u00A0quad symmetry in conjunction with quadcouplers. It was a copy of a rocket from a super old video and the first thing that happened was me pushing the EVA button without a ladder. The second thing that happened was Jeb falling inside of the launchpad. The next few weeks consisted of me relearning orbit, crashing into the mun, and other things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI soon saved up enough for the full game though, and in 0.19 bought it (just in time for free making history today!)

I made a twin engine plane, with a couple of wing pieces and a simple tail plane. I made it halfway across the runway before realizing that I had to go to bed. The next few days consisted of me trying to make fighter jet replicas and space fighters, watching my brother make the strangest\u00A0of all land vehicles, and discovering that cars made the world turn into a blue and white marble.\u00A0Soon I dove into the world of the official KSP modding site, which I found incredibly cool and awesome.\u00A0Lazor systems was my first mod, and tanks and aircraft carriers were my entire interest for the next few days.\u00A0Skillful was next, but BDarmory came.
