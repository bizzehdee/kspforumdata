Which has all these lovely features, but NEEDS MJ to use some of its features, and that pretty much sealed it for me. Although, I saw that there\u0027s a way to disable the autopilot parts of it, so I might try that sometime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Johno\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Johno\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBless me, KSPers, for I have sinned.\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was trying to refuel my new spaceplane in orbit, I tried to get the tanker into an orbit which would intersect the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI forgot my basic orbital mechanics.
