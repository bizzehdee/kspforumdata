I suppose given the price, few would ever get more than one, anyway.

The kind of people who would be most interested in this would likely want multiple models at the same scale (i.e. to show off the multiple stages of their awesome interplanetary mission). The price and material adds insult to injury in my opinion, $99 for a model that you can\u0027t even really play with (because if you bump it too hard it will break) means only a very small number of players will actually use this, and from the latest devnotes it sounds like Squad devoted a significant amount of time to this \u0022secret project\u0022 when they\u0027re going full-bore for 1.0 and need all hands on deck for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to have a 3D models of some of my craft, but they need to be a lot more flexible (i.e. separable stages, not just all fused together) and need to be cheaper and more durable, plastic would have made much more sense than sandstone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T17:08:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 05:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T17:09:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketPilot573\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RocketPilot573\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI miss when the Hype train tickets where free...

Cause from what i know about 3d printers (my friend has one), metal based printers are the most solid and durable models, but are insanely expensive, and the cheaper alternatives arent that strong. Extruded plastic isnt bad (my friend\u0027s machine uses this), but ive also heard some cheaper machines use plaster or some more brittle materials instead, making very bad models in terms of structural stability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, while its a neat thing, at a price tag of roughly $100, i dont think this makes much sense considering teh game is like less then 1/3 the cost of a single model (and id bet people want to have multiple models that can be attached ect).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot a bad idea, but i doubt that many people would utilize it with the current pricing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, id prefer that there are no menus or advertizements in game (launcher ok, but not the game itself). Regardless of intentions, i dont think that many people will like to have adverts/links to services integrated within the game menu or whatnot, especially the 3d printing, that considering the cost, is not going to be all that popular in the 1st place. Games like WOT, or stuff with microtransactions is another story, but i feel that integrating a external service that isnt directly game related isnt a good move, ofc i can bet if this is done a mod will come out to remove it, but i hope it doesnt come down to that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T23:12:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 11:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T23:57:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@panzer1b: it\u0027s a sandstone-like material, with the drawbacks that you note.
