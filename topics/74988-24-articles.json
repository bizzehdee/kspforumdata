However, 4000 thrust is very a lot for only a 2.5m rocket. The Dragon\u0027s engines make sense to be high thrust (for abort). But... I think it would be cool to have it use two engine modes too. One for abort preparation (and/or landing?), then, once it\u0027s in orbit on its own power, it switches to a more fuel-efficient, and less powerful orbital state.
