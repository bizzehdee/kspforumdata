That is well within the realm of possibility. However, I think it would be far more effective and productive for that team to take what was learned from the creation, implementation, reception, and growth of KSP and its mods and start a new project from stronger foundation. Hopefully the profits of KSP would be enough to fund such a project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-07T18:56:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222978164\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157287\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488849910\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269375\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mako\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, Mako said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea of a new project built from the ground up on a more capable (or even custom designed) engine by team of experienced devs using KSP as a proof of concept holds a great amount of appeal to me, and it seems to others as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm, sounds like a cookie-cutter approach.

I\u0027m saying that a second KSP built from the ground up on a better foundation while learning from the creation of the original sounds very appealing. There are definite limits to what can be achieved with the current code base. Unity was a good choice given the circumstances at the time. I believe there are better options now available because KSP has been successful. I believe the magic you speak of comes from the Kerbals and the lighthearted nature the game puts forth. The rest is just programming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP\u0027s case, what made it successful was its approachable nature and its accomplishments \u003Cem\u003Edespite\u003C/em\u003E the engine it was built on. I would love options like axial tilt, a solar system size that could be chosen for each new save, a building system other than the strict parent-child configuration. KSP works as it is. The concept would continue to work just as well if those improvements (and others) could be added. However, after coming as far as KSP has, I don\u0027t see any way for anything like my few suggestions to be implemented. I don\u0027t think it would be effective to try to wrestle significant changes into what currently exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first time you create something is not likely to be the best version of that thing that you\u0027ll ever create. If I draw a picture of a horse for the first time, it won\u0027t be good because I\u0027m a terrible artist. The second time I try to draw that horse I can look back at my first attempt and see what worked, what didn\u0027t, and try to improve on it. Maybe I bring better tools to the table (better paper, pencils, etc.) based on what I learned from my first experience. But I can tell you this: if I try to erase parts of my previous drawing and correct problems it certainly won\u0027t look as good as if I start fresh with what I\u0027ve learned from my first attempt. The choices I made for the first drawing will be impossible to get away from entirely. And yet, that first drawing will have some magic to it because it was the first. It will not be my best or most impressive creation, but that doesn\u0027t change the fact that it was the start of something even bigger and better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as I said before: I don\u0027t see it happening, but it\u0027s certainly possible and it\u0027s certainly fun to dream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redneck","CreatedById":2030,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-07T20:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222978814\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157287\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488913010\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002281727\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, The_Rocketeer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm, sounds like a cookie-cutter approach.

Also, the current team has yet to release an update. I\u0027m not speculating that the upcoming release will be bad or anything like that. I just want to point out that we really don\u0027t know current Squad apart from the little information they\u0027ve chosen to give us. I feel like even the current PR people are mostly unknown to us. Say what you will about Maxmaps or other past public facing representatives, but my feeling is that Squad was more approachable and more interactive with its community in the past. I\u0027m not accusing Squad of anything, just sharing my perception (which may be biased because I mostly lurk, but I lurk a lot and what I\u0027ve seen has affected my perception).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when people say things like what I suspect motivated your comment, I think it\u0027s a symptom of the apprehension some of the community is feeling since we\u0027re waiting to find out more about this team (through their hard work [because I understand the hesitance to be too directly involved in the community even if I don\u0027t exactly agree with the choice]), more about the updates, and more about future plans for KSP. The teasing of announcements and secret projects that can\u0027t be discussed has not helped the feeling that the community really has very little information by which it can form an idea or opinion of Squad and the future of KSP. That\u0027s not doom and gloom, it\u0027s just facts. In some way it doesn\u0027t matter too much, because KSP already exists and is worth its price.

There are definite limits to what can be achieved with the current code base. Unity was a good choice given the circumstances at the time.

I will just say that I made those comments in response to someone saying a sequel would just be a cookie-cutter project and therefore kill the magic, but just as I don\u0027t believe that poster did my idea justice, I didn\u0027t do the devs justice on their design and cleverness. If it were so easy to program such a game as this I believe we\u0027d have seen clones pop up by now, and to be fair I doubt those clones would have the same, if any, magic that KSP has.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redneck","CreatedById":2030,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-09T02:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222979595\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157287\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488985840\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002216426\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, sal_vager said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThankfully, Squad are committed to supporting Kerbal Space Program despite no legal requirement to do so, and are continuing to work on content, including localization which regardless of your opinion is much welcomed by the majority of other players, especially foreign players who see this as the positive move that it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd may I ask how do you/squad know this? \u0022welcomed by the majority of other players\u0022 How is this conclusion reached?
