And of course, I guess, it would just decide to be hydrogen in a Nerv.\n\nPoint is, the chemical rockets have specific impulses comparable to Kerolox."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:30:13Z","Content":"Check out the specified specific heats and specific impulses. Looks like a much closer fit to Aerozine 50 and nitrogen tetroxide (assuming high-tech staged combustion for the upper-end engines, and [invisible] large area ratio nozzles for the vacuum engines)."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:32:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Check out the specified specific heats and specific impulses.
