I would really appreciate it if you could all orbit the Mun at 8KM with any inclination BUT equatorial. You are encouraged to take as many photos as possible and post them here. Also, please name mountains and craters (small. No Maria) after anything you\\\u0027d like. The more Lunar sounding, the better. As part of my grand idea to map the entire Mun and name things, I ask for a mapping mission from everyone here. Also, try to put the locations of each thing in perspective so that we can see where they are. My mapping probe is orbiting the Mun right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
