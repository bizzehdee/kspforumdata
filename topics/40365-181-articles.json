They still work folded up, but they work better deployed. Protecting Kerbals from Radiation is a lot harder. Use your Magnetometer part to find out the Magnetic Field flux (amount of Radiation interacting with Kerbin\u0027s (or any planet\u0027s) magnetic field). Generally, the lower the number on the Magnetometer, and the higher the orbit, the less radiation your Kerbals take. Don\u0027t put your orbit too high though, or you\u0027ll leave the planet\u0027s Magnetosphere and your radiation will go up again because of the solar wind. I\u0027m not sure that your Kerbals can actually \u0022die\u0022 from radiation, or at least it hasn\u0027t happened to Jeb yet after 3 years getting to Jool and back... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure of the plugin\u0027s values, but in real life, 50 mSv (50,000 Nano-Sieverts) of Radiation in a one year period is considered the maximum \u0022safe\u0022 amount of radiation exposure in the USA. The lowest yearly dose figure that has been confirmed to increase risk of cancer etc. is 100 mSv. At 400 mSv you start to feel the Symptoms of \u0022Radiation Sickness\u0022 but you won\u0027t die. At 2000 mSv up to 2 Sv\u0027s is considered severe Radiation Poisoning, this is not good, but dose\u0027s like this are not generally deadly, especially with medical treatment. Some people have survived exposure of up to 6 Sv, with immediate medical attention, but a dose this high is usually fatal.

Fractal has stated that one of the upcoming things he would like to do is implement a type of magnetic/plasma bottle field thing (can\u0027t remember what he exactly called it) to protect against radiation. If he goes down the same path as when WasteHeat was implemented, we\u0027ll get a measurement (which we have now), then we\u0027ll get some way to protect against it in a future patch, then in a patch sometime after that, he might implement consequences for not protecting against radiation. Long story short though, it\u0027s nothing to worry about at all right now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cylindrical and the little white and gold radial radiators do not fold out.

It\u0027s a small DLL file that compresses part textures and such when loading the game. Some people have reported 200-800 mb reduction in RAM usage. Another thing you can do to save more RAM than compressing a texture is just flat out delete parts from parts packs like KW that you don\u0027t use (like if you use procedural fairings, you don\u0027t need the fairings provided by KW).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kalloran","CreatedById":89303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T13:03:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt depends exactly what you have done in terms of installation - you should end up with three folders inside GameData, those are HexCans, TreeLoader and WarpPlugin.

Reference, a sundive mission had one of the basic 1x6 panels generating something like 38,000 EC/s in the low Kerbol biome (\u0026lt;1 Mm). What this means is that even very small solar panels can quickly roast ships that don\u0027t have any radiators on them when you get to Moho or low Kerbol orbit. I typically send a probe on a sundive during early mid career and have to be careful not to overdo it with solar power or underdo it with radiators to prevent my probe from getting cooked when grabbing science from the low Kerbol biome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vardicd","CreatedById":75832,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T15:53:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vardicd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vardicd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah I\u0027m getting this too, I played one game a while back, and the stock single solar panel had a display for waste heat, it almost never accumulated any, but now the waste heat display doesn\u0027t show.

Use your Magnetometer part to find out the Magnetic Field flux (amount of Radiation interacting with Kerbin\u0027s (or any planet\u0027s) magnetic field). Generally, the lower the number on the Magnetometer, and the higher the orbit, the less radiation your Kerbals take. Don\u0027t put your orbit too high though, or you\u0027ll leave the planet\u0027s Magnetosphere and your radiation will go up again because of the solar wind.

The lowest yearly dose figure that has been confirmed to increase risk of cancer etc. is 100 mSv. At 400 mSv you start to feel the Symptoms of \u0022Radiation Sickness\u0022 but you won\u0027t die. At 2000 mSv up to 2 Sv\u0027s is considered severe Radiation Poisoning, this is not good, but dose\u0027s like this are not generally deadly, especially with medical treatment.

Would it be useful as mono-prop or venting the helium-4 carry away some waste heat or feed into the crew\u0027s air recyclers for amusing sounding transmission back to mission control?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will just be fusion reactors that produce charged power - in theory, antimatter reactors should produce some too but in this case it is charged pions that are being produced, these are very fast, very penetrating and essentially impossible to stop so although power is technically being produced in this form, you can\u0027t extract it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Helium-4, I don\u0027t really have a use for it at present so I\u0027m not going to worry about it. It\u0027s certainly no use for carrying away waste heat considering a few years of reactor operation will get you a few kilograms of helium-4. It is almost certainly used inside the brayton cycle generators but its used within a closed cycle so it doesn\u0027t really get used up, so not much need for a resource for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T23:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice, I will continue to plan for my next career \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust designed a small AM satellite, it will only take 9 trips from my Fusion SSTO to get it all into orbit:rolleyes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ER2M7jI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ER2M7jI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RabidMonkey","CreatedById":76974,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T00:30:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Kethane seeming to be the front-running resource mod now that integrated resources have been indefinitely shelved, are you rethinking integration with it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T00:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RabidMonkey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RabidMonkey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWith Kethane seeming to be the front-running resource mod now that integrated resources have been indefinitely shelved, are you rethinking integration with it?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane has been the most popular resource mod for a long time, the fact that the stock resource system has been shelved indefinitely is irrelevant, nothing has changed with regard to hard dependency since I last discussed this matter - it remains out of the question.
