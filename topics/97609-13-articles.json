Seriously? It\u0027s just another update. Not the first and not the last one. It\u0027s not like after this one comes out they\u0027ll say \u0022Ok our job here is done have fun with all those bugs we ain\u0027t fixing them because this one\u0027s finished because 1.0 thats why.\u0022 That would kinda ruin their reputation, would it not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reviewers disagree that its just another update. Calling it 1.0 makes the assertion that KSP is a complete finished product, even if they keep working on it.

One of these, quite well known, is the reentry heat. I know that such a feature can be in KSP as a mod, but was originally planned as part of the game himself. Since nothing is said on this for the next version, i think Squad should make a statement about this. As a note, that may be random (or maybe not !), but the wiki page on this official site is experiencing technical difficulties ... Nonetheless, i\u0027ve found a place where an interview with Damion Rayne, a former community manager, which took place the 11 Feb 2013 (yes, nearly two years ago !), where he said that that feature will be in 0.19, which proved wrong. The interview link is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.themittani.com/media/kerbal-space-program-qa-devs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.themittani.com/media/kerbal-space-program-qa-devs\u003C/a\u003E . I save a screenshot as proof that this statement has been officially said by someone that was at the time an employee of this company. I never saw a word about that feature cancelled by Squad since.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
