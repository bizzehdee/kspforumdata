do would be a large task.\u00A0 It\u0027s not collective brainpower, it\u0027s a coordinated software development project for a non-trivial app that will have to target a particular

skeptical that that would happen-- specifically, I\u0027m skeptical that it would produce a product that\u0027s complete enough to be useful, bug-free enough to be usable, and finished in a time frame that\u0027s faster than just waiting for IPS to fix their stuff.\u00A0 It\u0027s a pretty big ask.\u00A0 (And would still leave anyone out in the cold who happens not to be on Android, or whichever platform you implement it on.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd all of that assumes that IPS has an API that this hypothetical mobile app could call, which I don\u0027t know to be the case.\u00A0 Maybe it does, but I don\u0027t know that it does.\u00A0 You\u0027d absolutely have to have that, or the entire idea would be a non-starter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short:\u00A0 I love the
