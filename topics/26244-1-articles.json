im an aerospace engineer so i might be able to help you here, first of all, both cases A and B are the same. you are increasing speed with a gravity assist, or swing-by. however, the common misconception here is that your speed on the instruments must increase, and it wont. your speed entering the planet encounter will equal the speed leaving the encounter if no thrusters were burned. gravity assists find no use in standard orbital mechanics within one body systems or systems with one moon. but they find many uses in systems with more bodies. like a solar system. gravity assists are used for interplanetary travel, to conserve time and fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirst you need to understand that the speed we are considering here is not the speed of the orbit but the speed relative to the sun. start with a heliocentric reference frame. now, consider that your spacecraft and the planet pull on each other, its not just the planet pulling you, but also you pulling the planet, but the mass of planets is so large its negligible, but the principle is important. the idea is that the velocity vector of the planet and your spacecrafts entering velocity become an added vector Vin (you\u0027re in mathematics so i know you know how to add vectors, the arrow method will suffice.) now, the velocity vector of the planet and your spacecraft also form a resultant the moment you reach the escape node. construct the two resultants and observe the difference, in both cases A and B you will find the resultant Vout to be larger. meaning, you have assisted in increasing your speed relative to the sun, and thus are travelling to wherever youre going faster in terms of the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egravity assists can also be used to slow down your craft if the planet is moving in the opposite direction of your spacecraft. and the manipulation of the encounter vectors Nin and Nout is what determines this, for example, case A is a large increase in velocity relative to the sun, while case B is a much smaller change. and depending on how exact the points i took from your drawing are, case B could also be a negative assist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eregardless the understanding should be that you are trying to manipulate your vector, not your speed. because the resultant of the planets vector and your own will determine where and how fast your interplanetary travel will be. remember according to the planet, no matter the strength of the assist. the velocity on your screen will be the same at encounter point and escape unless any burns were made. so for quick analysis, arbitrary arrow lengths are acceptable, the spacecraft\u0027s and the planet\u0027s. find your encounter on the map, and work out your velocity vector and the planets and draw them on a sheet of paper for the resultant, if the assist does not benefit your flight, change early to minimize fuel usage. when the desired resultant is reached. enjoy the ride.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crown","CreatedById":18262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T08:06:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFlying as shown in picture A, which means
