It\u0027s often the equation that link them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr said another way, a way to break a game is to to make its balance-algorithm simpler so it can be set, many good game are balanced by many parameters that do not make sense without game-developing skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, asking for \u0022difficulty setting\u0022 is not always out of altruistic motives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We all know that\u0022 some will say. Maybe, but setting are a good excuse to suggest something IN or OUT without saying outright and starting flamewar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eex :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone who do not like a feature will reque...suggest for the game-developer to make possible to balance the game without it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone who want an unpopular feature will claim it as a \u0022much needed\u0022 \u0022higher difficulty\u0022 or ask for proxy features requiring his own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think we all know example like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe would swear that our favorite Deadly Reentry mod could be a difficulty setting ON/OFF, Life-Support too, or planet scale even. Alas we would be missing the details like the new parts to model and the time to write the code and test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not putting blame on people for wanting to add variety or custom fit their experience. There\u0027s more than enough case where setting are a formidable asset for a game, also I trust the developers to do professional choices, rule out feature they do not see fitting, recognize mods which fit (and save you time, admit it !).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wouldn\u0027t want our dear and respected all supreme \u0026amp; glorious SQUAD being called lazy by expecting the player to balance the game themselves. Just like I don\u0027t want myself to have to try 40 different setting to find one that work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this topic is to discuss :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EWhat would make good setting for KSP ?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat do we need setting for ? If at all ?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the best game I know do not let you modify the setting or make them very abstract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with a game like KSP I do not think this is a question of difficulty, \u0022Easy / Normal / Hard\u0022 won\u0027t change the physics, they can\u0027t. You can change the economic, but some of us have very specific vision of how their space program should evolve, and will mod their game until they can pretend to play Orbiter 2.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it would be a question of personal experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027ll finish this message by saying you shouldn\u0027t have to select your experience \u0022before game\u0022, ideally you should make it on the go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T09:14:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy opinion is that the game should be in somewhere betwen remotly realistic (I kno thst\u0027s imprecise) and fun to play. This alone is hard to get right and many people will have different opinions on that. For example I rly dislike the fact that ssto\u0027s are relatively easy to make in stock ksp, because of the missing reentry mechanics and the odd air intake behaviour. Especially the last one is something that can\u0027t be adressed with the good old \u0022screw this, I pretend it\u0027s there and roleplay! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E \u0022 (like you can do with DRE, although it\u0027s not exactly the same). But honestly, I don\u0027t think that the more experienced players (the vast majority of people over here) agree on most things like (NEAR-alike) aerodynamics or some form of softened reentry mechanic. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve seen, if I missed an important discussion than please correct me. There are however a lot of topics that heavily divide the forum (life support).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut all that doesn\u0027t cover the very important aspect of the learning courve. The basic question is: how much can new players be tortured with real life physics? Even if those mechanics are softened, they still make a huge difference. DRE is one of those. You need a better understanding of orbital maneuvers or you burn up. Mun returns are going to be more difficult for new players. And THIS is where I think difficulty settings should kick in. My opinion is that theire main purpuse should be to lower the learning courve, so experienced players still have a decently complex and interesting game. My definition of this would include more plane/shuttle parts than we hafe now (although not much more), reentries and aerodynamics. Some additional stuff like a need for satelites can be included with contracts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd at that point I will mod my game till I\u0027m happy with it. That includes additional parts, life support (I put it over here cause not everyone likes it), remote tech and a bunch of others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a conclusion my intention is to have a game that\u0027s not a full simulation and leve a fair margin for the players mistakes and impatience\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But I think the game should stop you from doing mission profiles that are basically impossible. I\u0027m not talking about details like the number of stages or the overall amount of needed delta-v. I\u0027m talking about explosive staging woth srb\u0027s to mun land with tier-1 or air hogging with 2000 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
