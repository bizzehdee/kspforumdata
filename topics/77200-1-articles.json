Yes this aircraft only has 1 intake. It is powered by 1 Turbojet and 2 small Rockomax orange stack engines. It is very tight for fuel as in orbit for the first test flight it only has 460 m/s of Delta-V. There is a Mechjeb module on it, but I only have used it to keep the aircraft pointed at the node during the orbit insertion burn.
