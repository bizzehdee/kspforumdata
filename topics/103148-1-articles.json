Basically what you\u0027re gonna wanna do is slowly strip any form of power from normal users, and only allow them to post one font, color, and size of text. Then, what you\u0027re gonna wanna do is slowly make your rise to the top of the forum administration hierarchy. Next, declare yourself dictator, don\u0027t let anybody leave or delete their accounts, and change all of their names to a number. You may also wish to stage large actions against other forums, and possibly take them over as well. If you follow this, then you will invade may forums and create a great empire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, you could just ignore your duties and wait until after april fools, it\u0027s your choice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T16:07:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGod knows what would happen if everyone actually got mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027arial black\u0027;\u0022\u003ECOMIC SANS MOD/ADMIN SHIELD\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E============--===================================---------------============================\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T16:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMashed potatoes or ice cream?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T16:47:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIce Cream of course, the breakfast of champions and second through seventh place finishers alike(with the exception of fifth obviously, following the \u0027No dairy for those who finish fifth\u0027 clause established by the 1960 olympic medal council).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T16:50:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIce Cream of course, the breakfast of champions and second through seventh place finishers alike(with the exception of fifth obviously, following the \u0027No dairy for those who finish fifth\u0027 clause established by the 1960 olympic medal council).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key for moderating ice cream consumption is to use a bigger spoon so you take less scoops.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T16:52:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Comic Sans MS\u0027;\u0022\u003EModeration: OK, I can help here as I have a bit more experience than some of you newer moderators:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Comic Sans MS\u0027;\u0022\u003E1.
