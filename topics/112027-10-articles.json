This is so that the radiator mass is the same for a given quantity of heat rejection regardless of the type used.

There are many mods that operate in those spaces already, the most evident of them in reference to my own has always been KSPI. That is really not what I am here to do.

To keep structural design constraints around reactors from going out the window, I decided to work on a heat modeling and simulation backend that everyone could use. Squad came along with 1.0 and a base heat system that I went for instead, because it makes things a lot simpler for me to use their work. It was also about 90% of what I wanted with mine. I\u0027m not afraid of throwing 100s of lines of code out the window if something more elegant comes along. So we worked with that to develop HeatControl and its supporting balance, resulting in a new gameplay element. However... what was the original goal here? Radiators wherever the player wants. Now, we have 1.03/4 with what? Radiators wherever the player wants. This is, really, what I wanted all along. We should not struggle and fight over maybe 4 hours of model work on a few things that won\u0027t be as useful, and really HC doesn\u0027t have much code in it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, the thing that I will be doing is finding a way to move NFE and the HC radiators into using the stock modules.

A fork is a redistributed copy of an open source software project, not a modification to a not-redistributed piece of closed-source software. That would be called just that, a modification. Shorthand: \u0022mod\u0022. You can also use \u0022conversion\u0022 to underline the fact that it completely replaces a game mechanics system, or \u0022total conversion\u0022 if it goes as far as replacing the game experience in its entirety (like BTSM does), but never \u0022fork\u0022.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a perfectly reasonable use of the word, and it distinguishes between an add-on mod and one that fundamentally changes part of the game in a way that possibly makes it incompatible to other mods.

You will still be able to get HC separately, but it will just be parts. This may require some rejiggering of a few parameters in NFE and I\u0027ll need to think about how to reconcile the balance.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo be it! I hope, insulators will stay, they still look useful. On the other hand, conductors will fade away. Heat pipe... I do not know. Maybe it would be the way to partially localize heat management.
