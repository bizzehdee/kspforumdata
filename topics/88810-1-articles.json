And I always had fuel to spare at the end, especially once I had it updated to using a mainsail and ram intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T22:02:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eright, I built an even lighter version of Bill Zarr\u0027s SSTO plane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lMQ5rM9.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022lMQ5rM9.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etest flights show it can do a 100km orbit and come back on 36 funds. I made it in my career mode however and seeing as I am playing on permadeath I didn\u0027t want to risk a kerbal\u0027s life. A few sidenotes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-even though it only has two delta wings, this thing actually starts to suffer from infiniglide effects in low altitudes because it\u0027s so light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- it only has 1 radially attached ant engine just behind the cockpit glass. So yes, it does have an unaligned center of thrust, but the cockpit itself has enough torque to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a quick check showed that while ion engines are super efficient, xenon gas is pretty expensive. No way you can use it for a \u0022cheap as possible\u0022 challenge. So yeah, I really think 36-38 funds is the limit of what you can do in stock without exploits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.: It occurs to me now that I did equip it with a probe core, guess I might be able to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T02:16:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edown to 36 funds! awesome!
