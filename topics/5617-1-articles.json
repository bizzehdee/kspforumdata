It helps a lot. Also, try to equip your orbit stages with gimballing engines; you can turn off RCS while burning, thus saving a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, your ship will seem to spin as you go around Kerbin, because you\\\u0027re pointing at a certain heading. I\\\u0027m not quite sure how to explain it, but say that point is on the other side of Kerbin. Your ship will point at that point while it\\\u0027s orbiting Kerbin in a circle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
