It has the following features:\n\n- 3 different modes for spaceplanes, rockets, and EVA\n- Adjustable deadzones and nonlinear response curve\n- Uses keyboard emulation, allowing more than 20 buttons, and no need to bind the joystick buttons\n- Bindings for almost every button on the HOTAS\n\nSee the GitHub site for more information, including joystick layout cheat sheets. I encourage users to modify this script for different joysticks.\n\nDownload: [https://github.com/BManx2000/KSP-X-55-FreePIE-Script/releases](https://github.com/BManx2000/KSP-X-55-FreePIE-Script/releases)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/BManx2000/KSP-X-55-FreePIE-Script](https://github.com/BManx2000/KSP-X-55-FreePIE-Script)\n\nLicense: [https://github.com/BManx2000/KSP-X-55-FreePIE-Script/blob/master/LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/BManx2000/KSP-X-55-FreePIE-Script/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)"}]}
