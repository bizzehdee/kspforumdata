The rocket fueled adapters are translucent so that the simplified internal design may be viewed. The inner oxidizer tank is immersed within the outer fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince KSP doesn\u0027t yet reward the use of aerodynamic parts (adapters, caps), the drag on these parts has been reduced.

But, you know, KSP actually does reward the use of nosecones - is they\u0027re placed below the CoM, they will stabilize the rocket, but if placed above, they will destabilize it. So it depends on how high you put your boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Srilania","CreatedById":70829,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T19:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot quite true.

A flat rocket and a coned rocket, if both weigh the exact same, both swill fly upwards at the same rate. Sure, if you add more mass behind the center of mass, it\u0027ll fly more stable. But, it has nothing to do with the shapes. Just mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
