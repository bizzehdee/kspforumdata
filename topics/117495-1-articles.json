Well, first attempt post-1.0 anyway. I brought it down from 100km in a descent path that was probably about 20 degrees or so during the upper atmosphere and at a fairly dramatic AoA. Almost \u0022bounced\u0022 right back into space.

Of course, there was one time (Wish I had photos, too busy to hit F1) a poorly built space plane never came back up from the drop behind part. Luckily I had a \u0022glideslope\u0022 of such a steep descent, that I was on a perfect course to land on the mountain side. So I did, rolling down hill at 70 degrees pitched down. The slop gently leveled out in the plains. I\u0027ve tried to do it again.

Especially when you come down early with not much fuel. Put the airbrakes back down and pitch up. You slow down a lot but can still coast a lot farther due to the extra altitude."},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T04:04:44Z","Content":"Aims for KSC, land on the Korea shaped peninsula"},{"CreatedByName":"oversoul","CreatedById":66822,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T04:14:37Z","Content":"I\u0027ve landed short of KSC a few times, but tried to ditch anyway, and have the people parts survive. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n![lToGsJU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lToGsJU.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T06:46:54Z","Content":"I once was trying to land at Kerbin after a Minmus mission.
