And your craft will start to turn/pitch/yaw on its own? Well my crafts have decided to start doing this automatically. At first i thought I was accidentally holding in the alt button while flying. Only during this play-through I played very close attention to it and it just happened again! I think it usually occurs after I switch from one craft to another, or from the space center an back. It\u0027s hard to keep track of it since I almost always have SAS on, and so it\u0027s whenever i turn it off that my ships starts spinning and yawing out of nowhere. This is especially frustrating when i fly all the way to Duna, undock the lander, and the lander proceeds to spin off out of control for seemingly no god damn reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is easy to work around by just holding in Alt and \u0027correcting\u0027 it. But my corrections are never 100% accurate, and so the craft will always have a slight drift that is impossible to correct. And just now while trying to dock with a craft that had no SAS with one that did. The one without SAS kept \u0022drifting\u0022 ever so slightly. I had it pointing 100% north and it kept drifting, and in a matter of minutes was already 10 degrees off the \u0022north\u0022 marker, making it practically impossible to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have a solution for this? Or perhaps a button combo that resets the directional adjustments?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running Windows 64 bit, but I\u0027m not sure if Steam is smart enough to run the 64 bit version or the 32 bit version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T21:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming this is just trim, and that you are correcting it manually, do you know alt\u002Bx resets trim to zero on all axis ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
