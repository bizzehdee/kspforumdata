If you flip a docking port 180* by pressing w twice, you actually change up to down. If you instead flip it by pressing d twice, you match up directions with its mate. Watch the 3 outer handles on the Sr to observe the effect, when up is aligned the handles with match on both docking ports. If you built everything so the up directions line up, then you just need a slow accurate approach. Be sure to turn off SAS so nothing is fighting the magnets when you get with a few meters. If you have to detach and retry, be sure to get a good distance away and then redock so you don\u0027t confuse the docking ports. Finally, for accurate alignment of your center, your rotation, and port direction all at once I recommend a mod like Docking Port Alignment Indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one of those things that feels really great when you get it to work.
