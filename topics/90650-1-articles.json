However, when I start coming back into the atmosphere, I run into problems. BIG, explodey problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow many heat shields do I even NEED for it? From low kerbin orbit going down, I burn up, and the heatshield overheats, if I have a 1.25m heatshield on the 1 man pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this normal? Do I need more heatshields? If this isn\u0027t normal, how do I fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a feeling this isn\u0027t normal at all, or i\u0027m doing something terribly wrong.

It explodes about 6 seconds later, and after that, the capsule, too, overheats and explodes. Bob is gone, and so is Bill.
