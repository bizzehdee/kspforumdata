Some didn\u0027t make orbit, others made orbit but didn\u0027t have enough fuel to de-orbit and land again, I had to de-orbit one using RCS thrusters. I had one attempt with something larger but with way too many wings, it got to orbit and de-orbited but as I got into the lower atmo it became a leaf, floating this way and that, falling one second and then soaring upwards again. With too many wings and not enough weight it was impossible to fly, never mind land. Thankfully I can eject the command pod, so Jeb parachuted to safety. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI persisted with this folly, pausing periodically to restart KSP as it crashed, having occasional yells at my screen and eventually got something that could reliably make LKO and return safely. But what is the point? Getting a single Kerbal into orbit, well that can be done much more easily with a rocket. OK so the SSTO is reusable but I\u0027m not sure that it warrants the overhead in design. If I could make a SSTO that could do more than just take one kerbal to LKO then maybe we\u0027re onto something. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I made my SSTO a bit bigger and thankfully it didn\u0027t take too much more shouting at my screen to get something that can now reach Mun Orbit on a single stage, an SSTMO. This is the craft I came up with; It has about 1400 dV left once it\u0027s got into LKO. It\u0027s called \u0027the Answer\u0027 as it weights exactly 42tons before launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ENM3NDI\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ENM3NDIh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ENM3NDIh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the first mission I just returned to land at KSC to make sure I could still do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne aspect of this design is having 3 rather than 2 or 4 jet engines. Just before they flame out I can shut the outer two engines down and then keep the central one running longer. When it flames out its not a problem as it doesn\u0027t put the craft into a spin. That one engine combined with the two aero-spikes get it out of the upper atmo nicely and then the areo-spikes do the rest. Also when coming into land I drop down to just one engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ZCOJujz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZCOJujzl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZCOJujzl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/0DOTSUE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0DOTSUEm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220DOTSUEm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Vbg1uT5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Vbg1uT5m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Vbg1uT5m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen on the second mission I transferred to Mun;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/9a7PySv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9a7PySvh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229a7PySvh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut it doesn\u0027t have enough dV left to de-orbit and land or to return home from Mun orbit, I\u0027ll need to refuel it for that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s still not as useful as I\u0027d really like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it now is over powered for just the task of reaching LKO, I wondered if maybe it could be used to transport small payloads up to LKO.

Perhaps Jeb now smiles because he trusts his ejector seat system, now a feature of all my planes, and although plane and payload were lost, Jeb parachuted to safety in his pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Bmgqrv5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Bmgqrv5l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Bmgqrv5l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s taken me a couple weeks to develop this craft, but contrast it took me less than 10 minutes to throw together a 2 stage rocket that could take 2 of the same satellites up to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m now trying to make an SSTO which can actually take a payload up to orbit, or bring something back down.
