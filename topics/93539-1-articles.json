I have two ships in orbit ready to go to Duna, but I figured it might be wise to refuel them first. I sent a first fueler, docked it to ship I and transferred the fuel - this went fine, I know how to dock and all. The second fuel ship, however, I just couldn\u0027t control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen in docking mode, the RCS works but the controls seem to think I\u0027m still in Stage mode. Shift and Ctrl are up and down, but ASDW do the exact same thing as in Stage mode: rotating the ship, making it impossible to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried five times, each time with the exact same ship. The 1st and 4th time it worked normally, but the 2nd, 3rd and 5th time the RCS went nuts. I have a version of Kerbal Engineering that is fully updated. It doesn\u0027t seem to be the cause of the problem, since it works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp is much appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Amfi\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T16:01:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Amfibrachys and welcome to the KSP forums \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn docking mode you have two control sub-modes, rotation and linear, these are switched using the space bar, it sounds like you are in rotation mode, so try pressing space to change to linear, you should then find that you can move the craft vertically and horizontally without rotating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may need to have SAS enabled to help hold you steady as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amfibrachys","CreatedById":132414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T16:05:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the welcome and your quick reply sal_vager. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems I keep learning about this game every day, I never heard of the linear and rotating mode.
