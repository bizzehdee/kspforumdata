But my Mun-Kerbin return trajectory always result in a very high orbit around Kerbin (peri-ker around 7-9000 km and apo-ker just outside of Mun orbit) when I exit Mun SOI and reverts back to Kerbin as orbital reference. This means I have to do another big burn in order to lower my peri-ker. How should I change my trans-kerbin burn so that I will end up somewhere closer to Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aiyel","CreatedById":1201,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-14T17:08:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhen you take off from the mun, (assuming you\\\u0027re pretty close to the equator burn at 270 degrees until you\\\u0027ve got a stable munar orbit. Begin your TKI burn when you\\\u0027re about 45 degrees into the far side, as measured using the Mun\\\u0027s orbital path.
