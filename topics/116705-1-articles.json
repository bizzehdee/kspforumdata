They\u0027re live status indicators, that will gray out again if you stop meeting the condition. For example, suppose you have a contract that says \u0022Be in orbit around the Mun\u0022 and also some other condition.

Suppose the contract is to \u0022launch a new station on a solar orbit.\u0022 You build your station, and it satisfies all the conditions (have a docking port, etc.) except \u0022be in orbit around the Sun\u0022 since you haven\u0027t gotten that far yet. You launch it on an escape trajectory from Kerbin, and then you go off to work with other ships. The contract won\u0027t automatically get fulfilled when the ship leaves Kerbin\u0027s SoI, since you\u0027re not currently controlling it.

Each click of launch button will increment launchID, and the newly launched vessel has all parts associated with that ID. When you accept a contract, it also records the current launchID. This way the game can track whether it\u0027s newly launched (relative to contract acceptance) or not. Docking makes this matter more complex, but seems not scope of discussion here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also explains the Ore situation as Ore is just a resource and there\u0027s no launchID for it, so game has no way to rigorously check whether it\u0027s the same ore or not.
