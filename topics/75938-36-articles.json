What I\u0027ve started doing most recently is diving into the .mu files to see if all the textures being included with the model are really being referenced in the model or the config. In your mod specifically I have identified some extra textures that we can safely prune. Next on my list is to try and set up MODEL nodes for these things so that we can have a common texture folder and not have to have so many duplicates of the same textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, I\u0027ve discovered the following textures which can be safely removed due to them not being used in the models \u003Cem\u003Eor\u003C/em\u003E configurations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(Note: my observations are based on the Github package, not the released alpha tests.)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn \u0022AlphaRBIInvertingTrack\u0022 you can safely remove \u0022model003_NRM\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn \u0022AlphaRepulsor\u0022 you can safely remove \u0022accordion-tex\u0022 unless you want to sue it to replace the used texture called \u0022accordion-tex 2\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn \u0022RepulsorWheel\u0022 you can safely remove the following: \u0022CF\u002BA\u0022 , \u0022RepWheel-diffuse\u0022 , \u0022RubberLoGrav\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn \u0022RoverBody\u0022 you can safely remove \u0022CF\u002BA\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you\u0027re an optimization freak like I am, go ahead and trim the usage a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thinking is to have the normal steering return to centre and the lateral mode as-is, probably with an action group/gui menu thing to return to centre. What you see is mathematics straight from excel, syntax converted. I didn\u0027t get it quite right, though I know what I need to do now and the rest is detail. They\u0027re currently still using the stock modules, as are the repulsor wheels, which I have yet to do configs for with the custom plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can give me some config pointers for texture sharing, I\u0027d be much obliged. Like many things, it\u0027s something I\u0027ve not even had time to look at! Regarding the performance issues, I\u0027ve been doing my best to keep the update loops as free and simple as possible. There is some complicated stuff going on, though, so there\u0027s a limit to what I can optimise. Getting some texture sharing going on would be really good, though. Make you realise how much work there needs to be done to put out a fully fledged mod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOff on holidays now, I fly out in the morning. Happy testing, I\u0027ll check in at odd points over the next couple of weeks.

A lightweight folding wheel is also trying to fight its way out of my head and into KSP, along with some dedicated rover body designs.
