If your takeoff altitude is different than your landing altitude, use the higher of the two. So in the same example if you land at 4,600 but take off at 4,610, your score is only 3,390.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHints:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

This is because the thrusters are perpendicular to each other and consequently are wasting some thrust pointing in inefficient directions. Only use one EVA thruster at a time, and make sure it\u0027s darn near perfectly prograde all the time for maximum efficiency.
