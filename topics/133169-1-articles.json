Considering Elon himself hasn\u0027t picked it up to work on, I\u0027d exclude that. SolarCity is a goner, so that leaves only stuff Elon has done with Tesla and SpaceX that are fundementally innovative, which is not much. Automatic Cars are being pursuited everywhere in the car industry. Electric Cars are age-old. Vertical Landings on Earth were accomplished back in the DC-X\u00A0days, (though not on the scale of F9, an evolution of the DC-X landings is not innovative). Only the deep-cryo Lox is really innovative, and that really seems to be backfiring on SpaceX.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222438596\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133169\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456945710\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n34 minutes ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey could produce 3 g of antimatter per year and sell it, getting more money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNah, I doubt people need that much antimatter to study.
