Regardless if you want to use it in a vacuum, it does still come with the drag penalty getting it INTO space, or mandates the use of an aeroshell which is extra mass, cost, etc. No matter which way you cut it, the engine is objectively worse than it was prior to 1.0. Therefore, it deserves a little buff to compensate.\n\nEither buff the engine\u0027s isp slightly to make it a wee bit better and to \u0027balance\u0027 the extra drag, or reduce the drag it\u0027s causing and leave the engine otherwise alone. I would lean towards the latter, since the drag arrows are so damn big it looks like it\u0027s treating it as any other unaerodynamic radially-attached part.\n\nAnd give it a new model and attachement properties already, sheesh. You \\*have\\* to use the offset tool to make it not look awful.\n\n**EDIT:** I decided to do a little test. The drag they produce isn\u0027t nearly as much as a radially-attached uncovered \u0027flat top\u0027 1.25m tank, but it IS more draggy than a covered nosecone\u0027d 1.25m tank. Considering its much smaller size and seemingly more aerodynamic profile (not to mention hugging the side of the rocket, which I have no reason to assume helps, but I assume it does), it should be LESS draggy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T04:37:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 04:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Frostiken**"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T04:32:21Z","Content":"In 1.0\u002B they\u0027re clearly modeled as verniers, to be used on lower stages to increase control authority, and in particular when you have only one main engine on the stage and want some roll authority (ignoring magicTorque from pods/cores/etc).
