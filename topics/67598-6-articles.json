Assigning arbitrary values to a system always makes the system seem arbitrary and inconsistent because, well, it\u0027s arbitrary. Thusly, arguing that arbitrary values feel arbitrary - then arguing about by how many degrees it feels arbitrary - doesn\u0027t strike me as particularly constructive. Then again, maybe it is, and I\u0027m just not enlightened enough to see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, arguing over a system that exists in its own discrete reality by comparing it to real world values and systems (of which KSP functions as a poor - but fun - facsimile thereof) is also not particularly constructive. To correct that, Squad would have to create a particularly complex formula to determine mass, thrust, and fuel consumption that mimics real world rocket science, which I suspect is beyond the amount of time and effort they want to invest in \u0022balancing\u0022 engines. Thus we have the ubiquitous \u0022power creep\u0022 that comes in because game designers want a \u0022feel\u0022 rather than actually having to engineer a system so that current and future parts are consistent with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, we can\u0027t have engines have \u0022roles\u0022 because ISP is done wrong - it is used as a weird form of SFC (specific fuel consumption) mostly because it is easier for us non-rocket scientist types to figure out how to adjust the design so it can go farther. If ISP were to be done properly, it would be fixed so THRUST changes with atmospheric pressure, not SFC (and yes, both would change with throttle setting). Not only that, but ISP would be a curve, because an engine\u0027s peak ISP is determined by its nozzle shape (which, of course, KSP does backwards:huh:) which is optimized for a certain altitude... and now we know why aerospikes were invented!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it sits now with ISP acting as SFC - and since the goal of any engine is to go up - all engines get better as they race to vacuum where they operate the best. It is why we never really pay attention to atm ISP value of engines and focus exclusively on vacuum ISP figures, because atm ISP numbers get to vacuum ISP numbers real quick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if Squad changed ISP to affect thrust and put it on a curve so that some engines had decent ISP (thrust) at sea level, high ISP (thrust) at medium to high altitude, and low ISP at vacuum; and others were optimized for vacuum and simply produced less thrust in atmosphere, and so on; we would actually have engines that had roles and would only be good at their specific job (except aerospikes, which are always good at all jobs, though why no thrust vectoring Harv? Why?)... but BUT! we would pay for that by making it a little bit harder to overcome that barrier to getting things into orbit, and I think making thrust variable due to altitude would possibly make a lot of players mad enough to fill the suggestions forum with \u0022Mak ISP be lik old SIP or I kwit forevar!!1!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in closing, I humbly and respectfully plead that the discussion shift to solutions and other constructive goodness so that we may hopefully affect positive changes to the game, and leave the negativity to the electrons! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-06T09:34:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2014 09:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Scoundrel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T17:07:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Error\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Error\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was just trying to point out almost anybody can completely and totally unbalance a part on a whim, so trying to enforce \u0022balance\u0022 in the game doesn\u0027t really accomplish that much.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simulation first, a game second.

The game very rarely, if ever, adds changes for cost/point/mechanical balance reasons. Only time, such as the mass/size of planets, the ion engine power/efficiency etc. Most other balances will be done on cost/availability of parts, not on their mechanical function. Why? The sim part requires some parts TO be more powerful, just as in real life new tech IS better than the old.

This, I believe, is because Squad is moving to a more realistic air resistance model in the near future, just as they have recently improved the joints. Squad is pushing for more realistic rockets, and asparagus rockets are simply not viable in the real world, so they made new rockets. In fact, in order to create a more efficient rocket in teams of delta-V per ton than the large new engine with the largest tank attached, you just need to make an orange tank, one mailsail at the bottom of that, and attach two Rockomax X200-32 Fuel Tanks with mainsails to the sides, feeding their fuel into the orange tank. This weighs almost exactly the same, and has a larger amount of delta-V. So you see, the new engines are absolutely not overpowered for what they are intended for, they are just not supposed to be larger versions of the old engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my other views on this matter, ill be brief:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The game should be balanced for career, so cost is also going to be a balancing issue when that is implemented. Until then there really isn\u0027t a reason to nerf the engines, especially not this close to the implementation of money. Saying the game should be balanced for sandbox is like saying that League of Legends should be balanced for coop-vs-ai.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Yes, they should move it further back on the tech tree, and I assume they will soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Research should provide better parts, just like how research in CIV provides better soldiers. Research providing larger but other wise identical parts is ridiculous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You will still need the same skills, except for asparagus building skills.
