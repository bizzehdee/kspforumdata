You can counteract it by rotating the engines, I used a pair of 24-77 aimed just right to counter act the rotation it caused.

While your center of thrust doesn\u0027t look too offset, it can still be ever so slightly offset. Even a slightly offset center of thrust can cause your vessel to spin. This is where RCS Build Aid comes in. It tells you how much torque your engines (and of course, your RCS thrusters) are inducing. Also, the distance between the CoT from the CoM does not effect torque; What is important is whether the direction of thrust is offset from the CoM. Think of the direction of thrust as a line that passes through the CoT. If this line does not intercept the CoM, then you will have rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T19:24:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHum, do you have massless parts in that design ( can\u0027t really tell from the pics ) ?
