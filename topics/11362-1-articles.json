I put up an interest poll in my school\\\u0027s science building and sent out an email to all the classes about it, and have some interest (Right now, I have 6 people who have said they\\\u0027re interested, not including myself, as well as two teachers who could act as moderators for the group), and I\\\u0027m pretty confident that by the time the gym gets opened up next year for the clubs to present themselves I\\\u0027ll be able to get more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the biggest hurdle is not interest levels, but plans for the club. Right now, I would bring in both of my telescopes, one solar one and another normal one, to be used for Sun viewing and stargazing (The former of which could occur just after school, the latter is up in the air right now, since weekends may be occupied with other activities and other days would be school nights), and I would try to set up viewing sessions for special events. The events could include meteor showers, which could be planned in advance, and with the coming of the solar maximum in 2013, I could also try to send out alerts for possible auroras in the case of a strong flare. Of course, in addition to all this, things that are being seen would be explained, and any questions answered along the way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut other than this, I can\\\u0027t think of anything, and I\\\u0027m not comfortable with this list of stuff, since after a while it could become stale. I don\\\u0027t think it has enough variety, and is too focused on viewings and stuff. Well, maybe there is one other possibility, which would be amateur rocketry, but I\\\u0027m not so sure about that due to expenses (It IS a club, and so usually it wouldn\\\u0027t require any sort of money on a regular basis, plus rockets are difficult to build in real life). And I\\\u0027m not so sure about the safety of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, any ideas? I\\\u0027m not on any particular schedule with ideas yet, since this would start NEXT year (all I have to do in the next few days is make sure it has enough potential interest, which I think it does), but this would really be my first leadership role, and I don\\\u0027t want to make the universe seem boring (since it most certainly isn\\\u0027t), so I want to make sure it goes smoothly. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abrexus","CreatedById":24715,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T18:35:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest starting out with programs such as \u003Ca href=\u0022http://en.spaceengine.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.spaceengine.org/\u003C/a\u003E to allow you to take people on a guided tour of our solar system and galaxy, then follow that up with a real life look via telescope!
