For the moment, I\u0027m going to run a Kerbalized mission series. I have chosen to use Open Broadcaster Software as my video recording device. However, I have no idea how to start recording anything besides sound and a black screen. It says I need to add a global source to it, but everytime I attempt to do so, it never shows up in the white sources box, what am I doing wrong here?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs said above...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gmpd2000","CreatedById":37101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T13:50:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027m wrong, but OBS records for livestreams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want, Bandicam is easier to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9Or fraps, they\u0027re almost the same.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T14:03:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike those, OBS is free and yes, it does record on your storage medium. I\u0027ve used it and it\u0027s a decent program when you figure out how to do it.
