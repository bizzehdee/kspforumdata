It asked me to do a few other missions first. Then BAM! Make a Mun orbital base then BAM! Make a minmus orbital base. Uhhh what happened to kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhy did it feel like 0.9 had far better mission progression? Is this a simple bug?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonly mod I have is kerbal engineer redux for the in flight information. That\u0027s it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont even have the science progression to build big enough rockets to put a station in minmus orbit yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions? Thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T07:41:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbin orbital base missions should be random draws right about the time you get the ones for mun and minmus.

I always click accept. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t know that the kerbin orbital missions would start at the same time as Mun and minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat seems very strange considering kerbin orbit is much easier to get to compared to the Mun or minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder why why it\u0027s setup that way. Doesn\u0027t make sense to me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T07:49:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no penalty to declining before you accept, and its good in this kind of situation where you know you want the kerbin version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T09:39:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EContracts don\u0027t come in any specific order. They are procedurally generated by the game, based on what it believes you are capable of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get station building contracts, you need to unlock certain parts in the tech tree. Once those parts are available, the game starts generating station building contracts, because it knows you are now capable of actually fulfilling them. Without those parts, you will not see a single one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor each such contract, the game selects a location it thinks you are capable of reaching. In other words: if you entered the Mun\u0027s SoI at least once, the game considers you capable of sending things to the Mun, and also to Minmus, which can be reached by the exact same ship. Because of the position of the required parts in the tech tree, you are more or less guaranteed to already have visited the Mun (at minimum) by the time you unlock station contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the most part, the game will randomize a destination out of those it thinks you are capable of reaching; however, that randomization is weighted depending on your reputation. If your reputation is fairly high, then that means the contracts will be weighted towards the more challenging, better paying end. It may even decide to give you a contract for a location you have not visited yet but which is considered a \u0022next logical step\u0022 destination (such as a contract for Duna when you can comfortably handle both Mun and Minmus). Similarly, if you have a low reputation because your space program is in trouble, it will generate contracts for you that may not pay as well but are easy to fulfill, so you can pull yourself together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, even though Kerbin orbit is a viable choice for the contract generator, you\u0027re more likely to see Mun and Minmus (or even Duna) pop up if you are doing well, because the game seeks to challenge you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
