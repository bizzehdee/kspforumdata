Did you actually read anything I wrote before? I\u0027m talking about use of beamed power for Thermal Rocketry- which is perfectly \u0022decent\u0022 in terms of ISP (better than chemical rockets). Apparently you\u0027ve grown accustomed/spoiled from using some of the more OP\u0027d features of KSP-Interstellar. My whole entire point was that those features should be expensive, but earlier technologies like Microwave Beamed Power Thermal Rocketry, in particular, should NOT cost tens or hundreds of thousands of Funds just for the parts on the actual rockets (as opposed to the reactors and transmission-facilities, which SHOULD be expensive...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T00:56:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bonesbro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bonesbro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere are a lot of \u0022quality of life\u0022 issues fixed - much better tooltips, automatic throttling of received power to keep from incinerating little probes, a few bug fixes, etc. He\u0027s also balancing (increasing) part costs now that 0.24 is out and the costs suddenly matter.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe you mean *breaking* the mod with incredibly excessive and over-inflated part costs (25,000 Funds for a simple, dumb, low-temperature, no-magnet metal exhaust cone on a 1.25 meter beamed-power thermal rocket).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you read any of the discussion I had earlier about the current costs for Microwave Beamed Power Thermal Rocketry (which should actually be CHEAPER than chemical rockets in terms of the parts you actually launch for balance- as the whole point of Microwave Beamed Power is to leave the heavy/expensive parts behind- and to correspond to reality- at the cost of incredibly expensive reactors and transmitters that actually generate the power- which I assume most players will run from the ground now that 0.24 makes launches so expensive...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T01:20:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eexperimental build should be working for v0.24.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I haven\u0027t done so in a while, here is a list of updates versus the official version by fractal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EVersion Experimental -  for ksp v0.24.2\u003Cbr\u003E- Fixed data collection on magnetometer.\u003Cbr\u003E- Added more details to generator, reactor and radiator modules.\u003Cbr\u003E- Added atmospheric intake functionality to atmospheric scoops.\u003Cbr\u003E- Charging is now disabled by default on the alcubierre drives.\u003Cbr\u003E- Added 1000 EC to computer core, and increased torque to 5/5/5.\u003Cbr\u003E- Added a more detailed tooltip description for the computer core.\u003Cbr\u003E- Added details about power transmission to array and reciever to tooltip descriptions.\u003Cbr\u003E- Added details about generator attachment and modes to tooltip descriptions.\u003Cbr\u003E- Added detail to the GC/MS tooltip to indicate that it is also a science experiment.\u003Cbr\u003E- Added details to the GRS description to indicate that it is useful for detecting concentrations of uranium and thorium.\u003Cbr\u003E- Added a more detailed description of the science labs capabilities.\u003Cbr\u003E- Added a clarification of the crygenic helium tank, and its use with the IR telescope.\u003Cbr\u003E- Added details about the magnetometer is also a science experiment\tto the tooltip desciption.\u003Cbr\u003E- Added details to the helium-3 container to clarify that it does not store helium, and is used as a reator fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E- Added tooltip to antimatter containers to indicate maximum capacity.\u003Cbr\u003E- The UN tank now uses the correct model.\u003Cbr\u003E- Charging is now disabled by default for antimatter containers.\u003Cbr\u003E- Microwave recievers will now attempt to throttle reception to equal demand.
