But...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I fly a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me explain:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have FAR installed, and i\u0027v build a nice plane, that will be balanced, and that will take off without falling apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have so far never been able to get back to the runway. My planes just won\u0027t manoeuvre. Stock planes as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t seem to make turns. At least not in a controlled matter. I\u0027m used to planes to start turning when you bank them. However, here when you bank a plane, it will just keep straight, starting to lose height beause of the reduced lift. In order to realy turn I need to bank to 90 degrees and pull up. That\u0027s not really realistic, and hard to align your plane with something. Basically I have no control whatsoever over the bearing of my plane. Getting to altitude is fine. And this both with planes I design, as with stock planes, or the planes that came with the B9 pack. And I\u0027ve also tried without FAR. Same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, flying is a big fail for me at the moment. A pity, as I really would like to do more with spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOt am I overlooking something blindingly obvious?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"relin","CreatedById":89684,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T09:20:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven in real life, simply rolling the craft doesn\u0027t cause it to turn very much. You need to combine some roll with some pitch to make it happen (and you already touched on the method): roll it part-way, and then pull up to keep your elevation steady. Optimally, you\u0027d also add a bit of rudder to keep the craft pointing where you\u0027d like, but that\u0027s a bit tricky to handle without a joystick or some practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you\u0027re trying to turn left. First, use \u0027a\u0027 to roll your craft a bit to the left, then use \u0027s\u0027 to pull the craft through the turn. If you wanna perfect the motion, use \u0027e\u0027 to yaw the craft back toward the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T09:21:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend a Spade over a hoe, much more aerodynamic =\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T13:53:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know about FAR, but stock wings are all symmetric airfoils (no camber). Symmetric airfoils need AoA to generate lift. I\u0027m not sure if KSP is actually modeling all this in bank, or if it\u0027s just coincedental.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, when you fly a symmetric airfoil craft (such as a T-38, F-15, F-16, etc) you do indeed have to pull back on the stick after you roll into bank. Otherwise the nose just drops because of the lift loss. (Swept wings do other wacky stuff too, but that\u0027s a whole separate topic.) When you want to stop turning, you have to stop pulling then roll out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works the same way for cambered wing aircraft too, except that you can get some turn without having to pull back. If you don\u0027t pull back, the nose will still want to drop some. If you do pull back, you will turn faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh, I forgot. Also, even if you do design a craft that is capable of turning on it\u0027s own in bank (which is possible in stock), if the SAS is on, it isn\u0027t going to turn anyway. So this could also be what you\u0027re running into. SAS is trying to hold a set attitude, so normal aerodynamic behavior of the aircraft sometimes gets nullified. Like rolling into bank, often your nose will stay up (or only drop slightly) but your prograde marker will sink. Realize this one example assumes you have enough yaw control authority to actually hold the nose up in a bank.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-08T14:26:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2014 02:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
