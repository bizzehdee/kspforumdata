powered \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E engines, you\u0027re inhibited by the fact that their always going to be heavy.\u00A0 Without invoking super-science and fusion, you need large chunks if fissionable materials, plus even more mass in shielding, and then the only real advantage in atmospheric flight is longevity.\u00A0 For any sort of system using air as the propellant (fans, ramjets, scramjets, etc) you\u0027re going to be stuck in the atmosphere, and fairly low in it.\u00A0 So what you end up with is a radioactive craft that can stay aloft at speed for a long long time, but can\u0027t go higher without both losing thrust, and losing cooling, with resultant explosions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you take your propellant with you, then you can get really good ISPs out of NTPropulsion, but you get crappy \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, which leads to really huge gravity loses getting up into orbit.\u00A0 And that cancels out the usefulness.\u00A0 Again, the mass required for fission fuel and shielding is going to kill the plan.\u00A0 Lightbulbs are probably the closest to viable for ground launch, but they\u0027re not what I\u0027d call based on proven engineering.\u00A0 Most of the concepts are sorted, but there\u0027s serious concerns for various parts of the fissionable gas containment.\u00A0 Similar concerns surround open cycle gas core as well, but seem a bit less insurmountable, but no-one in their right mind would start one of those up in an atmosphere (hell, they should be banned if they\u0027re even close to one, IMHO).\u00A0 And that leaves things like the pebble bed as the best of the bunch, and when you have TWRs that low, you burn through a lot more propellant getting out of the atmosphere and into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is a lot easier.\u00A0 There\u0027s so little delta V required for orbit compared to Earth.\u00A0 But NTRs will still have the same issues.\u00A0 Using something other than LH2 for a propellant in NTRs lowers their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and raises their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, and that\u0027s close to what we see in KSP\u0027s NTRs.\u00A0 But they only function for atmospheric flight because Kerbin is so small.\u00A0 NTRs will always be for orbital and deep space use in my opinion.\u00A0 They don\u0027t care what you feed them, but obviously there\u0027s limits.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, on to \u0022why aren\u0027t there Oxidizer slurping NTRs?\u0022.\u00A0 Realistically, you add NTRs to get better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E than chemical rockets.\u00A0 That comes at a price in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 And for maneuvering after you\u0027d got out of your gravity well, that\u0027s just fine.\u00A0 A more extreme version of this trade off is the electrical drives, ion, plasma, etc.\u00A0 Stuff all thrust, but truly awesome \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Now, to maximize \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E in an NTR you use LH2.\u00A0 There\u0027s just nothing that comes close to the low molecular mass.\u00A0 And there\u0027s a chunk of your propellant that will dissociate at the high temperatures and result in some of your exhaust products being atomic hydrogen, half the mass again.\u00A0 Mysterious liquid fuel could be anything, but assuming it\u0027s analogous to RP-1 aka refined kerosene, then it\u0027s molecular mass is much higher (and variable).\u00A0 Again, some of it would break down and do strange chemical things during it\u0027s passing through a hot reactor core.\u00A0 But, the end result is lower exhaust velocity (a given temp is a fixed amount of energy per molecule, so larger molecules are moving slower for the same temp).\u00A0 This becomes a trade off, higher thrust (same energy, but now it\u0027s in higher mass, slower molecules, which results in higher momentum) but uses more mass, aka lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 But, by choosing NTRs, we already decided \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E was what we wanted.\u00A0 So, anything other than LH2 is a secondary choice.\u00A0 Now, the other issue is the effects each propellant has.\u00A0 Carbon chains can cause coking.\u00A0 When something like kerosene is heated really hot, it starts to break down, and the result is a mixed bag, but some of it will be carbon-carbon bonding, resulting in solids.\u00A0 Considering graphite is a fairly common material in nuclear reactors, this is only likely to cause trouble if it starts blocking flows.\u00A0 S, you probably can run NTRs on RP-1.\u00A0 Even better would be methane, which doesn\u0027t tend to coke things, being just a single carbon with hydrogen.\u00A0 Being the lightest hydrocarbon, it\u0027s also the preferred one for NTRs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here comes the problem with Oxidizers.\u00A0 They oxidize.\u00A0 At high temperatures, they oxidize a lot.\u00A0 If you run liquid oxygen through a high temperature reactor core, the metal, including the fissionable fuel, and the carbon moderators, will start burning.\u00A0 There are some metals that are immune (up to a point) for a while, but you\u0027d need to make a lot of the systems out of this.\u00A0 If you read up on the Russian/Soviet full flow rocket cycles, and how the Americans didn\u0027t believe it for a long time, you get a hint of the sort of thing I\u0027m talking about.\u00A0 But pushing oxidizer through an NTR would be worse.\u00A0 It wouldn\u0027t be one pre-burner, one turbine, and then on to a balanced combustion chamber.\u00A0 It would be everything.\u00A0 And it\u0027s not like you can use exotic stainless as a fission fuel.\u00A0 And, the whole thing needs to deal with neutron embrittlement, high temperatures, and retain it\u0027s strength.\u00A0 I doubt there\u0027s any material known that covers off all the requirements for some sections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, it is KSP.\u00A0
