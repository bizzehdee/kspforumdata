The throttle on that controller has a notch on the 50% point, meaning the output from the controller is -1 if fully backwards and 1 if fully forwards, meant to be used as an easy reverse. Now, my problem is that when I map Axis 2 (the throttle on the controller) to throttle ingame with the Advanced FlyByWire mod, it only uses one half of the throttle, and if the input is not inverted, pulling the throttle fully backwards makes the ingame throttle go to 100% and centering it mkes it go to zero. Obviously I want to use the full range of the throttle, as I have no use for reverse throttle in KSP, and it isn\u0027t even supported. So, how could I make use of the full range of the throttle?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-06T14:02:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2023 02:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Crazy Inventor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
