It has always been a fairly minor annoyance, though, because for practical purposes I can generally just rely on the altimeter, and when the only interesting thing you can do to the water is \u0022drop straight down on a parachute and go plunk\u0022, the exact moment of contact isn\u0027t all that important (unless you have a ship that\u0027s falling just a wee bit too fast on chutes and needs a bit of engine thrust at the last minute to slow down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, now that they\u0027ve made the ocean into an actually interesting place, it\u0027s much more of an issue.
