Scaling of the root part is not recommended because it will trigger a bug in KSP aud cause bad things. Other than that, there is no known problem with scaling of mass and attachment positions. Part clipping or models reverting scale are usually just visual bugs, so they should not interfere with physics. What you describe sounds like it comes either from a scaled root part or from a problem with your install.

Then I\u0027ll take a few days for discussing feedback and deciding on the new scaling behavior. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main point where I need more feedback is mass/thrust of engines. My understanding is that 2 would be a physically reasonable exponent for thrust, and lead to engines that are useful in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old setting is exponent 2.5 for both, probably because my predecessor wanted to avoid part-specific mass exponents. Going as low as 2.5 already messes up the mass fraction of fuel tanks enough. So my guess is that the mass exponent was chosen as a compromise and the thrust exponent was chosen to preserve TWR. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment the dev version uses exponent 2 for engine thrust and weight.

This is the old setting, which I kept for boosters (i.e. engines with a tank attached). So when a booster is scaled, the twr scales with exponent -0.5, and the burn time with \u002B0.5.

This is both realistic and encourages people to use natively bigger engines at some point and not just a 48-7s scaled up for almost everything. The range of scaling down should be limited though as engines will get ridiculously high TWR as they scale down.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf an upscaled engine is strictly worse than several regular ones, why would you ever want to use it instead of plastering the rocket with small engines? If you want to forbid one direction and nerf the other to death, it would be a better choice to just not provide engine scaling (which is a perfectly fine way of playing and can be done with a single MM patch). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy opinion is the larger parts could have some slight advantage, so it makes sense to use the largest part that will do the job.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Verios44","CreatedById":125676,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T21:28:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edoes tweakscale work on KSP 1.0 or does it need a update?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T21:38:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Verios44\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Verios44\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edoes tweakscale work on KSP 1.0 or does it need a update?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt needs a recompile, and an official update of the dependency KspApiExtensions.
