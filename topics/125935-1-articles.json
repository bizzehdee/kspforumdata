The hotter it gets, the further along the emissive animation will progress. Before 1.0.5 the animation would begin to display around 500-700 degrees, depending how you had the emissive set up. Now even with the animation beginning at 15 seconds, it doesn\u0026#39;t seem to display until around 1000 degrees. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFXModuleAnimateThrottle is tied to the throttle output of the engine. The higher the throttle, the faster the emissive reaches it\u0026#39;s maximum.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T13:54:22Z","Content":"\nIt works mostly the same.
