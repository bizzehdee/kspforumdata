One thing is,, you could actually SEE the difference for sure, between a simulated model rocket and a simulated full-size orbital rocket, and since you can SEE real model rockets fairly easily, and most people have, and since you can then also SEE videos of full size orbital rockets,,, more than ever before, it might help you develop your \u0022mental picture\u0022 overall.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso, a lot of people might not be particularly inspired to try modelling an orbital rocket in KSP, because it\u0027s a things that\u0027s so far away from them, while there MIGHT be a lot of people who have had a bunch of model rocket experiences, and it might be just the thing that makes them want to play with it. Also, ,,, exactly what you say about the complexity. Although it\u0027s pretty cool to put together all of those parts,,, a model rocket is only like 1 part. so, you could much more quickly see all the parts of the game,,,, when I first played with KSP,,, it was very confusing. I didn\u0027t know how to exit from the different screens, I didn\u0027t understand how to interact with all of the buttons, I couldn\u0027t even play the game. it would have been nice to have a more gentle introduction,,, it\u0027s better for me to play with new games for only a few minutes at a time until I\u0027m actually pretty familiar. Otherwise, I had to wait for a pretty special day where i could take my time and figure everything out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still can\u0027t even play the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-10T07:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah KSP could use better tutorials, as it is it does pretty much throw you in the deep end of the pool. \u0022Here, get to orbit, have fun!

Plus one of the procedural wings forks or tweakscale for tiny fins and other bits and bobs. Normally use this for custom aircraft missiles but that\u0027s basically a model rocket anyway.
