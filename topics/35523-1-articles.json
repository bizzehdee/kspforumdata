I have the liquid fuel rocket (mk-6XL parachute, RC-001S Remote Guidance Unit, z-500 battery, FL-T400 fuel tank and an LV-T30 engine) and the mission is to lit-off and head eastward but, and here comes the problem, when I try to make a lateral movement (or above 5km) the rocket begin to spin around and it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s out of control.
