Yes, it was hard and grindy, but after some time I reached a point where I had lots of money and science and I felt like in sandbox mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I started a new hard career on 1.1.1 and it feels... well, just grindy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI complete contract after contract and cannot even think of upgrading VAB or unlock Poodle engine and big tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 1.0.2 I managed to unlock everything I need for munshot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my current game, I feel the only way to get poodle for munshot is by getting a poodle-test-contract. Otherwise, I have no idea where to get 180 science for poodle and big tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid they change the multipliers for hard career?\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhats your opinion on this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mk1980","CreatedById":163203,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T11:16:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni also started a new 1.1. career with hard settings (except for the no reverts/reloads - that would make it too frustrating for me)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni didn\u0027t have much problems with the early career. frankly, i think you may be overengineering your stuff. you certainly don\u0027t need poodles for a mun shot. i landed on both moons with just the 45 research point nodes unlocked, so it\u0027s definitely doable. once you\u0027ve done 1-2 landings you\u0027ll also be able to unlock stuff like the OKTO probe core so you can send a scientist to minmus and grab multiple biomes in one go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfrom there, funds are the main bottleneck in my experience. the settings are relatively harsh. especially the double cost for facility upgrades coupled with the reduced contract rewards. takes a lot of effort to get enough cash for a fully upgraded KSC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe final upgrade of the R\u0026amp;D is currently the \u0022paywall\u0022 i\u0027m working on. 3,4 million funds is a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsatellite contracts are probably among the most economic ways to make money. 50-80k reward for a satellite that costs maybe 5k baseline (\u002Bwhatever the cost of the required science sensors is) is quite good. tourist missions are a bit harder to make profitable. i developed a small tourist shuttle that can get 4 dudes to the minmus or mun for about ~15k per launch. that works all right, leaves a bit of profit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso, station/outpost contracts can be quite lucrative. you get something like 180k funds for (basically) landing/orbiting a 3 ton vessel (if you use the 2 seats passenger cabins), so that\u0027s also a convenient way to get money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit feels a bit grindy lately, but i kinda enjoy how it forces me to come up with cheap and viable solutions. normal difficulty is a bit too generous for my taste.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T14:51:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven in hard mode, there is a lot of science available on Kerbin.
