Back when I was an undergrad at the university, one of my friends had a nice observation on the differences between the hard classes in medicine and in computer science and mathematics. If you didn\u0027t understand something in medicine, you just had to work harder. In computer science and mathematics, you rarely had to work hard, but even hard work didn\u0027t help you past a certain point. If you still didn\u0027t understand something, it was often better just to drop the class, go drink beer, and try again next year. With some luck, your brain had processed a lot of stuff during that year, making the things that used to be hard easier.
