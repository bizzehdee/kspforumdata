So a space ship landing on Mars needs to do every thing itself. This means a landing a rover on Mars needs a very complicated and smart autopilot on board. This means we need to think a lot harder about auto pilots that gives us knowledge, tips \u0026 tricks that we can use in every day airliners. When you fly towards your holiday, the Mars rovers did a bit to get you there safer\u0022.\n\nI mentioned a lot of these advancements, to which he replied\n\n\u0022Well apart from all the progress and new knowledge we got from it, What did space ever do for us???\u0022\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9foi342LXQE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T18:24:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s not about laughing at people who don\u0027t care about space, it\u0027s about laughing at people who don\u0027t understand the most basic facts about space.
