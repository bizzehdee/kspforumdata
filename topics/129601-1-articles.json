It\u0027s unfortunate that newbies have to wait a little before posts appear, but it means the forums can function quite well without having a huge overarching moderator team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure if the team needs expanding, then the seniors or CM will ask for volunteers from the forum. I hope that helps, as the queue currently stands at 10 waiting posts, and it\u0027s not getting any smaller!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T13:16:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGaps in coverage for the approval queue can happen, but in general the time to wait to have a post published averages at about 15-20 minutes. It\u0027s not ideal, I remember having the same frustration when I joined the forums back in 2012, but unfortunately it\u0027s necessary because of the targeted spambots that post on any forum with advertisements for everything from counterfeit Gucci accessories to fake diplomas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T13:19:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat cart\u0027 man haha ; ) so : 3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-10T13:20:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2016 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
