Mainly because im not signed up for the bug tracker thing yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 1.1.0 I found my craft would yaw all over the runway when attempting take off. After some work I found this was mainly due to the friction control and was able to remedy the situation with some settings change on the wheels. I wanted to make sure in 1.1.1 there were no new issues, turns out there is. When im on the runway, totally stationary with RCS and SAS activated with the same friction control in 1.1.0 the craft yaws back and forth even though theres no thrust and brakes are on full. I was hoping this would be another friction control issue. So i played with the controls trying each setting but no matter what she yaws left and right. Albeit slowly. This craft was from 1.0.5 and updated to work with wheels in 1.1.0 but now its not working again. I know this can be an issue when importing craft from previous version so I rebuilt the main part of the craft in 1.1.1 (not the full thing as its 426 parts and im lazy) but the same thing still happens.
