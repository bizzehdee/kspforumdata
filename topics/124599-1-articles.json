They are something I\u0027ve never done before, but I\u0027d love to try, but I\u0027ve been having this issue where I can use Blender to cut it. Here\u0027s a sketch of what it should look like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hgjXaNn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hgjXaNn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it\u0027s really poorly drawn. But it\u0027s meant to be like that as it\u0027s a blue print. So as you can (hopefully) see to the left of the FrozenKerbal148 flag, there is a Monopropellent tank inside a little gap into the command pod. But as shown here, I can\u0027t get the cut positioned there. Is there any other way I can make this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/GwaUIm1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GwaUIm1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T22:36:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMany ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnife operator (edit mode, hit K)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoolean operations (create the inverse of what you want to cut out, add a Boolean modifier to the original object)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore edge loops (you are trying to create an edge loop in the wrong spot, move over to where you actually need it)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashingKirby148","CreatedById":130193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T22:40:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMany ways.\u003Cp\u003EKnife operator (edit mode, hit K)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoolean operations (create the inverse of what you want to cut out, add a Boolean modifier to the original object)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore edge loops (you are trying to create an edge loop in the wrong spot, move over to where you actually need it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027m new to this, so these options sound very complex, but I\u0027ll try them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the edge loop, I know it\u0027s in the wrong spot.
