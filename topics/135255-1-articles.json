You\u00A0know the steam you see before a rocket launches from fuel boil off, I was trying to replicate that in KSP. I think that it might be a fairly simple project to start of modding. I was looking for advice such as: What software is used, How long it might take, or were to post my mod once done. any help would be much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy game play.

So yes, the project would be fairly simple, adding the cfg (and if necessary model transforms) to models to apply it. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
