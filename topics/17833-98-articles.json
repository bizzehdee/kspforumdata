Do you use any other mods?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpottinger","CreatedById":82073,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T12:29:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love this mod and consider it one of my \u0022core\u0022 mods that must be available before I upgrade to a new version of KSP. So many thanks for creating/maintaining it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that I would find useful to have added is the current throttle setting expressed as a percentage. When I execute a manoeuvre I will take the displayed burn time of x seconds and begin my burn at t - x @ 50%, or t - 2x @ 25%, or t - 4x @ 12.5%, etc. As it is now, I have to perform the manoeuvre in IVA and get the percentage from a Raster Prop Monitor display, or eyeball the current thrust from the navball for craft with no IVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any chance this value could be squeezed in to an upcoming version?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T12:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecpottinger, if you use the engine\u0027s thrust limiter instead of the throttle KER will automatically recalculate burn time. Not 100% what you want but a workaround for some situations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
