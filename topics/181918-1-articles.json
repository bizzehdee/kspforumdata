I think I\u0027ve cracked the math of how much of Kerbin\u0027s surface will receive coverage, so I hope to update the document in the next few days. And for good measure I\u0027ll see about doing the math for the resonant orbits - that\u0027s a pretty good idea!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDStaal - the problem with RemoteTech and highly elliptical orbits is that the RemoteTech omni-directional antennas don\u0027t have a massive reach (the best one is 5Mm). The directional antennas, obviously, have much better reach, but then you end up with too many antennas on too many relay satellites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrew - yes I saw that page. I believe it gets one quite significant thing wrong - it doesn\u0027t account for eclipses by the Mun and Minmus which occur when the satellite is above Kerbin\u0027s terminator. I believe those eclipses tend to last far longer than eclipses by Kerbin. Also, I like to specify my orbits by period and not altitude, as it\u0027s vital to match the period between all the satellites in a constellation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I do is put 3 satellites in equatorial orbit with Communotron 32\u0027s in a period of about 1h30m (I think that gives best coverage for\u00A0the surface of Kerbin when paired against Communotron 16-S\u0027s - I\u0027ll know for sure when I\u0027ve checked the math). I also put the Mun\u00A0and Minmus antennas (HG-5 and DTS-M1)\u00A0on those 3 satellites. That\u0027s the Kerbin system covered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor further afield, I use a pair of relay satellites in highly elliptical polar orbits, and put an RA-2 on them pointed at Kerbin.

The first is that if you are looking for constant coverage, you need to provide enough battery to survive the Kerbin night.
