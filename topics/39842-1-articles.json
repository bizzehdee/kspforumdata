Aerospace Division, and Kerbal kind were delt a devastating blow in the last week. A revelation in scientific knowledge has led to the disaperance of previously existing orbiting crafts. Satelites orbiting mun, minimus, and kerbal. Along with the International Kerbal Space Station and Fueling Depot \u0022Zues\u0022, have gone missing. Leading physicists are scrambling to find and explanation. In related news a devastating discovery called \u0022Thermodynamics\u0022 by Physicist Ialdabaoth Kerman was announced. Leading governments tried to suppress and destroy the report before it was distributed but were unfortunately they were to late. With kerbals now aware of thermodynamics they have been set back in their attempts to conquer space. Plans for a manned mission to the mun have been suspended till engineers and scientists can tackle the new problem of reentry. Good news is that along with these discoveries, advances have been made in SAS software, engines, and other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVehicle Series: MGS Mk.
