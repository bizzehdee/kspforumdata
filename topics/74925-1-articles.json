This should bring my 3 brave Kerbals to the Moon and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Problem is that i can\u0027t get that thing in orbit. Every lifter i build gets only heavier at around 8.000 delta-v if i want to boost it to 10.000 delta-v. (Adding and extra 20% fuel to the first stage brought me only from ~8300 to ~8400 delta-v and adding to the 2nd stage brings down my delta-v on the first of course and negates my efforts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat TWR Start and endpoints are optimal for an Vehicle like this? I can\u0027t for the heck of it figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, could it be that there is a lack of engines around 3.000-6.000 thrust?
