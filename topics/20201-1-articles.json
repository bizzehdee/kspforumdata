giving the semi-truck command pod room for only two Kerbals, making it lighter than other pods, and giving it awful crash tolerance (still enough to land, of course). In addition, there should be attachment nodes where the tires would be, and there should be a heavy tire part that would act as both ballast and better crash tolerance for the semi-pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tire-tank should have a lower fuel capacity than the standard tank, but should be somewhat lighter as well. Kind of a mix between the rocket fuel tank and the jet fuel tank. As a bonus, having tires for the main body, it should have excellent crash tolerance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pulse-jet should be lightweight and have good thrust while having terrible efficiency (as well as the god-awful sound you mentioned). This engine should have significantly higher impulse inside the atmosphere than in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe large tank (of course) should be super heavy and have bad crash tolerance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should also add a super light RCS thruster with rusty nozzles, giving it lower thrust than the other RCS parts. Also, the stock solid boosters already look like trash bins, but I\u0027d crack up to see an actual aluminum trash can as a solid booster in this pack! High thrust, short burn time, and horrible crash tolerance. I\u0027d love it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing: Dynamite decouplers! Smaller, lighter, but with MUCH more separation force!
