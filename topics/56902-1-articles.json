KSP used to be all about the rockets for me, but then I discovered how much fun flying is and now I\u0027m addicted. I used to think landing a lander was satisfying (and it still is), but bringing a plane down to a perfect touch down on the runway is just sublime. I also just love really low alt flying, trying to go as fast as possible and as low as possible. The crashes are often much more spectacular than rocket crashes and although low flying is hazardous I\u0027ve got a pretty good eject system now that makes it mostly survivable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t post any of my megaton of plane pics here, I\u0027ve been doing career mode using just aircraft and I\u0027ve almost completed it.
