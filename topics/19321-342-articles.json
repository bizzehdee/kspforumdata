I could never fly or design anything that flew anywhere remotely like a plane in the old placeholder aero. People always said the old placeholder was like flying in soup, but I disagree it was like flying in some state of matter not currently known to man. Closest I could ever come to describing it, was like flying through silly-string. FAR was much, much better but still off a bit. What ferram has accomplished with FAR is nothing short of amazing to me, when you realize he did it all in his free time, and the handicaps he had to work with.
