That is, career game with all difficulties set (e.g. no respawn, no revert), and all add-ons that compel to consider every aspect of space-faring (communications, life-support, crew management, etc.). And really, I use almost all the add-ons you listed (and many more).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you (honestly) started telling to be fairly new to the game, and such a setting would be quite difficult to manage without knowing KSP and those add-ons in depth. Trying to do so may bring into awkward situations, and quickly drain the pleasure of playing KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I would suggest to start doing that in steps instead (I did, really). Best starting with a sandbox game in stock, and add add-ons a bit at a time, letting you have enough time to experiment and acquaint with how they work.
