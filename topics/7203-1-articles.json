The school system (much like the medical system) sees you as a number, nothing more, nothing less. All of this is different for me, as my school is open. This leads to some werid ideas (like 5 15-18 year olds trying to launch a rocket to 30 KM up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the thing about this post that I disagree with is that they arn\\\u0027t being unreasonable. Not in my mind anyway. This laptop I am writing on, I code games on, and do work on it. Only around 2-4 hours each day are spent playing game. Rest on work, travel and other stuff. And you have it lucky. If I didn\\\u0027t have this for work, I would be limited to 30 min of internet time (using Internet Explorer) and 30 min of game time per day. Unless you do work on the computer, I can see this as being parenting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
