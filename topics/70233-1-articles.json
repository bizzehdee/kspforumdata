Exploitation: Whats the point of chairs if you can just use a ladder? As long as you have a control unit, chairs are pointless. You could litterally make a 100 kerbal ship, by having them hold onto the sides. Super unrealistic, super rediculous (even for kerbal standards) and as said before, MASS-LESS. Personally this isn\u0027t that big of an issue, but my other reason probably is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. to prevent unusual occurrences in the physics, and the amount of work to fix those issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe all know that Kerbals themselves have unusual physics applied to them. The main reasons why they have special treatment are they are flexible, unlike a ridged ship body. They also have to have special animations, such as walking/jumping/RCS packing/ spinning/ rag dolling and a few others. This makes them \u0022special\u0022 at least in the game\u0027s eyes. So at times, when a kerbal is on a ladder they might start \u0022sliding\u0022 off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would mean there would need to be changes with kerbals climbing on latters, to prevent them from \u0022slidding off\u0022 during time warp. Changes would probably make them ridged when on ladders to prevent them from slidding around or moving in general. This could cause issues with them climbing somewhere ridged and letting go and becoming edridged. This would probably make many more EVA buggs occur in relation with ships and other bodies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is only one example of how Kerbals physics need to be dealt with. There are many more (FTL EGG?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like a lot of work just for something that really shouldn\u0027t be done in reality (long term spacewalks) unless necessary.
