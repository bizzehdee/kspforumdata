Career mode. and nothing is planned outside career mode until after at least 0.28, IIRC. Better aerodynamics is something squad wants to do (and is on the WNTS list, but this is a disscussion, so that makes no difference), and in the mean time there is FAR (Whic is, AFAIK, the most accurate representation of a real atmo out on the forums). However, FAR isnt perfect, and makes planes exceptionally hard. (For me at least, nothing I ever build is stable, even when following the tried-and-true COM infront of COL, or using daihedral, or placing COL above or below the COM.) I think it may be best to have a sort of difficulty settings, controlling the atmo types (Real or kerbal) and perhaps the drag types.
