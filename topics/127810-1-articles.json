I\u0027d like to provide an upgrade path for specific parts as you progress through the science tree. With a command pod, for instance, the first pod would have the barebone functions like SAS. Later, you would unlock a part that replaces the initial pod with upgraded features, such as built\u00A0in RCS thrusters and/or parachutes. These additional features would come in at roughly the same cost and weight, chalked up to advancements in \u0022science\u0022.
