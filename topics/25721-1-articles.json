Sice Subassembly Loader can\u0027t copy-paste the root object (i.e. the pod) and the pod is often an attachment point for multiple small pieces of hardware, it\u0027s a bit annoying. Since most of my constructs include a docking port anyway, I usually make a probe core the root object, stack a docking port under it, and build from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, when I reassemble, I need to start with a probe core again. It\u0027s ok, if it\u0027s right above a docking port I can just decouple it, right? Decoupling it, however, makes the stages on everything below it condense into one stage. This is normally not a problem, since I can just decouple it only by the time I reach orbit, when I am typically no longer dependent on staging interface for firing things in the correct order anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is, unless the build includes parachutes, which, in this case, immediately become primed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I prevent that from happening or un-prime them?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T12:49:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had to deal with the same thin a couple of times, what I normally do is leave the probe on the docking port until I actually need to use the port.
