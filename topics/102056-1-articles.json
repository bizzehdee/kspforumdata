Even if liquid methane was ten times as expensive as RP-1 is (and I assure you that it is not, RP-1 is super highly refined and certainly not common kerosene!), its price point would be irrelevant in the grand scale of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t tell you with certainty why it wasn\u0027t adopted earlier, but I can \u003Cem\u003Especulate\u003C/em\u003E that it was largely a question of practicality. RP-1/LOX not only worked just fine, but in fact did something very specific very well: it delivered high fuel density, allowing the designers to keep the rocket stage small and easy to build. Then, if you wanted a high Isp fuel and density was no longer important, you could go with LH2/LOX. It\u0027s the most effective (sane) chemical propellant mix that we have, even today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to that, liquid methane had no immediate key selling point. You had no reason to pick it over RP-1 if you needed a dense fuel, because it is much less dense. You had no reason to pick it over LH2 if you wanted performance, because its performance is much lower. And yes, it is much better storable long-term than LH2... but for deep space missions, you take hypergolics anyway, because they make the design of a restartable rocket engine a million times easier, and the resulting engine that much more reliable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with a propellant sitting somewhere in the middle is that it is a jack of all trades, master of none. It is good at many things but not the best at anything, so when rocket scientists looked to use only the best stuff to maximize their efficiency, it got passed over at every opportunity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFast forward a couple decades, and you get renewed interest in methane because nowadays, we have computer-aided engine design that allows us to understand the combustion process, and design specific behaviors for specific fuels. We have better materials to build rocket hulls and tanks. Thirty years ago the advantages of methane seemed not worth the extra effort you needed to go to to unlock it, but today we have minimized that effort. Additionally, the scientists today are looking at dfferent things than they did in the past, such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Self-pressurizing tanks, which saves weight and complexity by removing the need to carry helium tanks and pumps and seals and valves and control electronics and software to maintain the pressure. Methane can do that, hypergolics or RP-1 cannot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The ability to refuel a rocket in situ, something that just doesn\u0027t work with most fuels due to the complexity of the refinement process. Methane on the other hand is super simple to produce, if you cannot just collect it from the environment outright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Cost reduction. Mixing a RP-1 first stage with hydrogen upper stages might be performing better, but it requires a more expensive rocket and a more expensive launchpad and a more expensive servicing and launch process. With just one fuel in all stages, and it being less cryogenic than liquid oxygen which is present anyway, you can radically simplify a lot of things, and that might be worth a small hit in performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Special applications. SpaceX wants a higher Isp engine because that higher Isp is critical to avoid losing too much in the way of payload capabilities by saving fuel for a boostback and landing of the first stage. A conventional rocket gains a bit of mass to orbit from every extra second of Isp... but a rocket that needs to reserve some of its fuel for after decoupling gains many times more of an advantage - or more precisely, it sacrifices less in addition to gaining the same benefit that a conventional rocket would. So for SpaceX, the advantages of running on methane are larger than they are for conventional approaches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo sum up, nowadays we have the know-how and the technology to get an actual advantage out of methane while mitigating its downsides, and we have gained a new appreciation of things only methane can do that designers decades ago weren\u0027t even in need of (or aware of).
