To help me, I wrote a small application that helped me to calculate a few parameters for my flight (orbital velocity, phase angles, required delta V, delta V required for transfers, etc.). But this was the only time when I really did some calculation.

I\u0027d then bust out my calculator, multiply that by 9.8 to get the acceleration in m/s^2. I\u0027d then use the maneuver node to figure out when to burn and how much dV I would need, and then use the acceleration calculated earlier to figure out about how long the burn would be.
