Not only does that mean you can\u0027t set it to a value outside the slider\u0027s range, but you also can\u0027t set it to a value in-between the \u0022detents\u0022 that the slider\u0027s \u0022resolution\u0022 allows. (i.e. if the slider is defined to have a minimum increment of 0.5, between values of 0 and 10, and you try to set it to, say, 8.43, you\u0027ll end up setting it to 8.5 instead, just like what would happen if you had tried to set the value using the mouse.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all that\u0027s happening here is that kOS is obeying the rules set by Infernal Robotics\u0027s decision as to what to allow via the user interface. If Infernal Robotics has decided that users should never be allowed to change the value above 5, then kOS will honor that decision and obey it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the makers of IR decide that the limit of 5 is really unnecessary and it should be allowed to be higher, then they can change it by just altering the parameters of the tweakable on that KSPfield, and kOS will automatically follow whatever rules they set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe number is not embedded that deeply in the code.
