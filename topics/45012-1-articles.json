But beyond those, there\u0027s supposed to be procedurally generated solar systems. You get to them using some kind of FTL warping, which the developers also talked about at least once...though very briefly.

Also, I think the reason people don\u0027t like magic warp drives is because KSP tries its best to be an accurate space program sim with proper orbital mechanics and physics. So adding Sci-Fi stuff to KSP would not be favored by too many. That\u0027s not to say nobody wants it, as plenty of conversations have involved warping on this forum. As for me, more planets in the current system is perfectly fine, perhaps leaving the interstellar exploration to a later more refined version of the game, after it has already been mostly worked out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
