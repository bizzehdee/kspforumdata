The front wheel can then be lowered to allow the rover wheels to gain traction, allowing the entire craft to act as a rover! One problem is you can\u0027t stop the control surfaces from moving, so turning while in rover mode can be an issue in atmo. Also due to some of the parts used it can be a rather late-career ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Longbow is essentially an engine booster the Arrow plugs into, and can refuel from. It has additional ports (all shielded, cause they look cooler) for docking refueling craft, lighting for making it\u0027s docked Arrow look pretty, and an emergency escape vehicle if for some reason things go horribly wrong, but that could never happen, right? Also comes with a launcher (not single stage). If it breaks apart on the pad, or partway into orbit, just reset and try again.

The thrust from the NERVA on a light craft like this is large proportionally; but because the craft is light, the magnetic forces of the docking ring is also proportionally large, so that it balances out. Here\u0027s a pic of the lightest craft I have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RiJOTiO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RiJOTiO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, I\u0027ve opted for scientific equipment to be carried and jettisoned once the science transmissions are completed.

I\u0027ve juiced up the Longbow launcher, and modified it back down to 3 NERVAs per nacelle, since from what I\u0027ve read more engines does not equal better, in this particular case. Using MechJeb I was able to get it into a stable 120km orbit on just the launch sections with a few seconds of fuel left over, though there\u0027s still a small chance of collision when dropping the second lot of inner rockets, as doing so causes a massive flex in the craft. I added a few separatrons to try and lessen it, but it still needs a little tweaking. I\u0027ve also changed around the action groups a little, which I\u0027ll update on the first post.
