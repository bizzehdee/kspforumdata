Not gone beyond so far, I want to build orbital outposts at every place in turn then use them for staging for landings etc. It\u0027s a bit of a baby steps way of doing it but it\u0027s my way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, on to my quandary. I am using MechJeb 2.0 to autopilot my orbital maneuvers, because I am too cack-handed to do it by hand basically. I am a bit baffled by the differences in orbital launch profile. Now, I\u0027m aware that it may well be rocket dependant and that there\u0027s a lot of complex maths behind it. I am a self-confessed match dullard, I cannot wrap my head around it. Are there any \u0027rules of thumb\u0027 I can apply to get a roughly suitable profile or resolve issues with profiles for each rocket by following a diagnostic routine or something? Failing that can anyone explain it in layman\u0027s terms (i.e. not descend into Einsteinian maths equations and stuff)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
