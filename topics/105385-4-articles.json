So place stuff like RTGs, batteries, heck even fuel tanks can be placed into cargo bays to disable the drag on them completely. Personally ive already made some ion SSTOs that store ion tanks (lots of drag normally) inside the cargo bays.\n\nRadially placed parts do not have any occlusion enabled and will ALWAYS suffer maximum drag penalties for a given orientation into airstream. This means that placing something externally and moving it inside the hull via gizmos (clipping in other words) does not lower the drag experienced at all, and that part is still just asd subject to overheat as it was externally.\n\nOcclusion works for parts in a straight line (attached to the nodes in front/rear). Only the front part suffers maximum drag/heat penalties, and every part behind it regardless of size/shape is occluded and only suffers minor drag when angled. I know this is most likely a bug/exploit, but its how the game curently works so nice to let people know.\n\nbasic jets die off at roughly mach 1, turbojets around mach 3, and rapiers do not technically have a limit except at a certain point drag or heat ends up stopping you going to infinity (usually mach4-5 is the max you can achieve without cheats or exploits). \n\nRapiers are the best for SSTO/spaceplanes as they can eject ships at excess of 1500m/s from the atmosphere, and if you can get above 40ishkm, the drag becomes negligible unless you are going interplanetary velocities. Turbojets can eject at like 1200m/s, which is 300m/s more rocket fuel dV you need.\n\nBasic jets have incredibale ISP, but are useless at higher altitudes and mach numbers.\n\nReentry without heat shields is very dangerous especially when going interplanetary, but can be countered with a very shallow angle. Almost all situations allow you to aerobrake into a stable orbit on the 1st pass with a aeroplane (2000 K temp limit parts exposed). For beginners its recomended to have heat shields though, as they make a masisve difference and allow some rather rapid slowdown (especially when coupled with the currently broken parachutes that cant be torn off or burned off for some reason)."},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:57:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\* NuStock spaceplanes reenter without difficulty so long as you use AoA and S-turns to wash off most of your speed at high altitude.
