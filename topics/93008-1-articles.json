As you can see I\u0027ve got an SAS installed on the rocket... I was under the impression you either needed a pilot OR a module to use the SAS (t key) function. Yet it only seems to work with pilots... when I throw engineers or scientists in I get the message I can\u0027t enable SAS because there\u0027s no sas AND no pilots (implying it should be an either or like I was under the impression of in the first place). I\u0027ve tried this on more than just this craft as well with the same issue.
