Elevator design also provides for the alternate blocking of the upper or lower thrusters on the central sabre engines, a kind of crude thrust vectoring system. I love the performance I\u0027ve gotten out of it, I just wish I could use procedural wings to avoid the ugly overlap midships. Any advice on how to put that together with what we have?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
