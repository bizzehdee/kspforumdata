Truly pretty, impressive and seems to be performance friendly. But I\u0027m having huge inconsistencies in the reflections of my dev install (specially landed) probably caused by the new EVE version (wip yet). I don\u0027t know if this happens in the official release (7-x) too. I say \u0022probably caused by EVE\u0022 because the cube layers seem to remain consistent in the ground, but the reflection appears with black spaces in the sky (atmo, clouds and particles).\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering, if this can\u0027t be solved... can we at least get the reflection without this details (I mean, a reflection of the sky without the clouds)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LV9J9nll.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/LV9J9nll.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVE overhaul seems to have some kind of frustum culling for clouds, so they are not rendered in some directions.

Like more coherent. In a standard KSP seems to run perfectly (checked). But the problem with the EVE overhaul (atmos and clouds) still persist. I\u0027m quite sure that is not a TRReflection problem at all, because you can see the broken atmo over perfectly reflected buldings or ships, as example. I think that Rbray is not over yet with the new atmo system, so maybe this is temporal. Or maybe can\u0027t be avoided. That is why I\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s possible to avoid the EVE \u0022layers\u0022 in the reflection. Don\u0027t know... I don\u0027t want to push too much, atm your reflections are simply beautiful, works perfectly and my complaints are based in a WIP.
