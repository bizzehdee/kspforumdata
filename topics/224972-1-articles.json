I\u0027m currently trying to using it with Astros MADV part mod. Patched over the IVA the from LonesomeRobots collection to both parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut im currently having issues with the windows being opaque and not see through in IVA regardless of which part i use. Is this a texture issue? Do I need to learn to use unity/blender\u00A0 or can I fix it in the spaces cfg?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso im having issues with Free IVA as well. Mainly the Lab and Hab hatches not aligning.\u00A0 I\u0027m guessing i need to play with cgf\u00A0 hatch location or rotation to make them line up?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final issue is making the top docking port node work with free iva. When I place a docking port, it blocks the top hatch\u00A0 with unpassable door with a backward message.\u00A0 With slim profile ports, I can see open the top hatch, but after that it\u0027s still blocked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you guys for any help\u00A0 or advice you can give.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-30T20:47:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2024 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 30\u0022\u003EMay 30\u003C/time\u003E by mozzy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
