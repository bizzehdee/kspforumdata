After the original design\u0027s two PT-100 turboprops proved too weak to keep the aircraft flying I had to ditch it in the sea. I noticed that all of the fuselage survived except for the nosecone and the crew cabin. I checked the parts list and for some reason the crew cabin has a stupidly weak impact tolerance of 6.0 m/s. The cargo bays and inline docking port have a tolerance of 50 m/s, and the cockpits 45. Can anyone tell me why it is like this?"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T01:40:33Z","Content":"I wouldn\u0027t say that a part that can survive a crash of 14mph completely unscathed is \u0022stupidly weak\u0022 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBy contrast, I\u0027d say that a part that can survive an impact of 112mph completely unscathed is...kinda freaky."},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T01:42:53Z","Content":"My main issue is just that compared to other parts that you would see along with it on a plane it is much weaker and thus isn\u0027t actually viable for aircraft that may have rough landings or something."}]}
