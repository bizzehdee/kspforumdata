I spelled it wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHello KSP forums! Until the other day, I had enough fun playing KSP with about 900 of the extra parts available through mods. I quickly noticed a few things I would have liked to see, but was worried that I\u0027d have missed the boat on suggestions, necroing threads, etc. I also didn\u0027t want to insult anyone by messing with their hard work -- in all honestly, 99.9% of these parts are perfect on their own. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I can\u0027t leave well enough alone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been developing some part hacks that fill the gaps I\u0027d been noticing, but I\u0027m not ready to pass them through testing just yet. I\u0027d also like to make sure I\u0027m not upsetting anyone by using their currently existing parts, even though all DCCC parts show up as separate from their original creations and are pretty clearly identified in game as cheap knockoffs built by used car salesmen. Since these parts really do belong to people other than me, I wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be upset if they took over the modifications in the least, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m hoping to make some kind of mark on KSP, as I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m currently modeling a few of my own actual models. Suggestions? Angry threats? Any input? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a list of some of my changes so far. Please go easy on me, I\u0027m not really a forums-of-any-type kind of person:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDishy_cam: Probodobodyne Camera config as a mounted hullcam (I think). I love the look of the model and texture, but wished it had function. Still testing this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(description = This high-definition television camera is capable of displaying a perfect 575 line picture for use with most television networks. It\u0027s perfect for landings and special events!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDishy_dish: A reconfig of the Probodobodyne Dish that works with the ISA mapper. Works fine so far. Another \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cjust wish it had a function\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 situation. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d have loved to do something with telemetry or some sort of radio aspect of exploration (deals with resolution/bandwidth over distance for the camera), but that kind of thing isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t implemented yet and I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know how to make a plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(description = If it\u0027s suitable for a rooftop, it\u0027s suitable for the Mun, amirite?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDishy_ext_battery: Dani-Sang\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s MMI external battery even LOOKS like a battery. I love it, but it feels cheat-y. I reconfigured it to work a little more with MuMech (from my limited understanding of the solar power/recharging situation) and halved the capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(description = Someone lost an MMI external battery over the lake behind our factory. We slapped on a new coat of paint and replaced the core with one of our own rechargable batteries. No refund.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDishy_Mag_Drive: A retexture and reconfig of Nomad\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s FTL drive. This one is built as an ion engine, has some exhaust, weighs a ton, costs a fortune and is still overpowered (from 1000 thrust to 8000). Requires a LOT of energy to run for every long and is designed to rip off your ship simply by using it. Most people probably won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t use this kind of thing, but I think the pipes look cool. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve managed to manually fly it to Minmus and park it in orbit. Took about four hours, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s possible. Still working out some kinks in the texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(description = This expensive-looking part incorporates the latest research into Magnetic Pulse engines and has been deemed a failure by 137 countries and agencies, but we\u0027ve saved it for you. PLEASE NOTE: Applying more than 12% thrust of this module is not recommended or deemed possible by the laws of physics. Keep hands and feet away at all times. Remove jewelry, glasses, or pacemakers before use. Purchase of this module constitutes acceptance of Clause 32, subsection C, Paragraph 83 of the DCCC liability wavier.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDishy_Mag_Drive_Battery: Same story here with Nomad\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s FTL battery. Instead of having a liquid fuel cell with 9999 fuel@3 mass, I changed it to store 6000 energy as a ModuleKrBattery. The texture on this one needs to be scaled down as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(description = This battery is meant to be paired with the DCCC Mag Drive. Do not stand within 60 meters. Ever.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*old image snipped*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDishy_microthrust: Kyle \u0026amp; Winston\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s set is phenomenal. It even comes with a spin booster that would be perfect for a low-thrust liquid fuel engine onboard a satellite. Or at least I thought so! Reconfigured as a liquid engine and added fx. You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll still have to rotate it on your own. Working that out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(description = A teeny tiny thruster body salvaged from fallen debris. It looks like it was once part of a solid rocket booster system and there\u0027s no way to refill it. We were able to salvage the nozzle, but not much else. Use of this module not recommended without adult supervision.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDishysat_ISA: Going to say this one works. Another reconfig. Using MMI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s dish model. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s actually been pretty useful on my own satellite deployments over the Mun, I liked being able to flush mount the dish (even upside-down). I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to retexture it, but all of that is locked up in the mu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(description = We\u0027re really hoping this will work as a mapping device, but it probably won\u0027t. It\u0027s still a dish so it\u0027ll still look snazzy on your ships. It\u0027s pretty fragile, though. External use only.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDyna_compat_battery and Dyna_compat_ion_engine: Maraz\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s battery and Thobewill\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s engine both look amazing. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve reconfigured them to function more like the panels below. On click, the battery shows level! I had a hard time getting the indicator to show, so this happened and I kept it. The ion engine has had the thrust upped at a cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(description = This \u0022battery pack\u0022 is made from the highest quality post-consumer waste products. Not suitable for habitation.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(description = This Dynavolt compatible ion engine outputs slightly more than twice the thrust of the original, but requires %354 more power. It has also been internally lined with a lightweight heat resistant coating that may or may not contain nuts.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDyna_compat_DSM_battery and Dyna_compat_DSM_ion_engine: Same story as above with reconfigs. Kockaspiton\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s green foil bothered me a little bit, so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve retexed it with copper and a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cdeath\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 placard to make it different. Thrust is upped a little and the battery compliments it, minus an issue with the vent colors. The ion engine, when paired with the right battery can launch a small satellite into orbit. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m rethinking this\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(description = This ion engine packs enough punch to move your space-based pleasure yacht into orbit, provided someone else got it into space. It\u0027s too heavy and too weak to use to land said pleasure yacht. Please don\u0027t try.

I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know what it was, but to be honest the current texture I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve applied isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t very good either. I love the models for both, but I wanted them to look more like engine parts and not radioactive barrels. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve missed the mark a bit and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m continuing work on it... Either way, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve made them more like cheap knock-offs to fill a smaller niche. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(description = This micro version of \u0022our\u0022 \u0022battery pack\u0022 is capable of storing a charge, but there\u0027s no telling how much. It should work with satellites, but there are probably better options.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(description = This Dynavolt compatible micro ion engine is the smaller version of \u0022our\u0022 ion engine and may be suitable for smaller probes if you\u0027re in the market for a \u0022nice\u0022 piece of used laboratory equipment.
