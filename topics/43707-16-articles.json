If I have a EXIT AND RUN command it is supremely easy to add and remove modules and it makes it to where they are self contained things that are easy to debug. I have tried what you suggested and had my orbit program run the splash and the menu. It did work. The only issue I have with that is I now have to cram every module into the main. It\u0027s going to get big and slow. My orbit program is already too slow. Mostly my fault, but you can imagine the nightmare with module integration. Nice de-bugg-able and replaceable chunks. That is what we are going after. This is a scripting language after all. It should be as easy as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe autoexec would be nice. It\u0027s not as important as break and run though. For now, that is what is really required. Then module writers only need to add \u003Cstrong\u003EEXIT AND RUN main.\u003C/strong\u003E or whatever you wish to call it. My main menu then only has to do the same on selection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I have everything set to run from main menu. The problem is then when it runs the orbit program that the program orbit no longer has control of the ship. It stages but it doesn\u0027t throttle or steer. The menu literally doing nothing. It is set to wait for end condition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet some how it is not allowing the orbit program full control of the craft. I suspect it is because the menu program has control of those things. I even tried moving the main loop out to the main menu and had it do the loop and the orbit program just set when flags but that still doesn\u0027t work. Break and run solves all my problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutoexec is nice but not nearly as important.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-03T07:24:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2013 07:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Payload\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T11:38:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I figured out how to save my cruddy programs, now I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing wrong with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a simple two-stage rocket with the first stage being two fuel tanks adding up to 720 l of liquid fuel, and a second stage one 180 l fuel tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy command is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait until stage:liquidfuel \u0026lt; 180.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat have I done wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cameroon","CreatedById":51687,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T11:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KevinLaity\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KevinLaity\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy ideal would be that you configure the loadout of your unit while you\u0027re in the VAB, including assigning autoexecs that apply to individual craft or whatever you like to it.
