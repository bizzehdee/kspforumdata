Twice before, single Kerbals had bravely travelled to the surface of the Mun and returned. The doctors, eager to learn of the health effects of travel beyond the Van Allen belts, had examined Jebediah and Valentina after their respective returns. The results of these examinations had been submitted in reports to the Space Program leadership, reports which stated that such a mission carried about a 1 in 20 risk of radiation-related medical conditions. For this reason, the new Mk1-2 Command Pod was built with much better shielding than the old single-seat Mk1. Once rockets powerful enough to launch it were ready, the exploration of the Mun could continue where it had left off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe great day had at last come. Kerpollo-3 stood on the launchpad, 180 tons of the finest Kerbal engineering. The designers would have preferred to add still more shielding below the pod, but the weight could not be spared. The pilot would be Berbelle Kerman, who not long before had been rescued from low Kerbin orbit after her previous employers failed to use sufficient struts. Alongside her were Bill and Bob Kerman. Bill, the engineer, had been kicking his heels for some months after a spell on-orbit supervising the construction of the Kerbal Space Station; Bob had recently returned from that same station where he had been pursuing fruitful scientific research in the microgravity lab environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch itself went according to plan, and some ten or twelve minutes later the ship was heading out through the Van Allen belts, on course for the Mun. To minimise radiation exposure, the bulk of the vessel \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC including the 700-gallon fuel tank \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC was kept between the command pod and the sun, the idea being that kappa rays would be absorbed by the rocket fuel, and prevented from striking the crew. However, it would be necessary to deviate from this alignment when making maneuver burns, as well as to perform the munar landing and ascent. Moreover, there are other sources of kappa rays besides the sun; the galactic background of cosmic rays is of low intensity, but the individual particles often have very high energies. The three Kerbals on board were, nonetheless, confident that their capsule, with its brand-new shielding, would protect them well enough; after all, had not Jeb and Val survived in their primitive Mk1 pods?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little over a day after launch, Kerpollo-3 arrived at the Mun. Berbelle flew an absolutely nominal orbital insertion, and tilted up the orbit to pass over the mission target: the Southwest Crater. Soon enough they were crossing the crater rim and slowing down for the landing. Though Berbelle had seemed a little tired, the other two were not overly worried; she was an experienced pilot and the approach was on course. Until, that is, Berbelle lost consciousness and slumped forward onto the controls. Terrified, Bill and Bob leapt into action, pulling her off the control stick which had already sent the ship way off track. While Bob tried to rouse Berbelle, Bill grabbed the controls and steadied the ship. They were already late in the descent \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC too late to abort the landing \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC so Bill would have to land the ship himself. A non-pilot, with no SAS to help, while distracted by anxiety about his friend Berbelle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bad news,\u0022 Bob\u0027s voice pierced his concentration, \u0022I think she\u0027s bought it. Kraken knows how, she seemed fine two minutes ago.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Then put her down and give me a hand with this throttle,\u0022 Bill replied. \u0022I can\u0027t land this thing myself, there\u0027s more levers than I can handle.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs they struggled to set the ship down gently, they realised how much they had relied on their pilot. \u0022I\u0027ll never be rude about stick-jockeys again,\u0022 said Bill, \u0022how they cope with this I\u0027ll never know.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt last the capsule touched down on the surface. Though some distance from the intended location, the landing was still inside the Southwest Crater. With the immediate panic over, the crew could at last radio back to a nervous Mission Control, who had been asking for some time \u0027what was going on\u0027 and \u0027why you\u0027ve all stopped talking to us\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, we\u0027re down,\u0022 Bill told them. \u0022Something\u0027s happened to Berbelle, though; she just passed out halfway through the landing.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I think she\u0027s dead,\u0022 Bob added, \u0022I can\u0027t find a pulse anywhere.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger, we copy. Any idea why?\u0022 came the crackly reply from the radio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not a clue.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So what do we do now?\u0022 asked Bob. \u0022Head for home?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I guess we try to finish the mission. Otherwise \u0027belle will have died for nothing,\u0022 said Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Bob gathered up his sensors, his shovel and his sample bags, and climbed out of the ship and took his first step on the Munar surface. Next to the flag that he had firmly planted in the regolith, Bob built a little dolmen from brecciated Mun rocks, as a memorial of Berbelle\u0027s sacrifice. Not long later, his scientific observations were completed and Bob clambered back aboard the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022All done,\u0022 he said, \u0022let\u0027s set off for home.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anything, the take-off was a more harrowing task even than the landing for the two untrained pilots. Keenly aware of the falling fuel gauge, they wrestled with the controls and managed to bring Kerpollo-3 back into Munar orbit - and then onto an escape trajectory. But the latitude of their landing-site meant they were on an inclined orbit, and would end up on an even more steeply inclined orbit of Kerbin, and struggle to hit re-entry. Patiently, Mission Control talked them through the final maneuver to leave the Mun in the right direction. By now, it was well over 10 hours since the three kerbonauts had blasted off from the Space Center; but at least two of them would make it safely home. They had run it fairly close \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC there was less than seven seconds\u0027 fuel left in the tanks (which would have given them just 160m/s more delta-V) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC but they were on course for Entry Interface with a 37km Kerbin periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet danger still threatened these hardy explorers, for the solar radiation continued to stream by. Without the help of SAS, keeping the pod pointed away from the sun proved a daunting task. A steady axial rotation of about 4rpm helped to stabilise the craft, but the axis still drifted over time and required regular corrections. Shortly after the two-day mark, Kerpollo-3 passed into Kerbin\u0027s shadow, shutting down the solar panels. To conserve the batteries, Bill retracted the antennas \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC there was, after all, little to tell Mission Control that they didn\u0027t already know \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC and turned out the lights. The two kerbonauts settled into a grim silence in the eerie cockpit, dark but for the blue glow of the navball and the streaks of stars seen through the window; what little light there was seemed to limn the body of their fallen companion. And yet in that cockpit there seemed to be another source of light, inexplicably tinged with green.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey!\u0022 interjected Bob, \u0022it\u0027s those samples. Look, they\u0027re glowing. They must be radioactive!\u0022 He grabbed a piece of photo film, as a makeshift dosimeter (there was no Keiger-M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCller tube on board) and wrapped it around one of the samples; sure enough, the rocks he\u0027d collected from the Southwest Crater were emitting low but detectable amounts of radiation. Was it deadly kappa particles, or something benign like alphas? There was no way to tell; better to err on the side of caution. Quickly Bob took the samples out through the hatch and stuck them to the outside of the ship; the pod\u0027s shielding would protect them, and the samples could be brought back in just before re-entry. \u0022Better check our personal dosimeters,\u0022 said Bob as he climbed back into the pod. They were both reading 0.129, standing for a 1-in-8 chance of cancer. This was far higher than Jeb and Val had experienced, and it was sobering for the kerbonauts to think that they might by now easily have tumours growing within them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little over an hour later, the sun rose over the limb of Kerbin. Though the sunlight and solar power were welcome, the resumption of solar kappa rays was not; Kerpollo-3 was still more than 6600km from Kerbin and re-entry was almost two hours away. Bill steered the ship back to point away from the sun, and restarted the slow gyroscopic roll. From his window, Bob could see the Mun go past once per roll \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC the Mun whose exploration had claimed Berbelle\u0027s life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFifteen hours into the mission, and at 3200km the ship was just nudging into the outer reaches of the Van Allen belts. Soon the crew would be safely inside the protective embrace of Kerbin\u0027s magnetosphere, shielded once more from the sun\u0027s harsh kappa rays. Soon the crew \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC or at least, those members of it who were still alive \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC would be able to kiss the ground of their home planet, would be able to sleep in their own beds, would be able to bury their unfortunate pilot in a solemn grave. Soon the nightmare that was the Kerpollo-3 mission would be over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is Kerpollo-3 calling Mission Control, do you read?\u0022 Bill had turned the radio back on and was calling via the Chromium-5 satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Loud and clear,\u0022 came the answer, \u0022How are you coping up there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022As well as can be expected,\u0022 Bill replied, \u0022we\u0027re about half an hour from Entry Interface. Can you get us on radar, check our trajectory? Neither of us really know how to shoot a re-entry and I can\u0027t read the handwriting on Berbelle\u0027s notes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger, we\u0027ll give Tracking a kick,\u0022 said the voice of Mission Control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout five minutes later, the numbers came through from Tracking Central. \u0022Yeah, we\u0027ve got a fairly tight ellipse on your flyby, it looks like a bit above a 38km perikerb.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Is that good, bad, what? We don\u0027t know what height Entry Interface should be,\u0022 Bob spoke up testily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We reckon it\u0027s a bit high, you want more like 36.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger. You think you can work out a burn for us?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure, give us a minute to crunch the numbers.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, it\u0027s going to be a really small one,\u0022 Mission Control came through on the radio, \u0022just 3.6m/s retrograde. You wanna make it \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E precise now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wilco,\u0022 Bill acknowledged the instructions. On the dregs of its fuel, Kerpollo-3 made the correction burn; the periapsis was now within tens of metres of the 36km Entry Interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA short while later, the ship was down to 300km and safely inside the bulk of the Van Allen belts. Bill\u0027s dosimeter read 0.147; Bob\u0027s, 0.149. Had they taken too much? They would have to wait for the doctors on the ground to check them over; until then they could only guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey passed by the Kerbin Space Station, only 18km away; they could see the light reflecting off its solar panels. Then it was time to drop the service module and prepare for the re-entry. The kerbonauts were grateful for the pod\u0027s stability; otherwise, keeping the heat shield pointed the right way as they slammed into the atmosphere at Mach 9 might have been rather difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-entry always feels endless; it certainly did for Bob and Bill in \u0027the hearse\u0027. But at last it was over, and they were drifting down under the \u0027chutes. Two days, four hours and forty-five minutes after launch, they splashed down at 114\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 East and called up the recovery team. They were back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA crack medical team gave the two surviving kerbonauts a thorough examination; to everyone\u0027s relief, neither of them showed any signs of cancer despite their elevated dose. They also performed an autopsy on Berbelle\u0027s body, and found severe ionisation damage to the Kerbal equivalent of the liver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob\u0027s observations and samples weighed in at around 200 science points, and a priority for the labs examining the rock samples was to investigate their radioactivity. But it seemed they were only emitting alpha particles; Berbelle\u0027s killer was \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E a crater full of radioactive rock. Did the sun strain itself to produce an extra-high-energy particle? Or was Berbelle the victim of an unlucky hit from a cosmic ray? The statisticians say it was probably the latter, but we\u0027ll never know for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the years that followed, this tragedy hung over the Space Program, leaving them reluctant to send any Kerbal further than low orbit. The exploration of the Kerbol System would be carried out by robots, driven by ever-smarter computers (not that those are immune to kappa rays either...), and the dream of landing kerbals on other planets would remain unfulfilled for decades. Even after Kerbalkind at last travelled to its destiny in the stars, Berbelle was never forgotten as the first to give her life pioneering that destiny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHer gravestone reads: \u0022Berbelle Kerman, d. y2d053, just above the Mun. Determined to explore space, even if it killed her.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nahim","CreatedById":78568,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T17:26:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow guy, that was pretty realistc for me...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESad, but realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
