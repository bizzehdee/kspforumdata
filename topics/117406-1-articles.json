It consists of two modified stock parts: an Engine-Precooler that\u0027s been converted into an Internal Comubstion Engine, which intakes air and LF to produce a special \u0027RPM\u0027 resource. This goes to my modified TR-2L Rugged Wheels, which produce much greater speed than the regular ones (plus improved crash tolerance, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set up my \u0027RPM\u0027 resource by copying the ElectricCharge resource and pasting it as a new module at the bottom, and simply changed the name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, if I have the throttle at 0, no RPMs are produced, and the tires won\u0027t spin. At even a tick above 0, it produces enough to get up to nearly top speed, but much more than I want. At full, it gets top speed easily. Would I just need to play with numbers, or would it just not be modeled correctly in the current system? I feel like when I experimented before with lower numbers, one wheel would simply not get any power below a certain threshold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is this: how can I manage RPM output and usage so that changing the throttle affects how much power the wheels get? Is there a better resource to model it after than ElectricCharge?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T17:52:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam_Jones\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stoney3K","CreatedById":139954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T19:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you using the stock \u0022Engine pre-cooler\u0022 part as a template? Because that does not produce any ElectricCharge at all by default. The B9 one may do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can try using the Basic Jet Engine as a template, set it to produce almost zero thrust, and modify the ModuleAlternator entry so it generates your \u0022RPM\u0022 instead of EC (alternatively, add a separate ModuleAlternator to do just that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ModuleAlternator output is proportional to the engine\u0027s throttle output, so it does what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also try the ModuleResourceConverter for the same purpose, however, I don\u0027t know if that can be set to respond to throttle output.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T23:52:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight that\u0027s beasically what I did.
