It consists of two modified stock parts: an Engine-Precooler that\u0027s been converted into an Internal Comubstion Engine, which intakes air and LF to produce a special \u0027RPM\u0027 resource. This goes to my modified TR-2L Rugged Wheels, which produce much greater speed than the regular ones (plus improved crash tolerance, etc).\n\nI set up my \u0027RPM\u0027 resource by copying the ElectricCharge resource and pasting it as a new module at the bottom, and simply changed the name.\n\nCurrently, if I have the throttle at 0, no RPMs are produced, and the tires won\u0027t spin. At even a tick above 0, it produces enough to get up to nearly top speed, but much more than I want. At full, it gets top speed easily. Would I just need to play with numbers, or would it just not be modeled correctly in the current system? I feel like when I experimented before with lower numbers, one wheel would simply not get any power below a certain threshold.\n\nMy question is this: how can I manage RPM output and usage so that changing the throttle affects how much power the wheels get? Is there a better resource to model it after than ElectricCharge?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T17:52:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam\\_Jones**"},{"CreatedByName":"Stoney3K","CreatedById":139954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T19:55:30Z","Content":"Are you using the stock \u0022Engine pre-cooler\u0022 part as a template? Because that does not produce any ElectricCharge at all by default. The B9 one may do so.\n\nYou can try using the Basic Jet Engine as a template, set it to produce almost zero thrust, and modify the ModuleAlternator entry so it generates your \u0022RPM\u0022 instead of EC (alternatively, add a separate ModuleAlternator to do just that).\n\nThe ModuleAlternator output is proportional to the engine\u0027s throttle output, so it does what you want.\n\nYou could also try the ModuleResourceConverter for the same purpose, however, I don\u0027t know if that can be set to respond to throttle output."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T23:52:24Z","Content":"Right that\u0027s beasically what I did.
