The SuperLarge panel can resist 6 thousand degrees Celcius!

Spudman is right, glass shouldn\u0027t be heavy but should have low crash tolerance. The bigger the piece, the lower the tolerance, and vise versa. As of the melting point, it is high on purpose. You can tweak it down if you want to, but the original mod will stay the same. Because there is more surface to heat, the bigger the panel, the higher the melting point. Currently the temperature is in Kelvin if I\u0027m not mistaken, so it\u0027s not as absurd when you think about it. lol.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n**Update 1.5 is released!**\n\nAll parts have been rebalanced.\n\nGlass tube now has fuel crossfeed capabilities.\n\nTechTree integration.\n\nEnjoy!"},{"CreatedByName":"2001kraft","CreatedById":120475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T18:29:51Z","Content":"**Update 1.5.1 is released!**\n\nFixed entryCost numbers and removed a useless, empty folder! \n\nSorry, lol."},{"CreatedByName":"2001kraft","CreatedById":120475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T07:14:43Z","Content":"I decided to remodel the tube.
