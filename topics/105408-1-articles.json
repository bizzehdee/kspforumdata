Basically a pod on top of an SRB, this is actually your only form of flight at the start of a new Career game. The liquid fuel parts are locked under Basic Rocketry, along with a new node.\n\u003E \n\u003E We also start with the Mystery Goo Canister, planted on the sides of the pod. It\u0027s actually a bit smaller than before, which is certainly convenient.\n\u003E \n\u003E Before we go, take a look in the bottom-right: that\u0027s the new Engineer\u0027s Report.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s like a checklist of potential problems: minor, major and catastrophic, from right to left.\n\u003E \n\u003E For this vessel, it initially reported some staging errors from the parachute and booster being on the same stage.\n\u003E \n\u003E It also warned me about some monopropellant that wasn\u0027t in use, interestingly enough.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![46BmYICh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/46BmYICh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Here we are at the Launchpad interface. You\u0027ll notice that Valentina is already available, as an alternate pilot alongside Jeb.\n\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s also a little picture of your craft in the top-right, and the button to select your mission flag has been updated.\n\u003E \n\u003E Finally, notice the small blue button next to the current time; that\u0027s the mythical \u0022Warp until morning\u0022 button.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyways, everything seems nominal here, so let\u0027s launch this thing!\n\u003E \n\u003E ![nFTr7rPh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nFTr7rPh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E And we\u0027re ready to go! The mandatory \u0022hop out and take Crew Reports 5 feet above the ground\u0022 took place off-camera.\n\u003E \n\u003E One thing to note is a button change: the B key is now used to re-enter the pod while in EVA, while the F key is used to let go (though I didn\u0027t actually test it to find out).\n\u003E \n\u003E Now launching in 3... 2... 1...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![R2EuNdhh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/R2EuNdhh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Whoa! This thing is *fast*! ...Yeah, I actually had to revert the whole launch and try again to get a good picture.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyways, a few things of note. First of all, you\u0027ll see a few messages in the right.\n\u003E \n\u003E You get a couple of free contracts that don\u0027t count to the contract limit now, though they\u0027re just simple record-breaking contracts. In this picture, I\u0027ve broken the records for 150m/s and 300m/s in rapid succession, with 450m/s occurring just a few seconds later.\n\u003E \n\u003E In addition, though it\u0027s obviously not visible now, the camera shakes when the rocket\u0027s moving; quite violently in this case, due to the sheer speed involved.\n\u003E \n\u003E I was expecting some rapid unplanned disassembly from it, but fortunately it seems to be harmless.\n\u003E \n\u003E Whether that\u0027ll be the case with future launches remains to be seen.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![RBRmXX1h.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RBRmXX1h.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Here we are right at the top of our launch: it\u0027s not too far off the ground, actually.\n\u003E \n\u003E Though some people could make it to Mun on their first launch, this (admittedly simple) design couldn\u0027t make it past 5000m.\n\u003E \n\u003E So it\u0027s definitely harder to \u0022sequence-break\u0022 now, though probably still possible.\n\u003E \n\u003E You can just make out the cables of the chutes in this shot, as well.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![8wtMRlIh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8wtMRlIh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E On our way down, I stop to look at our contracts list, and it\u0027s rather impressive.\n\u003E \n\u003E Remember the \u0022free\u0022 contracts I mentioned? This is how many we\u0027ve claimed in just one mission.\n\u003E \n\u003E For reference, the contracts I picked out were \u0022Launch our first vessel!\u0022 and \u0022Gather scientific data from Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E The second contract is technically new, but now too exciting.\n\u003E \n\u003E As it implies, you simply need to gather science during your flight, and recover it afterwards.\n\u003E \n\u003E Notably, this one doesn\u0027t have any biome or elevation requirements: you can complete it on the surface or in the air.\n\u003E \n\u003E It also offers a seemingly absurd amount of money, at least in my opinion. You\u0027ll see what I mean later...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![PJsB4izl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PJsB4izl.jpg)![RgxPD54l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RgxPD54l.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E These pictures were taken as the parachute deploys.\n\u003E \n\u003E Keep in mind, this isn\u0027t some split-second timing on my part: the first picture was actually taken about a second after the chute began opening.\n\u003E \n\u003E The parachutes open slowly now, instead of quickly \u0027snapping\u0027 to maximum size, and I think it looks pretty nice.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![ReNlBrPh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ReNlBrPh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Of course, no good launch is complete without a potential wallpaper! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E This is how it would look to a spectator on the ground. (Or at least, that was my intention)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![JWJK4Muh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JWJK4Muh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E And our landing is successful! We landed in the area between the pad and the crawlerway.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb gets out of the pod and decides to go plant a flag, before remembering that this is Career Mode and flags don\u0027t exist yet.\n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe someday, Jeb... Maybe someday.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![dz2Imxfl.png](http://i.imgur.com/dz2Imxfl.png)](http://imgur.com/dz2Imxf) [![KBrsuZTl.png](http://i.imgur.com/KBrsuZTl.png)](http://imgur.com/KBrsuZT)\n\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s our recovery data. Sorry about the size; I didn\u0027t want to put two massive images in a vertical row. You can get a better look at it on the imgur album.\n\u003E \n\u003E I also put links on these pictures, so you don\u0027t have to scroll all the way back up. You\u0027re welcome. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E Finally, just to avoid confusion, I edited all the windows together for convenience. The recovery window still has the same size and appearance ingame.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyways, this is all the cool stuff we got from this mission. Take a quick look at our funds count: I started with $15,000, and now we have $119,144.\n\u003E \n\u003E *I just got over $100,000 from the first mission*.\n\u003E \n\u003E I assume this is because of all the stuff to buy (strategies, employees, part research, etc.), but it seems a bit excessive to me, especially since I\u0027m playing on Moderate. I guess time will tell.\n\u003E \n\u003E Before we go, there\u0027s some new stuff that needs to be shown off.\n\u003E \n\u003E Let\u0027s take a quick look at the new tech tree first.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![gKSfTFOh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gKSfTFOh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E This is how the tech tree looks now. As you can tell, every node is now visible at once, which I think is a big improvement.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve also selected a new node in this picture: Engineering 101.\n\u003E \n\u003E Placed in the same \u0027tier\u0027 as Basic Rocketry, this one focuses on... well, engineering.\n\u003E \n\u003E Our old friend the Science Bay is here, along with the stack decoupler, the first antenna and the first place cockpit.\n\u003E \n\u003E Conversely, Basic Rocketry contains the \u0027old\u0027 SRB, along with a liquid fuel engine and our first liquid fuel tank.\n\u003E \n\u003E Yep, liquid fuel isn\u0027t available at all until you get Basic Rocketry.\n\u003E \n\u003E Just looking at this tech tree has me interested. I see a new node in there already; it\u0027s just past Stability, and has an airplane icon on it.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m a bit mixed about that: it\u0027s cool to see more airplane parts, but I was never any good at building stable planes before.\n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe I\u0027ll give it a try later.\n\u003E \n\u003E Finally, I also got the Survivability node, which contains a few new parts!\n\u003E \n\u003E Let\u0027s look at those too before we leave.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![p9kSdwul.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/p9kSdwul.jpg)](http://imgur.com/p9kSdwu) [![GRqZJ6Vl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GRqZJ6Vl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/GRqZJ6V) [![dXhhb2Vl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dXhhb2Vl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/dXhhb2V)\n\u003E \n\u003E Again, sorry about the size; the imgur album offers a clearer look. These pictures are linked as well.\n\u003E \n\u003E Now then, these are the three new parts I\u0027ve seen.\n\u003E \n\u003E The first one is your starting SRB: the RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s pretty powerful if you\u0027re just pushing a pod, but as a \u0027downgrade\u0027 of the RT-10, it\u0027s not as good at gaining altitude.\n\u003E \n\u003E This one has 100 units of solid fuel, and as stated gets this craft up to about 4500m.\n\u003E \n\u003E The next one is an exciting one: the first heat shield!\n\u003E \n\u003E Re-entry heating is now a thing in Kerbal Space Program, and this part\u0027s here to save your kerbals from an impromptu marshmallow roast.\n\u003E \n\u003E It also comes with a new resource; \u0022Ablator\u0022. I\u0027m not too knowledgeable on this kind of thing, but I assume it\u0027s *probably* a pseudo-durability meter.\n\u003E \n\u003E With it\u0027s size, it seems like it\u0027s meant to be attached to the bottom of this pod.\n\u003E \n\u003E Finally, we have a service bay, also 1.25m in size.\n\u003E \n\u003E I haven\u0027t actually tested this out yet, so I\u0027m not too sure what it does just yet.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s basically a hollow container that you can put parts in; for this example, I put a few Mystery Goo Containers inside.\n\u003E \n\u003E The purpose is to protect your more fragile and important parts during re-entry.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nAnyways, that took quite a while, so I\u0027m calling it a day.\n\nUpdates will occur ideally every day from here on out, but that\u0027ll probably change after a while.\n\nI don\u0027t want to completely exhaust myself from KSP, after all.\n\nIn any case, thanks for reading this first mission, and hopefully there will be many more coming!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T02:48:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 02:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gmbigg**\n  \nAdded spoiler to make navigation easier."},{"CreatedByName":"gmbigg","CreatedById":107412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:45:03Z","Content":"**Chapter 1 - Visit the Mun**\n\n**Kerbin Year 2001, Day 2**\n\n[Imgur Album](http://imgur.com/a/N290f)\n\n\u003E ![8FZMt5Zh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8FZMt5Zh.jpg)\n\u003E Here we are at... the Administration Building. Why are we here? Well, there\u0027s a few strategies, new to 1.0, that I want to point out here.\n\u003E \n\u003E The two new strategies are \u0022Research Rights Sell-Out\u0022 and \u0022Bail-Out Grant\u0022; though only the first one is pictured, they both have similar functions.\n\u003E \n\u003E These strategies convert science and reputation, respectively, into funds. The cool thing about these, however, is that this is an instant, one-time deal.\n\u003E \n\u003E Once you click accept, the Funds are awarded instantly. Perhaps not too exciting, but something I thought was worth sharing.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![WPBmtYNl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WPBmtYNl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/WPBmtYN) [![BUmxXVyl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BUmxXVyl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/BUmxXVy)\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyways, let\u0027s get ready for our second mission. This is our craft, which in no way, shape, or form resembles a nuclear warhead.\n\u003E \n\u003E For this mission, we\u0027re sending out Valentina Kerman, the new recruit to the Kerbal Space Center (even though she was already here on opening day).\n\u003E \n\u003E Like Jebediah, she\u0027s also a fearless pilot. Her courage is also a little higher, and her stupidity is a little lower. Not that it matters much.\n\u003E \n\u003E As for the craft itself, it uses an SRB for the first stage, with our first look at liquid fuel for it\u0027s second stage. Since I don\u0027t know how high it can take us, we\u0027ve also packed a heat shield, just in case.\n\u003E \n\u003E You can also see the service bay, with some Goo Containers and antennas inside.\n\u003E \n\u003E One thing of note is that most \u0027engine\u0027 parts have new subtitles. For example, the LV-T30 is now subtitled the \u0022Reliant\u0022 engine, while the RT-10 SRB is now the \u0022Hammer\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E The Engineer Report is also warning me that I have no way of producing electric charge, because the antennas require it to transmit data.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s actually pretty clever, now that I\u0027ve tested it. If you have an engine with an alternator, it\u0027ll note that when giving you the warning.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027ll also warn you if you\u0027re lacking an important resource (like oxidizer for liquid fuel engines), or if you\u0027re going to jettison an engine without ever firing it (and tells you to ignore the warning if it\u0027s meant to be a missile)\n\u003E \n\u003E Finally, though I didn\u0027t show it in the picture, the decouplers now have a tweakable ejection force. (I think that\u0027s new, at least; I don\u0027t remember if that was in 0.90)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![SA3wcuXh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SA3wcuXh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Clearly, Valentina isn\u0027t interested in wasting any more time. Just look at that smile!\n\u003E \n\u003E I didn\u0027t actually notice last time, due to how fast we were off the ground, but there is some new effects following a launch.\n\u003E \n\u003E For instance, this dust cloud is now visible just after you\u0027ve left the pad.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![RsKm5Lqh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RsKm5Lqh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Some time later, Valentina approaches the 25 kilometer mark. The Hammer was ejected some time ago, and most of the liquid fuel has already been used up.\n\u003E \n\u003E The engine *is* still running, by the way: I just didn\u0027t think to move the camera from this angle. You can sort of see the flame effect behind the navball.\n\u003E \n\u003E Not long after, though it was unlikely we\u0027d actually manage to orbit Kerbin, I decided to begin a gravity turn anyways.\n\u003E \n\u003E Unfortunately, it seems Valentina passed the limits of our communications shortly after, as all contact was lost. If any pictures from space were sent, they\u0027ve all been lost now.\n\u003E \n\u003E Or I may have forgotten. Either one\u0027s possible.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![3whzVRgh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3whzVRgh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E This picture was taken shortly after communications returned. The effects of re-entry are just beginning to show here, and they don\u0027t seem much different than before.\n\u003E \n\u003E The camera was shaking more, though, which added to the ...fun of the whole thing.\n\u003E \n\u003E Will Valentina return home safely? Will our heat shield stand up to the intense heat of re-entry? What happened to Valentina\u0027s face?\n\u003E \n\u003E Find out in the next episode!\n\u003E \n\u003E ...Nah, just kidding. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![tEDOEqih.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tEDOEqih.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Valentina was moving pretty fast; normally I deploy chutes at about 10km up, but with the speed we had, and the risk of our chute burning up completely, I had to deploy at just 2km above the ocean.\n\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps not *too* bad, in the grand scheme of things, but it\u0027s out of my normal comfort zone. At least I can say I did something new today!\n\u003E \n\u003E As for our contracts... just look on the right. I think each \u0027free\u0027 contract has about 5 levels, and we got most of them done in this one mission.\n\u003E \n\u003E **12** contracts were completed today, including the one I actually selected in Mission Control: \u0022Escape the atmosphere!\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![em0ipIwh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/em0ipIwh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s the spot where we landed. For the newer players here, the little yellow landmass, just to the left of the capsule icon, is where the Space Center is located.\n\u003E \n\u003E I think this was about 30-35km away, though I didn\u0027t actually bother checking. It was, however, close enough to be able to see it inside the Space Center screen.\n\u003E \n\u003E As for what we recovered from this mission...\n\u003E \n\u003E [![ZT3s66Il.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZT3s66Il.jpg)](http://imgur.com/ZT3s66I) [![8pI2H7Yl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8pI2H7Yl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/8pI2H7Y)\n\u003E \n\u003E ...I\u0027m too lazy to write it out, so here\u0027s some pictures instead.\n\u003E \n\u003E Look closely at the left picture. That mission earned us over double the profit of the first one; we\u0027ve jumped from $119,144 to *$356,384*.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s certainly easier to upgrade buildings, at least; I bought the Level 2 Mission Control after this, and have about $250,000 left; plenty for future missions.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![3crf8bwh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3crf8bwh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s a look at my tech tree. After this mission, I bought the rest of the Tier 3 nodes; Advanced Rocketry and Stability.\n\u003E \n\u003E This got me the LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022 engine, a radial decoupler, and a larger liquid fuel tank.\n\u003E \n\u003E This is that new node I mentioned in the last post: Aviation.\n\u003E \n\u003E It provides most of the basic parts you\u0027d need to build an airplane, and seems to be quite a bit easier to get than it was in 0.90. We\u0027ve also got some new landing gear, it seems!\n\u003E \n\u003E Looking forward into the tree, at Tier 6 it seems to separate into three parts: the top part focuses on powerful rockets, the middle part focuses on airplane and SSTOs, and the bottom part focuses more on utilities: science, mining, probes, etc.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m really looking forward to getting into mining Ore, so that portion will probably be our focus in this playthrough.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nI\u0027ve decided to divide this playthrough into chapters, each one focusing on a specific goal. For this first chapter, that goal is to leave Kerbin\u0027s Sphere Of Influence (SOI) and enter the Mun\u0027s SOI.\n\nAfter that, I\u0027d like to land on both Mun and Minmus, and hopefully test out some new ideas on our way to interplanetary missions.\n\nOf course, that\u0027s all just wishful thinking at this point in time. Hopefully we won\u0027t have too much trouble.\n\nExpect a mission to get an orbit around Kerbin next mission, along with the addition of a few mods now that they\u0027ve had the chance to update.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T02:47:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 02:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gmbigg**\n  \nAdded spoiler to make navigation easier."},{"CreatedByName":"gmbigg","CreatedById":107412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T02:45:16Z","Content":"**Kerbin Year 2001, Day 2**\n\n[Imgur Album](http://imgur.com/a/Oh59m)\n\n![BJkmqmrh.png](http://i.imgur.com/BJkmqmrh.png)\n\nSo, welcome back! If you don\u0027t remember me, I started a save file for about two days, then forgot about it for two months. In any case, let\u0027s get back to where we left off.\n\nHere\u0027s the Space Center as it was last time I left; looks pretty boring.\n\nAs promised, there are mods for this mission; you can see a few of them at the top right. The clock is for Kerbal Alarm Clock, while the starry icon is for Distant Object Enhancement.\n\nIf you want links to those mods, along with all the others, go back to the first post and open the \u0022Mod List\u0022 spoiler. I can wait.\n\n[![OwB70mRl.png](http://i.imgur.com/OwB70mRl.png)](http://imgur.com/OwB70mR) [![PJmpGv1l.png](http://i.imgur.com/PJmpGv1l.png)](http://imgur.com/PJmpGv1)\n\nThanks for coming back! I hope those mods weren\u0027t too awesome for your tastes.\n\nAnyways, this is our rocket: the Time-Tested Thruster Thingy, or TTTT. Kerbals never cease to amaze with their brilliant naming ideas.\n\nPast simulations have shown that this rocket is more than capable of making it into space. However, the simulated rocket had a slightly different design (no fins, mostly), and was made in a semi-outdated simulation (0.90).\n\nWill it be able to hold up to the rigors of reality? That\u0027s what we\u0027re here to find out.\n\n![zhEp9xRh.png](http://i.imgur.com/zhEp9xRh.png)\n\nAnd here we are on the launchpad, once again.\n\nFor this mission, Jebediah Kerman\u0027s heading up into space, and hopefully into orbit. From there, it\u0027s not much of a leap to encountering Mun. At least, that\u0027s the plan.\n\nHowever, Jeb can\u0027t help but feel a chilling sense of deja vu getting into this rocket.\n\nObviously, he wasn\u0027t involved in the simulations, but something seems off about this rocket.\n\nHave you ever had a premonition of something going catastrophically wrong, ending in a cataclysmic explosion as your pod flips over the wrong way mid re-entry?\n\nThat\u0027s what\u0027s passing through Jeb\u0027s head right now. But I\u0027m sure it\u0027s nothing, right? ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)\n\n![pvtlbBSh.png](http://i.imgur.com/pvtlbBSh.png)\n\nSomehow, the rocket doesn\u0027t immediately explode, and Jeb\u0027s airborne.\n\nIt may have been two months since I last played, but I still really enjoy those launching effects.\n\nThere\u0027s serious \u0027weight\u0027 behind a launch now, and it really makes it feel like this rocket is important.\n\nOf course, it\u0027s technically the second time I\u0027ve seen it, so... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n![mMNmPVhh.png](http://i.imgur.com/mMNmPVhh.png)\n\nA few kilometres off the ground, Jeb decides to take a look at the various new systems available to him.\n\nAs you can tell, there\u0027s quite a list of new mods available. The clock of Kerbal Alarm Clock is still here, along with a microphone indicating the presence of Chatterer.\n\nChatterer is just a sound mod, so it won\u0027t have any relevance to you as the viewer, but I find that the game just feels \u0027empty\u0027 without it.\n\nNear the top-left is an icon for PlanetShine, a mod that works to provide ambient lighting in space; primarily, obviously, through the use of planetshine.\n\nIt\u0027s a little technical; I\u0027d recommend checking out the mod page for details.\n\nWe also have a satellite icon, on both the top-left and the top-right, for SCANsat.\n\nSCANsat is one of the few mods I have that introduces parts; in this case, a small collection of mapping tools to... well, map the surfaces of other planets and moons.\n\nWe don\u0027t actually have any of those parts available to us right now, so that\u0027s won\u0027t be relevant to this mission either.\n\nBut I do plan to send up satellites to map the surfaces in the future, as it\u0027s a great tool to have for landings and provides more purpose to unmanned craft.\n\n![FYJ5UVbh.png](http://i.imgur.com/FYJ5UVbh.png)\n\nBut that\u0027s enough analyzing for now; we have a spaceship to pilot.\n\nAt about the 15km mark, Jeb starts a gravity turn. This is accomplished by slowly turning sideways as you ascend, and is necessary for achieving a stable orbit.\n\nThis picture was taken at the 23km mark; my turn was a bit gradual, but the alternative is turning too much and flipping over, which rarely ends well.\n\nWe\u0027ll also be staging shortly, as this stage is nearly out of fuel.\n\n![3PHl9nFh.png](http://i.imgur.com/3PHl9nFh.png)\n\nHere\u0027s how our orbit is looking not long after. Our goal was to reach an apoapsis (maximum height) of 100km, then shut off the engines to conserve fuel until we get near 100km.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with how this works, an orbit is, at it\u0027s most basic, a circle that the rocket travels around the planet. Though what goes up normally comes down, a rocket in orbit goes fast enough to ensure that it *never*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9 comes down.\n\nGoing just straight up won\u0027t make an orbit; that will likely make us leave Kerbin\u0027s Sphere of Influence entirely. To make an orbit, we need to also turn ourselves sideways a bit to travel in the direction we want to go. In this case, we want to travel up and east; going east moves us with Kerbin\u0027s rotation and conserves fuel.\n\n(And I owe that knowledge to this game. Thanks, Squad!)\n\n![lqzf26dh.png](http://i.imgur.com/lqzf26dh.png)\n\nA short time later, the rocket reaches 100km above the surface, and so Jeb orients the rocket and turns the engines back on.\n\nBy waiting until we\u0027re near the apoapsis, we\u0027ve further conserved our fuel; it\u0027s easier to change your Periapsis (the lowest point of the orbit) when you\u0027re near your Apoapsis (the highest point of the orbit).\n\nJeb keeps the rocket going until he runs out of fuel, then checks to see how awesome his new orbit is.\n\n![FFnlq73h.png](http://i.imgur.com/FFnlq73h.png)\n\n...Well, that\u0027s a problem.\n\nYeah, either I\u0027ve done something wrong during this flight, or this design just doesn\u0027t cut it anymore. Considering the changes to aerodynamics in 1.0, I assume it must be the latter.\n\n(Because I\u0027m an awesome pilot, all the time. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))\n\nFor reference, a stable orbit would be going all the way around the planet without touching it, and would have a visible Periapsis icon showing a minimum height of over 70km.\n\nThis flight path is known as a suborbital flight; basically, it means we\u0027re not going fast enough for an orbit, and what went up will now come down.\n\n![pjh4U7ah.png](http://i.imgur.com/pjh4U7ah.png)\n\nThis means, unfortunately, that this mission was a failure. For now, Jeb will have to focus on making it down safely, and the engineers will have to return to the drawing board for this one.\n\nSince this booster is empty now too, it\u0027s safe to eject it now. We\u0027ll want to do that before we get into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere; ejecting it now gives us ample time to get away from it, which reduces the chances of it crashing on our heads as we descend. With re-entry heating, those chances are probably *very* low, but better safe than sorry.\n\nOne more mod to show off before we go is Distant Object Enhancement, though it\u0027s not too obvious here. See that bright green dot in the top-right, just above the words \u0022Contract Complete\u0022? That\u0027s Jool, the local gas giant.\n\nThe Distant Object Enhancement mod shows the positions of every planet and moon, from anywhere in the solar system, as glowing dots.\n\nNot too practical, but a very nice aesthetics mod. It also allows you to see debris and other vessels from a considerable distance.\n\n![k642d9Ch.png](http://i.imgur.com/k642d9Ch.png)\n\nA few minutes later, and Jebediah is nervously waiting in his pod while the heating effects of re-entry surround his vessel.\n\nSo, I suppose it\u0027s time for a confession; this is technically the second time I attempted this mission. The first time, everything went pretty similar to how you see it now, but with one notable change.\n\nSee, back in 1.0.0, there was a bug that prevented heat shields from applying their weight normally, with a side effect of making the capsules \u0022top-heavy\u0022. At least, that\u0027s what I *think* the problem was, but it seems pretty likely.\n\nEither way, the capsule suddenly flipped over partway down, and the re-entry forces stopped me from flipping it back. Jebediah ended up dying mid re-entry, exactly as his premonitions earlier predicted.\n\nI don\u0027t remember ever losing a Kerbal before that point (by accident, anyways), and I had never lost Jebediah of all Kerbals before. I was pretty devastated, and ended up reverting the whole mission just to keep Jeb around.\n\nThat\u0027s not the only reason why I stopped; real life got in the way, too. But I\u0027m sure this mission would have been made much earlier if that hadn\u0027t happened.\n\n![coyFezMh.png](http://i.imgur.com/coyFezMh.png)\n\nFortunately, that bug has been fixed, and so no unexpected flipping occurs. Jebediah makes it down, safe and sound, and is shown here deploying his parachute safely.\n\nAnother water landing is in the cards this time, which means there won\u0027t be any more science to do. A bit disappointing; it would have been nice to land somewhere new and get a bit of \u0027compensation\u0027 for this wasted mission.\n\nAt least everything went to plan otherwise.\n\n![tl4hzJSh.png](http://i.imgur.com/tl4hzJSh.png)\n\nHere\u0027s our recovery info. Unlike the other flights, the pilot and the ship were recovered at the same time, as there was no reason for Jebediah to leave the pod.\n\nFortunately, our contract choices got us a decent profit, bringing our funds up to $346,743 from $258,518.\n\nI didn\u0027t realize until as I was typing this up that I made a pretty bad mistake; I picked a picture with a different money counter.\n\nHow did this happen? Well, you can\u0027t see it here since I blocked the evidence, but I actually upgraded the Astronaut Complex in this picture, and copy-pasted the boxes into that picture without realizing.\n\nFor the record, the count up top is more accurate, and shows the *current* money count after the upgrade.\n\nUpgrading the Astronaut Complex increases the number of employees we can hire, which means more potential rookies to train up in the future.\n\nMore important for right now, however, is that it also improves our EVA capabilities. Now we can not only plant flags, but EVA up in deep space is now a viable option.\n\nThis should help to get us more Science for our next flight, which in turn should make it easier to achieve our mission sooner.\n\nSo that concludes this long-overdue mission. At this point, I think it\u0027s safer to say that new updates will come out \u0022when they\u0027re ready\u0022. \n\nNext time, I think we\u0027ll take a quick break from our goals here to try to fulfill some more contracts, and hopefully unlock another tech tree node or two in the process.\n\nWe\u0027ll also take some time to check out the new parts that have been added; besides some modded parts, we\u0027ll also check out the radiators added in 1.0.3 if I can unlock any now."}]}
