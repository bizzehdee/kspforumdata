What angle do you mean: angle relative to horizon or prograde ? Are you sure you don\u0027t mean altitude ? Does this happen while in atmosphere or vacuum ? What type of engine are you using ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are very specific about your problem, it will be easier to solve it. Screenshots also help a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, if you\u0027re using a jet engine (in air-breathing more if RAPIER) it could be because of intakes not receiving enough air due to the angle of attack of your plane (air flow is then not directly aimed at the intake and it is less efficient). Jet engines stop if they do not receive enough air; and if you have several jet engines, they may not get all the same amount of air, resulting in some engines switching on and off, and not others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re too high, atmosphere gets thinner and engines receive less air, it may be linked to your issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps a little, but please add screenshots, they are really helpful \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pitbull81","CreatedById":69341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T18:56:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk i will take some screenshot tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not use jet engine but these engine : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55985\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55985\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm aware about the lack of air at high altitude. but i will take few screenshot in few minute and post them here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
