A version with movable guiding fins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBobCat has made one for his MIR / ISS mod. It was very good modeled, but it had the problem, that the docking alignment was 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 sideways. That meant, it was impossible to use any kind of docking help like the docking port alignment indicator by NavyFish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaidernick had made one too in his 1.4 version of his wonderful Salyut Stations \u0026amp; Soyuz mod. It looks very nice, but he published it May 27th and locked the thread June 6th. I missed the possibility to get a copy. That is very sad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther versions with movable guiding fins I don\u0027t know. So I would like to ask for help. Is any modder would be able to make one working APAS-75 docking module, I would be very greatful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a lot in advance,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Isabelle\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMeeb","CreatedById":84238,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T13:37:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the KOSMOS mod, there is an APAS-75 (it\u0027s called the APAS-69, but that\u0027s just a rename) with movable guiding fins.
