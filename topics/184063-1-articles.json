I\u0027m trying to build a large interplanetary platform to drop recon vessels and stuff. I\u0027ve installed a lot of mods : station parts extension, near future propulsion, electrical and construction, opt, planetary base inc, kerbetrotter ltd, rovers, BFR stuff. Everything works fine, but my hitchiker\u00A0storage containers top and bottom became transparent. It wouldn\u0027t be a problem but currently i\u0027ve got 2 HSC on the first 3 module of my station and it doesn\u0027t look good. Is there any way to fix it or I just need to start from the beginning? I\u0027m using 1.4.5 KSP.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-28T22:58:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like some mods conflicting somewhere.\u00A0 Best way to narrow it down is to delete half your mods \u0026amp; see if it\u0027s still doing it.\u00A0 If it IS, delete half of the remaining mods \u0026amp; keep going until you narrow it down.\u00A0 If it ISN\u0022T, delete all the remaining mods \u0026amp; reload the first half that were removed \u0026amp; try to narrow those down.\u00A0\u00A0 I\u0027m in the middle of doing this right now to chase down a weird lighting issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso it can help to post a log if possible - I\u0027m no expert at reading them, but some of the folks on here can point you in the right direction.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
