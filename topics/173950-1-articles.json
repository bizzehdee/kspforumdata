The most useful for stability is \u0022friction control\u0022 which determines how much wheels \u0022bite\u0022. Leaving friction control at auto is a bad idea! Auto is like\u00A0\u0022stupid\u0022 or something. Setting friction control to 0 makes wheels frictionless which is great for sliding around and not flipping, but you can\u0027t accelerate, brake or steer... Setting friction control to 5 will make the wheels toss the rover around, any loss of traction will cause severe forces on the rover. Usually, the best handling is found with a friction control of 0.5-0.8. Happily you can even adjust friction control on the fly, the main thing you lose with a low friction control is braking power (it\u0027s not such a problem in terms of acceleration), so if you\u0027ve set friction control to a low value for improved stability, you can just crank it up for improved braking, like to make the rover stay still on a slope. It also tends to be helpful to have a lower friction control on front wheels than rear wheels, because the front wheels are more prone to cause flipping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-16T11:21:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2018 11:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by blakemw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-16T11:26:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223355797\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022173950\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221523877048\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168819\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blakemw\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, blakemw said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nt\u0027s instructive to watch this really short video about center of mass:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only will this help you in game, but it\u0027s a very pertinent life skill.\u00A0 The vast majority of people will end up loading a moving truck or trailer at some time in their life, and it\u0027s good to understand how to load one.\u00A0 As a medic, I have responded to quite a number of trailers that got loose due to poor loading.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-16T17:36:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can take this a step further...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had similar problems with my Mun rover. I made all of the above suggested adjustment - brakes, traction, steering enabled/disabled, etc. Still, I found myself with many a time where I\u0027d be flipping my rover. Reducing your speed prior to attempting to make a turn is a big help, but there are moments when this has no bearing or help what-so-ever, like when your rover makes a hop (takes air) over a bump or crater rim.
