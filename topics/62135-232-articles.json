I checked the craft file in Notepad\u002B\u002B and I could\u0027ve sworn they were saved trimmed, but they didn\u0027t load trimmed. The .zip I downloaded last night definitely has more action groups than the one in the .exe, but I haven\u0027t gotten around to loading it up yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you should post the trims for the engines in the OP in case this stuff happens again. I think it\u0027s in videos, but I\u0027m connected via 3G cellphone right now and can\u0027t look those up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, on the FAR patches by the community (this is for people who\u0027re considering FAR/NEAR) I got into orbit using NEAR with a bit of fiddling to make the gimbals right, but when I tried to land there just wasn\u0027t enough drag to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got through reentry safely, but the craft\u0027s lift got it back up to 30K before it could slow down, and it got stuck at 1,700m/s. I got up, had something to drink, visited the bathroom, came back two minutes later and I was still at roughly the same altitude and speed. This was an entirely unpowered reentry attempt in NEAR. With FAR, the supersonic flight changes would\u0027ve probably made me do loopy-loops above the KSC, followed by aerodynamically ripping off the wings and the back right landing gear, but it appears that in NEAR there won\u0027t be enough drag to land the KSO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is, I got the KSO to fly stock even with FAR installed for everything else once, when I\u0027d accidentally forgotten to patch the KSO to FAR the first time I tried this mod. I\u0027m thinking it\u0027ll be possible to keep NEAR for my rockets and to set up the KSO on stock aerodynamics. I\u0027m going to look into it and if it\u0027s possible, I\u0027ll note it here.
