An alternate way of doing it probably could be taking an engine and test running it on the launch pad. Check the engine\u0027s plume size while firing and you could use a part(s) in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to place under the engine to show the size of the plume.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Iodyne","CreatedById":193337,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-21T23:46:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHa I didn\u0027t mean you had to answer lol; just laughing at how it got 30 views and noone seemed to have an answer. I guess it shows that it indeed does not exist. Yeah launchpad works fine, just thinking maybe it\u0027d make a useful mod and not having to deal with loading times...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr even to allow \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to act within \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E so one doesn\u0027t have to resort to editing into orbit (although I guess now that I think about it, KRASH kind of does this) although again with loading times, but perhaps switching from editor to physics requires such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks anyways for the reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrionix","CreatedById":201588,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-21T23:50:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish I could create a mod that does this, but I too don\u0027t know much about modding...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clamp-o-Tron","CreatedById":201818,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-22T01:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOops... wrong thread.
