You\u0027ll want to leave the back open so you can access it to deploy. This craft will of course be incapable of going retrograde inside the atmosphere...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m not sure radiators are even meant to do anything useful in the atmosphere? For some reason I thought they were used for heat sink while in space where you can\u0027t use atmospheric ventilation. Either way there are static radiator panels that don\u0027t fly off so easily, and I\u0027d be really curious what you\u0027ve built that needs this much heat radiation while in flight within the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: For whatever reason I decided to try this. It works fine as long as you never change trajectory, but if you do, even slightly, you will lose your panels no matter how occluded they are, even totally entombed in structural panels and surrounded by tanks. I have no idea whether this is because atmospheric physics are imperfect or because Kerbals can\u0027t make an airtight weld or what, but that\u0027s what my testing suggests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T23:50:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 11:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hagen von Tronje\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T00:21:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for trying. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is for an aircraft travelling just above sea level (240m) going as fast as possible. Obviously the problem is heat. I\u0027ve tried dumping heat with radiator panels but as I understand it they only dump heat from the part they are attached to. The hottest part of my aircraft is the fairing streamlining the front and you can\u0027t attach radiator panels to any part of a fairing. The Thermal Control System parts seem to work differently by pulling heat out of all the parts of the craft. So that\u0027s why I\u0027m trying to get one or more on this craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T00:44:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see what you\u0027re getting at, low atmosphere super/hypersonic jets? Makes sense you\u0027d dump heat for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately the closest thing to an idea that I have is, bizarrely enough, maybe attaching Gigantor solar panels to the fuselage, in the open, and not extending them. This only even occurs to me because I\u0027ve seen them get way hotter than the rest of the craft on some atmospheric entries, which makes me wonder if physics don\u0027t make them act as heatsinks even retracted. Obviously they might explode from overheating, too, and I might even just be a dummy seeing things where they don\u0027t exist, but that\u0027s all I got.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can say that retractable radiators do seem to pull heat from any part, I\u0027ve sent sun-diving probes with nuclear engines and large radiators, and the panels did in fact heat up in thermal display after the nukes got pretty hot despite being attached to the body of the craft. But I have no idea if the game treats heat from parts the same as heat from drag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
