There was no map view, so you had to do math or check your speed on a lookup table to see whether you were even in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were a total of only 11 parts in the VAB. For propulsion there were only 3: fuel tank, LV-T30 engine, and RT-10 solid booster. There were NO STRUTS and no fuel lines. Fuel tanks couldn\u0027t be placed radially, only solid boosters.
