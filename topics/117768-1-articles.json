During the development and testing of the engine they\u0027ve released tons of information and videos.\n\nThey really embrace the \u0022Kerbal way\u0022 to rocket science and they are doing an amazing job of making DIY-style rockets in their pursuit of launching humans to space.\n\nNow they need moar Funds to help with development so they\u0027ve just started an Indiegogo campaign for future research. Please support them, they are well worth it!\n\n[https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fund-the-world-s-only-manned-amateur-space-program#/story](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fund-the-world-s-only-manned-amateur-space-program#/story)\n\nMore info on the rocket [here](http://copenhagensuborbitals.com/roadmap/nexo-i/).\n\nTheir [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/CphSuborbitals)."},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T13:11:58Z","Content":"Copenhagen Suborbitals?
