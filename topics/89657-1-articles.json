A couple of months ago I did experiment with a variable geometry wing aircraft (The XNAFA-9) which used a system which copied that of the working cargo bay on the below thread to allow its wings to change in sweep (and move forward or backwards a bit) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92798-K-29B-bomber-Y-38-fighter-%28stock-props%29?highlight=y-38\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92798-K-29B-bomber-Y-38-fighter-%28stock-props%29?highlight=y-38\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test program was a complete failure though. The wings were completely unstable, and had to be kept in the forward position just because it was slightly more stable there. They were way too floppy, as in the wings were slanting themselves upwards in kind of a shallow V (which they weren\u0027t supposed to be doing, it was glitching through some pieces attached to the fuselage) and sometimes deciding to completely rotate around into the fuselage, either damaging or destroying the wings, and, at least one time, the middle of the fuselage (the only fatality in the program if \u0022revert flight\u0022 didn\u0027t exist). Using landing gear on the top and bottom of the wings to stabilize them actually worsened the problem. And the wings only rotated 10 or 15 degrees or something. I didn\u0027t get any pictures of it before .25 came out and ruined it, but I can show the ruined version and inner mechanism to prove it at least existed (or as much as something can on the computer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5yCM4GD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225yCM4GD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CB5Jizv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CB5Jizv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe inner mechanism to sweep the wings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZLaGdNi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZLaGdNi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint is that variable wing aircraft may be a possibility if in the hands of someone better at the game than me. If the wings can be stabilized in some manner to not start bending upwards or suddenly doing a 360 through the fuselage, then your variable wing tomcat may be able to be built. Or you could detach the wings but use built in hinges to allow them to rotate, and then some pushing and pulling mechanism to allow them to rotate. But both options do seem heavy and bulky, so I\u0027m guessing that really the only uses for variable geometry aircraft would be for aesthetics, aircraft which need to shift their center of life, or for aircraft in FAR or NEAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick afterthought: If you want more than the 10 degrees my wing was shifting, you could try using two of the mechanisms, one to sweep it the first 10 or 15 degrees and a second one to do it again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
