Their store of funds has been described at rivaling Scrooge McDuck\u0027s own cache of gold. Well, lament no more, because here is a way to spend it all and feel good* doing it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is inspired by the movie Brewster\u0027s Millions with Richard Pryor, where Brewster, a poor cat who loves baseball, discovers he had a rich uncle who had a sadistic sense of humor. Brewster could take just a million dollars inheritance, or take a chance towards 300 million dollars, if he can spend 30 million in 30 days. There were rules and stipulations which I have taken the time to translate to kerbalese below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You get a Kerbin year to spend all of those funds on missions. Not a minute more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Missions have to fulfill requirements typically given in contracts, although you aren\u0027t taking on any contracts(that would be rather self-defeating, after all).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Replicating testing contracts is allowed, but only one part can be tested at a time. You can not load up a rocket with a bunch of Sepratrons and call that a test. An experiment, maybe, but those have yet to become a contract requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Any parts (even marked as debris) left on Kerbin count as retrievable assets which can be converted to funds, which would count as a loss at the end of the year. Since flags cost nothing to place, those do not count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Funds can be spent on any KSC buildings or complexes that have yet to be fully upgraded (which is highly possible. I have yet to touch my SPH and Runway with my career) Of course, the KSC is not retrievable so does not count towards assets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No mission can be terminated. What is launched during the challenge stays active until it is actively retrieved. Anything not on Kerbin does not count towards retrievable assets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Using the Administration Building to convert funds to science or rep is not allowed. You already got a bulging account of science and any reputation will be questionable once you have driven your space program into the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you required entry purchase on research, funds can be spent to finish unlocking any leftover markers. (Bully for you if you make that choice)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You can hire four additional kerbals to aid you in this endeavour, but no more, since that would make it easy to just use up funds. You also can not tell any of your kerbals what you are doing. That would just inspire them to go kerbal and destroy a lot of vessels. Any true Space Program Director needs no help destroying craft made with the blood, sweat, and tears of kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bare bones:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZero funds after one Kerbin year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo Terminations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo retrievable assets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan not reveal your plans to your kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHarder difficulty stipulations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Include any parts left in LKO(Low Kerbin Orbit, which is about 300k meters highest) as retrievable assets, which must be de-orbited and any surviving parts then be retrieved and the resulting funds spent to accomplish the goal. (Yup, you need to ride it all the way down during de-orbiting...otherwise it wouldn\u0027t be that hard since the parts would just despawn upon entry in atmo)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All surviving kerbals must be Kerbinside when the year is over. You can\u0027t have some kerbal out in the void end up finding some pot of gold, now, can you? (Remember, no terminations) Bonus points for group photo taken outside the Astronaut Complex. Note the looks of despair on your kerbals as they have to find new employment now, thanks to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*- There are no guarantees you will actually feel good. The only reward is having an empty funds account, bankrupting your KSC, and knowing you completed the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to play out the challenge while watching the movie. There are some great actors in it and some funny moments, like watching a minor league team take on the New York Yankees.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cubeking2311","CreatedById":153013,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T00:18:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI obviously don\u0027t have the skills for this challenge, but couldn\u0027t you just blow up a building then repair it, then blow it up, then repair it, etc?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
