I have no idea how he did that, maybe it is the parts in the mod he is using. If you don\u0027t want to see the docking ports you can use the offset tool to put them so they only just stick out of the surface of the part. That way when they dock you can\u0027t see the ports."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T15:56:37Z","Content":"There is a docking port, it\u0027s just not a very visible one.
