You can\u0027t have everybody ranked #20. They have to fall in a #1-40 distribution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe the best way to think about it is that if you took an infinite number of classes, then your ranking in those classes would fall into a close-to Gaussian shape around some mean, and that mean would be your class rank (because infinite weighting from an infinite number of classes). So you can assume your class rank probability is currently described by a distribution (not a true normal distribution because the tails are limited -- can\u0027t be better than #1 or worse than #40) that surrounds your current average. Your\u00A0current average is about #7 (135 points/4 = almost 34). Unfortunately for you, there is more room to get worse than to get better, so it\u0027s a little more likely that the true value is worse than #7 than better. Still, that\u0027s in the top 20%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr to put it another way, the obvious answer (your current average rank is your current class rank) is the most likely one. It\u0027s possible, of course, that the people who got #1 in each class also got #40 in another class, and so on, so that you are the only student significantly far away from the overall average of #20. But that\u0027s not very likely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn practical terms, this is all pointless. Just do your best, and if it\u0027s good enough you\u0027ll end up with a high rank.
