For no reason. A ship can be working perfectly, and suddenly it will fire to the side instead of downwards, and no amount of taking those engines off and back on will help it, the only way you can make it work again is making a different ship, placing them, and hoping they don\u0027t go nuts. The difference is that in some cases I will see the center of thrust shift to the side on the VAB/SPH, unlike in mightydread\u0027s post. Sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here is the problem: I\u0027ve experienced that on STOCK engines as well, on designs where BahaSP engines were present, but not firing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst there was \u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=474392982\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E design, which contained a bahaSP vector inline within the fairing, but wasn\u0027t firing at launch. It worked perfectly for a number of launches, then all of a sudden it would thrust to the side and slam into the ground a few meters in. I double checked everything was symmetrical, all thrust was fine, no controller problems. No matter what I did, the design seemed corrupted. But you could argue that it\u0027s a very stupid rocket design and that the weird shape or whatever were messing it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I had problems with \u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=473783525\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E upper stage as well, which had no bahaSP engines, but retractable RCS blocks. The stage went well up until the after the transmunar injection, after which it would suddenly thrust off to the side. That\u0027s where I figured out that if you turned the gimbal in the engine off, and just let the SAS work that problem would disappear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo maybe the BahaSP parts are doing something to the center of thrust? Maybe the gimballing? Maybe it\u0027s a problem with another mod? I have no idea.

Should be simple-ish if it\u0027s just a color change. You could probably sample the colors from the stock parts to color-match. This pack is still using TGA files for the textures (rather than DDS), so as long as you can open, edit and save to that format, it should be doable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
