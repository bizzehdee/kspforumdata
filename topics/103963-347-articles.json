I\u0027ve found that tinkering with the Scattering Exposure can help. It starts at 0.23, try something like 0.005 and then adjust up/down to your taste.\n\nAlso be aware of the config points up at the top of the settings - Kerbin has different config points for zero, 1000 and 250,000 altitudes. I dialed down the opacity at 250,000, but when I was flying at 80,000, it was still all white \u0026 pearly because I hadn\u0027t edited the 1000 config point.\n\nI hope that helps. I also increased the Extinction tint a bit to breath a bit more colour back into the world. My next task is to figure out how to save the settings! The buttons don\u0027t seem to be doing the trick, so it might be a matter of editing the config files once one works out what looks nice."},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-15T06:54:41Z","Content":"Hello, I sadly have a bug to report that a few people using Spectra have reported.\n\nWhen \u0022EVEIntegration\\_preserveCloudColors = True\u0022 on Kerbin and Spectra is installed, the clouds on the main menu turn all rainbow colored:\n\n![4cBnLGk.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4cBnLGk.jpg)\n\nI haven\u0027t been able to replicate the bug on my end for some reason, but two different people reported this to me after I released an update that changed it to True.
