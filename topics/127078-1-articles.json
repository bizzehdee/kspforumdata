I figured there\u0027d be a small flurry of activity once the forums came back, waited patiently for my email notifications to start pouring in... and I just sat there, waiting... Eventually, I looked under the Fanworks section to find a big thread I follow (the simpit repository), and low and behold, people \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E returned to it, but I was not subscribed to it anymore. I go in to check things, that find that I have no subscriptions to follow \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong story short, any thread you\u0027ve ever followed for the sakes of keeping\u00A0track of, whether it\u0027s the thread that goes to some mod you were considering installing, to some challenge you planned to do, or anything really...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s all gone. Not the threads. They\u0027re still there, but that notification that tells you to check it out again. That was lost in the migration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this is a PSA to everyone who thinks their favorite thread is dormant... It might not be. Check them out manually, and resubscribe to those threads if you wish to keep following them. They certainly are not set to let you know of any updates anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-05T12:20:22Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2015 12:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
