It\u0027s called WingForce. It\u0027s an on-rails shooter heavily inspired by StarFox 64 where the player pilots a high-tech starfighter called the Dual-Wing (which strongly resembles the Arwing), fighting through various enemies in space and across the surfaces of unique planets.\u00A0While it needs improvements here and there, it\u0027s a pretty nostalgic game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe developers of the game said that they don\u0027t quite have the budget for any major updates any time soon because of poor sales of the game. The game is about $4, which might seem like a bit much for a game like this. However, if the developers get a boost in sales, they could potentially provide larger updates and build on the game over time, making it well worth the price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d strongly recommend giving this game a chance. It would be awesome to see the game improve over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
