I\u0027ve never had it during physics warp though, but interestingly it always originates from the same part.

Another thing I\u0027ve noticed is that infinitely hot solar panels don\u0027t generate any power). In my case this was a Mun base, four modules all landing separately (two of the modules are in the gif), joining together, then I went and edited the save file to bring the temps back to within a reasonable range.
