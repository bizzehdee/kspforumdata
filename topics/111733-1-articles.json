Parts are color-coded according to the [universal electronic color code](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252fen.wikipedia.org%252fwiki%252fElectronic_color_code), simply because the author is an old RDAF radar technician. Hence, size4 (5m) is yellow, size5 (7.5m) is green, and size6 (10m) is blue.\n\nEngines are kept at reasonable thrust figures and are thus not overpowered compared to the thrust/size curve of stock parts. The same goes for reaction wheels. Big spaceships are going to be sluggish, as one would expect.\n\nThis parts pack contains config snippets from the [Community Tech Tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385) by Chris Adderley.\n\n**NOTE:** As of version v1.3.5, BAE no longer includes the Firespitter plugin, but supports both it and Interstellar Fuel Switch. Either must be installed to enable multi-fuel tanks. In addition, Cross Feed Enabler is required to enable cross feed to radially attached \u0027Predator\u0027 tanks.\n\nRecommended mods:\n\n- [Interstellar Fuel Switch](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117932) or [Firespitter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24551) - enables multi-fuel tanks.\n- [Cross Feed Enabler](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76499) - enables cross feed to radially attached \u0027Predator\u0027 tanks\n- [Community Tech Tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385) - extends the stock technology tree with lots of new nodes for your favorite parts packs to fill.\n- [Kerbal Joint Reinforcement](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55657) - ensures that your big spaceships suffer less from unplanned rapid disassembly.\n- [KSP-AVC](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745) - ensures that your installed mods are up to date.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n**Change Log**\n\n    v1.3.5\n    \u00B1 Fixed engine heat animations\n    \u00B1 Updated test subjects to new format.\n    \u00B1 \u0027Predator\u0027 tanks now support ModuleCrossFeed.\n    \u00B1 Multi fuel tanks now default to LiquidFuel/Oxidizer if neither InterstellarFuelSwitch nor Firespitter is installed.\n    v1.3.4\n    \u00B1 KSP 1.0.5 compatibility upgrade\n    v1.3.3\n    \u002B Added scaled flag in /Agencies to fix problems with Texture Replacer mod.\n    v1.3.2\n    \u00B1 Converted flag decal to PNG to fix problems with Texture Replacer mod.\n    v1.3.1\n    \u00B1 Fixed visual bug with solar panel arrays.\n    v1.3.0\n    \u00B1 Replaced Firespitter plugin with newer version.\n    \u002B Added parachutes.\n    \u002B Added bi-, tri-, and quad-couplers.\n    \u002B Added docking ports.\n    \u002B Added solar panels.\n    \u00B1 Adjusted drag for all things red and/or checkered.\n    v1.2.3\n    \u00B1 Adjusted procedural fairing parameters to better reflect KSP 1.0.4 fairing values.\n    \u00B1 Adjusted thermals and drag for SRB nose cones to better reflect KSP 1.0.4 nose cone values.\n    \u00B1 Adjusted drag for radial tanks and nose tanks.\n    v1.2.2\n    \u00B1 Fixed KSP version number in version file.\n    v1.2.1\n    - Deleted Firespitter version file.\n    \u00B1 Adjusted engine heatProduction to better reflect KSP 1.0.3 engine values.\n    \u00B1 Adjusted SRB thrust and Isp to better reflect KSP 1.0.3 SRB values.\n    \u00B1 Adjusted heat shield maxTemp, etc., to better reflect KSP 1.0.3 heat shield values.\n    \u00B1 Fixed landing leg piston retraction\n    v1.2.0\n    \u002B Added 8m landing legs.\n    \u002B Added modular solid rocket boosters.\n    \u002B Added resource ModularSolidFuel, allowing for modular SRBs.\n    \u002B Added large radial decoupler.\n    \u002B Added ablative heat shields.\n    \u00B1 Fixed A1 \u0026 A2 engine strut normals.\n    \u00B1 Fixed A2 engine texture.\n    \u00B1 Fixed agency logo loading error.\n    \u00B1 Moved nose tanks to correct tech tree locations.\n    v1.1.0\n    \u002B Added procedural fairings.\n    \u002B Added nose cone tanks.\n    \u00B1 Fixed Ajax engine cost.\n    v1.0.3\n    \u00B1 Fixed engine overheat problem.\n    v1.0.2\n    \u00B1 Tweaked engine ISP curves to better reflect realistic payload capabilities.\n    v1.0.1\n    \u00B1 Converted all textures to DDE, so they will load faster.\n    \u00B1 Corrected location of version file, so it will actually work.\n    v1.0.0\n    Release!\n\n[![88x31.png](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n\n[Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n\nCC BY-NC-SA\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-01T01:55:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2016 01:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by greystork**"},{"CreatedByName":"Life on Europa","CreatedById":142177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T13:33:16Z","Content":"congrats on release"},{"CreatedByName":"LordLemonFaceOfLemonistan","CreatedById":145326,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T13:39:28Z","Content":"I...
