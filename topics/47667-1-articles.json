But banking was absolutely necessary in order to keep descending. Even with a 40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch, the shuttle\u0027s lift vector still pointed mostly up. And when it hit the thin atmosphere at 80km going Mach 23 it generated enough lift to counteract gravity and pull it back into a ballistic arc above the atmosphere. In order to maintain the 40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle of attack, but point the lift vector away from the sky, they had to do steep banks (up to 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0), alternating left and right in order to maintain course toward the landing site. This was all controlled by the guidance computer; the commander didn\u0027t take control until about 25 miles from the landing site, at an altitude of about 15km (10 miles), at which point the orbiter was going less than Mach 1. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP this is all difficult to simulate because Kerbin is such a small world. Orbital speed is about Mach 6 instead of Mach 23 like on Earth. You can probably pretty easily get away with just using pitch to control your descent and don\u0027t stand much danger of skipping back out of the atmosphere in any circumstance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
