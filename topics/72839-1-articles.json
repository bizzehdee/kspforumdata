The closest one out there is the Demo which is a crippled 0.18 that limits you to three flights at once. You can, however, transfer craft files from it to newer versions. I did so with my Mun landers removing the extra SAS and adding solar panels before flying it to Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T23:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recall someone had a thread somewhere in the mists that had an archive of all the old \u0022free\u0022 versions of the game (0.8 - 0.13.3), but I seem to have misplaced the link for it.
