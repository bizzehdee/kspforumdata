I got a \u0022new\u0022 computer to me, well my old one went the way of failed kerbal launches (Kablooey!) and doesn\u0027t work so I bought some parts and built a new one and re-installing windows and trying to play KSP again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is: 1.) clean windows install, windows 7 x64, 2.) clean steam install, 3.) clean KSP download/install.

The problem is.... I can leave it right there, and it will run for a good 15 minutes, no problem. The instant I left-click on something in KSP, it crashes to desktop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELogs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.outfoxed.net/ksp/output_log.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.outfoxed.net/ksp/output_log.txt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.outfoxed.net/ksp/error.log\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.outfoxed.net/ksp/error.log\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd all drivers in the system are current, I just finished installing everything yesterday and now today so all drivers are current from nvidia and intel and everyone for all devices in the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny input?
