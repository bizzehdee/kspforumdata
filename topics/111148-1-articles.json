I have a habit of sending up multiple missions per launch and sometimes staging makes a mess.\n\nFor Example: Here I have a rover w/crane and a separate crew lander. I don\u0027t want the decouplers or the crane engines to have anything to do with staging.\n\nI\u0027d like to just activate each part manually. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![gfspo6o.png](http://i.imgur.com/gfspo6o.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T15:49:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 03:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aser**"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T15:56:34Z","Content":"I just place all of the ones that i don\u0027t want activated to the last stage and do it manualy with custom action groups.
