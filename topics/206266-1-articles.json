I don\u0027t exactly want to press \u0022G\u0022 to deploy landing gear, only for it to take actual years to do so. I suppose the way that this\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0work is that if you were to switch to a probe in the map view (flight or tracking station), it will add a time penalty when loading that craft.\u00A0This could happen either through a timeskip, or allowing the probe to load the next instant, but forcing the player wait the latency minutes to control it in realtime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, let\u0027s say we want to control a probe that is at Jool from Kerbin. The smallest gap that could happen between them is around 55 billion metres.*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.5 x 10^10 metres divided by the speed of light (2.99 x 10^8 m/s) = Approximately 3 minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen wanting to control a probe from Jool at 55 billion metres away (3 light minutes), 3 minutes of latency will occur when you accessed the probe. After the timeskip, you can control the probe in \u0027real time\u0027. Of course, 3 minutes to Jool is too quick for latency, so I propose dividing the KSP speed of light by 10, such that the shortest time in light minutes between Kerbin and Jool is around 30 minutes, which scales properly to the closest distance between Earth and Jupiter being about 35 minutes. Therefore, a probe 30 light minutes away will force a 30 minute latency when switching to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis should be different when using remote access (a pilot controlling a probe), where the distance between the nearest pilot and probe also has latency in light minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs such, this would also allow for a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EProject Daedalus style\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0chaining of relay probes backwards.

I see arguments for orbital decay, super complex communication systems, and dozens or hundreds of parts that add single functionalities for complete customization, and I wonder whether these people want to play in a team of 20 people designing every aspect of a craft. My personal take is that if you can justify a simplification by chalking it down to the people in mission control back at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, then it is worth it. Players shouldn\u0027t have to compensate for orbital decay because the kerbals monitoring the space station are already doing that. Players shouldn\u0027t have to add fifty different computing modules to their craft, the engineers who made the pod should have included that in the pod as soon as they had access to the tech. Same with light delay, it is a cool concept, but you can simply claim that the computers back at a colony or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E had sent those commands way ahead of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 One thing that light delay could impact that the player has control over and won\u0027t be annoyed by is science. If science took time to transition between colonies, that would be interesting because colonies in a far-off star system would not have the same access to parts as the Kerbol system, and might need to spend some of their research points to unlock tech nodes that were already unlocked just to get new parts in time for important missions. This doesn\u0027t punish the player for uncontrollable (pushing buttons with delay) or easily avoidable (delay ahead of time) things, and also generates interesting gameplay. So, I think that craft should be immediately controllable as long as comms are open the entire way through, but science should spread slowly across the galaxy (maybe even slow enough that colonies could be seriously offset from each other, or make it a difficulty setting to change the speed)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-05T15:30:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2022 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by t_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-05T15:52:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224072932\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206266\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221641357634\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00221896\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Axelord FTW\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Axelord FTW said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn an ideal world, KSP2 would include a speed-o\u0027-light signal delay\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn an ideal world, KSP 2 will keep letting players control their probes in real time under the explanation of \u0022it\u0027s all preprogrammed\u0022.

More inputs, outputs and math abilities adds more complexity and having a magic \u0022land this thing\u0022 function destroys the whole point of the system.
