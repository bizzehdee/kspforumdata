I would ask though, that if your \u0022\\_ShadowWorks\\_RealChute.cfg\u0022 does not begin like it should, and you are using the most recent version that you would let me know where you downloaded the mod so I can put a notice or something in the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

The SLS, however,  is probably because of the parachute.  I noticed that when the problem you described earlier occurs, the game treated the parachute as deployed even though it isn\u0027t and so will cause the vehicle to do strange uncontrollable things.  So, fixing the parachute issue should fix the SLS, but there\u0027s not much to do with the shuttle.  When I was originally testing the Shuttle I don\u0027t know how many times I reverted to launch before I was able to get the thing into orbit, so you just have to play around with it and find what works for you.  Remember, the real Shuttle was flown by the onboard computer(s), so we have to do our best.\n\nIf you fixed the parachutes by replacing the first line of the \u0022\\_ShadowWorks\\_RealChute.cfg\u0022 file, try deleting that file altogether.

You would have to set up the action groups again, but it might help.  Are you using any aerodynamics mods?  I haven\u0027t tested in anything other than stock aerodynamics, so that\u0027s a possibility.  I\u0027ll try to do some testing, when I get the chance, to see if I can reproduce what you\u0027re getting.\n\u003E \n\nive done what you have said (apart from the rea chutes) i have real shutes installed, however the rocket still snap. from what i saw the capsule seems to sink kind of into the decoupler.\n\nAso great job on all the rockets, they look amaizing."}]}
