It wouldn\u0027t need any kind of piloting or SAS. It would just need to transmit data back to the ground.

The only thing aerodynamics would influence with balloons would be drag if used to construct an airship. For pure ascent straight up drag changes nothing with balloons, it is is a non-issue for balloons since you are not using fuel to get up (where as for rockets and spaceplanes drag does change how much delta-v you need to get into orbit), hence unless Kerbin\u0027s atmospheric density/pressure profile was changed, no change in the aerodynamics would affect how good balloons would be in KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso they\u0027re fairly easy to balance since there\u0027s a clear altitude ceiling when the weight of the balloon is equal to the lift gained from buoyancy, adding more parts to it just reduces that maximum altitude.
