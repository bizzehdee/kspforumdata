View full album](//imgur.com/a/0aYUz)\n\nYou can look through the album to see the details of how I did it. This seemed right on the edge of what is possible to me, and 4 RAPIER engines plus one nuke seems like the magic formula. I believe this design could just make it to the surface of Laythe as well, and I will test it for that challenge later. It mey requires some fancy gravity assists! However landing on the Mun and returning has its own unique challenges. Can you do better than this? Can you:\n\nDo it with lower takeoff weight?\n\nDo it with more than one Kerbal?\n\nDo it with more fuel in the tank when you land?\n\nVisit any other body as well?\n\nDo it without using a nuke engine?\n\nLand back on the KSC runway?\n\nGround rules include all stock, 1.0.2, and no abuse of part clipping or any other physics exploit!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T15:51:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 03:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program**"},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T15:50:06Z","Content":"Well done.

I used my nuke as an afterburner in the design I posted, but I think you\u0027d need to go pretty big to support 2 or more nukes. As using just turbos \u002B nukes, I don\u0027t think the turbos can sustain enough speed at the high end to allow for the most efficient flight to orbit. I also use the RAPIERS during my Mun landing to bleed off velocity quickly. It requires less accuracy that way, plus the rapid deceleration makes up or the lower ISP to a significant extent. Landing without them would have been very hard! Anyway, I\u0027d love to see you prove me wrong about the turbos!"}]}
