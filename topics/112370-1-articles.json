This seemed right on the edge of what is possible to me, and 4 RAPIER engines plus one nuke seems like the magic formula. I believe this design could just make it to the surface of Laythe as well, and I will test it for that challenge later. It mey requires some fancy gravity assists!

I used my nuke as an afterburner in the design I posted, but I think you\u0027d need to go pretty big to support 2 or more nukes. As using just turbos \u002B nukes, I don\u0027t think the turbos can sustain enough speed at the high end to allow for the most efficient flight to orbit. I also use the RAPIERS during my Mun landing to bleed off velocity quickly. It requires less accuracy that way, plus the rapid deceleration makes up or the lower ISP to a significant extent. Landing without them would have been very hard! Anyway, I\u0027d love to see you prove me wrong about the turbos!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
