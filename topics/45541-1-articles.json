That said, Miner Wars in an of itself is not a shining resume to me from the developer. It\u0027s a neat enough game in it\u0027s own way, but things like the mission scripting ensured I never got past the demo. Looking a bit more at what the developer said about that game, and what people (and supposed ex-staff) are saying about the developer, I don\u0027t feel particularly inclined to go for it. One of the things I look for with new games is the community, in particular, the relationship between the gamers and the developer. When I see a community that seems to universally despise the developer of the game, I know something is up.
