I\u2019ve tried loading cloud backups, USB backups, reinstalling the game, restarting my PS4, none of it works. It\u2019s a shame they\u2019ve put so little work into console KSP, it\u2019s almost 2 years behind in real content updates, the bugs and crashes are nearly unbearable, I\u2019ve never been able to get through a single session without a crash.
