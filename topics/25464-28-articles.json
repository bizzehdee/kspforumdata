Also in lower elliptical orbits are the two Triple Tugs with all the Tylo landing craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OM2h6CO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OM2h6CO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first order of business was for Aldner and Nelemy to get all their mission hardware down into 90-km circular orbits from which all the landing would be made. For the Triple Tugs, this required retro burns of about 595 m/s at periapsis.

Then they did a small burn to raise the periapsis of their ship to 90 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jM1zeqv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jM1zeqv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe retro burn for the Tylo ship was scheduled to take 678 m/s of delta-V (the picture below is from a little ways into that 5-minute burn). But the burn was cut short when the ship\u0027s apoapsis was down to about 200 kilometers to leave the ship in a phasing orbit so that it could circle a few times and get lined up for a rendezvous with the Triple Tug carrying the crew landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PYut3tC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PYut3tC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the orbit phasing was correct, the Tylo ship was dropped the rest of the way to its 90-km orbit to rendezvous with the Triple Tug. The lander payloads don\u0027t have docking ports on top (to minimize weight), so Aldner and Nelemy docked their ship temporarily to the rear of the Triple Tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4o16bFd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224o16bFd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Yo, Dude... the Vanallen sensor mounted on the hull is ticking away madly.

The lines mark the equator and the meridian that faces Jool. Jebediah Kerman\u0027s landing location was on the east rim of the large crater at the sub-Jool point. Aldner and Nelemy will be targeting the basin to the west that KerbalMaps shows as having a flat, smooth surface with an elevation of 1 meter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ayx3HrN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ayx3HrN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner was going to land his landers using the method where you lower the periapsis of the orbit to very low over the landing target, and then do a two-phase landing: Phase one involves thrusting mostly horizontally to slow down from orbital speed, while thrusting a little upward as needed to keep the ship from dropping. Then, when the horizontal motion is mostly slowed, phase two involves the mostly vertical drop for the short distance to the surface. The problem here is that there is a ridge line to the west of the target basin, so the periapsis can\u0027t be lowered below 4 km there, or the ship will smash. Aldner has named this \u0022Flyswatter Ridge\u0022 and will try to skim his landers in at orbital velocity a couple hundred meters over this ridge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy will be using a more traditional landing technique: Retro burn to drop the ship in near the target area, then a \u0027suicide burn\u0027 to slow the ship down both vertically and horizontally close to the surface...then a hopefully gentle vertical descent from there. He has named a feature \u0022Retro Crater\u0022 to mark the longitude in his orbit where he has to do the initial retro burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[The fun of Tylo is all about the danger of landing on such a large, airless body. So I practiced many times with multiple techniques before I decided to risk the actual landings for this mission. I also decided to do the landings using my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro joystick, a relatively new toy. This took some getting used to...but the rapid response of the throttle lever-thingie is certainly handy. Plus, I mapped the \u0022hide the UI\u0022 and \u0022take screenshot\u0022 functions to handy keys on the joystick to hopefully make taking pictures during the hectic landings easier. I found that the standard setup up of pitch, roll, and yaw as forward/backward, left/right, and twist on the joystick (which works fine for flying planes) did not work well for me when trying to land vertical-descent landers...so I swapped around roll and yaw...and this made me happier.]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Tylo Station to Laythe Base. Are you there, Fearless Leader?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022I\u0027m on radio watch, Aldner. What can we do for you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022We are ready to start landing ships, but we need to decide who goes first. Nelemy suggested we flip a coin, but that\u0027s hard to do in zero-G. Can you flip for us?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022You think I brought a coin to Laythe? OK...each of you pick a number between one and one million. Closest guess wins.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022I\u0027ll guess 500,000 Dude!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022I\u0027ll guess 499,999.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022The magic number was 292,202. Aldner wins. Be careful with those toys...the boys at KSC spent a lot of money shipping them out here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Aldner remotely separates the Tylo Fido A lander from the other Triple Tug ship and prepares to guide it down via remote control. This lander was originally designed to be able to land on Tylo with just its eight internal and side tanks...but I later added the Rockomax X200-8 Fuel Tank to the bottom for more loiter time. But it\u0027s surprising how adding all that fuel only resulted in a little extra fuel available at landing -- a lot of the fuel gets used up just slowing down all the fuel for landing. Landing on Tylo is a situation where MOAR FUEL is often NOT as helpful as one might think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ON6lQec.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ON6lQec.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, a top view of the Tylo Fido shows that it has four FL-T100 tanks built into its structure -- these tanks are there so that the rover can be used to transfer fuel between ships on the surface of Tylo. The FL-T400 tanks on the sides are the main descent fuel, and can be separated after landing. There are 12 Rockomax 48-7S engines clustered beneath the side tanks to give the ship a very impressive thrust-to-weight ratio, which is very helpful when landing on Tylo. The docking port on top of the Fido is used as the \u0022control-from\u0022 point during landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CvISgcw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CvISgcw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step in the landing technique Aldner was to wait until the lander was directly 180 degrees opposite from a point on the west edge of the target basin. Then a retro burn was performed to lower the periapsis to a little under 4,000 meters just beyond Flyswatter Ridge, which has an elevation of 3,785 meters (so the lander will be skimming a couple hundred meters over this ridge). There are also mountains further to the west (near the Ap marker in this image) that the landing trajectory misses by a kilometer or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/M7menS1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022M7menS1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the unmanned lander has passed the mountains and is headed toward Flyswatter Ridge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yfKa6i6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yfKa6i6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe animated GIF does not quite relate the thrill of passing within 113 meters of the surface while zipping along at over 2,200 meters per second orbital velocity.

The first panel below shows monitoring the fuel level in the big tank on the bottom. When that tank was empty (after having slowed down the ship to under 1,200 m/s) it was jettisoned (second panel).

The Fido rover itself was completely intact. On the side tanks, one landing leg was gone, two were broken, and the third was OK. Most of the engines on the bottoms of the side tanks were gone (and apparently were the main source of the explosions).

This put the orbital hab on the correct side of the ship relative to the Triple Tug\u0027s nuclear engines and radiation shadow shields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z2QDZoL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022z2QDZoL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just for good measure, they undocked their original single Tug and flipped it so that its nuclear engines were properly shielded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ueV9TF7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ueV9TF7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner prepared to remotely control Tylo Hab A down to the surface.
