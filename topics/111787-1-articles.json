I landed in water and my craft fell to its side. The mod was showing splashed down. Decided to get surface sample from water and got a kerbal out. While the kerbal was standing on the ship wanted to take a picture so returned to craft to take the other kerbal out. My eye just went over to the science and they were all unfinished. Obviously it was saying that the craft landed.
