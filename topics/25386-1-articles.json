Starting from a circular orbit no higher than 500km above Jool, descend as deeply into Jool\u0027s atmosphere as you dare, and then return to a stable orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) You must use the FAR mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Mods which provide diagnostic tools (such as Kerbin Engineer) are allowed; no other mods may be used. For mods that provide both diagnostic tools and other functionality, only the diagnostics may be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) MechJeb may be used for diagnostics, but this is as much a piloting skills challenge as it is a build challenge so under no circumstances may the MechJeb autopilot be activated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) All craft must contain at least one manned pod, which must be returned to a stable Jool orbit for successful completion of the challenge. Other parts may be decoupled and dropped to a Joolian doom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.) At no point may the craft exceed an altitude of 500km above Jool. (This is to prevent people from using a high-speed flyby to assist them in getting back to orbit. You can still build speed by burning on the initial plunge if you so desire.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.) You may cheat your craft into Joolian orbit using HyperEdit or save file editing to save time; launching from Kerbin is not necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.) Scoring is based on minimum altitude achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.) At least three screenshots are required for proof: one in orbit prior to the dive, one at minimum altitude, and one back in orbit showing apoapsis and periapsis. I encourage you to post more (or videos) for posterity\u0027s sake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeaderboard:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
