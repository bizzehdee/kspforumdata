I watched several tutorials and thought I had a basic understanding of what I needed. So, I built this craft and was able to do a suborbital hop. I made a few changes to refine it closer to hitting orbit, but now my RAPIER engines will not ignite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027re in air breathing mode on the runway, but when I activate them and throttle up, they immediately flame out and give an insufficient intake area error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor whatever reason, the Mk2 Shock Cones will not provide air to them. I\u0027ve tried swapping regular circular intakes, and regular circular shock cones to the exact position of the Mk2 shock cones and the RAPIERs work, but if I use other Mk2 shaped intakes, they do not work. Is there some reason that it\u0027s *just* the Mk2 form factor intakes that will not work?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1180005913\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1180005913\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-25T02:00:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums. There are no such things as stock MK2 formfactor air intakes. So if you are finding them in some mod, then the ones in the mod are buggy.
