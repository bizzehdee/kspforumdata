Yes, there are realistic planetary simulators and yes some of them have rockets (e.g. Orbiter), but none of them allow you to start with an empty hangar and a list of parts and build an interplanetary spacecraft in the same way that KSP does and then ceaselessly attempt to analyse why your rocket exploded in some meaningful way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the educational reputation, well, the game pretty much mirrors exactly what I was taught in A-Level Physics.
