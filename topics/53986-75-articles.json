You learn a lot of stuff along the way: Building a re-entry capable space plane, flying a brick, learning to deal with off-center thrust, SRB\u0027s, huge tanks that need to be aerodynamical, using 3 gimbaling engines, having an extremely low amount of orbit delta-v (about 400m/s), learning to adapt your payloads instead of your rockets (you have to make the payload fit), weird angle dockings, putting RCS on abnormal rockets. Since you do the same type of launch a lot of times, you learn to optimize it perfectly and make orbit with as little fuel as possible. I, an experienced player (I\u0027ve got to the moon and back with engine ignitor, built countless stations, organized over 5 GEO satellite arrays and have a fleet of extremely optimized rockets) still haven\u0027t been able to make a shuttle. I wish I could reap those benefits. It is in no way easy, but it gives a lot of advantages.
