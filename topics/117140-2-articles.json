Windows Update can be accessed through the control panel, or you can just type \u0022Windows Update\u0022 in the start menu\u0027s search bar and it should show up."},{"CreatedByName":"Kozak","CreatedById":128114,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T15:29:46Z","Content":"It\u0027s downloading!!!!!

You can download the Media Creation Tool from Microsoft\u0027s website and use that to download and install the update directly, or you can create a bootable USB and then browse to the drive and run setup.exe to install. Both of these should count as an \u0022update\u0022 instead of a \u0022clean install\u0022, so it should be able to associate your product key with the new version. This won\u0027t happen if you actually boot the installer from the USB drive as it can only be used to perform a clean installation or to repair a broken one, so you must use Windows Update or the two abovementioned methods to perform the first installation.\n\nI\u0027m currently using the Media Creation Tool to do a direct update. Will report back with results once it\u0027s done."},{"CreatedByName":"Kozak","CreatedById":128114,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T15:55:32Z","Content":"wait so the one im doing doesnt work?"},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T16:07:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I keep getting offered the update, but I refuse to shift from Windows 7\n\nI love you, by the way.\n\nAlso, updating to Windows 10?
