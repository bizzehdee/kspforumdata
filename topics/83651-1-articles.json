However, just a random gesture or one related to Courage and Stupidity would be neat (but then I suppose, if one didn\u0027t change Kerbals, the gesture wouldn\u0027t change ... Keypad would probably be better.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks for reading!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T21:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGestures, poses (not momentary, for screenshots), idle animations, yes, it would be nice to have them in as it would make things a bit more alive.
