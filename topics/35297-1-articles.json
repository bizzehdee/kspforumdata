I frequently experience the same thing. You can\u0027t use the flip direction as an indicator. It will flip any direction (usually the nearest) to get the CoL behind the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy solution is thus the standard one: your shifting fuel load moves the CoM behind the CoL, you need to move your CoL further back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T19:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne tip that I heard for this is to add a small part as an indicator to where the CoL is in the VAB, then zooming in once the fuel is depleted to see where the CoM is with respect to the CoL, as the camera centres on the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SDIR","CreatedById":59117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T23:50:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I can suggest is to dump all fuel and oxidiser before landing. Just disable all of the liquid fuel flow first and rev up the rocket. There should be no thrust but the amount of oxidiser will deplete, and once there is no more oxidizer, then re-enable the liquid fuel and dump that as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vpfsz9YjM00/UctBTX487GI/AAAAAAAAfGc/T1olI-9up6g/s576/screenshot555.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot555.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick the green arrows to disable the resource, and it should turn into a red circle with a slash through it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigpapabearxx","CreatedById":30899,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T00:30:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI figured it out.
