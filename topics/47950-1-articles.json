Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night. Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night. Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light. And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. - See more at: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15377#sthash.SjUN5t5p.dpuf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15377#sthash.SjUN5t5p.dpuf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGodspeed, Scott Carpenter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-10T21:19:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2013 09:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by BostLabs\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Needles_10","CreatedById":59554,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T20:37:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll miss him.
