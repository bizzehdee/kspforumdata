There is of course GIT/GitHub integration for VS, which means you can use it more or less the same as TFS. Fortunately the license is rather permissive, so just taking over while the original author isn\u0027t around is no problem at all. He hasn\u0027t posted anything since august \u002714, where the last commit to the GHud repository was in July.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for what changes I\u0027ve made to the code, they\u0027re actually rather minor (added 42 and deleted 22 lines or so), but as I said the performance implications were quite significant for me. You can see and look over the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Creat/GHud/commit/110aad492653c322ca32be85efe924df29888ec9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Especific changes here\u003C/a\u003E, and all of them are in GHud.cs.

All things considered, the patch is rather minor though and you should be able to trivially integrate them on your end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do hope you put your code up somewhere in a repository (or even just in a zip or something) so I can (hopefully) help or at least compile it on my end with the coroutine changes, as I simply have to do that or the whole game lags constantly. I haven\u0027t tried your build with the KSP 1.0 release so far (haven\u0027t had the time), there might\u0027ve been something fixed on the KSP side such that it no longer causes any problems, but switching over to using coroutines should be done anyway if possible: it\u0027s just the better approach for this kind of plugin that doesn\u0027t actually interact with the images/frames on the monitor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould the original author not return (soon-ish), I\u0027d recommend starting a new thread so that the discussion is separate from this one. Also adding support for the more recent management-plugins might be nice (I could probably also provide that, if you want me to). By that I mean things like CKan or KSP-AVC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMFirmy","CreatedById":112717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:02:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo simply get the plugin working from the posted source, there were really only 2 changes that I had to make.
