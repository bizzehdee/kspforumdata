I liked it\u0027s more modern Look than the Mk 1-3, especially the IVA, so I kept using it (you still found it when you know where to look) after it has been hidden from the TechTree and was disappointed when it was completely removed from the Game. The \u0022Mod\u0022 is just the Part Files copypasted from an older KSP Version without any Changes, except setting \u0022TechHidden\u0022 to false in the .cfg File. So it should run fine with any Game Version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info/mod/2310/Mk%201-2%20Pod\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://spacedock.info/mod/2310/Mk 1-2 Pod\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo any new Players who don\u0027t know the Mk 1-2 anymore, it\u0027s a 2.5 m Command Pod for three Kerbals. It has pretty much the same Characteristics as the Mk 1-3 but is a bit havier. I\u0027d guess that this is due to better Radiation Shileding in modern Spacecraft compared to the 60s.
