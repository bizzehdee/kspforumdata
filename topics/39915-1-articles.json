So I killed the engine (because I can\u0027t look at my orbit map and steer at the same time, and this thing was all over the place) So I looked at the orbit map, decided I wasn\u0027t high enough yet. Went back into normal view.. and I was spinning out of control and falling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis happens to 90% of my stuff. what am I doing wrong?
