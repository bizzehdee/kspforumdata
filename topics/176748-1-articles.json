KSP came up as usual without any delays and didn\u0027t see any Cartographer related errors in the log - but no directories were created and no maps. To be clear there were three files in Sigma\\Cartographer\\ when I installed it - the dll, the version file and the cfg file - directory was unchanged after booting KSP and then quitting from the space center scene.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then made a fresh 1.3.1 install - same same setup as the 1.4.4 test.
