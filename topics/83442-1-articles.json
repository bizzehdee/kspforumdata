I was expecting this to be a field in the ScienceDefs.cfg or part.cfg of the sensors, but cannot find it. Is it accessible somewhere in the API maybe? So far, i have only found \u0022dataScale\u0022, but that just determines how much network packets need to be sent for the experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-31T12:25:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2014 12:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SirJodelstein\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Esolved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirJodelstein","CreatedById":62251,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T12:25:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efound it... its in the sensor config... its \u0022xmitDataScalar\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
