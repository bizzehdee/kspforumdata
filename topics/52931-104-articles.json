Chris got fed up with x64 support requests (because for some people, including Chris, Windows x64 is an unstable piece of crap), and disabled his mod for Windows x64. Linux x64 works perfectly well. Use 32-bit, use Linux 64-bit, or eliminate the check from the source code and recompile*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2: The stock parachute configuration file (in RealChute/Module Manager) causes major issues: either delete the config, or never use stock parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3: Wait until 200-250 m/s to deploy your parachutes if using Deadly Reentry. Supersonic speeds eat parachutes, and the speed of sound is ~330-350 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*It basically means reprogramming his mod yourself to eliminate the x64 check.
