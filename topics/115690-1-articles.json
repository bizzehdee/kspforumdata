The Kerbal X, Two stage lander, Aeris 3a, etc. But when you take a closer look, you realize that... these crafts are fairly useless. \n\nThe Kerbal X has a pod with landing legs, but can\u0027t make it back from the mun. The Stearwing d-45 can only make orbit with excellent piloting, but it\u0027s obviously designed to be an ssto. The Kerbal 2.... What even is the Kerbal 2? The super heavy lander is not very well built, and wastes a lot of delta v. And the list goes on.\n\n**CHALLENGE**\n\nYour job is to build a new stock vehicle lineup to fill the basic niches (Small rocket, lander, larger rocket, various aircraft, ssto, etc.) that will teach new players good strategies and practices for building ships.\n\n**RULES**\n\n- No excessive clipping. You can decide if your craft(s) violate this rule.\n\n- Stock parts only. Informational plugins are fine. In fact, Kerbal Engineer is recommended to see delta v of your craft.\n\n- No debug menu *\\*cough*\\* Kaboom! *\\*cough\\**\n\n**LEADERBOARDS**\n\n**SPH**\n\nJLtheGrunger, Pelican (Aeris 3a Light Jet)\n\n**VAB**\n\nGoSlash27, Rockomax Katapult (2.5m medium launcher)\n\nBev7787, Navigator Probe Launch Kit (1.25m launcher w/ Probe)\n\nRed Iron Crown, Day Tripper (Mun and Minmus lander w/ launcher)\n\nJLtheGrunger, Proton K (3.75m Heavy Launcher)\n\nGood luck, and happy building!\n\nSmallFatFetus\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T00:35:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 12:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SmallFatFetus**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T03:39:09Z","Content":"You never said we couldn\u0027t use the debug menu"},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T03:57:34Z","Content":"You just had to, didn\u0027t you. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nSeriously though, that\u0027s a given with challenges.
