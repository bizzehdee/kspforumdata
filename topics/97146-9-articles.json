So much usefulness in one simple epic package. The ability to strap a set of Kerbal Foundries tracks to the chassis and go crawling across planets and moons is nice, and I\u0027ve found them to be excellent drilling and resource gathering platforms.\u003Cp\u003EWould like to make two minor requests, though. One: A crew cabin/ habitat module in the ore-box styling, for use in making mobile bases. Two: A science lab in the ore-box styling for making super-size science rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, I\u0027ve found just about everything I could want in here, other than (and I\u0027ve seen you\u0027re working on it) some power-generation units and something to top the cabs with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso found the roll-caged safety seat to be useful for my IR\u002BKAS mini-picker. I use it for moving small items around and loading little box-bed vehicles with said small items.

Will make building mobile mining bases/colonies so much nicer (and easier) with everything having beautiful matching colors. I\u0027ve been having far too much fun building mining vehicles, and I\u0027m glad to see that collapsible vehicle trick (KAS or KIS, didn\u0027t catch which, but either would work, I think) being prepared as well. I kinda like the idea of having to ship up a bunch of parts on a bunch of rockets, ship up a crew, and tell \u0027em, \u0022You\u0027re here to establish Kerbin\u0027s first Mun colony. Your first mission: To assemble your mobile colony base. Use the included radio to send word home when you are done, we\u0027ll send you your mining truck and your science lab, along with more colonists.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould see that being one of those fun ways to play KSP in Science Sandbox mode while having a purpose. Mining to make fuel, shipping rockets back up to an orbiting station, empties come back down to be refuelled, fuel truck comes by to pick up some gas cans and transfer them to Kerbin Orbit, extending the range of interplanetary vessels. At the same time, collect science from all over the Kerbol system with the mobile labs. And yet being able to ship up my massive, heavy mining vehicles in convenient round rocket tubes, carefully broken down so they fit nicely, packing every piece I could possibly need to get something going. Everything from the \u0022Do-It-Yourself Series ACME Mun Rover\u0022 up to \u0022Massive Industries Heavy Miner MK2\u0022 in a can, just ready to assemble on site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, I understand needing to redesign the power modules for heat dissipation in vacuum, rather than just atmospheric. As for those underbody cargo racks, not sure how often I\u0027d find myself using them as underbody racks, given I like Kerbal Foundries tracks under my heavy vehicles (because we all know real space-mining trucks run on tracks, not wimpy wheels) but I\u0027m sure I\u0027d come up with some place to put them that would end up useful. After all, that Hi-Lo adapter of yours makes an awesome protective crash bumper. And a bloody convenient way to mount some lights to the front of the truck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly thing I wish is that I could drive from inside the cabs, but, well, that can always wait a while longer. Right now, I\u0027m having enough fun trying to, um... Well, I\u0027ve been launching totally-not-weaponized scientific probes from the back of an extra-wide cargo chassis. Completely scientific. I just forgot to install landing legs and a parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kari1393","CreatedById":117238,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T14:24:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VaporTrail\u0022 data-cite=\u0022VaporTrail\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMight want to update the pointer link for the Infernal Robotics dependency in the first post. \u003Cp\u003ECurrently points to: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-90-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Infernal-Robotics-0-19-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-90-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Infernal-Robotics-0-19-3\u003C/a\u003E , which, as of Apr 20, has been closed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new release thread for IR can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116064-Plugin-0-90-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Infernal-Robotics-0-20-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116064-Plugin-0-90-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Infernal-Robotics-0-20-0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENvm, wrong thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T14:26:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 02:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kari1393\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EWrong thread (my mind was elsewhere).\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T12:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kari1393\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kari1393\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEdit:\u003Cp\u003ENvm, wrong thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually it was also issue for this thread; link updated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paradigm Storm","CreatedById":127315,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T23:42:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello/Bonjour/Goeiendag riocrokite,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m enjoying the mod, immensely!

In-editor movement is achieved by rotating/translating the part around the defined axis, then rotating the fixedMesh in the opposite direction, the net result being that the fixedMesh appears not to move.
