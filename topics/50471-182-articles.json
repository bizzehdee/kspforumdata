Kerolox and hydrolox (kerosene/liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen) tend to be turbopump-fed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*I think liquid helium is pumped into the tanks to fill up the void left when fuel is consumed, which pushes the propellant to the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any event, I tend to use a combination of kerolox and solid-fuel boosters on my first stage (where thrust is king and efficiency not terribly important), that wonderfully efficient hydrolox mix on my second stage and interplanetary/lunar transfer stages, and whichever hypergolic mix is available for anything which is supposed to be ignited after more than a week in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, do look at the engine codes (as described in the first couple posts of the RF thread). L engines tend to be high-thrust but a bit inefficient, U engines more efficient and lighter-weight, but with a tad less thrust, while O engines tend to have very low thrust, but good efficiency and low mass. It also strongly affects sea-level thrust performance: L engines are designed to minimize thrust loss at sea-level, while U and O are designed for vacuum or near-vacuum conditions, and lose a lot of thrust (and therefore Isp) at sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-16T23:26:44Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2014 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ToyToy","CreatedById":103322,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T00:02:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much, I got plenty help and information here and on the RO thread, I understood \u003Cem\u003Ealmost\u003C/em\u003E everything about fuels types, that\u0027s great !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll test everything again on tomorrow (it\u0027s 1 am here in France !), hopping to put a probe on the Moon surface !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T01:27:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs to leak rate: you can always look at RealFuels/Resources/RealTankTypes.cfg, and look for loss_rate.

I want getting off Kerbin to be more difficult than stock, but not as difficult as getting off Earth. I want interplanetary distances to be close to real Solar system distances. I want the terrain on the planets and moons to be interestingly varied, not smooth as a bowling ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like I need the 6.4x Kerbin in a 10x overall system, with all the other planets and moons at 3.2x scale! Probably keep the sun and Jool at either 6.4x or 10x scale. This way, getting off Kerbin remains interestingly dV-expensive and closer to an Earth launch, long trips still take months or years, and everything besides Kerbin has enough hills to challenge the landings. Maybe I can give Kerbin a 365 day year while I\u0027m at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only real problem that springs to mind, is an Eve that\u0027s so much smaller than Kerbin loses some of its relative difficulty.

The gravity and atmosphere of those bodies are the main attractions, not the terrain. All the small, rocky bodies can be smaller and rockier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit #2: A whole lot of copy-pasting later, it looks like it works! The distances are far, most bodies are small, unless they have lots of atmosphere, in which case they\u0027re big. It\u0027s a day and a half trip from LKO to Munar SOI. In a 6.4x save, I left a small Mun lander probe parked on a nearly featureless plain; just a slight incline. I loaded that save up in the new config, and the little landerBot immediately fell over and rolled down the hill. I call that mission success! I\u0027ll put some thought into how to share it; who exactly to ask permission from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne nagging visual glitch (which I anticipated) is the Mun appears much smaller when viewed from Kerbin.
