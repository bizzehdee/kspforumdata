It began with \u0022help us\u0022 (which seems a little too similar to Earth communication structure), and then detailed its position. Evidently, they had destroyed themselves with war. I\u0027m not sure whether to believe this, but if it\u0027s true, they were probably Kerbals and they accidentally destroyed themselves by raining boosters down on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://beforeitsnews.com/beyond-science/2013/11/nasa-received-an-sos-call-from-another-galaxy-2444494.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://beforeitsnews.com/beyond-science/2013/11/nasa-received-an-sos-call-from-another-galaxy-2444494.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe had no solid evidence of alien life, and then BAM.
