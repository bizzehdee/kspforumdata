Your command module already contains a pretty good SAS system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. ASAS is only a control computer, not a gyroscope.

You can click on your orbital velocity display to change it to surface velocity. This is good for landings so you can have zero lateral velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Basic orbital mechanics.

You will lose many of them, and can recover them by restoring persistent.sfs if you find some you particularly like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. As a general rule, Kerbin\\\u0027s SOI is about 80,000,000 m, and the Mun\\\u0027s about 2,000,000 m.
