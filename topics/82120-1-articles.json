However, what if I was to accelerate away to 60% of the speed of light, and the original ship was to do the same thing in the opposite direction? In the reference frame of the earth, neither of us has broken the speed of light, but taking either me or the carrier as your reference frame, we have. Is this possible?

If you just want to describe electromagnetic field, Maxwell\u0027s Equations are sufficient. Unlike Newtonian gravity equations, Maxwell\u0027s Equations are exact. However, if you want to describe interactions between electromagnetic field and matter, you might have to consider Quantum Electrodynamics. This is only relevant to very high energies on very short scale. Like collisions between nuclei. There, you need QED to describe electromagnetic interactions properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you dig deep enough in both, QED and General Relativity are built on the same principles. GR isn\u0027t quantized, but if you just look at the underlying field theory, they are the same. The difference is that GR deals with symmetries due to translation and rotation in space and time. As consequence, it can be interpreted as curvature of space-time. Electrodynamics has to do with different symmetries. So while they can be described as curving of some sort of space, it\u0027s not a very useful description.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T12:36:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022peadar1987\u0022 data-cite=\u0022peadar1987\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHowever, what if I was to accelerate away to 60% of the speed of light, and the original ship was to do the same thing in the opposite direction?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EEach ship would measure the other as receding at less than the speed of light.

In regular situations (weak gravity fields guarantee that), trajectories depend smoothly on the initial 3-velocity, after all. If the photon is going to be deflected by 1 degree, A is not going to be deflected by 2 or 3 degrees, rather maybe 1.02 a most. In the reference frame of the star, the 3-velocity change is going to be similar in all cases, and certainly, the deflection the photon receives is a lower bound for the spaceships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMath time.
