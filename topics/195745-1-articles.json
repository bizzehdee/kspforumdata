What probably happened is that ksp ran out of ram and quit to prevent catastrophic failure. Restarting your pc probably helps with the ram by closing background tasks. But it\u0027s best to just quit chrome before playing ksp.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-21T09:53:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should close all other programs when running KSP on 8GB of RAM, KSP itself can fill that up without even beginning to include memory-hungry mods; I regularly see 10GB of RAM use running KSP, albeit with a hefty load of mods, and 97% of 16GB in use before it starts grinding to a halt or crashing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless you really really need something to be running, close it down and free the RAM for KSP to use instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
