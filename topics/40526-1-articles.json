Take a 1m lander pod, attach a 1m Kethane tank, Kethane fueled generator, battery, single xenon tank, and 5 ion engines, and the Kethane generator will provide both power AND xenon to the ion thrusters, and you get a ship that can use ion engines without the requirement of being in the sun to get enough power. Also, a similar drive solution could be used (suitaibly scaled) to transport Kethane to/from an orbit around any planet or moon in KSP. Granted, you might need to use quite a lot of ion engines to reduce the required burn time to a tolerable value, maybe it\u0027s not a reasonable way to do that, but since when has KSP been about doing things reasonably?

I mean deposits here on earth take years to mine out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the density of Kethane was doubled (was .001) this effect is lessened. In fact, when that happened and I realized that effectively doubled the deposit, I started playing around with the density to further increase deposits. Heh, setting it to .3 was kinda insane (i set it thus because \u0027testium\u0027 was set at .3 and i wanted to see what mining that would be like.). LoL, I didn\u0027t realize what that would do. The little tank (full) massed 45 tons. The 2000 unit pancake tank massed 600 tons. Still playing with the numbers on these really\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m of the thought process that while Kethane (once disturbed by the drills) is a gas but, as it is pumped into the tanks it really should condense down into a liquid form given the low temperatures where it\u0027s being mined. Also consider that Kethane has got to be a fairly heavy complex molecule given that it can be converted to a variety of other materials. Obviously .3 tons per unit was way, way, way to dense but it likely should be at least .005 or a bit higher.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
