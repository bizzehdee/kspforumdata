At the speeds you typically smash into the sun, it\\\u0027s instant death for every object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast week, I cheated a small, infinite-fuel spacecraft with a nigh-invulnerable pod (CrashTolerance and ImpactTolerance values of 1e30) into a low orbit around Kerbol, and tried to MechJeb it down. Since Mechjeb expected the solid surface to be 4500km lower than it was, I expected the spacecraft to crash and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt did... but the pod survived, ricocheting off the surface. Each time it hit, it bounced back up thousands of kilometers. I waited an hour for it to stop, but it never did. I doubt it ever would. Slowest velocity during the bounces was ~850 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
