As soon as I docked, the camera started jiggling and wobbling. I tried to go to the space center, but It said that couldn\u0027t leave (i.e. last saved point was however long ago). I tried to timewarp, but it said that I could not time warp while moving over the surface. I also tried to quicksave, but it told me that I could not do that while moving over terrain. The hub IS docked to the station.\u00A0I think it may have something to do with the probe body I used on the docking hub because I had something similar happen with an upper stage when I tried to re-enter it earlier today. Has anyone else been having this problem?
