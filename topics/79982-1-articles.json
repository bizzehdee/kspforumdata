My reading of it says no but I also read that the Harrier Jump Jet also uses something similar to RCS. I thought RCS thruster were applied only to space craft.

If they were to land on a slope, or a landing leg was coming down on a large rock, RCS might be needed to keep the ship upright. The Harrier uses its system to control attitude because the control surfaces don\u0027t work in hovering or slow flight. High altitude aircraft that travel in very thin atmosphere, such as the X-15 or NF-104 would also use RCS systems to maintain control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T15:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERCS use during landing is seemingly fairly common in KSP, either to fine tune out horizontal velocity or for last-minute terrain avoidance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if it is/has been used for landing of spacecraft in RL, but I suspect someone will be along to tell us fairly soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galacticruler","CreatedById":58398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T15:43:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlexinTokyo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AlexinTokyo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if it is/has been used for landing of spacecraft in RL, but I suspect someone will be along to tell us fairly soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot from my moderate knowledge of landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that it actually makes sense for them to use RCS thrusters to stabilize a ship the size of the one in Prometheus, It didn\u0027t look too well balanced before the engines went into landing leg mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
