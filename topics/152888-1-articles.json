I don\u0027t know what most of those orbit parameters mean, and i think eccentricity is broken. However, it seems to have most of the features of Hyperedit. You can set your ship to orbit around another planet or rendezvous with other ships with it. I\u0027m not sure if it can directly change your velocity or land your ship at certain coordinates or edit the orbits of planets themselves, but in its most barebones form, it looks a lot like hyperedit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess a lot of you have found this already, but if not, just thought i\u0027d leave it here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.
