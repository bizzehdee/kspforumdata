If you miss by hundred of meters, you won\u0027t accelerate anything, and you won\u0027t know you\u0027ve missed the target for several years required for the signal to travel back to you. And nobody thinks about it but even laser beams become diffuse with distance and hence less effective. Also, you\u0027ll have to put your laser into a very-high-inclination orbit or otherwise you won\u0027t have continious beam since the star will be between your laser and your ship from time to time. And moving a lot of mass into a funny orbit is a pain.

I don\u0027t remember NASA doing any large-scale experiments with it. And as I told before - beamed sail technology does not exist so we cannot evaluate how it behaves (yet). And basic rules of conservation of energy still apply - while your laser-propelled ship may be extremely light, the amount of effort you need to put into infrastracture is just as immense as for building nuclear pulse-driven ship. Rules of orbital mechanics prevent object from staying in the same place, so you\u0027ll have to put your solar collector-laser thing into POLAR solar orbit so it would be possible for laser to fire continuously in normal or antinormal directions. Now, start KSP and try to put a small probe into polar orbit around the sun. I did it using gravity assists from Jool and Eve, so it\u0027s perfectly possible even though it still requires a tremendous amount of delta-V. And KSP is free of many real-life concerns so moving huge things using gravity assists is as easy as small probes. Delta-V requirements would still be big enough to think twice about it. And you\u0027ll have only part of the sky covered, so to send your ships to all stars around you\u0027ll have to do some funny things again. That\u0027s just the most obvious thing. And if you do focusing mirrors, it becomes even more interesting delta-V-wise and you\u0027ll have troubles making the system to fire the beam continuously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, all-in-all, I\u0027d think twice about it. Of course, once the infrastructure is there it can be re-used again and again, it\u0027s a plus side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the plasma thing again - it would require a layer of ablative material. It increases the mass quite a bit, but it also allows high initial acceleration which may be a nice as it reduces the time you need to fire continously. And it\u0027s estimated to be much, much more effecient than NERVA. With beam powerful enough one can change orbits of asteroids, and it\u0027s not something your average NERVA might do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, about putting stars close together - I told that the fact that it\u0027s unrealistic can\u0027t be used as an argument to have an even more unrealistic FTL drive. However, we really cannot assume VERY close distances between stars (as we see in star clusters) because we don\u0027t know how being in a star cluster may affect formation of planets and general conditions favourable for life as we know it; it\u0027s just not a good realistic explanation for in-game mechanics.

But why the star destination cant be in a different inclination?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case it would be impossible to just float solar sail above the star, polar orbit is the way to go - this way you won\u0027t have Kerbol/Sun obstructing your field-of-view. You\u0027ll have to put another collector-laser assembly into equatorial orbit to reach stars above and below Kerbol/Sun, and another collector-laser assembly into polar orbit at 90 degrees to the first one. This way you\u0027ll cover all directions.
