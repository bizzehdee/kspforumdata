That would be fine if you could research multiple nodes at the same time but given there are a few nodes that are needed to reach the Apollo program I resorted to the cheaty method of giving myself funds and increasing my upgrade points. I had put about 20-25 points into R\u0026amp;D legitimately before I started \u0027cheating\u0027. I also have been giving myself science points here and there but that may be my play style.

I may not be the best example though since I am using some of the FASA non-RP0 parts which are not costed correctly. I also am hesitant to farm science from Kerbin as I find it tedious (personal opinion). I haven\u0027t been anywhere except the moon and a single Explorer-6 probe sent out into a solar orbit (failed venus attempt). I would like to see if there are other opinions on career difficulty. Maybe Scott Manley will give us a good indication in his video series once he starts getting into space. I\u0027m hesitant to use my opinion since I am still a bit inexperienced with realism overhaul and need more practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso on the topic of missions that was discussed earlier. I also felt the missions were pretty good already and only felt a bit lacking in the Aircraft department. I thought the progression actually felt really good and the Moon impactor and flyby missions felt appropriate. Maybe the crewed moon missions should require a probe impactor or unmanned flyby to be completed before the manned moon missions unlock. I liked the first satellite mission and felt there should be more missions of that style for satellites since they have relaxed orbit requirements. Unlocking stock missions requiring a specific equatorial orbit with low eccentricity is rather intimidating in RO/RSS/RP-0 for myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chrisl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chrisl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think I have an install issue.

Especially when you need so much for level 3 launch pad (basically required for manned moon missions) and R\u0026amp;D. That said, I wouldn\u0027t go more then twice what the current reward is.
