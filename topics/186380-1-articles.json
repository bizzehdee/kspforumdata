So far I\u0027ve been impressed with the new surface science experiments and surface science features, and my Kerbals had a great time setting up stations around the Mun and Minmus and later landing bases and rovers on both of Kerbin\u0027s satellites. At this point in my game, the Kerbals are ready to take their first step out into interplanetary space and have accepted a contract to send a probe to flyby Duna and return. To this end, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E has developed the Quicksilver probe:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BJSytFW.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/BJSytFW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe payload for the quicksilver probe is mounted on top of an older style lifter developed during the early days of the space program, which should have more than enough delta-v to flyby Duna and return to Kerbin. However, the Mission Planners at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E noticed that the transfer window for Duna only comes up very infrequently. So, in an attempt to launch the probe to Duna early, it was equipped with a slapped-together set of solid boosters for its initial ascent:\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rA0LqQC.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/rA0LqQC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe hope is that the extra set of boosters will give the probe enough delta-v to reach Duna and return before the optimal transfer window, leaving the best time for a proper Hohmann transfer open for the first wave of full scale exploration ships.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EHere we see the probe shortly after launch.

After circularization it still had its lower stage attached, minus the boosters. After some messing-about with the maneuver node editor, the probe was on its way to Duna after its interplanetary transfer burn, now minus the its lower stages. The probe is seen here framed nicely in between Kerbin and the Mun on its trip out of the Kerbin system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qNKR3UH.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qNKR3UH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShown below is the (very rushed and inefficient) transfer orbit the probe is on, as well as a picture of the probe\u0027s projected orbit once it enters the Duna system. There is a maneuver node planned in the Duna system itself to circularize the probe\u0027s orbit to match a satellite contract. The maneuver is tentative, as I am unsure if having this probe actually enter orbit as opposed to just flying by will prevent the next \u0022Explore Duna\u0022 contract from being issued. So for now the probe will just head on its merry way until the KSP Mission Planners (aka me!) figure out how to best negotiate with the contractors to fund the full scale of the KSP Duna expedition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228xO4t4Q.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/8xO4t4Q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QncB4BM.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/QncB4BM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUp next:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDesigning craft for actually mapping and landing on Duna, as well as equipment and infrastructure for the first Kerbaled landings on Duna!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerballingSmasher","CreatedById":195689,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-20T06:46:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbiting it on your first try will not cancel the next Explore Duna contract, but it will give you a head start if you accept the next one as soon as you enter Duna\u0027s Sphere of Influence (I\u0027m talking fancy terms, yall!) and then burn for orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samwiseiam","CreatedById":198813,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-30T02:15:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter extensive negotiations with the aerospace contractors regarding financing future Duna exploration (read: using a quicksave to determine whether the \u0022Orbit Duna\u0022 contract would appear after I completed the flyby portion of the \u0022Explore Duna\u0022 contract), the Kerbal Space Center was informed that the contractors were unwilling to offer any additional contracts for exploring the Duna system until the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E proves that a craft can actually return from Duna.

The party atmosphere died for a moment as the assembled Kerbals looked at each other.

The particularly thorny issue at the time was that the seismometer was far away from any kerbals currently on the Mun and with the notifications causing the game to sputter constantly, this meant that sending a mission to recover the offending instrument would be difficult, slow, and frustrating. Eventually with the assistance of quicksave Halsy Kerman used her \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E pack to fly to the offending hardware on what she has named \u0022Craterspike Mountain\u0022 and removed it. I did not take any pictures during the actual mission itself, mostly due to being preoccupied by frustration, but the crew of Munbase did take some pictures after the fact for analysis by mission control and posterity. Seen below is the flag Halsy placed at the peak of Craterspike Mountain after disabling the rogue siesmometer. The icons in the background are for Munbase and its corresponding flag, and are located at the point that Halsy started her jetpack journey:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CT5vCWt.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/CT5vCWt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here, Halsy and Lusy\u00A0 pose by the Munbase rover on the edge of the huge crater that Halsy flew over.

Fortunately, Kerbals are composed largely of gelatin and similarly elastic materials, so Halsy survived the impact, but Lusy then had to recover her since she had no other way to return to Munbase. Fortunately, after carefully descending and then ascending the crater wall, both kerbals returned to Munbase, where Halsy\u0027s EVA suit was retired, both to serve as a future museum piece and due to fears that after its high-speed impact, it was no longer structurally sound enough for future EVAs. Lets hope that things are going better with the Quicksilver Duna probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSaid probe reached Duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and passed by at high altitude and high velocity, recording temperature and atmospheric data as it went, confiming that the space around Duna is indeed composed of vacuum. The craft then made an intercept burn within Duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E to return to kerbin, adding some radial component to the burn in order to attempt to return to Kerbin sooner. The burn itself can be seen below with Duna and Ike visible in the background:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ztbSEFn.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ztbSEFn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was at this point that the head engineer notified Mission Control that the planned heat shield and payload fairing decoupler had not, in fact, actually been installed. This was problematic since the Quicksilver probe was designed to return to the surface of Kerbin after its interplanetary journey and the current mission profile was for the craft to aerocapture around Kerbin and then deorbit almost entirely using Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere to provide breaking force. The kerbals at mission control were divided into teams to present alternate plans for recovering the craft, and it was eventually decided that the craft would use its remaining fuel upon returning to Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E to enter a highly eliptical orbit with a periapsis slightly inside the planet\u0027s atmosphere, at which point repeated passes through the planet\u0027s atmosphere would hopefully deorbit the craft eventually at a velocity low enough that the science package would survive until landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI seriously don\u0027t know how I missed this when building the craft. I specifically designed it with a fairing protected pod that houses the science storage unit and the probe core, with the intention to decouple this pod upon return to kerbin and let it deorbit protected by a heatshield, but I completely forgot the parts critical for the entire plant to work. I\u0027m lucky I hugely overengineered the spacecraft so I have enough delta-V to enter orbit once I return to kerbin, otherwise the entire mission would have to be scrubbed. Next time, hopefully Kerbal Space Station will actually be launched to orbit, and we will discover the fate of the poorly designed Quicksilver probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-30T01:57:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe message spam from deployed science, whether it\u0027s working or because it isn\u0027t, is VERY annoying.\u00A0 I\u0027ve edited the config file by adding about 8x zeros behind whatever was there to begin with.\u00A0 This helps sometimes.\u00A0 But mostly I just go to the tracking station and delete the whole package.\u00A0 Then swear never to use it again until\u00A0 another patch hopefully fixes the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samwiseiam","CreatedById":198813,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-30T05:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned before, the kerbals at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E were working on a design for a space station to be placed in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, creatively titled the Kerbin Space Station. The final design they decided on is seen below on the launchpad and consisted of a cupola module, science lab, dock for a small orbital runabout, docking hub, and habitation module. All of this is powered by two deployable arms that have Gigantor solar panels installed along them, and cooled by a pair of medium radiators. Also mounted to the arms are science experiments and a communication dish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UBIlZQn.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/UBIlZQn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbal Space station is serving a dual role as a functioning space station and a prototype of the core of the planned InterPlanetary Vessel (IPV) in which the space program intends to send kerbals to Duna.
