(Development model VK Nova Mark One, offered to select customers as an interim super-heavy-lift solution, is now obsolete. All orders for VK Nova Mark One will be converted to VK Nova Mark Two.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing a successful test flight, VK is now offering the Nova Mark Two as the solution to all super-heavy-lift needs, be they putting large space stations into low Kerbin orbit in a single throw, or placing smaller spacecraft on escape trajectories to explore the Mun or even more distant bodies. Nova Mark Two is available in four-stage, five-stage, and six-stage versions, depending on the client\u0027s exact needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENova Mark Two four-stage will place a large payload such as a major space station component into low Kerbin orbit. Nova Mark Two five-stage will place a heavier payload into low Kerbin orbit, or offers direct injection to Kerbosynchronous orbit or a trajectory to the Mun with lighter payloads. Nova Mark Two six-stage will place medium payloads on escape trajectories suitable for Mun missions or exploring the Kerbal system. (Nova Mark Two six-stage not recommended for orbital missions due to reduced payload compared to four-stage.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn its recent test flight, the booster performed near-flawlessly, inserting a Mark 1 Command Pod with heat shield and Mark 16-3 parachute pack into an escape trajectory, with a simulated three-Kerbal crew. The only anomalies were longer delays than planned between stage separations and stage firings, and instability after second-stage separation but before third-stage ignition; the latter has been traced to the guidance officer not recognizing the greatly reduced rotational inertia following second stage jettison, and is thus attributable to Kerbal error. Trajectory parameters at fifth stage cutout were: Heading 352 degrees, velocity vector \u002B46 degrees above horizon, altitude 410,000 meters, velocity 4,804.7 meters per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContact your Vulpine Kerbospace representative for sales information, including options packages available to rate the booster for Kerbal spaceflight requirements, and strap-on booster options for further increases in payload capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENova Mark Two engine data:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVKN-I (first stage): 7 Kerbaldyne General M-50 kerosene/oxygen engines, 6 Kerbaldyne General SAS-2 vernier pods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVKN-IIC (second stage): 1 Vaccerspace BFE-3 hydrogen/oxygen engine, 6 Kerbaldyne General SAS-2 vernier pods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVKN-III (third stage): 1 Doubledown Construction Ltd.

Anyone who wants to try the Nova Mark One, just pull off the Big Effen Engine from the second stage and replace it with a 4x800 cluster, since that was my original version; I made the swap because the Mark One\u0027s second stage was severely underpowered, and my inital attempt at replacing it with five M-50s wouldn\u0027t hold together on launch, even using straps to stabilize them...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redneck","CreatedById":2030,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-16T15:48:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Every nice rocket indeed.
