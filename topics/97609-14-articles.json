This brought with it some bugs, many of which still exist. So as the game grew, new features have been installed without as much modding access to speed up development. This came with the promise that they\u0027d circle back and add it later. Well, its later now, and there is a large amount of work to do on the backend to polish the modding tools. We don\u0027t yet know how the big changes already planned will change mods within the game. The new Aero system could completely break FAR (and with it any mod that uses it, like most of the Realism mods) which means we\u0027d have a big 1.0 release without some of the biggest and best mods even working (and it wouldn\u0027t be a matter of just waiting for the mod authors to fix it) - There could be an entire updates worth of work on this alone, easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBugfixing\u003C/strong\u003E - KSP is supposed to be buggy still. Its been in Alpha development the whole time so far. In Alpha you don\u0027t spend large amounts of time fixing bugs in your code because that could could be replaced at any time the very next update cycle. Given that KSP has been a public alpha, they have spent time each release on *some* bugfixes, especially related to whatever new thing they just added. But by and large there is a big list of things that were pushed until \u0022Later\u0022 to be fixed. Again, \u0022Later\u0022 is now. If we could spent one update on modding issues, we could spend 2 on bugfixes. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis is the other major part of a Beta Phase\u003C/strong\u003E, the phase we seem to be outright skipping in its entirety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe next release, as described in harvester\u0027s post is already surely one of, if not THE biggest KSP updates thus far. Just getting that much done is going to be an accomplishment. It is not reasonable to expect that any of the other things listed here can be done alongside this huge update. There\u0027s easily 3 or 4 more updates worth of things that definitely need to be finished. To call the game released and toss it out into the public before then frankly wastes several years of work getting it ready. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s like running a marathon and then stopping 50 feet in front of the finish line to take a picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Robotengineer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Robotengineer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAfter reading through most of this thread, and the poll results, it appears as though NO is the consensus.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to try to lay out the reasons the community believes that the entry into public access is happening much to quickly, in no particular order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUnity 5.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity 5 will bring many new features, the features that the Kommunity has the most interest in will be optimization and PysX 3.3 (Multithreading?).

If 1.0 is on-par with the 2 previous releases, it would be good enough for the Kommunity, but not potential buyers who are unfamiliar with the quality of early access releases. That would lead to reveiws such as, \u0022I have waited for the full release of this game for more than a year. I was quite dissapointed with the quality of this game, as it does not feel complete, the art assets are not uniform, the career mode is somewhat hard to understand and it crashes often on my computer.\u0022 There have probably been reviews like this, but Squad has had the \u0027Early Access\u0027 shield to deflect these critcisms by saying that things will be fixed in the next update. Potential buyers would be turned off, thinking (incorrectly) that this is something of a final update.

However there are many other Realism features that have been requested, though the top ones are re-entry heating, ISP scaling, and some sort of antenna/communication overhaul.

Antenna/Comms are less popular, but something along the lines of AntennaRange or RemoteTech, the latter being a lite version.

This brought with it some bugs, many of which still exist. So as the game grew, new features have been installed without as much modding access to speed up development. This came with the promise that they\u0027d circle back and add it later. Well, its later now, and there is a large amount of work to do on the backend to polish the modding tools. We don\u0027t yet know how the big changes already planned will change mods within the game. The new Aero system could completely break FAR (and with it any mod that uses it, like most of the Realism mods) which means we\u0027d have a big 1.0 release without some of the biggest and best mods even working (and it wouldn\u0027t be a matter of just waiting for the mod authors to fix it) - There could be an entire updates worth of work on this alone, easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBugfixing\u003C/strong\u003E - KSP is supposed to be buggy still. Its been in Alpha development the whole time so far. In Alpha you don\u0027t spend large amounts of time fixing bugs in your code because that could could be replaced at any time the very next update cycle. Given that KSP has been a public alpha, they have spent time each release on *some* bugfixes, especially related to whatever new thing they just added. But by and large there is a big list of things that were pushed until \u0022Later\u0022 to be fixed. Again, \u0022Later\u0022 is now. If we could spent one update on modding issues, we could spend 2 on bugfixes. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis is the other major part of a Beta Phase\u003C/strong\u003E, the phase we seem to be outright skipping in its entirety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe next release, as described in harvester\u0027s post is already surely one of, if not THE biggest KSP updates thus far. Just getting that much done is going to be an accomplishment. It is not reasonable to expect that any of the other things listed here can be done alongside this huge update. There\u0027s easily 3 or 4 more updates worth of things that definitely need to be finished.

My initial reaction was no, but that was due to fear of the unknown. What comes after 1.0? Will they continue to work on it or toss it aside like so many other early Access titles have done? The fear of that happening was quite motivating and is more prevalent on this board than many probably want to admit. But Squad has given us no reason to assume they are washing their hands of it. It that were the case, we would not have gotten an ambitious list of what is coming down the pipe. We would have just signed on one day and *POOF* 1.0! Maxmaps has responded in this thread and on Twitter with some good PR. Enough to convince me to trust them as I always have. It would seem that once 0.90 was released, it became apparent that the work needed to round it all out wasn\u0027t as far away as they initially thought it would be, and since they built the game (not just modding it,) they know the inner workings enough to hammer it all out in one final push. I have full faith in Squad\u0027s ability to do this. I have bought many games for way too much money over the years that over-promised and under-delivered. I was unsure of KSP but the demo sold me and I bought 0.18. I have yet to be let down and am now going to enjoy the rest of the ride. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you Maxmaps for easing fears.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rynak","CreatedById":115092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T01:32:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe one thing I could see potentially bailing the game out of this mess while still sticking to their statement of the next version being the official release, is if this time they open up experimentals to absolutely everyone to make sure that it gets hammered on as much as possible to track down any lingering bugs before it gets put out the door, and be willing to leave it in experimentals for as long as necessary to make sure it\u0027s stable and balanced to a reasonable degree. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that would basically simply turn experimental snapshots into unofficial 0.91, 0.92 and so on, and yes it would be reasonable. The problem i see is them probably not allocating enough time, to do all this bugfixing and optimization AND at the same time implement all those new features, then balance, bugfix and optimize them too.... i mean, they wouldn\u0027t be announcing 1.0 as the next version now already, if they were planning for it to take half a year. What would be the point of that? No, they\u0027re in crunch mode to make it \u0022feature complete\u0022 at the last minute.... bugfixing or optimization won\u0027t have high priority.
