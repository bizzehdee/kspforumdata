If you\u0027re just bombing around at low altitude, you want minimal drag, so a single structural intake is fine. For a spaceplane, you want at least .18m^2 of intake area per engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Wings will begin to lose their effectiveness at around 25km and become useless at around 32km, depending on wing loading. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have some tutorials and comparison data on intakes, wings, and spaceplane construction tips in the tutorial section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Best,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-10T12:14:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2015 12:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T12:20:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience, it greatly depends which intake you are using. Generally, more of the cheaper, lower tech intakes are needed than the fancier, higher tech ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou definitely want more intakes if you are going above the thick part of the atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir intakes become very ineffective above about 36 km and jet/turbojet engines will flame out unless the throttle is pushed way down. Wings also become less effective at this altitude, but it seems as though they are still providing some lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know enough about the aerodynamic model in KSP to give you any exact values, but I have a spaceplane with one turbojet, and I can easily make orbital velocity using only two shock cone intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a lot of trial-and-error design when I first started making planes/spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.

If you intend to fly high and fast, you actually want very large wings. This is not realistic but is due to some inaccuracy in the aerodynamics model in-game. As you get into the upper part of your flight, where intakes start having difficulty, you also need extra wing surface and control surface to generate lift or else the atmosphere may start to pitch your ship toward your heading and you won\u0027t be able to get the high angle of attack you need to continue raising your altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have enough air intakes and wing surface (bigger emphasis on intakes) then you will be able to pass above 20km and into the range where the more the atmosphere thins the faster you can go. If you raise your altitude slow enough, you can simply keep increasing your speed as you go up, and your intake air will decrease a lot slower. Also, as drag evaporates into nothingness, you need less and less engine power to keep going. For instance, a plane with 3 jet engines can switch off the outer two when the air thins too far to run them, and keep the center engine running to a significantly higher altitude, and still have enough thrust to increase your velocity. You\u0027ll want a TWR greater than 2:1 for passing above 20km but around 25-30km when even multiple intakes begin to suffer, you can lower your TWR even below 1:1 and likely still have your velocity increasing. A big part of this is that you are already going a significant chunk of orbital velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce down to a single engine, you don\u0027t have to worry about your craft spinning out of control when the engine starts to sputter from low oxygen. If it goes out, just throttle down until it turns on again, and nose down a bit to level out your trajectory until you reach a higher velocity. As you burn fuel, your craft will get lighter and you will be able to go even higher and faster with some patience. Using this method with a somewhat reasonable number of air intakes I was able to take my craft higher than orbital velocity at around 28km altitude. It gave me an apoapsis greater than the diameter of Kerbin, and had I known about air-canning, I could have made an orbit with no rocket engines. That\u0027s when you close intakes at an altitude and velocity in which you were still able to run engines, and it holds a tiny chunk of air inside them. Then at apoapsis you throttle up your engines and point prograde, then open the intakes. The engines burn for an instant, and increase your velocity just a tad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-10T12:33:24Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2015 12:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heagar","CreatedById":67859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T16:40:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on what your plane should be capable off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a plane with a basic jet engine one intake is enough, since this engine starts to loose power at about 15 km altitude anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the advanced jet engine and one intake you can go up to 26 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in case you are planning to build a STTO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ewith three intakes per engine you are on the safe side without problems\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ewith two intakes per engine you should hit at least 1800 m/s between 30-36 km, then it is not important, if your air-intake reading is zero.
