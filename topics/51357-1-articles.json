I realize that if I knew the right keywords to search for it would be trivial to find if it exists but I don\u0027t remember what it was called.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic idea was to design something that no one else could get into orbit (they were allowed to add whatever they wanted to add to the craft, but they couldn\u0027t break it apart). I think the goal may have been to design the lightest object that was impossible to get to orbit intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone can find it, that would be wonderful. If we can\u0027t find it, I\u0027d like to try to start it again.

I could not for the life of me remember what it was called. Enjoy your rep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think my addition to your rules would make the challenge more attractive. Obviously you can build something that weighs 1000 tons that no one could orbit, but what\u0027s the smallest craft that can\u0027t be orbited in KSP? In this case, there would be two kinds of winners: 1) The person with the lightest craft that no one has managed to orbit. and 2) the person with the best solution for a given challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink about it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
