To achieve this he had arranged the aircraft such that all of its \u0022sensitive\u0022 bits were shielded behind the wing-structure and other pieces of the aircraft body.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTetris was the only remaining pilot with Thomlock and Glextrix in space and Edsel busy testing the Sulpher-series landers, and so was the only one available for the Aluminium X-4B 8 test mission. She suited up, climbed aboard and was busy working through the pre-flight checklist when one of the interns climbed the ladder and handed her an envelope. An envelope marked \u0022Operation Ice Castle. Open only during range test flight (test 3).\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour tests had been devised for Tetris and the Al-X4B-8. First: establish the craft\u0027s true operating altitude and speed while fully fueled. The craft would climb to the highest altitude possible, then descend towards the surface at no more than a 30 degree \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E to record its max speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second test was to determine if the aircraft could safely refuel from a non-standard source while on the ground. The actual design of the refueling platform for Laythe had yet to be settled on, but the interface was expected to use the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E hoses. The \u0022refuel target\u0022 as such would be little more than a small tank.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third test was the longest and most tedious of the Al-X4B-8 flight. After refueling, Tetris would take the aircraft North until reaching either the North Pole or bingo fuel (or just short of it), land to spend the night, and then return to the space center. This would test both the aircraft\u0027s operating range and its ability to land on basic, non-graded terrain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the fourth test was to determine the operating envelope for the aircraft while nearly empty. This test would be conducted while over the space center after the conclusion of test 3, repeating the steps of test 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160318_ksp0008_al-x4b-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160318_ksp0008_al-x4b-8.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo start, Tetris fired up the twin engines and lifted casually off the runway. The craft was well balanced, at least when full, though it did have a somewhat high liftoff speed. Care would be needed in choosing a landing site if the craft was to be used on Laythe. Somewhere over the ocean, and close to 3km up she banked around 180 degrees and continued to climb.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160318_ksp0012_al-x4b-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160318_ksp0012_al-x4b-8.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160318_ksp0016_al-x4b-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160318_ksp0016_al-x4b-8.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis craft wasn\u0027t designed for, nor would it ever reach, high altitude flight. The only true design consideration was to build a craft that could survive atmospheric reentry on an alien moon and still function. Tetris found the ideal altitude ceiling to be around 9.5km, an altitude where the jet could maintain a reasonable cruising speed yet still maneuver. The absolute ceiling was declared to be 11km, which the Al-X4B-8 danced around for some minutes before Tetris once again pulled a 180 and made her way back to the runway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile she was out the ground crews had prepared a small semi-mobile fuel tank. As they had yet to learn the secrets of rover wheels, the tank could only sit in the middle of the runway and await Tetris\u0027 return.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRefueling was a simple affair involving hoses and proximity. It also was cause for celebration, as the World\u0027s First representative soon appeared with a new plaque: We have started building the first \u0022outpost\u0022 on Kerbin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160318_ksp0029_al-x4b-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160318_ksp0029_al-x4b-8.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160318_ksp0030_al-x4b-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160318_ksp0030_al-x4b-8.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYay?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Al-X4B was topped off and in short order Tetris was airborne and headed North.

She pulled up the air chart and discovered the coordinates were on her way to the North Pole, and so continued her true-North heading. It was well outside the range of any ground-based radar installations, and likely completely beyond kerrestrial radio signals. At that latitude her only contact with the space center would be through one of the polar communications satellites. Nobody would know if she din\u0027t tell them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight was mildly interesting, as was the terrain. There were a good many small towns and larger cities below, seemingly frozen as she slipped past at more than half the speed of sound. Occasionally a small mountain range or group of hills. Eventually civilization and the rough terrain thinned out and ice and snow took their place. And then she was near the recon point.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160318_ksp0062_al-x4b-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160318_ksp0062_al-x4b-8.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was difficult to make out at first, especially since she blasted over the site at 8km. The Aluminium X-4B banked nicely and went into a dive as Tetris pulled to the East, preparing for a lower-altitude survey pass.

Barely more than specks on the vast plains of ice and snow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so on the next pass she came down for a landing... and overshot.
