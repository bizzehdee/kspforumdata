I\u0027m able to zoom out after a second or two but I can\u0027t refocus on my ship, or the KSC. I can focus on different planets and that\u0027s about it. Anyone have any ideas or tips? Otherwise I will probably be unintelligible it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Parv Kerman","CreatedById":160918,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T16:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsame has been happened with me, it was written, \u0022mod in progress\u0022!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T17:08:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi\u00A0 the simple fact here is that BDA has not yet been fully upgraded to 1.1.2 and is only compatible with 1.1.1.
