That\u0027s assuming Windows, as path lengths would not be an issue on Mac/Linux filesystems, but in Windows must be less than 255 characters (which is way more than would be the case with even a default Steam KSP installation).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LowOrbit","CreatedById":100377,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T18:18:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Roxette!
