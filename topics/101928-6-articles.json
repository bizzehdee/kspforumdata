Why have a list of traits to check for when you can just check whether the trait has one specific effect? I could add ExConstructionSkill to scientists (or any number of other traits) and EL\u0027s check, in its current form, would catch them all. Also, effects can have level-based modifiers that affect how well the kerbal performs the task. On top of that, it seems that adding an effect to the trait of one kerbal does not affect any other kerbal: you could have sub-classes, eg engineer A can do X, engineer B can do Y, but neither can do the other\u0027s job, even if they\u0027re the same level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMu gave us a very powerful tool.

Of cause, a number of them also contain relevant parts in KAS containers (original KAS containers as well as Versatile Toolbox (Nazari) and the really large containers from Kerbice). I can deal with editing or MM\u0027ing their functionality, but going with a ship everywhere and reworking all the containers (and apparently also the replacing the mounting parts?) might likely be more work than it is worth :/ Do you see any chance for a save file conversion script at all?
