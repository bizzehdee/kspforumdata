I was trying out the ASET Rover with this, and it would work better if sometimes the Kerbals have to just grab it on their back like in KAS.

I\u0027m trying to avoid any dependancy with KIS.\n\u003E Also, what exactly is your problem by checking the trait name ? It seem simple and good enough for me. I\u0027m using it only to restrict the use of the screwdriver and the wrench to engineer, but if you don\u0027t set the parameter in the config file, nothing is restricted at all.\n\nActually, it is quite possible to add an effect from code: Effects is just a list so you can do crew.experienceTrait.Effects.Add(newEffect). The problem is when to do it. [edit] it looks like you can do it in an onKerbalAdded handler, but that won\u0027t handle loading existing kerbals (even after adding the effect).\n\nAs to the problem with checking the trait name: flexibility and code cleanliness. Why have a list of traits to check for when you can just check whether the trait has one specific effect? I could add ExConstructionSkill to scientists (or any number of other traits) and EL\u0027s check, in its current form, would catch them all. Also, effects can have level-based modifiers that affect how well the kerbal performs the task. On top of that, it seems that adding an effect to the trait of one kerbal does not affect any other kerbal: you could have sub-classes, eg engineer A can do X, engineer B can do Y, but neither can do the other\u0027s job, even if they\u0027re the same level.\n\nMu gave us a very powerful tool. Please don\u0027t waste it.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I totally agree and you\u0027re right on that point. Gameplay can easily be used as an excuse to make things convenient.\n\u003E But...\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, it\u0027s not our way.\n\u003E \n\u003E IMO, in simulation games, \u0022simulation\u0022 doesn\u0027t mean \u0022real\u0022. Au contraire, a simulation \u0022simulates\u0022, it \u0022fakes\u0022 reality. \n\u003E \n\u003E Then, the point is not to make something real, it\u0027s to make an illusion of real. And as it\u0027s a game, it has to be an \u0022entertaining realism\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Real\u0022 include boredom or frustration elements as waiting (too long) or repeating (always the same thing).\n\u003E \n\u003E The \u0022gameplay purpose\u0022 I mentioned is not an excuse but a conscious choice, to limit those element and to keep the player interest and entertainment high.\n\u003E \n\u003E So about the inventory size, we want a good balance between believable (to keep that cool illusion) and gameplay focus (to avoid the \u0022annoying realism\u0022 effect).\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, the setting.cfg is here to allow you to change those parameter ther way you want ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI agree, too much realism would make everything unusable: it very much is a balancing act, which is something I was trying to say but failed to. My real point (again, failed, I think) was that I hoped it was just that little bit of anti-grind (like timewarp: most would still be on their way to Duna if KSP didn\u0027t have timewarp, assuming they hadn\u0027t given up).\n\nAgain, I apologize. I\u0027ve seen \u0022gameplay\u0022 used to justify truly bogus mechanics or vilify good mechanics too often.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T12:54:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 12:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by taniwha**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sanguine-Fiend","CreatedById":134857,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T13:11:33Z","Content":"Much appreciated buddy, KAS is one of my favourite.

So some things in the user guide (pdf) have me concerned:\n\nSpecifically, it says I can drag and drop parts to the ground (\u0022any surface\u0022), but what is the equivalent in space? Can I still set parts adrift, e.g. to start a new construction? And regarding detaching/re-attaching containers, can they also be moved directly between (a) different mounts part on the same ship, and (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) between different ships, without the need to put them on the ground first?\n\nI am also concerned by the \u0022containers can not be opened remotely\u0022 statement: does this mean it is no longer possible to check the contents of containers without an EVA kerbal next to it? I.e. when a \u0022cargo supply\u0022 ship has 10\u002B containers, it really helps to first find the item which needs to be pulled out before going EVA.\n\nRegarding loading of containers in the VAB: how would one add parametric parts, like specific parachutes (for Real Chutes)? (Or if you need an, admittedly totally arbitrary, stock example: try partially filled fuel tanks.)\n\nIs the max distance to handle objects (attachMaxDist etc. in KAS) configurable in KIS via .cfg? I had to recompile KAS in the past to adjust these values (because of large parts where 2.0 just didn\u0027t work, even with the kerbal sticking the nose into the part). I understand generally dealing with large parts is solved now, so it may not be as serious of a problem any more. Edit: should have finished reading the user guide first.\n\nFinally, my biggest concern really is the (non-)conversion of existing KAS container (inventories) to the new system. For example my current \u0022main\u0022 save contains about three dozen \u0022derelict objects\u0022 (ships, stations and asteroid colonies from previous saves, which have been broken by the various strut/fuel line changes or just plain abandoned); these are left to be re-discovered and repaired or recovered by the new crew (KAS prime time); some of them including parts/technologies which I house-ruled I may not use until re-discovered regardless of what the tech tree says (take that, difficulty setting!). Of cause, a number of them also contain relevant parts in KAS containers (original KAS containers as well as Versatile Toolbox (Nazari) and the really large containers from Kerbice). I can deal with editing or MM\u0027ing their functionality, but going with a ship everywhere and reworking all the containers (and apparently also the replacing the mounting parts?) might likely be more work than it is worth :/ Do you see any chance for a save file conversion script at all? I haven\u0027t had the chance to check how a KIS container looks in the save yet, so I have no idea how difficult it would be to transfer contents, and I have no idea whether the new container models would fit into the places of the old KAS containers and mounting part.\n\nUh, sorry for the long post, and by no means should you consider that a putdown of your great work on the new system - it really does look nice and is probably going to help a lot in the long-term maintainability of the code base.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T22:34:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 10:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kiwa**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddragon","CreatedById":66937,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T16:36:47Z","Content":"I really like it!
