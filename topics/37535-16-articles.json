How far that goes I would have no idea at the moment. My goal is to make the shuttle functional in a one stop solution. I don\u0027t want to fidget was stuff, even if it means it requires a mod solution to be a part of it. Its flight characteristics as well as the engine numbers are all bound with the assumption of ZRM\u0027s avionics mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was one reason why earlier on I had asked ZRM in his thread if his mod could be integrated into a part. For purposes of this mod it would have been integrated in the avionics portion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZRM will be taking over that portion of the project (coming up in the next few days). I asked him specifically to integrate it all with his mod. The goal is (my goal is) that the average user can download the mod and in just a few minutes with basic KSP launch, orbiting, maneuvering, and decent skills be able to fly this thing. That is my top priority and I\u0027m not deviating from that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout his mod (and without proper numbers and flight envelope parameters) people are going to have a nightmare flying, launching, and putting this in orbit. I know, I tried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the part I don\u0027t know (and I\u0027m sure he probably doesn\u0027t at the moment) is if the KSO will have its own version of ZRM\u0027s avionics mod as part of it. We\u0027ll find that out once we start testing things in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify: I don\u0027t know if you will need KCA specifically. I do know, and I have asked ZRM to use something similar (or the same) to wire the KSO so that it flies properly both atmospherically and in orbit in a space shuttle (piggy back) configuration. He might end up programing an FCS using his KCA mod, I don\u0027t know. The ultimate goal again, is for the average non-advanced user to be flying this thing successfully 5 minutes after installing it. Maybe later we\u0027ll release a bare bones version without an FCS for advanced users of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want my work and his work on the project to focus on cool add-ons to the shuttle; functional MFDs and IVA components, a mini rover, a mini roving vehicle, docking accessories, space station components that fit the cargo bay, alternate cargo bay segments like a crew module, expansion of the mission deck with lab stations, lift vehicle, and so on. I don\u0027t want to bog down the project with flight, center of mass, center of lift problems, drop rate, lack of proper flight envelope, and what have you, as to me that isn\u0027t fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-15T03:21:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2013 03:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by helldiver\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skykooler","CreatedById":60459,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T04:06:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am hoping that the shuttle won\u0027t need the bit of ZRM\u0027s mod (lpsolve) that makes it platform-specific - I would hate to see this beautiful shuttle but not be able to run it because I don\u0027t have Windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZRM","CreatedById":64626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T08:08:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022skykooler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022skykooler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am hoping that the shuttle won\u0027t need the bit of ZRM\u0027s mod (lpsolve) that makes it platform-specific - I would hate to see this beautiful shuttle but not be able to run it because I don\u0027t have Windows.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod does still run on platforms other than Windows - you just can\u0027t use the balancing features of it.
