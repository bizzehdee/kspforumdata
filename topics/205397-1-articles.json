Playing on the PS5 in career mode. Is it possible to recover rocket engines that crash back to Kerbin? Obviously I\u0027ll need to attach a parachute to each part to slow it down. I\u0027m thinking along the lines of SpaceX and reusability/ getting funds back. Is this feasible or a waste of time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-27T19:38:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s technically feasible, but very difficult to do- you\u2019d need to launch the second stage high enough and fast enough that you can get the first stage down to the surface and land it, then switch back to the second stage before it reaches apoapsis and put that into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-27T21:28:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason for jimmy\u0027s answer is that while in atmosphere parts which leave simulation distance from the ship you are flying will be automatically deleted by the game. Also, parts which get within a certain radius of a planet or moon will be auto deleted. You would need game mods to get around these problems.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-27T21:53:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther to previous comments- below ~25km, anything in an atmosphere but not within physics range will be automatically deleted by the game. To recover your first stage, you\u2019d need to have that one focussed and land it first, then switch to the second stage which by then should be in space and hopefully not falling back into the atmosphere; doing it the other way around will just delete the first stage before you can recover it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods can help with this, but you can\u2019t use mods on a console so you\u2019re stuck with the hard way\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal Productions","CreatedById":208620,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-28T03:16:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224047898\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205397\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221635370101\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would need game mods to get around these problems.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhich is impossible as the person who is asking here is on console (PS5)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224047805\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205397\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221635353393\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022217094\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Andy_Moz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Andy_Moz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this feasible or a waste of time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would call it a waste of time.
