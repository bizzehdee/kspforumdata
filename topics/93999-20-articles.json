The thing is, they said they didn\u0027t want to give Slate an atmosphere because then it would turn into another, beige, Eve which wouldn\u0027t be that new or unique. Completely sound reasoning and I agree here. However, apparently Slate used to have a thick atmosphere but do to a \u0027cataclysm\u0027 lost it recently. It is highly unlikely that ALL of it would be lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have been proposing - and would \u003Cstrong\u003ELOVE\u003C/strong\u003E - is for Slate to be given a very thin atmosphere. Like half - a third - heck, a quarter as thick as Dunas! Duna has the thinnest atmosphere in the game currently yet is it still thick enough to fly planes pretty well! \u003Cstrong\u003EThis is not right! \u003C/strong\u003ECombined with the high gravity of Slate, landing would not be made much easier at all but would make the whole planet seem more interesting. We already have Tylo! It is essentially a more detailed, farther away Tylo copy with roughly the same size and gravity. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I love the attention to detail with the terrain and I have already has a great time exploring one of its mountain ridges (I have barely scratched the surface though - it is huge (in a good way)), but I think it needs something to set it apart from any currently existing planet/moon in the game. Think about it! Slate already has mountains up to 10 km high so the (hopefully soon to be implemented \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) thin atmosphere would bearly exist up there but accumulate in the canyons and on the ancient sea bed a little! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, I don\u0027t have any real plans to go there in my career mode series. Eeloo has the same access to other moons in the Sarnus system, has less gravity so is easier to navigate and has the exact same atmospheric properties so I don\u0027t have any real motivation to set up a base on Slate over Eeloo. If, however, Slate has a tenuous atmosphere, more science could be gained - resulting in more variety, messing around in the thin atmosphere would still be fun. Parachutes would still open but not have any real affect to slow you down to a safe speed. That\u0027s the kind of thickness I\u0027m talking about. At the moment, I can land a large rocket on Duna using parachutes alone! Again, I love Duna and \u003Cstrong\u003EI don\u0027t think IT should change\u003C/strong\u003E, but I do wish there was another type of planet available. One with igh gravity and a thin atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing back to wasmic\u0027s original comment, I don\u0027t want a thick atmosphere for Slate, we already have those (Kerbin, Laythe and Eve) and I have seen Novaslisko\u0027s post about his ideas for moons in the future I just think a THIN atmosphere is the way to go to further improve and expand this already fantastic mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry this has been a long post - I got carried away but please take my suggestion seriously. If you (the creators of the mod) really don\u0027t want Slate to have an atmosphere, I am fine with that. As I\u0027ve said, I already like it and admire the attention to detail in it\u0027s surface!

It\u0027s a side effect of a bug that\u0027s also impacting other stuff: some properties applied to new bodies are applied to the template body too. It\u0027s even worse when you have multiple bodies use the same template. OPM only reuses Jool for multiple bodies, but for a gas giant that\u0027s not that bad as it has less interactivity than solid planets/moons. Anyway, this bug is not easily fixed and will require more than a few changes to the Kopernicus. Hopefully someone will be able to take that on, but in the meantime we\u0027re stuck with the biome bug. Maybe there\u0027s a workaround without a Kopernicus update, but I\u0027m not counting on it (although trying is never off the table).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a MM config that disables the biomes will be best, as the templates used are more important for science than the distant moons of Sarnus and beyond. People can remove that config and reactive the biomes if they want to explore Sarnus\u0027 moons with more interesting stuff to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, it\u0027s a big blow to see this bug pop up. It kinda makes 1.3 feel like a waste of time, since all its features are somewhat useless now. In the future if Kopernicus gets fixed it\u0027ll be nice to have all those biomes already done, but in the meantime it just sucks. I think the best thing moving forward is to just make the mod as complete in all the areas that do work. Third party mod support like Regolith, EVE or Astronomers. Adding more moons, that sort of thing. It might not be 100% suited for a serious career save until Kopernicus improves, but for sandbox or just mucking around in career it should be possible to get the mod the way we want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tellion","CreatedById":116794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T21:09:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMeh, disabling the biomes via MM does not seem to work (or, more likely, I am missing something), so I will toss this here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Kopernicus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E @Body[Hale]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E @Properties\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E !biomeMap {}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E !Biomes {}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E @Body[Ovok]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E @Properties\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E !biomeMap {}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E !Biomes {}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E @Body[slate]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E @Properties\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E !biomeMap {}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E !Biomes {}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice any issues with that?
