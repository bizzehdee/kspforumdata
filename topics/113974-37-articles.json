When I first started putting words down in June 2015 I had only the vaguest idea where things were going and no solid ending in mind. The words weave as the words will, I suppose. I had plenty of internal moments of \u0022Why do you people read this drivel?! It\u0027s *crap!* A liquored-up monkey farting on a keyboard could write better than this!\u0022 Fortunately, I listened to y\u0027all and not myself. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nAlso thanks to [@vsully](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129549-vsully/), [@Alpha 360](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/166007-alpha-360/), KSK and others I\u0027m no doubt missing for supplying crucial bits right when they were needed.\n\nAnd a *very* special thanks to Ten Key for sticking with me and dumping Kerm knows how much of his own time (that could have been spent on his *own* story ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)) into making mine so much better.

Of course, a big pile of money from a publisher would go a long way towards assuaging that. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) (But fanfiction writers are very rarely privy to big piles of money from *anyone*.)\n\nTho it\u0027s funny how this thing bites you. For about 30 seconds after posting the epilogue I had this feeling of great relief and now I can just relax...\n\n...then I thought, \u0022well, maybe I can start putting down a few words to the prologue for *Revelations of the Kraken*... just... a couple... three maybe... I\u0027ve got it mostly figured out in my head... just like, six...*I don\u0027t have a problem! I can quit any time I want!\u0022* ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif \u0022:sealed:\u0022)\n\nAnd now for some actual entertainment. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022)\n\nThe [soundtrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/113974-whispers-of-the-kraken-epilogue-revelations-of-the-kraken/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2933719)has been updated with the final few songs, tho I never could find a version of that, ahem, traditional Gednalnan hymn that I liked. You\u0027ll have to use your imagination.\n\nAlso, as his his style, Ten Key often demonstrates how *he* might write a certain thing. Below are a couple examples picked out from the stacks of messages I rooted through.\n\nFrom around Chapter 28...  \n\n-- As mentioned, this whole scene feels very \u0022NASA\u0022, and just doesn\u0027t work for me. I would go dark with this, maybe have the engineers grasping for a solution, and then have the political officer appear, with the sad, fake smile. It is fortunate that Dibella did not die in space, for that would embarrass the Imperium! No, Dibella has returned safely after a successful mission, and has chosen to retire to a place of solitude, where she might be free from the attention of the foreign media! Any one who talks, dies. Some of you may die anyways, that is the way of things. Papers please.  \n\n...  \n\nSo the political officer shows up, Darkwing Duck style, and scares the heck out of Bald spot and friends, and slams the door on Dibilla\u0027s life. And Valentina tears him apart with her bare hands. There would need to be some careful writing here, not unlike when Edgas killed Edmund on the beach in Shadows. But this time, Valentina wrests control from the darkness. And that also is going to take careful writing, the darkness at first exulting and then, suddenly the sense of victory becomes one of fear.\n\nAnd then, do the flash of light thing through the window, the engineers, stunned, starting at her. And she points out of the window.\n\n\u0022You see that?\u0022 She pulls a slip of paper from the dead Kommissar. \u0022We have the launch codes for that.\u0022\n\nNo weakness here, no turning back. And at the end, have someone come in, a technician (faceless NPC time, maybe see if you can pull one of those faceless techs from the last chapter) steps through the door and sees the Kommissar\u0027s broken, mangled body. \u0022Oh my God! What happened?!\u0022\n\nAnd Valentina sets her jaw, again the feral smile, steps over the bloodied corpse and heads for the door.\n\n\u0022He slipped on his tea.\u0022\n\nAnd where are we going with this? Where does it end? With Valentina victorious, but with a broken mind, and in an Imperium asylum. But perhaps she escapes, and somehow makes her way back to her broken home, where what\u0027s left of her spends its days prowling the forests like an animal, and its nights talking to her departed deda. And it is sad, and it is heart rending.\n\nAnd she is so *happy*....\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n...So, let\u0027s say the ship is meant to use an N2/O2 mix, but the life support system isn\u0027t fully integrated/tested/whatever. The quick and easy junkyard fix is to swap the N2 tanks with Helium. It\u0027s much safer, and far more tolerant of gas imbalances. And it has the hilarious side effect of making everyone sound like Mickey Mouse....  \n\nIn a similar vein, you had mentioned Dibilla had been sick from space food in an earlier chapter. If their suits are connected, and if Dibilla is still having gastrointestinal issues, well, you can\u0027t go wrong with a good fart joke. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)  \n\n(I may have to steal this one later...)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFrom Chapter 74...\n\nThere\u0027s a belching joke in there somewhere.\n\n    -Was there *EVER*.![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif \u0022:sticktongue:\u0022) I think that pretty much made the chapter.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFrom Chapter 96:  \n\n[Raw Scene]\n\nDibella stands in the \u003Cmemorial square=\u0022\u0022\u003E in the dead of Ussari Winter. She huddles in her coat against the cold, emotionally drained. General descriptions of the cold stone, the barren earth, the stark government buildings. \n\u003C/memorial\u003E\n\nShe stands alone in front of two graves, the markers indicating high ranking members of the Party. They are her parents. \n\nShe ruminates on the futility of standing against \u0022forces\u0022. She can see, in the corner of her vision, dark, cloaked figures entering the cemetery, but she does not take her eyes off the graves. The wind cuts through her coat and she knows her time is short.\n\nThe figures surround her, and now she does lift her eyes, not to the intruders, but to the window of the Kommisar\u0027s office in one of the nearby buildings. Her parents had gone all the way to the Kommisar for help, but in the end, it hadn\u0027t been enough to save them.\n\nThey had, after all, gotten in her way.\n\n\u0022The Kommisar takes his lunch alone in one hour. I have arranged for that wing of the building to be empty. See that it is done.\u0022\n\nOne of the cloaked figures bows, sharpened teeth briefly visible under the hood, and then they depart.\n\nDibella lights a rat tail, regards her parents graves for a few final moments. There could be no loose ends. She turns and moves to leave, eyes moving now to Valentina\u0027s grave marker. \n\nNo, no loose ends.\n\n[End Scene]  \n\nBr\u00DCtal. Just br\u00DCtal. With a capital umlaut. I love it!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnd my personal favorite:\n\n[Keep the tone dark.] \n\nI would end with P. Kerman arriving at 42 Wallaby Way. This scene is longer. It is happy. He enters his home, moves from sunlit room to sunlit room, finds his wife standing next to a large piano, her back turned. He starts to apologize, to explain, and she hunches, hugs herself, still turned away.\n\n\u0022Please Meg, I promise. . .I need you.\u0022\n\nAnd she turns to him then, raises a pistol, points it at his head. Her face is the same hollow mask he had worn earlier. \n\n\u0022But we do not need you.\u0022 And she pulls the trigger.\n\nThe End\n\nThen you tack this onto the end of your music play list and start working on Part III.  \n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/nak4OVJlhAU?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nWow. ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif \u0022:0.0:\u0022)\n\nNice going, Meg."},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha 360","CreatedById":166007,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-12T06:16:13Z","Content":"WOW!

NO![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022). Remember, her ship is on a trajectory which will make the capsule hit Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere in twelve years, or is it several minutes..... I know you trick there. The lifesupport goes off just as she begins to enter the atmosphere. IVAN as a survival instinct(at least I think) and will keep the ship alive and therefore keep Val alive and while in reentry, something happens to let the air leak in so that she can breathe. Then IVAN will revive her. Then Jeb Jr. will find her in the capsule and then she will teach him how to combat the Kraken. Then the story continues./ \n\nAnyway.

Jeez man!\n\u003E \n\nAll right, now, in my defense. . .\n\n. . .the thing with Val losing her mind happened all the way back in chapter 28, when I had no idea what was coming or how long the story was going to be. That was me fishing around for a bittersweet ending similar to the one found in Shadows. \n\n. . .the bit with Dibella stems from the scene where Dibella\u0027s pod is crippled in orbit and the Kraken tempts Val with the power to save her friend. Val resists that temptation. . .but what if Dibella had then been made the same offer? That didn\u0027t end up working for a few reasons, but like I said. . .scattergun. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) \n\n. . .as for Meg, well, the reality of that scene is actually much worse than you\u0027re making it out to be. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) I had envisioned that ending starting with the Dibella scene, and then rapidly escalating through a series of increasing dark mini-scenes that set up the next part of the story. Meg\u0027s scene was meant as the capstone, a sudden shift in tone that starts out very light and joyous. . .the sliver of a happy ending. Perhaps Val didn\u0027t save the world, but at least she saved this one poor soul. . .\n\nAnd then we see very suddenly that, perhaps during an attempt to locate her wayward beau, Meg has herself been ensnared by the Kraken. Meg doesn\u0027t dispose of P. Kerman-- the Kraken uses her as a meat puppet to silence its former thrall. P. Kerman\u0027s freedom results in his death and the eternal enslavement of his loving wife. \n\nI am. . .not necessarily a fan of happy endings. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-13T00:26:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2017 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Ten Key**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-03T08:47:53Z","Content":"Well, here it is, as these things usually go, 1:30 in the morning and after an unexpected burst of inspiration the first chapter to *Revelations* is now complete.  ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)   I can hear [@Ten Key](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123319-ten-key/) groaning from here  \n\nWell, it\u0027s not really the *first* chapter, it goes somewhere in the middle. *I\u0027m* not even sure quite where, so it won\u0027t see the light of day for many and many-a\u0027.
