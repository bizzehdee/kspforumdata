This one makes use of some funky DirectX stuff that complicates things further. in the end, you\u0027ll just have to take a hard look at the parts in your \u0022mooooorr mods\u0022 and make some hard decisions. I\u0027ve had to cull my B9 parts down to the ones I use the most and remove the ones that aren\u0027t used by me or any downloaded craft files (at least, the ones I decided to keep). I also had to take another look at any stock textures (squad folder) that had not been resized yet and do some quality-reduction passes. You don\u0027t need a huge texture, no matter how detailed, for a part that, for the majority of the time, is packed away into a 3x3 pixel screen-space. Until we get a stable KSP experience with full use of the maximum ram available on the host system, we will have to continue making these decisions.
