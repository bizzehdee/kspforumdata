So, your base at 1 degree 27\u0027 N, you will need a minimum inclination of 1 degree 27 minutes (1.45 degrees) for the top / northerly pass of your orbit to touch the latitude of your base....and then you just need to wait for the planet to rotate the base underneath the trace to make your landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do a higher inclination, then you will end up with 2 chances for the base to pass under the ground trace.....one on the way up, and one on the way down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re on a tight orbit, and just want to change inclination and then land, you want to set your inclination change slightly more than 90 degrees from the base\u0027 longitude, so that the burn pushes the top of your orbit to the desired Lat just ahead of where the base is about to rotate under.

Just eyeball it until the path crosses over the destination, and fine tune as you get closer. As long as you are pretty close, course corrections of that nature require very little fuel usually (at least with no atmosphere to interfere). In order to minimize the angle at which you are coming in, you could take one of two approaches. A) come in from a polar orbit laid ahead of your destination such that it will be there when you get there, or \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E at 90 degrees phase (dawn or dusk), execute an inclination change whose degrees match the latitude of your destination, and ensure that your periapsis is over the target area, then burn for landing when the target site is at the noon position on the surface. Honestly, with either method your angle of attack due to descent will be greater than the angle of attack due to inclination difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, however, you want to know more about method B, the trick is to get equatorial and point at your normal/antinormal node depending on situation. The number of degrees that node traverses will be equal to your change in inclination. (of course this requires a navball that shows normal/antinormal) So in your case, you\u0027d burn normal or antinormal until the indicator moves about 1.5 degrees (which will be pretty difficult to nail unless using rcs.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for my 2 cents:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always go for insertion to polar orbit. You can land anywhere on the planet with minimal changes to your orbital inclination if you wait long enough. Also, if you do a mid-course correction, getting polar orbit is really cheap (anywhere between 5-40m/s depending on the situation). This, combined with not having to worry about post-arrival inclination changes and a variety of good alternate landing possibilities makes it an ideal situation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T02:46:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, it should be easy enough to combine the inclination burn with a deorbit burn ... a degree and a half isn\u0027t exactly much in any case, and it will be a lot easier to do an angled burn to get in the area then correct things on the way down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
