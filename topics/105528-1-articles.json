I have already pointed out there is a bias in human thinking against coincidences, we don\u0027t like them. Someone above already pointed out why that is. The hard part is not knowing there is a bias, it is having confidence that that is what is getting you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a computer person, I went to school for programming, and I am a system building hobbyist. It is hard to wreck a system in the way you described. You can\u0027t do it accidentally. Think of all the amateur programmers out there. NONE of them have every fried their BIOS. It just doesn\u0027t happen. It is something you have to do deliberately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if KSP did do it, it wasn\u0027t accidental because that would be hundreds of times harder to believe than the coincidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven deliberately is hard. Even if you are targeting just one kind of BIOS, say American Megatrends, that BIOS is still custom to the motherboard and manufacturer. They have protections on them. If I wanted to wreck a system, I would just write a bunch of 0\u0027s on the hard drive. Done, easy, simple, reliable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if it wasn\u0027t your BIOS, what if it was something else and you were just too specific in your first post? That is hard to believe as well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see malware is a business. Malware isn\u0027t out to annoy you. The best malware is malware that is silent. It doesn\u0027t slow your computer down more than it has to. It doesn\u0027t annoy you. It doesn\u0027t want you to take it to an IT to get rid of it. It wants to use your computer to send spam for profit, or some other method of making money. Now we all know malware fails in this, it does slow your system down for example. But it isn\u0027t out to wreck your stuff for no point. Frying your system would be just that. Pointless and unprofitable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets not forget you are the only victim. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summery, it is nigh on unthinkable that KSP caused your issue accidentally. It makes no sense that it was done on purpose. The possibility that it was a coincidence is just about 99.999999999999% of the total causality space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me finish with a parable. You might remember Star Force, it was a copy protection scheme that had some serious issues. Many people blamed it for wrecking their computer, or their disk drive. These accusations are false. It had real verifiable issues but hardware failure wasn\u0027t one of them. I once pointed out to someone that my drive failed within 1 week of getting Star Force installed. (It came with Silent Hunter III) They wondered how I could possibly rail against those that argue against Star Force when I myself had been a victim. I then revealed that my drive failed a week before I got the game and not after. Had it been the other way around, even knowing what I know about software, it would have been difficult even for me to dismiss the coincidence. Knowing the bias doesn\u0027t make it easy to ignore the bias, but it is still bias.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T08:40:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 08:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Leszek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:53:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://xkcd.com/552/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation.png\u0022 alt=\u0022correlation.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T09:30:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Leszek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Leszek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo it is not.
