I can\u0027t remember the name. I saw it once somewhere but for the life of me I can\u0027t remember where. It\u0027s a mod that tracks the orbits of planets and will let you let you know when it\u0027s alligned to travel to it. If anyone has any clue of what I am talking about or know where I can find this that would be a big help, thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T23:34:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may be thinking of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786-0-90-Kerbal-Alarm-Clock-v3-1-2-0-%28Jan-2%29?highlight=kerbal\u002Balarm\u002Bclock\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T00:09:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a launch window planner.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ignath","CreatedById":77210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T00:14:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re looking for the Protractor mod I believe.
