I\u0027m sure there are other programs I could be using, but it\u0027s free and fun. Aaanyway, after a fair amount of searching, I could not find any ragdolls or parts to use. I actually really expected to see them as a download for gmod, but no dice. I\u0027m no modelling expert, so I have no idea if rigging something like this so soon after .16 release is even possible, but I\u0027d love to know if there\u0027s anything available out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing for a long time, but I\u0027m new to the forums, so if this thread isn\u0027t on the right board or if it breaks some content distribution rule just let me know and the mods can have their way with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"6677","CreatedById":890,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-07T17:51:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts possible that someone could model them from scratch but it would be time consuming (don\u0027t look at me, I\u0027m an awful modeler).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if you would hit any intellectual property issues though, would be awesome to see though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zxcvb55","CreatedById":12874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-07T19:48:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I learned searching for this, the Kerbal EVA models are all in the game files already and come packed with the necessary VTFs and bones.
