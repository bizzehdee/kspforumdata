It is so thin it is actually easier to come in use the atmosphere to slow you down to Kerbin hypersonic speeds, mach 5\u002B and then use drag chutes to slow you down to near mach 1, then just switch to a VTOL mode and land as a VTOL. The amount of wing you would have to bring to Duna to land at a reasonable speed is HUGE! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna is by far one of the hardest places to land a SSTO space plane because of its thin atmosphere. It is just enough to fool you into thinking your plane will fly normally, but it isn\u0027t enough to actually keep a plane in the air at a reasonable speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BrotatoSalad","CreatedById":119211,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T23:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, Scott Manley did it with a crippled plane (wings at an offset angle from an Infernal Robotics glitch) in an Interstellar Quest episode, and he had FAR installed. I would advise getting close to the ground and using forward-pointing radial engines to slow down, and when you stall, do it a few meters above the ground to avoid damage. I agree entirely. Trying to land a plane on Duna is insanely difficult. However, taking off is easy in the low gravity if you have a decent TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T00:23:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELanding in unusual places is as much about post-touchdown behaviour as what happens before. Wide-set landing gear, tailstrike guards, and some Vernors or Sepratrons for retro-thrust braking. Find a good flat spot and you can safely touch down at 200m/s if you build for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou won\u0027t get a lot of effect from airbrakes on Duna; the air is too thin to give them much grip.
