It will still compress the textures, it just won\u0027t do anything else with them. If you have texture reduction packs for B9, Squad, or KW, you can remove them if you like and use the aggressive config, or change the scale parameter in the config to something higher. Typically, I see ~1GB reduction with just the stock aggressive config when running with B9 and KW stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow onto specific mod issues...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will probably be easiest to try this out myself, so the links to them might help. B9 and KW are good, as I tested those out myself and added the normal map config entries. The mods I\u0027m most worried about are Kethane, Interstellar, and LLL. So you could try commenting those three out of your config, one at a time, and see if the hang-up/CTD still occurs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod will function exactly like 1.1 did for all mods that are not in the folder list. It just adds additional functionality for the mods that are added to the list.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
