I was debating on whether or not to start a topic on this but figured that it would give me more motivation to actually finish the project if I started a thread. So here it is, a work in progress Bigtrak Jr. for Kerbal. I never had one of these as a kid but my cousain did and every time we would head over to his house we would always run the batterys down on it. My goal for this project is to have a connector on the top accessory port for attaching rockets/whatever, parachute mount points around the sides for air drops, and possibly a crate/bay that will allow it to hitch a ride on a rocket. Eventually this will be running on a modified version of the Cart Plugin\\\u0027s source code so you can actually go crater racing on the Mun. Its been a while since I\\\u0027ve made my last GTA mods so I\\\u0027m not sure on a release date as I\\\u0027m a bit rusty, and the only time I have to work on this will be the weekends. Heres some pics of what I got done in 2hrs last night, please ignore that I model in Zmodeler 1.07b \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E. I have Lightwave and Max but for some odd reason find this version of zmodeler easier to work in.

So far the some of the attachment nodes are on it, one on the hatch for .5m rockets and 2 on the bed one can fit a .5 with no clipping or a 1m with mesh clipping, and the farthest back can take whatever. You cant have two 1m\\\u0027s on the bed due to the space between them. Also the collision model is finally in, its a super fancy trapezoid of wonder, and its orientated the correct way for the cart plugin now.
