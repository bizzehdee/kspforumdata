Then I attached a Nova Punch 1.75 meter booster to either side. The booster works well for half the flight, then due to lost mass from fuel, it overpowers the shuttle engines, and spins out before I can perform SRB jet. I am not a computer programmer, but when I open up the parts with Console (Mac), I can see the values for dry weight and thrust. How would I go about either increasing the thrust of the Shuttle SSME\\\u0027s, or increase the dry weight of the SRB\\\u0027s or decrease SRB thrust? I just want to change a couple values, but with Console it\\\u0027s view only, as far as I can see.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BillWiskins","CreatedById":12285,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-19T00:57:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m not familiar with the peculiar, alien land of Mac - but in my home town of Windows, you can open a part\\\u0027s .cfg file and edit the values using a basic word processing program like Notepad.
