Click on it, then drag the contents of what is INSIDE the GameData to you KSP GameData. I can give you more specific details if you tell us if you are going via Steam or the website.

I have put the Remote Tech folder and all contents of the ZIP file in GameData. \n\nDo you know on which part of the mod I have referenced?
