I have the order of the stages / decouplers right according to my plans. In flight, I jettison the decouplers to remove the solid rocket boosters. Nothing happens. There is the noise of the decoupler detaching, but the boosters never fall away. Even the post flight analysis states that the boosters separated, when in reality they stick to the rocket and never fall away. Any ideas what\u0027s happening? I\u0027m positive that the stages are in the correct order (on the right of the screen in the assembly building).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T03:17:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre the SRBs clipping into other parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoArod","CreatedById":42574,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T03:32:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure that the SRB are actually attached to the decouplers, this has happened to be before, turns out the SRBs where actually on the rocket itself and not the decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"air805ronin","CreatedById":40948,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T04:13:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had this happen tonight to only half my SRBs, and it sent me into a nasty spin.
