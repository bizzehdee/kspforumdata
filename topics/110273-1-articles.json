He has this question about orbital mechanics.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E An untethered astronaut pushes off from the International Space Station.\n\u003E My understanding is that rather than just float away, he will go into a new orbit, and that orbit will intersect the orbit of the ISS on the other side of the Earth.\n\u003E \n\u003E The reference I read (and can\u0027t find again) said that this happens if the push off is to one side of the ISS and not toward or away from Earth. But I\u0027d guess that it would be the same for any direction. That is, push down toward Earth, and he/she would to into an elliptical orbit that would intersect the original orbit.\n\u003E \n\u003E Does that sound right?\n\nI don\u0027t think the astronaut would intersect but I\u0027m not sure."},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T20:44:53Z","Content":"Any orbit obtained in a single push will intersect the ISS\u0027s orbit, but the ISS might not be there when the astronaut hits the intersection. \n\nIf the push is normal or antinormal, then the astronaut will hit ISS in half an orbit.

It would be such a shame to see the station move away by a few feet further every pass until you run out of air. But what a spectacular view!"}]}
