I want to mess around with editing the stock textures but I have no idea where to find them or what programs to use in order to open them and then edit them. I can teach myself the rest through trial and error, I just need someone to tell me/point me at some videos or threads on how to at least get the textures ready to be edited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I\u0027ve been looking around here on the forums and i\u0027m seeing threads about .mbm\u0027s and Blender. I\u0027m assuming I found the answer I am seeking all on my own but any feedback would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: Discovered a .mbm to .png converter so my only question now is can I simply edit the .pngs and drop them into \u0022Texture Replacer\u0022 mod\u0027s folder?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 3: I did some digging around here on the forums and google and I found out how to do what I want to do so I answered my own questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-12T13:13:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2014 01:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dr. Kriger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
