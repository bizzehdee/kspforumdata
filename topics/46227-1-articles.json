I fully admit I haven\u0027t tried out the calculations myself, but I expect they\u0027d be close. You\u0027d have to be sure to try it on a single stage rocket (staging gets a little more complicated, but doable with the same equation) in a vacuum or in a situation where gravity effects aren\u0027t messing with the actual change in velocity measured to keep it simple. I bet launching vertically from Gilly or Minmus would be a perfect test bed as you have no atmospheric drag, gravity is minimal, and a vertical launch would put all the velocity in one direction for the experiment, reducing the amount she would lose to circularizing and pilot inputs.
