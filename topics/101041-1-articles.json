I can still grab or leave a ladder, jump or activate the pack but that\u0027s all. The Kerbal is not in ragdoll, so it\u0027s not the stuck in ragdoll problem (if he gets in ragdoll, in can\u0027t go back on his feets).\n\nHere is the list of the folders I have in my GameData (I can find the mods name but it would take time that I don\u0027t have for now) :\n\n000\\_Toolbar\n\n000\\_USITools\n\nAchievements\n\nActiveTextureManagement\n\nADIOS\n\nART\n\nAutoAsparagus\n\nB9\\_Aerospace\n\nBoulderCo\n\nChatterer\n\nCommunityResourcePack\n\nConnectedLivingSpace\n\nContractConfigurator\n\nContractPacks\n\nCrossFeedEnabler\n\nDavonSupplyMod\n\nDeadlyReentry\n\nDistantObject\n\nDMagic Orbital Science\n\nEditorExtensions\n\nEnhancedNavBall\n\nExtraplanetaryLaunchpads\n\nFerramAerospaceResearch\n\nFirespitter (comes with B9 I think, I didn\u0027t install the Firespitter mod)\n\nFusebox\n\nJSI\n\nKAS\n\nKAX\n\nKerbalJointReinforcement\n\nKineTechAnimation\n\nKlockheed\\_Martin\\_Gimbal\n\nkOS\n\nksp-advanced-flybywire (I\u0027ll test without this one because it touch to the controls)\n\nKSPScienceLibrary\n\nKWRocketry\n\nMagicSmokeIndustries\n\nMechjeb2\n\nModuleRCSFX\n\nMP\\_Nazari\n\nNASAmission\n\nNavyFish\n\nNearFutureConstruction\n\nNearFutureProps\n\nNearFuturePropulsion\n\nNearFutureSolar\n\nNearFutureSpacecraft\n\nNereid\n\nNovaPunch2\n\nOpenResourceSystem\n\nORSResourcePack\n\nProceduralFairings\n\nRCSBuildAid\n\nRegolith\n\nRemoteTech\n\nResGen\n\nRomfarer\n\nRSSTextures\n\nSCANsat\n\nScienceAlert\n\nSmokeScreen\n\nSquad\n\nStageRecovery\n\nStationScience\n\nTacAtomicClock\n\nTacFuelBalancer\n\nTacPartLister\n\nTechManager\n\nThunderAerospace\n\nTriggerTech\n\nTweakScale\n\nUbioWeldingLtd\n\nUmbraSpaceIndustries\n\nUniversalStorage\n\nVirgin Kalactic\n\nWarpPlugin\n\nWombatConversions\n\nNote : Even with this epic number of mods (2.3GB GameData) the games runs fine (crashing maybe every 5 hours, more than enough for me)\n\n(Please forgive me if there are mistakes in my english, I\u0027m french)"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T20:41:32Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had that a few times, going to spacecenter and back should reset them."},{"CreatedByName":"TheYumasi","CreatedById":138873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T22:17:59Z","Content":"Solved it !

You can also reset them by getting them into a capsule (or anything with crew capacity really), but if they\u0027re stuck in ragdoll pose, that can be difficult."},{"CreatedByName":"TheYumasi","CreatedById":138873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T19:14:34Z","Content":"Well I removed the mod I mentioned above and the problem just disappeared. None of your reset methods worked for my problem. Why I\u0027m sure this is that mod ? Because even with no controls defined in the option menu, I was still able to jump (buggy jump).\n\nAlso, I\u0027m not stuck in ragdoll anymore since I retrieved full control over Jebediah."},{"CreatedByName":"Cirrus","CreatedById":145623,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T18:34:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve had that a few times, going to spacecenter and back should reset them.\n\nThank you **smjjames**!\n\nYou saved a frozen Kerbal drifting in to the void.
