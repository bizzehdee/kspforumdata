If you go into map view and rotate it around until the Mun is half way between the 12 o\u0026#39;clock and 3 o\u0026#39;clock position, place the manoeuvre node at the 6 o\u0026#39;clock position of your orbit. Also remember to select the Mun as your target to get the encounter markers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother rough and ready method is to be in flight view and wait until the Mun comes up above the horizon and then start to burn.

Also note that it is possible to drag the manouvre node around the orbit (essentiall changin the time of the burn without changing the pro-/retrograde radial or normal components of your node). That way you can just add a manouvre anywhere and drag the prograde marker until your predicted orbit crosses (or gets very close to) the orbit of the mun. Set the mun as your target and then just drag the node around you orbit until you get an encountre. Of course this is assuming you actually have a relatively circular orbit to begin with.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am currently not on my main PC so I can\u0026#39;t test this craft in 1.0.5 since I built it quite some time ago.

You\u0026#39;re overshooting. That makes it very hard to get an intercept. Reduce the apoapsis so that the top of your orbit coincides with the mun\u0026#39;s orbit. Then drag your maneuver node slowly back and forth until you have an intercept. At that point you can fine tune both the maneuver node\u0026#39;s position as well as the velocity change, to get a better intercept.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nGood luck!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T17:17:05Z","Content":"\nYou need to aim ahead in the Mun\u0026#39;s orbit by about one quarter of an orbit (90 degrees).

That will give you some new indicators to help you getting the burn right. You\u0026#39;ll get inclination indicators as well as closest approach markers. You want the inclination to be, ideally, zero but a few tens of degrees off are fine if you don\u0026#39;t go for precision.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI assume your apoapsis is at a much greater altitude than your periapsis, or that your orbit is heavily off inclination-wise. Your orbit around Kerbit appears to cross Mun\u0026#39;s orbit but that could be just the angle of view, and the dv requirements shown are much less than one would see off a circular, low altitude orbit around Kerbin (from a circular 71km orbit expect around 850 dv \u002B/- a few required).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLast. It seems that your leading angle is less than 45* ahead of Mun. With an inclination close to zero, raise the maneuver node apoapsis until it just touches Mun\u0026#39;s orbit. Move the maneuver node around 90* leading to 45* leading. You should see Mun interfering with your Kerbin orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOops, someone got there before me.

This is not so. The orbit that the mun is on is just an indicator of the path the mun takes. You need to meet the mun right on the line, so that your craft and the mun are almost in the same place at the same time. This will create the encounter. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is because the mun has [relatively] small gravity.
