Nuclear does not automaticaly =bad. Not everything is a Hiroshima or chenobyl waiting to happen. A unrefined Orion was caluculated to AT WORST kill 12 people WORLD WIDE so thats 12 in 7 billion! You goverment likley makes more cold hearted descions that kill more for less benifit. Later on a recalculation useing some safety tecniques and more refined bombs was estmated to be \u0026lt;1 worldwide.
