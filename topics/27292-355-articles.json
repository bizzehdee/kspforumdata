Each stage has a 5-engine cluster: at the bottom is a KR-2L and two KR-1x2 LFBs clipped in through editor shenanigans (no debug menu, just some fiddling about in the editor). The other stage has four aerospikes and a Poodle, again using clipped tanks. Getting all the fuel lines in and running properly was a pain, and the LFBs had to have struts there too. The FL-T100 are placed to make the fuel-line placement work. Because of this, all engines in each cluster flame out at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/Mt9rF4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Mt9rF4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch profile is not entirely simple. The closeness of the engines mean that some care must be taken to avoid overheating. First, full throttle at launch until 150m/s. The KR-2L may look like it\u0027s about to overheat, but it\u0027ll be fine. Decrease throttle to keep TWR at ~1 until 2/3 throttle. This is almost at 10km, where a gentle gravity turn begins. Once pointing at 45\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E up, stay pointing that way. At 35km, throttle up to full. Very soon, it\u0027ll be time to stage, do so as soon as the engines flame out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/y9jOaV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022y9jOaV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an explosive staging as the stack separator is pushed back by the engine exhaust into the tank.

Perhaps if the orbit was a little lower, there\u0027d be more fuel left, but this is how it turned out. I transferred fuel from the test payload and deorbited fast. Attempted to land it, but with no landing gear and only two parachutes (only on the payload to make the mass right), the 5m/s touch down lead to it falling over and exploding instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/ED62uK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ED62uK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Apollo-like mission set up for a picture, then recovered to be launched a different day.

As the name suggests, as a part of my budget-slashing for simple Mun missions, this costs only 7472 funds. Compared to the 9222, the number of struts has been halved (the two at the bottom of the boosters have been removed), as has the number of reaction wheels. Also, the LV-909 and small decoupler have been switched for the 48-7S and tiny decoupler.

I\u0027ve also successfully complete a pair each of orbit-and-return gravity probe missions to Kerbin\u0027s satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the last week, I\u0027ve done lots of testing trying to land my Mun Lab with a rover. I have proven successful in adapting a 55 ton LKO lifter (based on screen shots of the LT branch of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63050\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMunshine V\u003C/a\u003E), landing on the Mun and even demonstrated that return to Kerbin is completely possible with my return vessel. If only the Mun hadn\u0027t gotten in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only trouble with my successful landing was that the legs on Mun Lab 01 compressed too much to provide enough clearance to drive (or push) the rover out from underneath. Since then, I\u0027ve redesigned the lab with greater clearance and also more thrust. This morning I got Mun Lab 02 into Munar orbit and tried twice to land it, only to be thwarted by a combination of uneven terrain, achingly slow craft rotation and the resulting panic. If another redesign is needed, I will add some RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, with a little more practice, I am certain to land this beast, give the near successes I\u0027ve already achieved. Everything I\u0027ve read about Munar landings is true: try your hand on Minmus first. It\u0027s harder to get there - due to distance and orbital inclination - but it\u0027s far easier to land. I made two landings on Minmus before trying my first Munar landing. I suppose I may have to take a Mun Lab to Minmus as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve actually landed twice on each satellite, and the second Munar landing had a toy rover. This success is what lead me to want a larger, more robust lander with science instruments and a local lab for delivery. The plan is to ferry seismic and gravity data from multiple Munar biomes, transfer as much of it onto the return vessel as I can, and return for massive science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T15:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PixelClef\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PixelClef\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe only trouble with my successful landing was that the legs on Mun Lab 01 compressed too much to provide enough clearance to drive (or push) the rover out from underneath.
