But I was disappointed (but not too surprised) that MechJeb for 0.90 didn\u0027t work in 1.0.\n\nThen, I saw that MechJeb got an update- YAY!- so I quickly removed my MechJeb folder from Gamedata and downloaded the new MechJeb (MJ) and installed it. \n\nFrom the start, everything looked like it was back up to snuff... except for some oddness during MJ- controlled ascent (one of my most trustworthy spacecraft that launched flawlessly under 0.90 did some somersaults before correcting itself about midway to orbit), everything else seemed to work fine... Rendezvous Autopilot, Docking Autopilot, etc... all fine.\n\nBut the Landing Autopilot failed miserably on three tries... note, this was before entering atmosphere... so it\u0027s not because of the increased realism in re-entry. I\u0027m saying, if you tell the Landing Autopilot to land at the Space Center, it draws an icon there on the planet, then the autopilot does the typical landing prediction blue icon and sweeps it to the Space Center... then over shoots it. This never happened in the previous MJ version. In fact, most times, the MJ- controlled Landing was so perfect that I was returned dead center to the launch pad! The other thing that doesn\u0027t seem to work is that the landing rockets don\u0027t fire early enough to slow the craft down. Again, this was all so flawless in MJ for 0.90.\n\nAnyone else seeing this?\n\nBtw- spotlights (at least the ones I was using in 0.90 without problems) explode violently on re-entry in 1.0. Bummer. I love a lit up ship! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\nPaul"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:35:27Z","Content":"Well, only speculation here, but based on all the posts I\u0027m seeing talking about the weirdness of the new aero model, and how engines are supposedly overpowered, I would guess this is having a huge affect on MJ, even though it may have been updated to meet any new API changes in 1.0... (Basically, weirdness may be on Squad\u0027s end than anything to do with MJ...)\n\nAgain, just speculation on my part...\n\nMJ is by far a hugely popular mod with the community so hopefully it will get worked out soon..."},{"CreatedByName":"ZAJC3W","CreatedById":38402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T17:20:35Z","Content":"ascent autopilot - set limit angle of attack to 5-10 degrees until you reach 20-25km.

A good player might be able to keep a craft with marginally insufficient control authority going where MJ might not be able to, but with seriously insufficient control authority, nobody\u0027s getting that sucker to space.\n\nIf you have sufficient authority, however, MJ remains on-the-dot.

A always limited the angle of attack on ascents anyway.\n\nLanding on Kerbin is pretty boinkers yet useful. The \u0022show landing predictions\u0022 on shows the expected point right under me or 1/4 the planet away on some approaches. You can use the landing system with the predictions on to manually adjust your node to \u0022get close\u0022 to the space center. Auto piloting landing is not working for Kerbin as of my last attempt. I could certainly get close with the help of Mech Jeb though.\n\nFunctions that do seem to work include manuever planner, hohmann transfer, rendeviouz autopilot etc.\n\nI havent successfully seen a \u0022porkchop\u0022 pattern developed for planetary transfer but I dont really use that nor know what the Kerbol Im looking at"},{"CreatedByName":"digitalsingularity","CreatedById":79683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T22:56:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Still does not work pretty much tried everything.
