But I was disappointed (but not too surprised) that MechJeb for 0.90 didn\u0027t work in 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, I saw that MechJeb got an update- YAY!- so I quickly removed my MechJeb folder from Gamedata and downloaded the new MechJeb (MJ) and installed it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the start, everything looked like it was back up to snuff... except for some oddness during MJ- controlled ascent (one of my most trustworthy spacecraft that launched flawlessly under 0.90 did some somersaults before correcting itself about midway to orbit), everything else seemed to work fine... Rendezvous Autopilot, Docking Autopilot, etc... all fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the Landing Autopilot failed miserably on three tries... note, this was before entering atmosphere... so it\u0027s not because of the increased realism in re-entry. I\u0027m saying, if you tell the Landing Autopilot to land at the Space Center, it draws an icon there on the planet, then the autopilot does the typical landing prediction blue icon and sweeps it to the Space Center... then over shoots it. This never happened in the previous MJ version. In fact, most times, the MJ- controlled Landing was so perfect that I was returned dead center to the launch pad! The other thing that doesn\u0027t seem to work is that the landing rockets don\u0027t fire early enough to slow the craft down. Again, this was all so flawless in MJ for 0.90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else seeing this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw- spotlights (at least the ones I was using in 0.90 without problems) explode violently on re-entry in 1.0. Bummer.
