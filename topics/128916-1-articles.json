I haven\u0027t tried since ISRU became a thing and I think that will go a long way toward making motherships viable. It helps to define what a mother ship is as well. Based on your description of multiple uses and different cargoes I think of interplanetary nuclear tugs instead of motherships.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me tugs are low part count high efficiency nuclear designs. Typically large or medium docking port, probe core, generous RCS supply for docking, powerful reaction wheel for directional control, a few solar panels (or 1-2 RTGs), and then as much liquid fuel as I can squeeze into the design all routed to 1, 2, or 4 nuclear engines depending on the weight rating of the tug.

The \u0022rover\u0022 weighs 44 tons on Kerbin, in comparison to the massive base. I relied on an incredible asparagus staging configuration that spanned the width of the VAB, and exceeded the fuel line length limit. It used triple height stacks of the large LARGE tanks, with mammoths at the bottom of every stack. I forget the cost, but it\u0027s the only thing that ever brought my budget back into 6 digits after unlocking the full tech tree (yes, this was a career save).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022781B1574586C43EB852CF8B3C94E096C6B345E26\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/714162859998331961/781B1574586C43EB852CF8B3C94E096C6B345E26/\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can see the means of landing here. 4 mammoth engines, with empty\u00A0Kethane tanks (I\u0027ve since quit using Kethane) ringed by landing legs. There are 8 of those landing leg stacks. there should be another one just off image to the right of the mammoth tanks. That\u0027s one \u0022spoke\u0022 of the torus. There are four spokes, with 4 mammoth engine clusters total, one per spoke. There was a Kethane drilling rig at the center. The rings that the mammoths, the kethane storage tanks, and the extra SAS wheels attach to are the radial attachment point. I did use tweak scale to make those WAY bigger. Couplers would have been attached to the bottom of the two kethane ISRU tanks and the SAS wheels on each spoke, plus there was a central stack attached to the drilling rig. This made 13 stacks of the large\u00A0Kerbodyne S3-14400 tanks, stacked 3 tall, with 12 mammoths at the bottom of those, and 4 on the vessel structure itself. the central tank was stacked one tank taller, and had decouplers all along, staged very late. This tank stack is important for landing. The outer most tanks had girders hanging between the tanks, reaching out for one another, with Oscar-B mini tanks at the end. This let me string 3 fuel lines (first stage to drop across a girder to an Oscar-B, the Oscar-B to another Oscar-B, and finally, the second Oscar-B to the next tank to be staged... The stacks really were that far apart on the stack! the next inner stacks only needed one girder with an Oscar-B to accommodate the distance. The inner ring of stacks could have fuel lines run normally. They all fed to the central tank, and from there, they in turn also feed to the landing motors.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had my control from here screwed up, and had to fly the pancake by adjusting engine throttle, as cantab mentioned. Until i reached orbit, that was my sole control. didn\u0027t even bother with RCS or SAS. on a vessel that massive, it\u0027s slow anyway. Once in orbit, I found the RIGHT probe core to control from, and flew it to minmus. On the top side, by the biodomes, are a number of LF\u002BO and mono tanks, for resource collection. The general idea was that I lower the entire vessel to the planet on the fuel from the large central stack, and when each tank segment depletes, I drop it, and pray that it blows up and leaves my landing site clear of debris. Once the last stage is depleted, I drop it to be destroyed on impact, and burn the fuel stored in the ISRU LF\u002BO tanks. There was just enough fuel for a safe landing on the numerous landing legs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPart of me wants to recreate this base, or one much like it in my current career. I know what mistakes I made last time, and what to do differently, but i also have no idea if the aerodynamics would ever let me launch this thing again. It IS mostly open space... Four spokes and a ring, but it\u0027s still massive. I really need a bigger VAB, as this was at the extreme limits of what I could do in the VAB already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif using tweak scale, I find that the double, triple and quad stack adapter are nice for splitting stacks into multiple columns. It does take some struts, cause of the limits in how KSP likes (or rather doesn\u0027t like) cyclical stack connection paths. One joint invariably REFUSES to snap and bond. Struts are your friend. symmetrically applied radial attachment points are really wonderful for creating good patterns of symmetry if you want multiple stacks coming off a central one.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMuch of the same can apply to mother ships. I have found that the Docking Port Sr is your friend in station/mothership design. Save the regular size and Jr. for probes, landers, and ferries. For any bulk transit, you need the structural strength of the large docking port.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother tip for large vessels, particularly long ones with many assembled segments, is to use a puller engine configuration. You go from wet spaghetti to a space train. Bonus points if you make it actually look like a train! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u00A0It makes a WORLD of difference... as long as you put your engines far enough out at the ends of girders or radially mounted tanks to CLEAR the trailing ship. KSP will calculate the losses of occluded thrust, not to mention possibly overheat whatever you\u0027re burning against, so take diameter into consideration. If you use a design like that though, then you can have a singular rigid engine/control/SAS/RCS unit, and it will always orient correctly for a burn. even if the tail end is kinda floppy, it\u0027ll pull it into a straight line by virtue of everything being pulled by a centered force. A pusher configuration works very well in a grid body, but the disadvantages of pullers can overcome the impossibility of pushing a non rigid body. In theory, you could have a literal train \u00A0made of segments joined by unlocked, pivoting claws, and it\u0027d still ultimately pull in the right direction.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n**EDIT**\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd as a number of people have mentioned... GET KJR. Kerbal Joint Reinforcment is your friend. They use it, I use it. My understanding is that the way it works is it \u0022eases\u0022 the physics on by ramping from no physics to full physics effects gradually, over the course of a second or two. it also tweaks the joint rigidity and strength to try to balance it out. Something like that. Fewer randomly rapidly disassembling vessels when you come out of warp or load them, and far less wobble when being and orienting vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-10T01:50:27Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2016 01:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T14:28:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play a stock game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I do with oddly shaped payloads (i.e. carrying spaceplanes or boats to Laythe or Eve):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJUST CARRY TWO OF THEM!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthen you can mount them on the sides and you CoM is stable. \u00A0(no center payload bay required)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhth\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT also works on rockets hauling the stuff to orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-09T14:32:33Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2016 02:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Brainlord Mesomorph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"elpollodiablo","CreatedById":128492,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T15:43:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222342317\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128916\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451504588\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002275413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022glen.mack\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 30.12.2015 at 8:43 PM, glen.mack said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to maintain perfect center line to prevent wobble/thrust not being aligned with COM?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would you balance the number/size of radial structures with actually maneuvering things into the cargo space?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you are using InfernalRobotics, i\u0027d highly recommend Quantum Struts (or KAS if you\u0027re not as lazy as i am) and the Welding Mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelding helps tremendously with the stability of the Cargo Bay, and the cool thing is if you consider this cheating, you can actually build something that would be that sturdy without getting into trouble with part counts.

I do use Tweakscale in these launchers to produce the nifty little science payload stacks. Rather than try to fit these inline, with the ISRU scanners in place, I decided to mount them side by side. Note the use of the 2-1 stack adapters and the center fuel tank adapter. I forget the actual part names. It gave me an efficiently compact 2 engine rocket for doing my orbital capture burn. Once I have that, I can decouple each of the two payloads, extend the additional solar panels, and use the ion engines to direct them to their final destinations.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A4AB1F5981D4A4B9CE17FF7D2966BE571AC73C80\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/443952327064768474/A4AB1F5981D4A4B9CE17FF7D2966BE571AC73C80/\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese payloads feature a combination of reusable science modules, and a redundant supply of reusable modules. Struts are your friend. KSP does NOT like to have loops in it\u0027s stack, but you can strut things. Interestingly, you can create parallel\u00A0stacks with docking ports, but it can be tricky, as the alignment has to be perfect if you want all the docking ports to actually connect. Struts will keep things rigid, even when there is no connection in a stack. These probes are designed to spam science at their destination. each probe can perform 9 Mystery Goo and 9 Science Jr experiments. The reusable experiments are all included. My goal is to get these into a polar orbit, so I can cover as much of the planet\u0027s/moon\u0027s biomes as possible. If I have any modules leftover, I may try to get some atmospheric science in, hopefully before they reach the ground. The gilly probe actually has legs added... The Ion engines should be enough to biome hop on Gilly\u0027s low gravity. This pic would be of the \u0022Ike\u0027n\u0027Duna\u0022 probe.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRegarding playing a stock game, I can certainly get that some people prefer stock play. If you ever consider moving beyond stock play, KSP is really a game that can be \u003Cem\u003Eheavily\u003C/em\u003E improved upon with mods, and not every mod will bring your computer to a grinding halt.\u00A0I would make just a few honorable mentions... Tweakscale, GPOSpeedPump, Kerbal Alarm Clock, and KER/MechJeb.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTweakscale REALLY is a beautiful mod. It really fills in the missing parts that the game doesn\u0027t really provide. Masses, volumes,\u00A0and values scale accordingly. Another great mod that really compliments an OTHERWISE near stock game is GPOSpeedFuelPump (formerly\u00A0Goodspeed Fuel Pump). It just adds some very nice integral fuel pumping and balancing options to the game. I can design a station, lander and refueling tankers that automatically pump fuel in the right direction, without ever having to right click a single tank. Really great for complex little landers that use a dozen tiny tanks situated around the vessel to keep the CoG low. Traditionally, you\u0027d have to right click every one of those to refill. Not with this mod though. Kerbal Alarm Clock is a wonderful, simple tool to keep track of multiple simultaneous missions. It\u0027s exactly what it says... a fancy alarm clock, and well worth it. I have two Eve/Gilly and two Duna/Ike missions, along with\u00A0a lively amount of activity around\u00A0Kerbin. KAC lets you easily focus on what you want to do int he here and now, and not have to worry about being distracted and forgetting to do a capture burn 76 days from now.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe last two, Kerbal Engineer Redux (KER)\u00A0and MechJeb, are very powerful tools in KSP. It IS true that MechJeb features powerful autopilot functionality, but I understand that can actually be disabled, if you prefer. What\u0027s important, are all the fancy spacey numbers that both mods give you. I can tell you this... for a while, i used to have MechJeb launch my ships, and dock them, and rendezvous... truth is, I just don\u0027t bother with the auto pilots anymore. the only \u0022auto\u0022 tools I use these days are the maneuver planner, the execute maneuver node button, and Smart A.S.S. (a better version of the SAS buttons to the left of the navball). I know how to do all the things. I just let MechJeb point the ship and stop the engines. I get a nice landing projection when i land (which I also still do manually). The thing i don\u0027t think I could live without though, are the stat windows. Vessel stats, Orbital stats, Surface stats... I feel the game is not complete without giving me the option to see those \u0022rocket sciency\u0022 numbers. If you have that much of an aversion to the temptation of auto piloting, stick with KER. It\u0027s just the stat windows. I just happen to see no reason to install both, as I\u0027m already accustomed to the MechJeb interface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-10T01:52:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2016 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoctorDavinci","CreatedById":150019,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T20:28:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222342989\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128916\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451536076\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298138\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Francois424\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2015-12-31 at 11:27 PM, Francois424 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn stock KSP large\u00A0motherships aren\u0027t very useful except for looks and kicks (Better send 10x small crafts rather than a 700\u002B parts big one).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI disagree with this statement ...
