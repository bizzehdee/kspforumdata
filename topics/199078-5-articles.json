There are optimizations that KSP didn\u0027t take, and we know that Intercept at least considered some of these at some points. So the expectation is that things will be better. There are additional optimizations that can be taken by switching from PhysX to Havok physics in Unity, but I\u0027ve heard no indication that this has been done. There are good reasons to believe the game started out oh PhysX, and it would be a significant undertaking to convert the components to work with Havok instead, but it could have happened I suppose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gsantos9489","CreatedById":176233,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-07T13:45:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224205727\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221670185918\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022184845\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MechBFP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/4/2022 at 5:31 PM, MechBFP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup.

Mid-tier would be your X060s for Nvidia/X600s for AMD. As for CPUs, I doubt KSP 2 wouldn\u0027t do well on say a 6000 series I5s from Intel and a 1st Gen Ryzen R5s from AMD. PS5 and XBSX might have powerful graphics, but there\u0027s a downside, they\u0027re APUs instead of dedicated graphics. The chip may have the performance of a 2070, but it\u0027s not going to hit that performance all the time, if not most of the time due to thermal throttling. Though, with that being said... KSP 2 isn\u0027t graphically intense, it\u0027s more CPU intense, so 1080P 60/4K 30 wouldn\u0027t be that hard to reach or even beat as the target.

I would not benchmark it based on \u0022games rarely max out the CPU\u0022. Most games don\u0027t have a lot for the CPU to do, comparatively speaking. You run the enemy AI (which is barebones in almost every game), animation and LoD/occlusion checks, and maybe a bit of physics. Everything else is the same gameplay code that ran on an 8 bit era consoles, so yeah, CPU doesn\u0027t have a lot to do, unless there\u0027s an optimization problem with one of the previous major categories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 has to deal with ship trajectories, part collisions and stress, aerodynamics, thermals, resource usage by ships and colonies, LoD tiles across multiple planets, and all of that has to work under warp and potentially in multiplayer. That\u0027s kind of a lot, and we don\u0027t know at this point how well the game will run across the hardware requirements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing we know for sure is that KSP2 has to run well on PS5 at an absolute minimum, but that has quite a bit more juice than any i3. Even with a i3 12300, I am far from confident that KSP2 will run well. We don\u0027t have enough info to say for sure that it will struggle, but also no concrete confirmation that it will be adequate. With older i3 CPUs, my uncertainty starts turning more into a skepticism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor reference, The PS5 CPU is most comparable to Ryzen 7 3700X. It has comparable multithreaded performance to Ryzen 5 5600X, Core i7 11700K, or Core i5 12600 to give you some spread. This is a lineup where I would say the confidence is high for good, stable performance across a variety of ships and situations, because if it\u0027s not, PS5 is in trouble.
