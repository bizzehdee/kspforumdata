This is not how quanta work in QM. The quantum of something is the smallest amount of change, and the quantum of electromagnetic charge is 1e. No interaction can change charge by less than 1e. A good example is a weak interaction between electron and an up quark, which can produce an electron neutrino and a down quark. The lepton\u0027s charge went up by 1e, and quark\u0027s dropped by 1e, despite the fact that quark\u0027s charge is fractional. There is still no interaction that will change a charge of something by 1/3 e.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with electrical charge is that we observe it as a single quantity, but it\u0027s really a composite. It goes back to the whole mixing of U(1) and SU(2) symmetries that Higgs Boson is involved in. The quantity corresponding to the U(1) is the weak hypercharge, Y\u003Csub\u003EW\u003C/sub\u003E, which works the way you\u0027d expect charges to work. The other quantity, corresponding to SU(2), is the weak isospin, T. And like any isospin, it has three components, giving us, finally, the formula for total electric charge, Q = T\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E \u002B Y\u003Csub\u003EW\u003C/sub\u003E / 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is where things get really interesting. I\u0027m not really aware of any constraints on Y\u003Csub\u003EW\u003C/sub\u003E. I have no idea why it\u0027s \u002B1/3 e for all quarks, and \u002B1 e for all leptons. But the actual unit of charge at 1e comes from the weak isospin part. The weak interaction flips it between \u002B1/2 e and -1/2 e, exactly like the electron\u0027s spin. Which means that the total change of charge is always 1e.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Yeah, looking a bit more into literature, there is no reason in Standard Model for weak hypercharge to be quantized, since U(1) has a trivial generator. Still if values for leptons and quarks were anything else, we simply wouldn\u0027t have chemistry, and that\u0027d be kind of bad.

Which you can picture as EM vacuum going from 0\u045B to \u002B1\u045B as that photon is created. You should note similarities with the process I described for a weak interaction in my previous post. The only weird thing about quarks is an offset of \u002B1/6 e, due to the weak hypercharge of \u002B1/3. So instead of -1/2 e and \u002B1/2 e, you end up with -1/3 e and \u002B2/3 e.

You might think you know some aspects of quantum physics, but, as \u003Cstrong\u003EK^2\u003C/strong\u003E said, you aren\u0027t trained in it and only know a rough, simplified explanation. In third grade I was taught that there were no numbers lower than zero (I called BS on this, but my teacher was insistent), and in 8th I was told it was impossible and pointless to square root a negative number. For what I needed to know these explanations were enough, but they weren\u0027t *right*. \u003Cstrong\u003EK^2\u003C/strong\u003E or another particle physicist could try to dumb-down their field enough for you or another layman to think they understand, but at the end of the day they\u0027d likely have to make too many sacrifices for the explanation to be accurate or really anything but unnecessary false knowledge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*DISCLAIMER: I am not a physicist, and any statement I make is made out of ignorance and the illusion of knowledge I will be elucidating later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-30T20:27:14Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2016 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by NFUN\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
