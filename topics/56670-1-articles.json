The only way I could get linear to work was to select any other flying object and then use the H and N keys for linear. So it seams that HJKLNI only works if you have a target. The rest of the time those buttons do nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWouldnt\u0027 it be easier if you can just press a button to switch between linear and rotational?
