This will be fixed.  \n\n-Sunflares still render underwater, this will be fixed.  \n\n-From orbits around 70-160km, when you have refractions on, you might see outlines around the shore, this will be fixed.  \n\n-I haven\u0027t made configs for laythe or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E oceans so they\u0027ll get the default values.  \n\n-The setting for alternate SQRT is removed, it should not be needed anymore, please report if you still get issues with the \u0022leaking halo\u0022 around planets.  \n\n-There used to be a very obvious line around 300m in front of the camera where the postprocessing effect starts, this is fixed.  \n\n-I haven\u0027t tested with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E or any other mods, I expect the clouds might be visible through the underwater surface, please tell me if this is the case.  \n\n-NearClipPlane parameter is back in the config file, I don\u0027t recommend messing with it.  \n\n-When the camera is just at the water surface level there may be some artifacting, a bit lower or higher everything should work well.\n\nReport any new issues and let me know what you think of the new features.\n\nHave fun\n\n[https://mega.nz/#!KBgjhQgY!A3ccBD_YyURyanNrmu9i2DTNXuM3-KKQ8-Wu11Z7PwM](https://mega.nz/#!KBgjhQgY!A3ccBD_YyURyanNrmu9i2DTNXuM3-KKQ8-Wu11Z7PwM)"}]}
