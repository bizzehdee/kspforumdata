I do that with the Xfer buttons already, so just need to add the test to the ability to close the windows. the Move and Xfers for that matter are essentially instantaneous, so I\u0027m glad to see your Kerbals were safe.

In my testing I found that Kerbal professions reset when the \u0022onGameStateLoad\u0022 event was triggered. So I tried setting the profession at that point and it seemed to persist across scene changes. Perhaps something similar would work for ShipManifest.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting. Let me take a look at that. My major concern relates to the fact that there seems to be no coupling between the Profession in the Game save... If names and Professions were decoupled, you would think that the Game save would have to contain some reference to it to actually persist it... Also, take a look at my code for the roster window and KerbalModel. There may be some nuggets in there, and the license certainly allows for you to play with that code \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022d4rksh4de\u0022 data-cite=\u0022d4rksh4de\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI figured out what breaks my highlighting.

Not sure what real fuels or other resource mods provide as fields for the part but the amount is always in \u0022units\u0022. If I provide the adjustment as units/sec (which it currently is) then you know what you are moving. I could also make it a time based factor where the slider denotes the time is seconds that the transfer runs to move full volume...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-12T01:04:02Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2015 01:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa_Joe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T20:50:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMmm, I was hoping that KSP API provided some sort of \u0022here\u0027s a resource, here\u0027s how much mass it has per unit and how much volume it takes\u0022 information. If not, then the solutions are messier. It may end up being that you have to keep a list of the popular resources, or at least the exceptions which require special handling, like TAC/LS Oxygen which comes in huge quantities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you know the mass per unit via the KSP API, then maybe the pumps are simply rated to move 1000 kg of stuff per second. Which might be a reasonable least-cost solution that is semi-realistic and mostly self-balancing. Moving 100t of fuel around is still going to take a long time, but moving 1t of Oxygen would be very quick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option would be to cap the transfer time at some upper limit. Calculate the sum of the source tank size \u002B target tank size in units, divide by 180 seconds. Your transfer rate is the maximum of either that value or 100 units/sec.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a little mono-prop tank that holds 750 that is pushing to another 750 unit tank, that is (1500 / 180s) or 8.33 units/sec. In which case you would use the 100 units/sec transfer rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of moving Oxygen around, the source tank holds 210k units and the target tank holds 50k units. (260000 / 180s) is 1444 units/sec. Since that is larger then 100 units/sec, you would transfer the materials at a rate of 1444 units/sec.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have some LF/O tanks that hold 29568 units of Oxidizer each. Transferring between those tanks would use a speed of ((29568 \u002B 29568) / 180s) or 328 units/sec instead of the default of 100 units/sec.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a quick-n-dirty solution, but a little suspension of disbelief says that larger tanks have larger pumps. And three minutes is probably a reasonable upper bound for moving bulk materials around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
