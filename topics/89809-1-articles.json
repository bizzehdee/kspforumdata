Apply a voltage between the two electrodes to create an electric field. It would be attracted to the top electrode, and repelled by the bottom electrode. If it got too close to the top electrode, it would start to pull in, but if you were fast enough, you could detect the pull in and dump the voltage before the antimatter came into contact with the top electrode.

As the radiation decays, it produces positrons, which in turn produce bursts of gamma radiation when they collide with normal matter.
