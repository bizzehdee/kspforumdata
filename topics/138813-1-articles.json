I was hoping it was a bug that would get fixed for v1.1 but it\u0027s still there. Not sure if it\u0027s intended by the devs to always be on but it would be nice if it were able to be toggled on/off or just set to turn on at dusk and off at dawn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T21:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo is this not possible or am I just the only one slightly annoyed by this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
