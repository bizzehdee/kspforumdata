But Squad have done a lot in recent versions to optimize memory usage and therefore reduce how often the\u00A0GC\u00A0needs to run. In a pure stock install the stuttering is pretty much non existent.

IIRC it\u0027s set to a GB by default, you may want to increase that and you\u0027ve got the RAM to do it. But don\u0027t just set it real high, more padding means longer between stutters, but it also means a longer pause when the GC does run.\u00A0 It\u0027s a bit of a case of finding the balance that works for your setup.\u00A0 I\u0027ve got about 50 mods installed and 32GB of ram and currently I\u0027ve set mine to 2GB.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
