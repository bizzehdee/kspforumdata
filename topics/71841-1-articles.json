You could have the App start with the stock GameData data, and if you want mods, just plug your phone into your computer, and have the App analyze what additional Partpacks are installed and copy their essentials over. i\u0027m also not too sure how much of that is possible, but at the very least, the App should be able to get the same modded files off of Curse (because Kerbal Stuff is 3rd party).
