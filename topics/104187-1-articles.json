I thought I did everything correctly to make a small plate setup but I keep having the same issue no mater what I do.\n[https://imgur.com/XvyxkXW](https://imgur.com/XvyxkXW)\n\nThe center tank stack gets a strange physics problem. It appears to not be connected to the decopuler and plate, but at the same time it does not fall right to the ground. When I am launching it with the other tanks in place the center tank bounces up and through all the elements and just looks like it is on a spring.\n\nIt appears to happen for outer columns as well. It looks like something changed with the physics and thrust plates are not as stable any more. That, or I am missing something. [https://imgur.com/eXmmyTa](https://imgur.com/eXmmyTa) [3]\n\nI uploaded my craft file to dropbox: [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30067887/Duna%20Retreival%20-%20Lander%20-%20No%20Mod.craft](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30067887/Duna%20Retreival%20-%20Lander%20-%20No%20Mod.craft)\n\nI think I removed any mod parts I was using so you should be able to load it into any game. If you go full thrust strait up you will see the outside stack start to bend the i-beams and plates up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T04:59:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 04:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ifandbut**"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T16:27:06Z","Content":"Might be unrelated, but have you tried using a bigger decoupler?
