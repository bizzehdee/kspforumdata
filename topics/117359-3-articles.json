The entire point behind a Von Neumann swarm is to get a lot of data for a relatively small cost.

We\u0027ve build our current technological wonderland from sticks, stones and fire. Sure, it took us a few thousand years, but it is a clear sign that you can use simple machines to make more complex ones. The same thing can be observed in nature: 2 billion years ago we had pond scum, now we have cheetas and killer whales. If you give a probe a good 3d printer, an energy source, some resource extraction device and an arm to assemble stuff, it could rebuild itself.
