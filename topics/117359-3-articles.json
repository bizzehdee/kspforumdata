The entire point behind a Von Neumann swarm is to get a lot of data for a relatively small cost. Guiding the first few generations until the swarm is sufficiently large would likely be standard procedure. After those first few replications the swarm is so big that a single failed replication is no longer mission critical, and we can afford to just watch the data roll in.\n\nAlso, I heavily contest your point that you always need a more complex machine to build another. Going by that logic you would never have a rise in complexity, as the child can never be more complex than the parent. Yet we see the exact opposite in nature and technology. We\u0027ve build our current technological wonderland from sticks, stones and fire. Sure, it took us a few thousand years, but it is a clear sign that you can use simple machines to make more complex ones. The same thing can be observed in nature: 2 billion years ago we had pond scum, now we have cheetas and killer whales. If you give a probe a good 3d printer, an energy source, some resource extraction device and an arm to assemble stuff, it could rebuild itself. It would take a really long time, and probably take loads of intermittent steps, but provided your programming is smart enough it could be done."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T09:34:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, I heavily contest your point that you always need a more complex machine to build another. Going by that logic you would never have a rise in complexity, as the child can never be more complex than the parent.\n\nThe rise in complexity is something nobody really understands. At a high level, we can talk about evolution, but we still don\u0027t know how adaptive processes transform entropy into information. Multiple independent agents, random chance, and reinforcement of both successes and failures are probably all essential.\n\nMachines can only produce machines that are simpler than themselves, but a system consisting of many simple machines can produce a machine more complex than any individual machine. Through trial and error, mistakes and death, the entire system slowly gains complexity. As the system grows more complex, it can produce and support more complex machines. The system itself is a machine, so it can\u0027t produce another system as complex as itself. It can split into multiple independent systems of lesser complexity, and each of them can eventually grow as complex as the original, as long as the conditions remain favorable.\n\nSo, essentially:\n\n- If you launch one von Neumann probe to a destination, it tries to improvise, makes mistakes, and dies.\n- If you launch multiple von Neumann probes to a destination, they try to improvise, but lack the means to seed a self-sufficient system that\u0027s complex enough to produce more probes.\n- If you launch colonization probes to a destination, and integrate the colony into the source system, the entire system grows in complexity. Eventually the colony subsystem becomes complex enough that you can separate it as a self-sufficient system and start producing more probes.\n\nThat gives three possible solutions to the Fermi paradox, depending on how many new colonies a colony can seed off, on the average, before running out of resources or making a fatal mistake:\n\n1. If the number is more than 1, the galaxy is full of advanced civilizations. The only reason we haven\u0027t seen them is that they deliberately stay hidden from us.\n2. If the number is around 1, the most advanced civilizations in the galaxy only span a handful of star systems. They survive for long periods of time, but they keep moving from system to system, as the old systems eventually become uninhabitable.\n3. If the number is less than 1, technological civilizations are short-lived and rare. Eventually someone makes a fatal mistake, and the entire civilization dies."},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T11:35:52Z","Content":"You keep asserting that a machine cannot create a machine if equal or greater complexity, but have not provided any evidence of that.

It\u0027s a trite example but you could regard a cell as nothing more than an exceptionally complicated machine. Given the right raw materials, a cell has no problem creating other cells of equal complexity. Similarly, a viable von Neumann machine would probably need to be manufactureable from as few raw materials as possible, which I suspect is one reason why nobody has built one yet.

(Note that the term \u0027ecosystem\u0027 is often used for non-biological systems with similar characteristics as biological ecosystems.)\n\nNo, that system of reactions must not be self-sustaining. They are simply there already. It might use them until none are left (then they probably die).\n\nAgain: your setting is pointless as you in the end are counting everything as an ecosystem, thus devoiding your argument from any meaning. If we actually build such probes, you could still say that \u0022it is just the universe sustaining a complex ecosystem\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T14:48:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Now you\u0027re assuming that the \u0022complex machine\u0022 is capable of assembling those \u0022more complex parts\u0022 into a \u0022new machine\u0022.

Start with a complex machine that is a) composed of simpler sub-machines, ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) capable of building slightly more complex sub-machines than it, itself is made from and c) capable of assembling those more complex sub-machines into a new machine.

If you can\u0027t make accurate predictions or produce other tangible results, you don\u0027t really understand the phenomenon at all.\n\nIncorrect. Go and read up on computable vs non computable problems. It is entirely possible to have a process that you completely understand and yet the only way to predict what the process will do is to run it and see what happens."}]}
