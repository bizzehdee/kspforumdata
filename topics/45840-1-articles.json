Hotter the engine, the faster the exhaust, the more thrust per unit of fuel. Some people have suggested using liquid-fuelled cores (or even the gaseous cores) but those have the frustrating tendency of leaving a long-lived radioactive exhaust trail behind your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThought Experiment\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m thinking... what if we have an imaginary substance, something that can withstand the insane temperatures and pressures of liquid uranium (say a material with a melting point of 5,000 degrees). We pour the uranium into these tubes and seal them, it can then fission away and stay contained, while emitting electromagnetic radiation (maybe as high as gamma) out to heat the propellent. Ideally I\u0027d want it to be hot enough that it could use water as a propellent and still achieve a good exhaust velocity. That way we wouldn\u0027t need to resort to awkward cryogenic propellent like liquid hydrogen. We\u0027d be able to \u0022refuel\u0022 easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy Question\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I really want to know is if we did do this, how dangerous would the uranium deposit be? I\u0027m not too worried about the gamma rays, I mean the crew will be shielded from cosmic rays anyway. But would increasing it\u0027s temperature that high make it more at risk of hitting super-criticality, or less? I\u0027m all for imagining a super-material that can withstand crazy temperatures, but even I acknowledge you can\u0027t ignore a chain reaction if it results in a nuclear explosion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked around these articles but couldn\u0027t find an answer.

The only times it might work is with excessive use of nuclear power with things like orion boom-boom rockets, and like I said earlier, I dislike the radioactive waste that would produce. So I want a technology that will have all the might of nuclear, but contain all of the waste.\u003Cp\u003EAs I said in the first post, the idea here is to suppose a material that would be able to handle ~5000 degrees without weakening. NTRs exist of course, but they can\u0027t be heated much more than conventional nuclear reactors can (~500 degrees I think). This means that the propellent being shot out of a moden NTR (if we were still building them using modern materials) has a fraction of the true potential energy it could have imparted onto it by the nuclear fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine that in order to get up to 5000 degrees we would need a very high concentration. I figure metallic uranium would fit the bill. But even if it doesn\u0027t... I still refer to Uranium as the fuel because that\u0027s where the energy primarily comes from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, my question is what would happen if a nuclear thermal rocket was allowed to heat up to insane temperatures (by being unmoderated I guess) but be incapable of melting. Would it eventually explode?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost designs actively cool the quartz light bulb with the hydrogen reaction mass, so it can take a lot higher temperature than the actual melting point of the quartz. The number I see most commonly quoted is about 25,000C. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe temperature of the fuel doesn\u0027t have a huge effect on the amount of energy it produces. Remember, this is a nuclear reaction, not a chemical reaction. If anything, as the fuel heats up it will expand, which will reduce the density of the fuel and reduce the rate of fission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, for the record, the NERVA rockets back in the 60s operated around 1,700C.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PTNLemay","CreatedById":30142,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T21:33:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@ Saint\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut isn\u0027t there a direct proportion to the energy being transfered to the propellant?
