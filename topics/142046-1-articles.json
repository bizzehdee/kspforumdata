a 100-pound weight, and you attach a rope to it, and pull straight up on the rope... what tension do you have to put on the rope to lift the weight off the ground?\u00A0 100 pounds.\u00A0 But suppose you have a *horizontal* rope held taut (clothesline-style), with you at one end and a friend at the other, and the weight is hanging from the middle, so that there\u0027s only a few degrees of \u0022sag\u0022 from the weight.\u00A0 How hard do you both have to be pulling now in order to lift the weight off the ground?\u00A0 A whole lot more than 100 pounds!\u00A0 That\u0027s because the

The \u0022thrust obscured\u0022 problem doesn\u0027t actually check backwards very far, so a longer ship with puller engines can work just fine, even without any angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you desire less cheese, remember sine functions are non linear. 45\u00B0 gives you 70% thrust efficiency. An angle of 15\u00B0 looks plenty realistic on a decently long tug and yields 96.6% thrust efficiency! Push that to 10\u00B0 and you have 98.5% thrust efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-20T22:26:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve built an asteroid puller that has a claw mounted on the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eback\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and a trio of long, curved arms sticking out (made of girders) that roughly define a hemispherical space big enough to contain a class-C asteroid.\u00A0 Then engines mounted at the ends of the arms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt works great, and looks cool... but dang that thing\u0027s a bear to launch in the first place.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-20T23:57:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222639065\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022142046\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466461613\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve built an asteroid puller that has a claw mounted on the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eback\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and a trio of long, curved arms sticking out (made of girders) that roughly define a hemispherical space big enough to contain a class-C asteroid.\u00A0 Then engines mounted at the ends of the arms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt works great, and looks cool... but dang that thing\u0027s a bear to launch in the first place.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want screenshots\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
