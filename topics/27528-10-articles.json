Remember that the orbital station lies at GEO at \u003Cstrong\u003E36000km\u003C/strong\u003E. Your elevator cabins are going to need to carry power to travel that far, and their speed is going to be limited by the friction of the rollers on the cable. Even if you manage to get your cabins to travel reliably at \u003Cstrong\u003E200km/h\u003C/strong\u003E, that\u0027s a \u003Cstrong\u003E2 week\u003C/strong\u003E journey from the ground to the station, with supplies and consumables to last the trip.\u003Cp\u003EFixed that for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E36,000km / 200 kph = 180hours\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E180h / 24hours per day = 7.5 days\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed that for you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the 200km/h speed is related to the initial design. Since so much of the technology is undeveloped yet, its rather early to say that travel time will be a limit on the system.
