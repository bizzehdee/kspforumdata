I\u0027m going to say in it\u0027s current state it seems to be working for some and buggy for others. If it doesn\u0027t work try removing the plug-ins first as they are more likely to break and are there for convenience rather than being required. In the development thread someone reported some kind of incompatibility with one of Tantares MM cfgs, so be mindful of that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
