Oops.\n\nWhen I awoke, I found that my craft was at 1250m altitude, maintaining 27-28m/s speed, with a descent rate of 0.\n\nIt had cruised right over the Next Continent, and kept on going. I suspect it would STILL be going now, had the program not crashed during an ill-timed ALT-TAB.\n\nSo..... anybody else created an atmospheric orbiter??? ;D"},{"CreatedByName":"Akaliwolf","CreatedById":26129,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T02:32:39Z","Content":"I haven\\\u0027t yet, Ill try to make one later though ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) sounds...interesting :3"},{"CreatedByName":"E.

I don\\\u0027t think I ever went above 4km, and for the majority of the flight, I maintained .96-.98 efficiency.\n\nThe powered distance was about 35% over any previous attempt, but that\\\u0027s not the shocking part.\n\nThe shocking part is that after the fuel was depleted, my craft continues to gain both velocity AND altitude.\n\nI intend to let this run as long as it will run.\n\n![r2jmeq.png](http://i49.tinypic.com/r2jmeq.png)\n\n![2qk5l75.png](http://i49.tinypic.com/2qk5l75.png)\n\nNote the time, fuel status, altitude, and speed."},{"CreatedByName":"LaggyScout","CreatedById":23211,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T04:17:02Z","Content":"Are these only new parts (.15 released) or do you have any custom do-dads (technical Term) on it.
