It all scales very nicely by crew count and expected return time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll put an example craft from my old 1.5 career in a spoiler below, of a simple mission to orbit Duna and return home safely, meaning sending life support and most importantly comfortable habitable volume to sustain a crew of just 3 for more than\u00A0a year or two. Because of the mass penalties imposed by the life support and sanity concessions, the vessel size balloons from what would normally be a pod-on-a-terrier kind of mission to a full blown interplanetary mothership with tight delta-v margins. The ship had to be launched in 3 sections, the main command, science and power\u00A0module which could also serve as a station\u00A0(since it\u0027s bloody expensive and I wanted my money\u0027s worth), the propulsion module to get it there and back again, and finally a Soyuz to bring the 3 kerbals aboard and also serve as a lifeboat and their return capsule for the duration of this soviet-themed Duna exploration. I could\u0027ve left the Soyuz in Kerbin orbit to save mass, but when docked it provided free habitation time with the extra volume and even after refuelling the ship with a tanker launched to Duna at the same time, I still couldn\u0027t fully guarantee capturing back into Kerbin orbit afterwards. In fact it was so tight on the return leg I had the crew bail into the Soyuz and undock upon reaching Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, so that the mothership would be just barely light enough to capture into a loose orbit. Worst case scenario I\u0027d\u0027ve had to recover it from Kerbol orbit at some point, but having the Soyuz saved me a salvage mission, or nearly caused one, who knows. You can see by the ratio of fuel tanks to equipment it\u0027s not got the best mass fraction, I was limited by the launchpad tolerance and didn\u0027t want to do more launches to fuel it, it already took 2 after orbital assembly, plus the cost of the tanker sent to Duna meant the mission was really making a dent in the budget. Going all the way to Jool without getting top tier parts and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E upgrades would be quite a challenge under these circumstances I think.
