Hopefully this thread won\u0027t turn into a flamewar on part clipping, but I wanted to share my thoughts on it and start a discussion about a proposed solution. Personally, I don\u0027t like part clipping. I won\u0027t go as far as calling it \u0022cheating\u0022, but I don\u0027t care for it myself and generally don\u0027t use it in any of my designs. I say \u0027generally\u0027 because I do recognize that without clipping, it\u0027s just not possible to make some asthetically pleasing designs. In a few cases I have had to resort to clipping in order to make something look good while remaining functional, or to hide what should be internal components (batteries, RTGs, monopropellent tanks, etc) instead of having them hanging on the side of a spacecraft. It is this second thing that I have a proposal for and would care to hear other\u0027s opinions. The biggest problem with internally clipping a battery or monopropellant tank internally to a structural piece is the fact that it becomes unselectable once in flight, so resources cannot be transferred to or from it (as far as I know. I\u0027d be glad to hear if someone has a trick to do that). For example, you can very easily clip a battery to the inside of an Advanced SAS part, which hides it nicely, but means that you cannot select the battery and transfer power to or from it once you are in flight. My proposed solution would be a new stock part, an equipment bay, or something similar that is the same size (diameter and height) as an Advanced SAS unit, that allows you to put other parts inside it, while still allowing them to be selectable (via right click). You would click on the equipment bay, and whatever parts you have inside it would show up in the popup menu with the necessary buttons to transfer resources. A real world analogy is the equipment section of the Gemini spacecraft. I also don\u0027t use mods, and I realize there may already be such parts provided by mods. I\u0027m suggesting a stock part because I believe it would enhance the game playing experience. I also understand that there is a section in these forums for suggested game enhancements, but am posting this in the general discussion section in the hopes it gets more views and generates worthwhile discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T18:39:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Johnny Wishbone\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Johnny Wishbone\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI also understand that there is a section in these forums for suggested game enhancements, but am posting this in the general discussion section in the hopes it gets more views and generates worthwhile discussion.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoved to the proper section, please don\u0027t pollute the forums for views \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T00:10:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KasperVld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KasperVld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMoved to the proper section, please don\u0027t pollute the forums for views \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought these normally get locked because theres people like me who say clipping multiple tanks inside tanks is cheating, and then there\u0027s other people saying \u0022you cant cheat in a singleplayer sandbox game\u0022 and its just a never ending back and fourth. Glad you kept it open Kasper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, part clipping tanks in tanks, intakes inside other parts, and engines inside engines, stuff like that, is cheating. doing it for aesthetics is ok i guess.

Why have a part that allows things to be clipped into it, when you can just add a part that contains certain amounts of Xenon gas, MonoProp and energy? You could just throw out the resources for the flights you don\u0027t need them on.

But there might be a point discussing what there might be in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, I think the game needs its parts better designed. Attach points of many parts are inside their collision mesh and that\u0027s why it is so hard to attach them in symmetry to other parts - the evaluation of part overlaps is done differently for the \u0022main\u0022 part and for its copies. That has nothing to do with the part\u0027s model, collision mesh is a different thing and does not have to have exactly the same dimensions. In the past, the collision checking was relieved to allow attaching parts together easily. But it\u0027s the part geometry what should be really improved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, assuming current symmetry modes (1-2-3-4-6-8) continue to be supported, all circular parts\u0027 collision mesh circumference should have 24 faces. Some parts, typically small fuel tanks, clearly have simpler surface and that again leads to many headaches when surface-mounting parts on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen part collision mesh issues are solved, the collision detection algorithm could be again made a bit more strict and less forgiving regarding part overlaps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
