The basis of the whole thing is that you play the part of a starting empire owner, and want to expand outward. Obviously you need a place to do all of this, so (this is where the name comes from) you race to the other planets against other empires in hopes of claiming it. Of course you don\u0027t have to be an empire owner, you can be a mercenary. Or a space pirate! It\u0027s all up to you. Once you get a planet, you now have to defend it. This is done by accumulating vessels, probes, etc (each of different value) in said planets SoI. Once you feel comfortable you can then set out to make your mark in the solar system, participating in political events, scenarios, etc. Or you can team up! Partner with your friends, buy out empires, do whatever you want, the whole RP revolves around the concept of open world. Furthermore there are \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ENO\u003C/span\u003E required mods, save KLF! Meaning you can go in with B9, Orbital Construction, Kethane, whatever!
