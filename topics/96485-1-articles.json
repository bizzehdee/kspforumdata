I fire up my rocket (LV-N, breaking my house rules that nuclear rockets are not to be detonated below 14KM), point the nose up, and let the rocket burn, trying desperately to make land as my drop tank (Rockomax Orange) drains rapidly. I reach bingo fuel in the drop tank, immediately cut it loose, and it bounces up into the belly of the plane, breaks the rocket free, shears off my tail surfaces, and adds insult to injury by flipping the plane upside down.

At this point, I\u0027m hoping the cockpits slow down enough on full deploy to not be a problem. Chutes full deploy, the rear two explode, velocity dips below 7 m/s. They\u0027ll live.
