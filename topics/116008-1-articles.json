If you Right-Click on the building you will get a box appear. In the box there is an upgrade button. Hover your mouse over the button and it will show you the result of an upgrade, which in your case will say something like \u0022Mission planning\u0022. If you pay the money and upgrade the building you will be able to plan missions with the blue line, and manoeuvre nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T01:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022 data-cite=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre you playing career, I think you have not upgraded your mission control and telescope, the grey means you can\u0027t place a manoeuvre node\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E^^This. You need to upgrade your mission control and tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re in KSP view, and right-click the buildings, it shows you their capabilities and provides you with an \u0022Upgrade\u0022 button that displays the price tag for doing so. Mousing over the upgrade button shows you what you get if you upgrade.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what you need to do is to save up money until you can upgrade the right buildings. You will have to do a fair number of missions before you get to that point, which means you will have to get to orbit without benefit of the blue lines \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(the magic phrase you\u0027re looking for is \u0022patched conics\u0022, that\u0027s the thing you don\u0027t have right now)\u003C/span\u003E. So you have to get to orbit with just your plain gray line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, that\u0027s not too difficult. If you launch and turn eastwards so that you hit suborbital apoapsis above the atmosphere \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(say, 80-90 km to give yourself a little safety margin)\u003C/span\u003E, just coast up until you\u0027re reasonably close to apoapsis and then thrust horizontally until you have orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you\u0027ll have to do this without a maneuver node, the easiest way to see what you\u0027re doing is to do that circularizing burn while you\u0027re in map view. When you go to map view, by default the navball is hidden, but if you click on the little tab you can see at the bottom of your screen, it will bring the navball into view on the map. While it\u0027s visible, you can control your rocket, i.e. you can rotate it, adjust throttle, etc. So all you have to do to make orbit is to go to map view, display the navball, use the navball to orient yourself so that you\u0027re pointed horizontally prograde, and then go to max throttle. Then you can just watch your trajectory in the map view until your periapsis rises above atmosphere, and cut thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T01:14:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, it can be easier than that ... suborbital tourists and parts contracts work well enough for getting enough money for upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T01:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryxal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kryxal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, it can be easier than that ... suborbital tourists and parts contracts work well enough for getting enough money for upgrades.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue... though they don\u0027t pay a lot, and in my experience it can be a bit of a grind to save up for a tracking station upgrade without having reached orbit yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a bit of practice, going to the Mun without patched conics is doable and not super difficult.
