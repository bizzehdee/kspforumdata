Strip some off to give it positive charge, squeeze some more in to give it a negative charge. But electric repulsion or attraction is very powerful.

hypersonic is something else altogether) and a cargo plane optimised for subsonic cruise would not be able to fly at supersonic speeds (mostly because it would fall apart before crossing Mach 1).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, this is just plain wrong, at least at a basic level.\u00A0 One of the early jet airliners (DC-8, as I recall, basically the MacDac answer to the Boeing 707) was routinely flight tested (as in, \u003Cem\u003Eevery single airframe\u003C/em\u003E) in a shallow dive to (IIRC) Mach 1.05, and virtually every other airliner built by Boeing, MacDac, Airbus, and whoever else since, say, 1960 had airframes that were not Mach limited -- that is, they have no grossly undesirable flight characteristics as shock waves build up over flying surfaces through the transonic regime.\u00A0 None of them (until Concorde and the TU-144 -- the Boeing version never flew) could exceed Mach 1 in level flight, but any airliner that routinely operates above Mach 0.85 (which is virtually all the big players since the early 1960s -- let\u0027s say any large transport with jet engines) can exceed Mach 1 without harm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a counter-example, the Me-262 and Me-163 were Mach-limited airframes (despite both being extremely fast -- faster than any propeller fighter, ever).\u00A0 Due to lack of knowledge about transsonic flight, both had designs that promoted compressibility problems like control reversal, stabilizer blanketing, and so forth.\u00A0 The Me-163 was accidentally flown into this regime once, after igniting its rocket engine at altitude (towed up like a glider) instead of using almost all the rocket power to climb to bomber interception altitude -- the pilot lived through the incident because the tuck-under that occurred due to control reversal killed the rocket engine and the aircraft slowed to subsonic due to drag.\u00A0 Both operated under flight rules prohibiting power dives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

to fly efficiently (see how different the Concorde is from any other airliner), and the faster you go, the more extreme these requirements get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, yes, \u003Cem\u003Eefficient\u003C/em\u003E is very much different from \u003Cem\u003Epossible\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Even though a B-52 can exceed Mach 1 in a shallow dive at full throttle, and remain controllable, it would surely come apart at higher Mach numbers -- those long, thin wings are very flexible (ground and air photos will demonstrate how much so), and the controls aren\u0027t designed to compensate for that (modern fly-by-wire could do it, but would require additional surfaces, and B-52 doesn\u0027t have this technology).\u00A0 The result would be surface flutter, which defines V\u003Csub\u003Ene\u003C/sub\u003E for most airframes built for subsonic flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, though, a Concorde isn\u0027t any stronger than a 737 -- it\u0027s just better optimized for high speed, and has much more power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you had a power source that would let you climb at near Mach 1 in, say, a 767, you\u0027d eventually reach an altitude where the fastest you can go is still too slow for the wings to support the weight.\u00A0 With a Mach limited airframe, like a U-2, this condition was referred to as \u0022flying in the coffin\u0022 -- you mustn\u0027t exceed Mach 0.95, but you must stay above stall speed.\u00A0 Yet, at around 80,000 feet, stall speed exceeded the Mach limit of the airframe, and simply lowering the nose would cause enough speed increase to encounter undesirable/unrecoverable Mach effects.\u00A0 To come down from that regime, the pilot had to very carefully reduce the throttle and manage airspeed and angle of attack to avoid stalling as he eased down from maximum altitude and Mach limit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, for those discussing the medieval nuke, it\u0027s worth mentioning that there were well known formulae for detonating substances as far back as the 15th century.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E wouldn\u0027t want to have anything to do with trying to manufacture and handle significant quantities of those (fulminates, mainly, generally sensitive to friction, shock, and heat, and what explosives handlers call \u0022primary explosives\u0022 in that they detonate without any additional help), but they\u0027d provide far more shock than anything else until the invention of nitroglycerin in the 19th century.\u00A0 Given a high-enrichment fissionable, and the knowledge, I don\u0027t see it as impossible for a 15th century alchemist to assemble a nuke (or blow himself and half his city to hell trying).\u00A0 If they have to start from natural uranium, however, they\u0027d never get
