I also noticed the game clock would flash green and yellow several times but remain on green in map mode.\u00A0 Yellow in the other mode.\u00A0 Not sure what that means.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made sure I was upgraded to the most recent version (version 3190, 1.12.5 Windows 64x)\u00A0 tried cleaning up my hard drive,\u00A0 tried turning on silent mode and not running background tasks with my North anti-virus, tried adjusting the scenery and rendering settings (although I couldn\u0027t tell if they stuck because when I would go back to settings they were often restored to what they were before).\u00A0 None of that seemed to make a difference.\u00A0 After restarting the game would run at normal speed for a short time, then slow down, at least in the tutorial.\u00A0 After slowing down, even reverting to the starting screen would be jerky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more thing, the game takes two to three times longer to load than it used to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy laptop is about three years old now.\u00A0 But I don\u0027t seem to be having problems with my other uses, which admittedly is mostly just watching videos online and internet browsing.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
