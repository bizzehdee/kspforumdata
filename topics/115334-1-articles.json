KSP, as it is has absolutely no storyline. There are some contracts. which are, are, as we all know are more or less randomly generated, and sometimes hilarious (this is addresses in game as you can just \u0027decline\u0027 them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe moment you start scripting a story/progress you can easily introduce \u0027game breaking bugs\u0027 on a logic level. As it is now it\u0027s completely irrelevant if you get a \u0027explore ike\u0027 contract or not. The starting contracts as they are just give you some initial funding and a rough guide of progress (and, after \u0027land on m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn/minmus\u0027 the most players should have figured the basics out anyway and don\u0027t require a guiding hand anymore, or don\u0027t they).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, squad may look into some \u0027logic issues\u0027, probably in form of blacklists, to rule out some rather stupid stuff. I totally see the point in asking for a more complete contract system - but if i think about it: this would mean some story-telling and scripting and a complete other focus on development as well as Q/A. As such a system would likely introduce game braking logic bombs. And It would be a problem if you don\u0027t get a \u0027explore Duna\u0027 because you won\u0027t get a \u0027expore Eve\u0027 later on on a story-line tree.

Not a bad simulation of a space program, bad game design, regardless of subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP could be about aliens flying around with their warp-drives, throwing physics out the window as a starting assumption, and the contract/career system would still be awful game design. Good \u0022career\u0022 games need a few things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn no particular order:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. They need to tell a story. Note that this doesn\u0027t mean a script, it means that looking back at the gameplay, it should have a logical arc. This engages the player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If it is to be a career, the designers need to think about what role the player is assuming, and make the career take that into account as a focus. The player is not an astronaut in KSP, he is maybe the director of the space program, so that is the level where the goals, etc.should be set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Rewards systems. Most games have a goal, and rewards systems in games like this tend to be getting new stuff to play with. Players unconsciously play to the reward system, period. Having the rewards end early is a problem as a game design. Alternate reward systems can be within the same game, but KSP really has just the one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Replay. Ideally, no two games would be exactly the same. KSP is always the same. Better contracts might help, but random, stupid, contracts don\u0027t because you read them as just absurd, not as a challenge for a space program. Having the Kerbol system change with a new game and have to be actually explored (via and for Science!) would massively improve replay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. A goal. It need not be entirely set by the game, the player could have options, but there needs to be an end-goal the player has in mind. Explore everything, or begin the process of colonizing other worlds, whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy does the current contract system fail so badly? The absurdity of the contracts breaks any sense of story arc unless you happen to think of play exclusively as #LOLKERBALSBOOM. If that is the only way to visualize kerbals, the game fails at this. Maybe some contracts should be destructive testing (manned) to drive this home. \u0022See how many kerbals can safely land with one parachute\u0022 might be a good one (no reverts). \u0022LOL, Jeb\u0027s dead!\u0022 I think most people don\u0027t play career this way, actually. Generally speaking, a \u0022mission\u0022 system is designed to move the game forward, and to set up novel situations for the player. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current system is to spam ridiculous missions, with the player ignoring the large majority of them. This isn\u0027t a mission system, because the player gets to pick, and the player is not driving the missions (as director of a space program) because the player has no control over the direction of missions (which he should).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think the current system is good game design, you must not have played many good career games. Note that most games get this wrong, so that would be unsurprising, computer game designers tend to think of the mechanics, but not the gameplay design. This is clear in the \u0022sandbox\u0022 nature of KSP. They need an RPG/boardgame (old-school, hex board boardgames) geek mindset to really fix career.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
