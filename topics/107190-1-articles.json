Whenever I step on or into the bay, my kerbal loses its footing and starts ragolling or freezes momentarily and tips over. I tried moving the ladders around, removing stuff from the top of the bay, removing experiments from the bay and rotating the bay itself, but nothing helped. I also tried hacking gravity, RCSing on top of the bay and then unhacking gravity... still the same problem. Strangely enough, on one of my older attempts everything went fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/jJy8p\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/jJy8p\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESample craft here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ybkdryvm3npcne/Munblaster%202_4.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/2ybkdryvm3npcne/Munblaster%202_4.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:54:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, seems service bays have one issue currently that may be the cause of what you reported.
