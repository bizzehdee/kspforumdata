I finally learned how to build a rocket correctly and I learned more about the staging and how to fly a rocket. In the end Jeb decided that he was done with the flying and decided to take a break and go for a swim in the ocean. Below you can see how my lesson went with building and launching the rocket.

Well after Sparky crashed countless times, Sparky turned to her boyfriend Raven and said, \u0022this rocket sucks, fix it!\u0022 As Sparky hands over the laptop to Raven, it was also stated \u0022make the rocket able to orbit Kerbin.\u0022 Well, the mission didn\u0027t go as it was planned in Sparky\u0027s mind. Raven did as Sparky said. He got the rocket into orbit. But he didn\u0027t plan ahead enough to give the rocket enough fuel to come back down; Jebidiah had to get out and push. Ravens response while laughing was, \u0022Well, you said to get the rocket into orbit. You never said it had to also be able to come back down.\u0022 Sparky, being a computer science degree should have know better when talking to a computer engineer major that you have to give them instructions like you would a computer. Facepalm. Also, Sparky made Raven promise that he wouldn\u0027t eject Jeb or do anything harmful to Jeb during the mission. Well what does Raven do? He ejects Jeb out of the cockpit to go skydiving. When will Sparky ever learn to not trust Raven with Jeb\u0027s life. Basically, to continue the mission we had to revert the flight and start over again so no one would be harmed in the making. After all that we finally completed the mission and Jeb walked away happy. Below are some awesome pics of Jeb and our mission process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/grGi6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
