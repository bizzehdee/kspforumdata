Aiming for celestial bodies. Well the easy way to think of it is when you de-orbit, you typically end up exiting 90 degrees off your burn start. So with that in mind, if you want to go outer, you want to exit the same direction the body you are leaving is going. This way your escape velocity also adds to your orbit transfer. Want to go inwards, go counter orbit. Is simple of when to know the burn. Want to go in, burn at and towards sunrise. Want to burn outer body, burn away from a sunset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet really good, and you can use an orbital slingshot to fling yourself out, but that is for another day. As for timing when to burn, you can use a calculator or do what I do. F5 quicksave and do a burn, check how far off you are and that is the difference in distance the orbits have to be. F9 reload and try again until you get the feel for transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasy circularization? The easiest is the braking/accelerating at periapsis and apoapsis. When at one, break/accelerate to get the other to circularize or the orbit you want. When at the other end, do the same. Perfect circular orbits. Also, you can burn towards/away from orbital body to help circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood mods, I like the KW/novapunch ones. Powertech and dynasat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe escape pod is on fire because you put your boosters on upside down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spinecone","CreatedById":52147,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T18:51:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, good to be here!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, sounds like you know what you are doing with the choosing which way to make my turn to orbit, but if I might ask, how can I tell which way Kerbin is spinning from it\u0027s surface?
