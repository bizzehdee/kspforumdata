Word of advice for anyone else trying to figure out the orbital mechanics stuff on their own, don\u0027t take shortcuts on your equations. If an equation says multiply by 2.2 and you can only remember the 2 and not the .2, yeah that\u0027s when things get difficult. Getting into orbit, not so much, getting to other planets.....yeah you suddenly find yourself building super-transports that should have the fuel to take you anywhere in the system, but because you flubbed the equations....yeah you wind up wasting at laest 30-50% of your fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MasterSounis","CreatedById":114506,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T06:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERealized the benefits of air breathing engines as boosters and spent an hour messing with configuration\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralMDBK","CreatedById":72407,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T07:39:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally got a new rig up and running so I ran my first official sandbox mission testing out an idea I got last month about using KAS and Universal Storage to build probes and such.

First landed upside down away from the lander, and had to use 25% of the remaining mono to get it back upright, 2nd rover landed too close to the landing gear and got hung up in it.
