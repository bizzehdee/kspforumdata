If you can manage that, you\u0027re probably going to just float in to a landing. Fire up the aero GUI and aim for a ballistic coefficient of under 400 kg/m^2 (preferably below 350, to give you some margin). Putting a little bit of built-in angle on your wings will also help a very great deal, both in the glide and on the ascent. In terms of KSP \u0027wing area\u0027 units, my current machine has 80 for a landing mass of 135t, and works fine, with touchdown speeds of \u0026lt;30m/s. If anything, it\u0027s over-winged for the mass, but I need to cover the takeoff weight as well, which is around 400t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-28T05:06:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2018 05:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by foamyesque\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
