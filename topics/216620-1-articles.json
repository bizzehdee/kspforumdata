KSP used this and I see no reason for KSP2 not to as well.

Usually the terrain system catches this and sends you flying into the air (probably breaking some stuff) but sometimes times I fall through. It\u0027s worse on Dres, there are whole areas on the equatorial ridge that seem to have no collision at all. Once you fall through on an airless world, you get launched back out by the singularity at the core and go flying out of the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMade more difficult to learn these things by the near-certainty for the kraken to rip my lander\u002Brover apart on approach when coming out of timewarp near the surface of Dres.
