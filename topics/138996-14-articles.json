Let\u0027s face the facts...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad is a business and is in business to make money - that is the nature of business. While it started as one person\u0027s dream to create a computer program based on the concept of spaceflight. It became necessary, for legal and financial reasons, to create a company to manage the day-to-day aspects of creating this product - the Kerbal Space Program. As the program became more sophisticated, it became necessary to hire more people and with that comes the potential to inherit problems. These problems can range from personality conflicts, inefficient employees, micro-managers, bruised egos, etc. (not that I am saying that anyone at Squad has those).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt can also create unique problems, such as too rapid of expansion to make the company fiscally secure. This contributes to horrible conditions such as low wages, rush projects (1.1, anyone?) and even rapid turnover of employees... oh, yeah, and the risk of extreme employee/former employee discontentment. In any case, Squad should not take part in THIS DISCUSSION ON THIS TREAD at all. This is why many small employees the size of Squad normally requires employees to sign non-disclosure agreements that include employer-employee relations (as I now hope Squad is considering).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is more disturbing is the number of people here ready to condemn SQUAD for the allegations. No business could ever withstand the scrutiny I have seen forum members apply to Squad. Squad should never have 1). promised a time frame for 1.1 as this increased the tensions placed on staff and added to the anxiety of those eagerly awaiting 1.1. 2) and never differentiated between release dates for Steam/KSP Store. While the testing beta was a good idea, not releasing it to the KSP Store customers created additional PR issues for Squad that it really didn\u0027t need and increased the pressures for a rushed release of 1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFolks, give Squad a break. This process is a learning curve for someone/or everyone involved in the management at Squad. Not only is KSP a product that is still under development, but so is the company. There is a learning curve for new small business owners, which is essentially what this is. Be patient and things will get better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo simply be one of those who say, \u0022forget, it... Squad treats its employees nasty and I am not going to recommend or buy a product...\u0022 is not only condemning Squad to fail and increases the likelihood of KSP 2.0, or other Kerbal based games never coming into being because well - YOU WILL KILL SQUAD by killing their sales.

Agreed, Squad, should not come down into the bleachers and set to about this however they should, at the same time, declare or publish and official statement concerning these issues as non-action, from a public relations and marketing perspective will be seen as tacit admission to the accusations instead.

It does not necessarily mean \u0022employee\u0022. \u0022Contract workers\u0022 may be employees or they may be self-employed contractors.\u00A0 If the former, they are protected by labour laws.

I do not think it is cause to boycott Squad (the devs nor the owners) or the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever it still leaves the issue of funding of KSP development and the quality of the product. I think the low wages, long hard crunch, and interns doing \u0027important\u0027 work, are of the same pattern as not hiring expertise in Unity, project management and design - resulting in a game that is still buggy and unpolished a year after release. And deep problems such as garbage collection will likely only be resolved when it is fixed in Unity, at some unknown date in the future. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile in the mean time the founders of Squad are funding a movie and a record label that they could not have funded without the success of KSP.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTheir \u0022kamikaze personalities\u0022 (Goya\u0027s words) has taken them far (it brought us KSP), but on occasions it causes them to push things to far (got Felipe to say \u0022i quit\u0022).\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the case of software there is a lot of \u0027give\u0027 in the quality of the product, which unnoticed by the MBA trained, disinterested-in-video-games leadership can get quite low before a majority of customers finds it unacceptable.

reasonable wage after I\u0027d gone through the motions and was established at the company. \u00A0I was skipped over for a raise the next year because the company was slightly under water but trying
