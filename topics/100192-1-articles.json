For a first attempt, I settled on an SRB styled after the first stage of the proposed Ares 1 launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qtI1vSVl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qtI1vSVl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe booster has a 1.875m diameter, which widens to 2.5m at the top to be compatible with standard parts. I debated leaving the top 1.875m and making a separate 2.5m adapter so that the booster could be used radially as well, but having non-standard sized attachment nodes bothers me greatly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GX7LN5bl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GX7LN5bl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imported a stock 2.5m fuel tank to make sure I had the size right, and I have to say I\u0027m very pleased with the result. I\u0027ve still got a long way to go, but I\u0027m happy with the progress I\u0027ve made so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- UPDATE - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter spending several hours tweaking the model (and learning Blender lessons the hard way) I think I\u0027m finished with the model. I might try to add some details, like a pipe running down the side, but I\u0027m happy with the overall shape. Next up is texturing, which I\u0027m much less comfortable with. I know how to do it, but making it look good is something else entirely. Fortunately, I\u0027ve seen several tutorials here on the forum. Anyways, here\u0027s what I have so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U3gLsLCl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022U3gLsLCl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your comments, any feedback is appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T01:12:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 01:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aurum6\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate #1\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnowWhite","CreatedById":121477,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T11:02:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this SRB 24-faced? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T11:44:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat, but why model an Ares booster?
