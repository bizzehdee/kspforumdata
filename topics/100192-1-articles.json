For a first attempt, I settled on an SRB styled after the first stage of the proposed Ares 1 launcher.\n\n![qtI1vSVl.png](http://i.imgur.com/qtI1vSVl.png)\n\nThe booster has a 1.875m diameter, which widens to 2.5m at the top to be compatible with standard parts. I debated leaving the top 1.875m and making a separate 2.5m adapter so that the booster could be used radially as well, but having non-standard sized attachment nodes bothers me greatly.\n\n![GX7LN5bl.png](http://i.imgur.com/GX7LN5bl.png)\n\nI imported a stock 2.5m fuel tank to make sure I had the size right, and I have to say I\u0027m very pleased with the result. I\u0027ve still got a long way to go, but I\u0027m happy with the progress I\u0027ve made so far.\n\n- UPDATE - \n\nAfter spending several hours tweaking the model (and learning Blender lessons the hard way) I think I\u0027m finished with the model. I might try to add some details, like a pipe running down the side, but I\u0027m happy with the overall shape. Next up is texturing, which I\u0027m much less comfortable with. I know how to do it, but making it look good is something else entirely. Fortunately, I\u0027ve seen several tutorials here on the forum. Anyways, here\u0027s what I have so far.\n\n![U3gLsLCl.png](http://i.imgur.com/U3gLsLCl.png)\n\nThanks for your comments, any feedback is appreciated.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T01:12:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 01:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aurum6**\n  \nUpdate #1"},{"CreatedByName":"SnowWhite","CreatedById":121477,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T11:02:01Z","Content":"Is this SRB 24-faced? \n\nAnyway, good luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T11:44:26Z","Content":"Great, but why model an Ares booster?

I like using SRB\u0027s as first stages, but the stock ones don\u0027t do that well, unless you cluster a bunch of them. I really like the big 2.5m boosters from KW Rocketry, so this is meant to kind of fill in the gap between the stock NASA SRB and those."},{"CreatedByName":"Chezburgar7300","CreatedById":114873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T21:03:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Great, but why model an Ares booster?

I spent a significant amount of time trying to fix it, but in the end I decided to just leave the pipe out. After all, this is really just a learning project for me, I don\u0027t want to get bogged down with details just yet."},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T00:02:40Z","Content":"nice job!
