I\u0027m honestly surprised that this happened. I don\u0027t like speculating, but in my opinion the failure might have been an improperly fitted fairing on the dragon capsule, as that\u0027s where the smoke plume originated from. Considering that with the fact that the rocket was under going peak dynamic pressure, i think this is a sound theory. I dont have a degree in physics or engineering, they generally don\u0027t hand those out to high schoolers, but based off of what i know i think this might be the case.

The vented gas looks cryogenic to me.

The rest of the stage fell down then and collided with the first stage about 8seconds later (you can see the 1st stage is still burning all the time while the upper stage goes crazy already). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like the most fitting theory right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space_Coyote","CreatedById":37107,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T15:43:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile i tend ot agree witht eh theory put out ther eYOu need to also take a look at that same picture at the back of hte rocket.. is it me? or does it look like there could have been a \u0022Cascade\u0022 Failue of the 9 engine stacck in the First stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The other part is the ventin gyou see as it is moving upwards..
