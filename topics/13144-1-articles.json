Done some challenging projects, and not everybody like to use modded versions. Mechjeb, smart A.S.S etc. So I did a bit of an overkill flight to minimus with some slingshots, wrong turns and smooth landings. Other fun little mistakes made, but that is what ksp is all about. So if you are having troubles on your landings, placing yourself where you want etc, and want to do it manually, well enjoy the shows.

I liked the videos, nice work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne small thing: At the beginning, you said that the rocket might be slightly overkill. I think that you mis-spoke slightly and what you meant to say was that your rocket was ridiculously overpowered for this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a more useful note, you might want to turn down the volume, gets hard to hear you with a engines firing. That\\\u0027s something I\\\u0027ve noticed with the first few videos of most people \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-24T08:08:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the comment, the audio is wierd, I think it actually was my mike volume was turned down too much on it\\\u0027s imput. The actual game volume is down very low in settings, just checked and it was that too. I heard it after I did playback, but to fix would mean a complete re-recording, I will add comments though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason I work with the bigger rockets is that it can take some of the hassle away if getting picky. Alot of it is I need to refine my designs more, make better use of the fuel tanks with jettisonable feeder tank sets. That is the setup I am experimenting with now, making more tanks, less engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HOC","CreatedById":4374,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-24T09:14:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game is ridiculously loud when we do our recordings- you want to have it down to 1% in game sound in order for your voice to be clear over the rockets. Of course, as your rocket progresses to using smaller engines you could always put it back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regards to quality, you have \u003Cstrong\u003EThe Voice\u003C/strong\u003E. \u0027The Voice\u0027 is something I am, sadly, lacking. It\\\u0027s clear that YouTube is a personality driven site, and your voice is quite enjoyable to listen to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MUST: You need to change your aspect ration to 6:9. If you don\\\u0027t know what that means, it\\\u0027s essentially the resolution you record at. Changing it to 6:9 (1280x720 pixels is 720p, which I record at) will remove those black bars at the sides of your video. Also, you should change the in-game resolution in the options menu to the same as your recording resolution, it makes a hell-of-a-lot of difference, trust me. What screen recorder are you currently using? I use Fraps, which is really great for high-quality recording. It does cost, but you could always use... other means to acquire it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully I\\\u0027ve helped you in some way, the reason I\\\u0027ve taken the time to write all that is \\\u0027cause I wish I knew all that when I started youtube... all those years ago... *cough*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, good luck with the channel.

First off the aspect, not much I can do about that actually. That is because I actually run UXGA CRT monitors. 1600x1200 resolution per monitor. Since KSP runs fullscreen on one, the game only plays that resolution, and that is what fraps records it at. When I put it all into the one movie, standard .wmv that vegas puts at for 720 is when the bars show up. You can see how much so if you check out that last eve online vid I did where it has the black bars underneath. I will see what I can do, might be able to get windowed mode set up so it more closely matches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for my voice, it is actually the part I have the most trouble with. I also need to get a new microphone as well, clear up some of the crackling. A wire broke in my headset, so am stuck with backup. I will play around with the audio balance some more see if I can get that cleaned up, I hope to do another project to really help with precision controls. So accurate landings and orbits. Nice channel you have as well. Clear and articulate talk, excellent intros. I would love to spend the time and do up an intro myself, but between ksp, eve online and other rl hobbies, don\\\u0027t have the time to do up one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really need to fix the landing vid, for some reason it is cut off, not sure what happened there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HOC","CreatedById":4374,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-24T10:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, you can change game resolution no matter the monitor size. My laptop has a 1366x768 resolution and I\\\u0027ve set the game to run at 1280x720.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really don\\\u0027t want to change your full screen resolution like that, then I\\\u0027d suggest running the game windowed at 1280x720. To edit my videos I use the (bad, but free) windows live movie maker, which one can easily set to render at 6:9. I\\\u0027d imagine most editors, including Vegas, can do the same. YouTube tutorials have never let me down, all you need is perseverance...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for microphones, I use a logitech USB desktop mic. Logitech is one of my favourite brands, they\\\u0027re pretty cheap on Ebay and perform well enough. I\\\u0027d recommend their stuff, as they do both higher and lower end equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! I really enjoy making intros; I used to do them for people specifically on my old channel. Would you like me to make you one? Just message me through YouTube or PM me here on the forums, we shouldn\\\u0027t really stray the thread off topic with stuff like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
