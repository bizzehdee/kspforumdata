I can press T and climbing is stable etc,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when I build something without Kerbals on the board, some kind of satellite etc. here is my problem, I have almost zero control over the stability and moment of the rocket. I can correct course, rocket is going up nice and then slowly falling on the side. I can\u0027t do gravity turn because I have no or very little control over the rocket. Yes I did use vectored engines, I used tail fins. sometimes if I\u0027m lucky rocket will get to the higher altitude, even higher than that and I can\u0027t control spin, can\u0027t turn my rocket in space to pro/retrograde, how to make the rocket controllable without Kerbals on the board.

Your problem probably comes from how you design your ships. In atmosphere, add winglets. The RV8 (or something like that I never remember) give you the most control surfaces. Also try disabling the gimbal on the outer engines of your craft. It\u0027s really all you can do to stabilize it. It might also be a strutting problem.
