Not a huge gamer (I actually never play vidjya), but I am interested here. \u00A0Could be fun. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully this initial question is not a rule violation, but WTF does the parachute open immediately upon launch? \u00A0No one would engineer that. \u00A0It is not realistic what so ever. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbleh, trying to figure this out. \u00A0Guess that is the fun in it all. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-12T23:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to set the stages. I agree on how stupid it is that the parachute defaults constantly on a stage with different stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-13T00:28:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello ironmanlet, and welcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, as HoloYolo pointed out, the parachutes start in the wrong stage by default.\u00A0 You can easily add a new stage and move the \u0027chutes into it using the interface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-13T04:27:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, seeing as you question has already been answered, I\u0027ll just say that sometimes engines have a tendency to go on the wrong stage, too.
