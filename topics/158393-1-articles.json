When he landed, he zoomed his camera around looking at the sights, as if he hadn\u0027t seen before. Then he saw something strange. It was a Kerbal, looking all scorched, but still had hair on their head, as if they just landed from a crash. My fellow pal flew away and landed back at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, heart beating in terror. He searched up on these very forums if ANYONE encountered this \u0022phenomenon\u0022. Fortunately, people also did see this Kerbal, like one of the game developers did. The developer said, \u0022I downloaded a mod that was made by Squad, on Curse. I went to the Old Airfield just to test BDA weapons. Then I saw a plane I had never seen before. I quickly used a nuke on the island, then ran away.\u0022 Another person (not developer) said, \u0022Hello, (Developer\u0027s Name), I looked into the files of this addon and saw a folder called \u0022Sheldon\u0022. I opened it and saw a file called \u0022shel_is_here.txt\u0022.\u00A0\u00A0My buddy\u00A0soon found out \u0022Sheldon\u0022 was a Squad employee who died while in his apartment. He had a heart problem, which was the cause of his death. Squad put his custom Kerbal, called \u0022Sheldon Kerman\u0022 in the addon files. It was an AI Kerbal who would follow you in your plane/spacecraft, and was smart enough to climb ladders and enter cockpits (if there was enough space). If you look in your Tracking Station, you CANNOT see the\u00A0Kerbal Icon and coordinates for Shel\u00A0on Kerbin if you were trying to look for him. Whenever\u00A0Sheldon was caught in your camera while you have a grounded craft, the Kerbals in the bottom-right of your screen would look tremendously petrified. A person in the KSP forums said, \u0022If Sheldon comes too close to your craft, press the \u0022Recover Vessel\u0022 button as quick as possible.\u0022 \u0022Sheldon is also mentioned ominously in the tutorials.\u0022 My friend took all these tips and warnings about Sheldon so much he just HAD to post it on YouTube. It got about 850,000 views by the next 4 weeks. The game addon Sheldon Kerman was in became really popular (to the old players), and it became a Kerbal Space Program legend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 Sheldon was actually a good person. His Kerbal alter ego used to be a friend of Wernher Von Kerman. The story said he participated for the KSP in order to reach orbit with one of their new SSTOs (Single Stage To Orbit), Aeris 4A. He instead crashed into the what is now the Airfield. It was\u00A0once a\u00A0comms station, but Sheldon crashed into it, leaving no trace of his plane. The only good fact was, he survived. What everyone thinks is creepy, is good. Also, Sheldon had been recently recovered by a rescue plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnd\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-30T03:30:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYay, KSP Herobrine...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-30T03:30:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2017 03:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Laythe Dweller\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimalMinmus","CreatedById":172387,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-31T09:02:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223002460\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158393\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490844629\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022134441\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Laythe Dweller\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 5:30 AM, Laythe Dweller said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYay, KSP Herobrine...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemme fix that for ya.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbobrine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo need to thank me, I am only doing my bad pun duty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hypercosmic","CreatedById":154181,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-31T09:24:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s like you copied Herobrine myth and edit it so it fits KSP theme.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry again if you want.
