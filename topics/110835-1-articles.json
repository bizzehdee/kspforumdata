I managed to successfully dock them using a sky crane (I was pretty chuffed). Whilst bringing in the third module I knocked the existing bit sideways. I don\u0027t know if they had already been technically undocked before I knocked them apart but they now are. Ok fine... but no matter what I try I just can\u0027t re-dock them. The one part is controllable and even has a good engine with Valentina, I\u0027ve tried the obvious thing which is to fly away and go back in close. Still can\u0027t dock. Here\u0027s two pictures, one the general situation and the other is showing how close they can be made to align.\n\n![d1PewSu.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/d1PewSu.jpg)\n\n![l0J5IWJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/l0J5IWJ.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T00:23:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 12:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MathmoRichard**\n  \nAnswered!"},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:09:31Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know what is wrong, but pull in your panels before trying again.

That is a fantastic tutorial, I think I\u0027ll do exactly that. It also crushed my overly pedantic way of insisting that everything should be upright. The tanks will go sideways so everything might as well do. I won\u0027t even continue the Mun base upright, I\u0027ll make two adapters which make it all the \u0027standard height\u0027.\n\nAs for my current situation, check this out!
