I managed to successfully dock them using a sky crane (I was pretty chuffed). Whilst bringing in the third module I knocked the existing bit sideways. I don\u0027t know if they had already been technically undocked before I knocked them apart but they now are. Ok fine... but no matter what I try I just can\u0027t re-dock them. The one part is controllable and even has a good engine with Valentina, I\u0027ve tried the obvious thing which is to fly away and go back in close. Still can\u0027t dock.
