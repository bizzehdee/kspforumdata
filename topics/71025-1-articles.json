The use of the highest efficiency engines with the highest T/W (mini cubic strut engine clusters) and keeping the throttle low enough to both keep the plane moving through the soupy atmosphere and to allow the thing to climb in the high gravity. I\u0027m thinking a LV-N engine once high altitudes have been reached and an couple of mini clusters on detachable fuel tanks for the initial climb. and disposable wings which can be dumped once I\u0027m out of the worst of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anybody tried this before and is it an effective method,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T10:24:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have heard it is not an efficient way to get out of Eve. Terminal velocity is about 40 m/s and if you\u0027re flying mostly horizontally you\u0027re not ascending very fast. Imagine how long ascent do you need to get to 30 km where only the atmosphere starts to resemble Kerbin\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T10:27:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis challenge should be of interest to you: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73048-Flying-%28off-of%29-Eve%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlying off of Eve\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s odd that this thread shows as \u0022Answered\u0022 with no replies. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FREEFALL1984","CreatedById":104993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T11:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis challenge should be of interest to you: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73048-Flying-%28off-of%29-Eve%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlying off of Eve\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s odd that this thread shows as \u0022Answered\u0022 with no replies. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerusing that challenge most people are using mods, nobody has dared to try it on a stock game, will I be the first? lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T11:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FREEFALL1984\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FREEFALL1984\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPerusing that challenge most people are using mods, nobody has dared to try it on a stock game, will I be the first? lol\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76153-Lightest-Eve-Lander?p=1119585\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1119585\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis one\u003C/a\u003E from another thread.
