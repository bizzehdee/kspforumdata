IIRC, you get about 7-ish days of hab time/seat if you use the first capsules; If anything, [@RoverDude](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/) is giving more hab time in those base parts than is realistic or historical.  The simple solution is to fly faster.  Burn a bit more fuel and get to Minmus in 2 or 3 days instead of 5 or 6 days; That doesn\u0027t require any new tech nodes.\n\nThe Apollo missions had quite a bit more room to move around compared to the early manned missions.  And they didn\u0027t spend more than 2 weeks in them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-04T18:12:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2017 06:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by NeuroticGamer**\n  \nadding Apollo comparison"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-04T18:10:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, Terwin said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Considering that a Mk1 cockpit is based of the Apollo mission cockpits and those are described as \u0027worn not flown\u0027 by the astronauts that flew them, multiplying the crew space by 3 probably only gives enough space to have both a bed-roll and a toilet if you use the toilet for a pillow.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E After all, in a Mk1 cockpit, you neither have room for a second diaper, nor enough mobility to take off the one you put on before launch.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know about you, but the Mk1 Cabin looks like barely enough space for one Kerbal to stretch and exercise for a 3 week mission(when not strapped in to the cockpit at least)\n\u003E \n\nThe Mk1 cockpit is closer to Mercury or Gemini, not Apollo."},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-04T18:11:01Z","Content":"[@Terwin](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/139655-terwin/) [@MalevolentNinja](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150038-malevolentninja/)\n\nRegardless of the details, the beauty is [@RoverDude](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/) put in all kinds of configuration options so you can tweak it to your liking.
