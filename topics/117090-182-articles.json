More importantly for the cylinder tanks.  Do we really need 4\u002B parts for cylinder fuel tanks? (MFT-A/B/C/CF/K).  I don\u0027t think so.\n\nAs a solution I would propose to roll them all into the same part in the editor.  One additional GUI slider would be added that would control the \u0027tank variant\u0027.  So you would first select your tank length, just as it currently is.  After that you could scroll through the options in the \u0027tank variant\u0027 slider that would change between the MFT-A/B/C/CF/K models of the same length.\n\nI\u0027m also wanting to do this for other mod integration, specifically for the Near-Future trusses.  I had started making a patch set for them, but ran into the problem that I would have needed a separate part for each \u0027style\u0027 of truss (solid, hollow, saddle, support, fuel, etc).  With the above proposed \u0027sub-type\u0027 support they could all stay as a single part that merely allowed for swapping of the variants for each length selection.  (Yes, I will likely release some of these mod-integration patches at some point; but I need to finish writing them first, which requires time that I can actually sit down and play).\n\nFor reference the exact same functionality can be accomplished right now by merely adding the alternate definitions to the existing tanks.  But then as you pressed the tank length \u003E\u003E button, you would get the next tank style of the same size until no more styles were available, where it would give you the next length (so it would go MFT-A-3, MFT-B-3, MFT-C-3, MFT-A-4, MFT-B-4, etc...).  Basically the proposed change from above would merely clean up the interaction on the tanks a bit and reduce the editor part-list clutter even further.\n\n-IF- I make the change (and I\u0027m really leaning towards \u0027yes\u0027), it\u0027ll likely happen during the transition for the 1.2 update as it has the possibility to be save breaking (okay, WILL be save breaking for anything using the MFT-B or MFT-K; the MFT-A will likely survive)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-13T17:13:47Z","Content":"I like that idea a lot.

The swappable docking ports is a hack at best and I would prefer to only use it where it is -really- needed (at least until such a time as stock code truly supports run-time module switching and it becomes less of a hack).  And any sort of secondary adapters also run into problems of sizing (e.g. \u0027top-lower\u0027 adapter has a top diameter of 1.25, but \u0027top-upper\u0027 has a bottom diameter of 1.875; and now the top of your rocket looks terrible due to mismatching adapters).  -Could- be solvable through code but would be a giant headache compared to the limited functionality it would add (easier to just add a second tank if you really need that many different adapters/sizes on it).\n\nOn a separate note -- adapters that go to from small -\u003E large (tank they are mounted on being the \u0027small\u0027 end) -- already doable, but requires creating second SSTU\\_MODEL definitions for each and every adapter to be used in this manner.  Would also double the number of adapters in the list, which is already quite long.  (This is the reason why they do not currently exist on tanks; I really don\u0027t feel like scrolling through 97 adapters to find the one that I want; scrolling through ~20 is already painful enough)\n\nAnd on the \u0027Too many adapters for the UI\u0027 end of things, I\u0027ve also been contemplating trying to come up with some sort of adapter/mount selection GUI that could be used for the modular parts... but that is about as far as the idea has gone.

I got about 10 hours into 1.05 before I ran into memory limitations crashing my game every few minutes/scene changes (and OPM/Kopernicus had a terrible bug in it too at that time).  I think I managed to play for a total of about ~5 hours since 1.1 has been released; entirely disappointing as *finally* the memory limit was lifted, only to be replaced with entirely broken wheel/leg physics that made any sort of landers or bases an exercise in futility.\n\nSo.. will know more about if I will make any \u0027crewed structural\u0027 parts sometime after 1.2 and I\u0027ve had a chance to do some actual playtesting.

Although, still won\u0027t be compatible with the upgrade system unless they merge that data back into whatever is passed into the OnLoad() method (and only if OnLoad() is called in the editor).  Haven\u0027t gotten to play around with it yet due to lack of ModuleManager (as I still need it for other purposes).\n\nHaven\u0027t figured out how to rework the engine cluster module to not rely on having the part config; seems like there is no real alternative -- I need the config specified values for thrust and thrust multipliers (only this won\u0027t work with the upgrade system... what a quandry).  Going to attempt to grab them off of the engine as it is initialized in the editor (before the thrust is updated from the cluster #)... this will hopefully give me the post-upgrade values for thrust which I can then multiply as needed to derive the cluster\u0027s thrust value.\n\nToday/tonight will likely consist of more of the same; removing dependencies on ModuleManager and replacing them with temporary workarounds so that I can actually get things to load in game (and THIS is why I do not want hard dependencies on other mods; end up stuck waiting for them to update before you can do anything).  I -think- I can hack the rest of the dependent methods into working through one stock event or another, so should hopefully be able to do actual testing tonight.\n\nThe good news is that the things that were not broken by lack of module-manager seemed to still work.
