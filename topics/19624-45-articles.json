If you want to know why it makes a difference, try driving a stock rover, and then a MK4 on Gilly and watch the difference. When that happened to me is when I removed them from my 0.23.0 folder and moved on. They feel too much like cheat parts now to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting the parts to load in-game is as simple as putting PART {} around the config files and downloading the updated cleverbobcat.dll. Making the work the way they should, the way Bobcat has stated he would want, the way his unfinished updated rover will, well that\u0027s a whole different job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf people make the changes themselves (really guys, it is a couple of minutes in a text editor, total, less with practice), then then understand the issues, the lack of support, the things that will still not be \u0022right\u0022. If they click on a link (especially one in the official thread), and unpack as normal, then they will all too often complain that the parts simply don\u0027t meet their quality expectations for Bobcat releases.... and the thread fills up with complaints about something that the OP didn\u0027t even do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that gives you a better understanding of why some mod-authors are resistant to derivative works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPardon my ignorance but if its such a simple fix then why doesn\u0027t bobcat make the fix and then re-relaese the mod.

So I fully admit that my ignorance is the reason I can\u0027t get it to work but everyone keeps saying it is such an easy fix. It probably is but with my schedule and the limited time I have to play this game, if I want to fool around with mods they need to be easy to use and work when I want them to.

Often teasing us and never following through. This is not a complaint simply an observation. I also understand that he does not work for us and that he does all of this out of the kindness of his heart. But with his reputation being what it is, do you expect a new version of HOME to be coming out any time soon? Based on the forums that seems unlikely. So back to my original question, if the fix to the current version of home is so easy to fix why doesn\u0027t he just fix it, repost it, and let people who want to use it, use it until the new version is ready for release? Please don\u0027t misconstrue what I am saying as ungrateful or demanding. The Soviet Pack and American Pack are triumphs and I understand the talent and care that go into all of Bobcats mods, it is a testament to how good the mods are that so many people are looking for an update for HOME. Not to belabor the point but if the fix is so easy why not just fix and repost. The only downside is, more people will be able to appreciate his work. I mean it is still a top download on the first page with that type of realestate in the add-on store you would think that having a functioning and updated mod would be desirable. Anyway sorry for the rant, probably going off topic, being greedy, being lazy, and being ignorant. I gotta cover all my bases on these forums.
