I\u0027m desiging logisitics for stuff that doesn\u0027t even exist yet...) but I have a bit of a problem: the center of mass goes up during flight. This means that while everything is fine and dandy in atmosphere where CoM and CoT are aligned and the flaps compensate for any small misalignments, in orbit everything does to hell because the flaps don\u0027t work and the difference between the center of mass and center of thrust means the plane flips like a coin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I know \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E the CoM moves: I use an overhead wing design with engines hanging from the wing (think C-130 hercules), engines fueled from the center tanks. So quite a lot of structural weight hangs above the CoM of the plane, a lot of fuel lies below it. Fuel runs out--\u0026gt;CoM shifts upwards--\u0026gt;misalignement, plane somersaults. I \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E redesign the plane to have the wings lower, but I like the whole overhanging wing design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo rather than redesigning: anyone have any ideas on how to deal with a CoM that shifts up/down in flight?
