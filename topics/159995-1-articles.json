It\u0027s usually plug-in conflicts or memory issues. The only hardware-related crashes I know for KSP are due to KSP having memory-leaks/poor memory management, resulting in out-of-memory crashes. However, that\u0027s really all on KSP. (It\u0027s\u00A0partially on the user with how many mods one uses and how you play the game... KSP shouldn\u0027t have been based on something like Unity, but that\u0027s water under the bridge at this point...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I recall, I think scene changes and/or reverting still has memory leaks. (It has gotten better over time; I just don\u0027t recall if it\u0027s been completely eliminated.)\u00A0I tend to test designs often, so this was a major cause of OoM crashes for me. I have had crashes when in the editor after extensive editing as well. Not quite sure if this is a memory- or game-related. (I have plenty of editor-mods to ease assembling vessels.) I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the Undo function has a memory-leak/quirk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027d really have to get some odd interactions in KSP going with stock KSP and mods for it to crash due to processing errors. (Or just a buggy plugin...) I\u0027ve had those, but mod devs tend to be quick on game-breaking bugs in their mods. I\u0027ve had several versions of particular mods doing dumb things in the background the mod dev forgot to remove for release. (I think one had massive log-spamming used during dev and testing but was left in by accident for release.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HunHarcos","CreatedById":177007,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-13T21:16:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUPDATE: The game went well, until I installed proceduralwings B9 for the game, 1.2, the mod itself was made for 1.3, I experienced a crash whilst loading in the game files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI went on the dearing endeavour to run the game in openGL, so I did that , supposedly, but it didnt do any better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm stuck with trying to enter the game lol, I deleted the ProceduralWings mod, and still .......\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-15T00:10:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould increasing swap help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anth","CreatedById":161238,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-15T03:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe memory goes up over time especially when going in and out of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E on a semi regular basis.
