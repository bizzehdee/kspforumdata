Now what i noticed though, is that the Parts that i dropped (they did not get destroyed) suddenly disappeared from the map, and i wasnt able to collect them later either. Same for some stages i dropped pretty close to my shuttle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow my question: did these parts just get recovered automatically? And do i get the \u0022refund\u0022 for them automatically as well? I know i couldve just looked at my money how it changed but i have to admit the numbers go up and down without me really getting from where (is there a finances mod or something like that maybe?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you guys for your help in advance, and im sorry my question is a bit chaotic\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-21T16:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, dropped parts are considered \u0022debris\u0022.

Atmospheric bodies have an additional check - if the pressure is above 1% of kerbin sea level pressure, it assumes either burn-up or crash and deletes it.
