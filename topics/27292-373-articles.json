Then, after doing two simulations, it was decided that launching the damaged first stage was not doable without dropping four additional tanks and engines, in order to get symmetric thrust. Well, the stage could still match its specifications, but only because it was designed to launch at sea level and had a head start of more than 1.9 km of height. All other stages were fully intact and the rest of the launch went exactly as planned, as did the rendezvous with the mothership in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter bringing the mothership to a higher orbit around Eve using fuel that was left in the Eve lander and the transfer stage from Kerbin, the Gilly lander was decoupled and landed successfully.

Bob and Lensey Kerman embarked on a long supersonic mission from KSC to the northpole while taking one stop to the north west then working back north. Man, the north pole with Astronomer\u0027s pack, it\u0027s beautiful. I got this amazing shot I really like of it. They also landed there so I could recover the plane and the Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/18bnnmy.png\u0022 alt=\u002218bnnmy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"General Rarity","CreatedById":67829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T05:10:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kx7w9Kh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Kx7w9Kh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5m parts with the help of TweakScale... that baby has 6k m/s delta v with a 100t payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: SSTO with NEAR and Spaceplane\u002B as well with Infernal Robotics.

My return from Mun proved tricky, however with sheer luck and soiled pants Bill safely managed to arrive back at kerbin, although he discovered hitting the atmosphere at speed could result in being bounced back on his way to Mun. Not wanting to miss out and feeling guilty about diving out of the Mun mission as well as faking his death Jeb decided to control the Minmus mission (sources say he also wanted to fly as close to kerbin\u0027s ground as possible without actually crashing a feat he managed thrice at little over 35km above Kerbin) using the Munster which shockingly proved to be a success. I also found landing and taking off from Minmus a lot easier than the Mun. Something which means that Minmus has been ear marked as potential bases for deeper exploration into the Kerbol system. 100 days after setting off, Jeb returned a hero having successfully landed on Minmus, collecting soil samples, conducting various experiments and the occasional oo and aahing. Quite pleased with the Minmus mission achieved orbit, landed and returned on the first run, either I\u0027m actually getting good at this rocket malarkey or the Kerbol god has decided to give me a helping hand.... oddly no one has seen Dean kermin for 103 days....
