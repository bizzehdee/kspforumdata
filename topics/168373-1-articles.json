Staging in the atmosphere, as I thrust my way into space\u00A0works fine.\u00A0The problem I\u0027m getting is when I\u00A0stage\u00A0(press space) for the first time in space. After that I can still stage but decouplers eject parts with 0 force, engines look and sound as if they work but provide no thrust, and I have no other control over the satellite except for staging. Going through all of my remaining stages doesn\u0027t help. However, the satellite is still being propelled by some constant \u0022phantom\u0022 force, even long after my engines \u0022burn out\u0022. My speed keeps dropping but apoapsis goes up and periapsis down, I can\u0027t time warp because the game recognizes the \u0022phantom\u0022\u00A0acceleration. I have checked and I still have plenty of electricity left and the signal is not the problem either. Doing anything in space seems impossible this way. Does anybody know how to fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
