This game intends to be a hard scifi full Newtonian space flight simulator. What does this mean? No planes in space! Namely there is NO drag! Vectors are properly preserved, if battles are happening in an orbit, orbital mechanics applies. What about the \u0022hard scifi\u0022 part? Well, simply put, no hyper-tech. They are attempting to utilize current theorized engine technology in a \u002B50-100 year tech range. Sort of like if NASA finally went in on things like NERVA and had a good 50\u002B years to work on it, how good could they be? Additionally, ships are no longer monolithic objects with health points! A ship is a volume, that volume contains parts. Those parts can be damaged or destroyed individually rather than always in aggregate. Meaning that as you fly by an enemy in a head-on path, it is possible for one of his rounds to rip off one of your maneuvering thrusters, causing you issues commensurate with that problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey have been very receptive to outside ideas on concepts, and in fact sometime soon it will actually be announced that I am coming on board as a consultant to help with things like UI design and concepts development. This arose out of the ideas that I was passing them in the comments area for ways to provide tools to allow for human pilots to get around making sense out of flying a space fighter in combat when they have no real time or ability to go to the sort of zoomed out planning view like we have in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile at this time the game is intended to be a bit of a multiplayer skirmish style, the team wants to eventually get a good single player campaign going. They are currently in the Kickstarter phase and are hoping to drum up enough interest that they can get funding to eventually implement it. Ideally, it is more a matter of time than money, but we\u0027ll see!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help us get this game made!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/impellerstudios/starfighter-inc/description\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/impellerstudios/starfighter-inc/description\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T16:57:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 04:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mazon Del\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded link.
