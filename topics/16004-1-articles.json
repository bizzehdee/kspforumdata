Its basis is the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, a species shown to mutate DNA, denature proteins, disrupt cell membranes, and chemically alter critical neurotransmitters. The atomic components of DHMO are found in a number of caustic, explosive and poisonous compounds such as Sulfuric Acid, Nitroglycerine and Ethyl Alcohol.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-04T17:04:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2012 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by flaillomanz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
