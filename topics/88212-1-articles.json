If you want to have a precise distance from something in orbit, I suggest you look into the mod \u0022Hyperedit\u0022. Yeah its a cheaty mod that hacks your orbit but hey I\u0027d count it the same as autopilot in terms of reaching orbit. I used mechjeb when I first started KSP and BOY does it teach you! Hyperedit I didn\u0027t use when I started but it is quite handy when I\u0027m filming. I hope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

It would calculate that angle for you if you let it do a test launch. If you want to be 8 hours behind you could work out the angle made by your orbit in 8 hours and add that to the phase angle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rosenkranz","CreatedById":57152,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T13:21:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re looking for MJ\u0027s resonant orbit in the maneuver planner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch your first sat into whatever orbit you\u0027re going for. I use a semi-synchronous orbits at 55 deg inclined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse MJ to launch into the plane of its orbit and get to 100x100. Then use the planner to do a holman transfer to it for rendezvous. Match velocity with it. You don\u0027t have to be real close, if you\u0027re within 10km you\u0027re golden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen use the planner to set a resonant orbit. Set it at 5/6. Do this and your orbit period will drop to 2h30m. Now, every orbit, you\u0027ll advance your phase angle to the first sat by 60 deg (1/6 of a full 360). So after two orbits you\u0027ll be exactly 120 deg ahead of the first sat. So as you hit Ap the second time circularize your orbit and get it to as close to the original orbital period as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ\u0027s utilities can throttle to a specific percentage of max thrust. I set it to .1% and I can get to within .05 seconds of nominal on the period which should keep them in position for years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re putting up more than 3 then adjust the resonant frequency as required. So 6 sats would still be 5/6 just circularize after the first orbit instead of the second. If putting up 8, or 9, then use 7/8 and 8/9 as required. You get the idea. I used 5/6 for 3 because 2/3 brought the Pe pretty low and required to much dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my example I put up 3 inclined orbits, 120 deg apart with 3 sats in each orbit separated by 120 deg in those orbits for a total of 9 sats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the other orbits get to the launch pad (assuming you have no flags or anything to mark where KSC is in the map view). Then go to the tracking center. Wait until the KSC is right under the first orbit. Note the time. 120 deg on Kerbin would be 2 hours. Wait 2 hours and go to the launch pad and go for gold. If putting up 6 orbits then only wait one hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
