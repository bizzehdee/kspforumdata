Crew transfer to the pods and eject those--perhaps a cluster of Mk1 lander cans with a set of parachutes, or a single Mk1-2 if you don\u0027t use all four seats in the cockpit.

Have you heard the gospel of the Offset Gizmo?\n\nSeriously, all you need to do is use a decoupler (and maybe a couple of struts for added strength) between the cockpit and the rest of the plane. Then, select the offset gizmo and turn off angle snap. You can then select the fuselage of the plane and move it forward smoothly until it mates with the cockpit.\n\nSprinkle cockpit liberally with Sepratrons and parachutes. Set up the abort action group and voila! A Mk3 LES!\n\nHappy landings!\n\np.s. Works the same for Mk2."},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T20:02:23Z","Content":"Thank you both!"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T21:28:25Z","Content":"Mine is fairly simple:\n\n- Cockpit attached to rest of craft with the largest decoupler\n\n- Escape tower on nose \u002B decoupler\n\n- 2 Raidally attached chutes on top\n\nIt\u0027s ugly, but it flies OK, and it saves my pilots.

Ended up crashing in the ocean. So in that case I would have definitely needed a decoupler."}]}
