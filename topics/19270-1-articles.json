That is the fact that the front tanks in a column of tanks drain first followed by the next and so on.... causing the front end to lighten while the back end stays the same weight. Is there a way to have ALL tanks drain simultaneously? I don\u0027t know specifically how the hoses work, but I tried them with no success...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this possible or should I just work on a different solution to weight distribution mid flight?
