People are a bit worried about the \u0022stereotypical\u0022 console players, as well as the fact that many \u0022stereotypical\u0022 console payers would find some bugs that they would consider \u0022unacceptable\u0022 and that they would wreck the game\u0027s reputation. Perople are also worried about the controllability of the game, the lack of mods, and the steep learning wall that KSP has.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, even if the console release does fail, worst case scenario is that Squad will not have enough money to continue developing KSP and then about 50,000 people (1/3 of the forum) will buy another copy of KSP to finance future development. That adds up to 2 million dollars, which should be enough to continue development.

Half of the players will like the game and learn rocket science, and the other half will be \u0022stereotypical\u0022 console players and run into bugs and not like the game anyway. So, nothing changes. Half say the game is good, half say bad, it cancels out. Life continues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe above is strictly my opinion. Somehow, it will work out.
