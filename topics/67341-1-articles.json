In a descriptive video (below), it shows a series of very complicated gravity assists. Now, how can I plan such a thing in KSP? I realize some gravity assists require a specific planetaty alignment. On the other hand, the first gravity assist of the video is with earth itself, which should be doable any time. It would be nice to be able to do such a thing on a regular basis to boost a spacecraft out to the edge of the Kerbol system!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine you launch and set yourself in an orbit whose orbital period is a multiple of Kerbin\u0027s. And you repeat the process at each gravity assist. This could potentially save thousands of delta-v! The problem is: when you make the first burn to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI, you can\u0027t target Kerbin to get back at it!
