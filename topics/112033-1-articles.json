Logan was an incredible person and a great friend to hang around with. He was, in many ways, your stereotypical comic-book nerd: he had a pretty impressive paunch and didn\u0027t care too much about his physical appearance, he liked wearing t-shirts emblazoned with rather obscure comic books, and he hung around with fellow comic-book enthusiasts pretty regularly. And yet, he was empathetic and great at talking about almost anything. (He had even heard of Kerbal Space Program, and this was back in 0.23 days, before the game was quite as well-known.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we got along famously for an entire semester (we were taking a college class together). On the very last day of class, right before finals, I take a look at the four or five tiny pins on the side of his backpack. I had known they were there for the entire semester, but they didn\u0027t seem to have much on them. With a bit of a start, I realize that the pins have MLP \u0027cutie marks\u0027 on them (the little cutesy symbols located on the ponies\u0027 flanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI pointed it out, and he sheepishly declared that he was one of those guys who likes the show. He then talked briefly about how there\u0027s a quiet majority of people in most of the major fandoms, and then there is the very loud minority who ruins it all. He did not want to be part of that minority. If people recognized the symbols on the little pins, he could talk with them about My Little Pony. If not, well, they didn\u0027t do anyone any harm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELogan was a wonderful person. Unfortunately, I\u0027ve only vaguely been keeping in touch with him.
