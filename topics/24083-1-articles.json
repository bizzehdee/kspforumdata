Basically, as long as you aren\u0027t carrying mostly fuel, you will max out the payload volume long before you max out the payload weight (for handy calculations, the maximum takeoff weight is indicated on the description). Handling is superb, with the powerful \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system and the almost-empty mass in orbit being relatively low.

First, for your convenience, the ship is slightly tilted eastwards, so that if you engage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E (and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E!) before take off, it will follow a slightly eastwards skewed vertical trajectory at first. By doing so, you can \u0027fly it\u0027 by selecting the prograde autopilot at the right time to initiate a perfect gravity turn. With full load, the magic number that warns you to do so is 85m/s on the surface speed indicator, but with a smaller load you will get more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E off the pad, and you will have to start it sooner. In any case, once the gravity turn is started, you can take care of any slight inclination misalignment (any imperfection will get magnified as you tilt over), since it a pretty hands-free ascent otherwise. If you happen to find that your apoapsis is rising too fast by the end (meaning you started grav-turning a bit late), you can always throttle down by pressing \u00272\u0027, shutting off one third of the engines. And once you are circularizing, using just that third (press \u00271\u0027 to toggle all engines to switch between 2/3rds thrust and 1/3rd) helps nailing a precise insertion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022D8qAlUY.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/D8qAlUY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on at all times, if that wasn\u0027t evident by now. The thing barely has reaction wheels, and no engine gimbal, but it has powerful vernors placed strategically so you have decent six-axis control. Which may seem a bit wasteful (and it kind of is), but it gives you a lot of maneuverability, makes docking quite easy, and it isn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E much more wasteful than gimbaling your engine. You can save some fuel by switching on fine controls with Bloq. Mayus., of course.

Then you can pull the chutes, freak out because it seems like they won\u0027t open in time, and breathe a final sigh of relief as speed suddenly drops to ~15m/s a couple hundred meters from the ground. If you get used to all that, you can use that time of heavy aerodynamic deceleration as you drop below 900m/s and get back comms to do some fancy inverted flying to precisely target the landing site (basically all controls work the other way around, you pitch up by pressing \u0027S\u0027, for example). Once the chutes deploy, tough, all that is left to do is turn the lights on, drop the landing gear, and provide a bit of thrust on the last meters to bring speed to a safe 5-10m/s for final touchdown, to ensure nothing blows up.

First, for your convenience, the ship is slightly tilted eastwards, so that if you engage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E (and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E!) before take off, it will follow a slightly eastwards skewed vertical trajectory at first. By doing so, you can \u0027fly it\u0027 by selecting the prograde autopilot at the right time to initiate a perfect gravity turn. With full load, the magic number that warns you to do so is 115m/s on the surface speed indicator, but with a smaller load you will get more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E off the pad, and you will have to start it sooner. In any case, once the gravity turn is started, you can take care of any slight inclination misalignment (any imperfection will get magnified as you tilt over), since it a pretty hands-free ascent otherwise. If you happen to find that your apoapsis is rising too fast by the end (meaning you started grav-turning a bit late), you can always throttle down by pressing \u00272\u0027, shutting off one third of the engines. And once you are circularizing, using just that third (press \u00271\u0027 to toggle all engines to switch between 2/3rds thrust and 1/3rd) helps nailing a precise insertion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KlOb00Q.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KlOb00Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on at all times, if that wasn\u0027t evident by now. The thing barely has reaction wheels, and no engine gimbal, but it has powerful vernors placed strategically so you have decent six-axis control. Which may seem a bit wasteful (and it kind of is), but it gives you a lot of maneuverability, makes docking quite easy, and it isn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E much more wasteful than gimbaling your engine. You can save some fuel by switching on fine controls with Bloq. Mayus., of course. Apart form that, don\u0027t worry about the fuel cell, it turns on automatically once you stage, and note that using the docking port through the action group (\u00272\u0027) uses the shiny new feature of \u0027control from here\u0027, to reset the orientation... which shouldn\u0027t change once you decouple the payload, but just in case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EldKIOO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EldKIOO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding is also easy: just focus on targeting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (the Trajectories Mod is amazing for that), and do nothing until the thing goes subsonic frighteningly close to the ground. Then you can pull the chutes, freak out because it seems like they won\u0027t open in time, and breathe a final sigh of relief as speed suddenly drops to ~20m/s a couple hundred meters from the ground. If you get used to all that, you can use that time of heavy aerodynamic deceleration as you drop below 900m/s and get back comms to do some fancy inverted flying to precisely target the landing site (basically all controls work the other way around, you pitch up by pressing \u0027S\u0027, for example). Once the chutes deploy, tough, all that is left to do is turn the lights on, drop the landing gear, and provide a bit of thrust on the last meters to bring speed to a safe 5-10m/s for final touchdown, to ensure nothing blows up.

After all, I already had the Heinlein to perform the VSSTO duty, right? But the more time I spent on it, the more in love I fell with its simplicity and looks... and now? Well, somehow it has managed to earn a place on my first interplanetary stack, and an honourable one at that: primary crew lander for Moho (check the album for a pretty cool pic of the stack breaking orbit). And copies of it are planned to pretty much take over every job the Heinlein had, plus small satellite delivery, and general purpose shuttling.

That capsule was really killing that design, because this is lighter, has less thrust, carries one more kerbal if configured to do so (like it is in the file), and if you don\u0027t need crew, you can always chuck out the crew module and put up to 2.5mT of payload there and still make orbit. Or exchange modules once on orbit! And due to the relatively small launch mass (~50mT), it is a handy chemical lander to take around the kerbin system.

Oh, I almost forgot, if you plan on maneuvering during reentry, you want to disable the winglets as control surfaces and enable the airbrakes, in order for them to work the right way on reentry when you are going bottom-first. Squad apparently hasn\u0027t figured out yet how to make control surfaces work when placed backwards... Other than that, it \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E survive an unpowered landing, no need to save fuel for the last second.

Only now that the engines arebunched together on the back, the flameout is even less of a thing to worry about, you can perfectly well time your engine switches by waiting for the sparks of total cutoff to come out of the engines (remember, first you switch the RAPIERs to rocket mode at about 1,500m/s somewhere between 25-30kms, then later you cut the turbojets when you are reaching orbital velocity). Note in the album how the \u0022performance proof\u0022 picture shows a rendezvous with a station at 100kms circular with all of 10m/s left in the tanks without tapping the payload\u0027s fuel, or much of the monopropellant.

Do you guys like? It should look like this in space, though it\u0027s mostly untested other than fuel flow (it is simple enough that I feel confident it\u0027ll work, though). Duna-class missions should be a breeze, and I bet this could visit a lot of other places, Eelo included, if you know your navigation stuff. Maybe even Laythe, though I am not sure 3.5km/s is enough to make the ascent there after falling on chutes.

Check the last pics (or even better, the craft file) to see exactly how that looks, and remember to check the action groups before flying to see how everything works!

This part takes about five minutes with no player input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4- At about 20,000m, start paying attention to your vertical speed indicator (next to the altimeter on a stock install, but a clearer one is the main reason I use KER). Don\u0027t let it go much over 100m/s, and remember the stock one is logarithmic: \u0027only a bit\u0027 to the right of 100m/s can perfectly be 180m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5- Start dropping the nose as appropriate so you bring vertical velocity under 50m/s at about 25kms. No need to completely level off. I find I stay at about 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA over the horizon to do this part, but YMMV depending on how fast you got to this altitude. This is the part were you should get to almost or above 1,500m/s (surface) before the first flameout, and after some practice you also want to let your vertical velocity rise slowly so you get to the end of this stage moving quickly upwards. The faster you can make it here, the better, but once you start seeing sparks on the lower right engine and control becomes weird, you should press \u00273\u0027 to switch the RAPIERs to closed cycle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6- If you waited till control was hard (greedy!), control will immediately return once you switch the RAPIERS. Keep at a 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA angle thrusting at full throttle and watch you vertical velocity rise. It is important that it rises quickly, having it over 100m/s at this point greatly diminishes aerodynamic drag and saves rocket fuel. At about 30kms and with the indicator either at 1800-1900 (surface) or ~2000 (orbit), you will get the second flameout. It is even more benign that the first, since airbreathing thrust at this point is only a small fraciton of the total. The main thing about catching it quickly is that you can save on drag by closing intakes with the action group \u00270\u0027, and save a few drops of fuel by cutting the non-functioning turbojets with \u00272\u0027. \u003Cem\u003ENote: as B.O.B. points out in the very next post, I failed to find out over the five or so test flights that if you don\u0027t drop throttle a tiny bit the RAPIERs can overheat in this mode if they are working together with the turbojets. Sorry!\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7- As you can imagine, form there it is a short push to the desired orbital altitude (I usually shoot for 75kms so drag takes it to the bare minimum, high efficiency 70kms circular). Circularize at apoapsis, deploy solar panels, from now on you have all the time in the world to remember to do things and take pictures. Hope you had a great flight!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will note that the vertical velocity method I describe here is basically applicable to \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E SSTO. The only design-related variables are the altitude at which you start the speed run, and the maximum velocity on airbreathers you design can handle, adn those are kind of fixed once you pick an intake-to-jet ratio and maybe vary a tiny bit with TWR (hint: I always use the same ratio, so all my SSTOs fly mostly the same). This just adds the extra twist of switching half my powerplants to rocket power while still using the others for a little (not so little, actually, saves me hundreds of m/s in rocket delta v) extra push, and no crazy flameout spins of death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- K-33 Venture Star\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother week, another hangover, another release!

Just good old fashioned air hogging, thrust, and lots of fuel. I\u0027ve got to say, the performance has me a little worried: while getting a more than decent payload of about 20mT and the same payload dimensions as the old one, it is still capable of going to Munar orbit in a single stage to refuel there! The amount of fuel you use to drop the cargo on the Mun and get back up is truly ridiculous, BTW (as in, no need to put any fuel on the two main tanks). And sure, it SSTO\u0027es from kerbin with 20mT loads mainly because of the unrealistic airbreathers, but check this out: it also gets 2km/s with full LFO mix in non-oxygenated atmospheres! So Duna SSTO is also covered, as well as most moons. There are chutes in case you have difficulty nailing good landings on airbreathing engines, too, though you can use the rocket setting on the RAPIERS to have a quicker response time. And of course you can use the nukes for incredible efficiency, so this can actually haul more than what you put in the bay between planets, thanks to the rear-facing docking port. Like, say, a whole base pack (sold separately! right now all you get is the fuel dump):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/IVU3Pe5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IVU3Pe5.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IVU3Pe5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you can guess that the testing implied plenty of landings on Mun.

Would you believe I got a kethane deposit right there? Anyhow, if you don\u0027t play with that mod, don\u0027t worry about the fuel bill that much: so fay I\u0027ve spent less than one orange tank in dropping three of the base modules! It also has tons of little details like a universal port in the bay, or one hanging from the CoM, so you put all kind of things there to suit your needs, or a landing light system that is synchronized with the landing gear without you doing anything and put in a separate action group so you don\u0027t deploy the landing gears in the payload by accident.

So a true jack of all trades that will service any needs you space program might have. Want to have a satellite put into orbit cheaply? It might have a huge capital cost, but with an Eagle you only use fuel. Build base on Mun? Just say where and put an orange tank in orbit so it can refuel. take some modules to Laythe to set up a colony there? I\u0027ve got you covered, just a matter of gas. Need a Kethane tanker to service said colony? Just build a kethane module for it, and this will also do it in it\u0027s spare time. Some scientific surveys on Duna\u0027s icecaps?

It is moderately useful, and it looks totally like the real thing. And it works like a charm, too! I might write up a couple of flight indications, but really, if you have gotten any other shuttle to orbit, you should manage this one without issues just by remembering to toggle the RCS on on launch. Oh, and it is my usual ridiculously low number of pars, 155 on the pad with the reference 11 part payload, plus it brings half the orbiter\u0027s weight up, 20mT (not down, though, it has severe mass limitations for a safe landing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/0Tc79lk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00220Tc79lk.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0Tc79lk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the little details that make it an extremely accurate replica:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Obviously, it has the same stack as the real thing: an engine-less Extrenal Tank, surrounded by two SRBs (no liquid boosters!) and the Orbiter with the three main engines feeding off the ET.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A thrust profile for the SRBs. You can tweak it further if you vary the payload, but right now the SRBs vary the thrust during flight, halving it once before the final cutoff. It works just enough to keep the torque in check, forcing the gravity turn actually. Just try to keep it upright facing the right way, and if you panic in the end when you start tilting anyway, just let the SRBs go, you have the margin and it\u0027s safe, besides looking pretty. You \u003Cem\u003Ecan \u003C/em\u003E ride them until they run out, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Payload is a low-density twenty tons, in this case that half-full orange tank. This is not only accurate to the original, it means this is my first \u003Cem\u003Euseful\u003C/em\u003E shuttle replica. Well that was unexpected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A OMS system that runs on different fuel mixture (monopropellant in this case). I know it doesn\u0027t look like it, but those Mk55\u0027s are there for looks only, they hide the true monoprop engines and simulate their mass. Remember to un-forbid the rear monoprop tank when you turn them on, it\u0027s cut off initially so the RCS subsystem doesn\u0027t use it during ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-No power generation on the orbiter other than the SSME\u0027s alternators (useless in space), so the mission time is constrained by that unless you dock to a station. That is an intentional feature, yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-It glides just like the real thing: not very well. Though you have adequate crossrange to line up the runway, you\u0027d better come out of reentry with KSC in sight, and the stable gliding speed is just not survivable on touchdown: you \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to save some energy and flare up at the last second to bring the descent speed under a safe 5m/s for the touchdown. And careful with high angles of attack, you can perfectly fine stall it to death on the final approach (ok, I know it\u0027s not a true stall because KSP aerodynamics, but it looks like one).

Obviously, it won\u0027t fly like that. The idea is that there is a mission module right in the middle of the ship, and you select each one depending on the mission. By default it is configured in the \u0022Science!\u0022 version, which includes all science instruments in a downwards-opening bay (so your kerbals have no trouble accessing it on the surface), plus a couple of rocket VTOL auxiliary engines to handle Duna/low gravity landings. But if you want to go further, or explore kerbin being able to land atop mountains, or you want to rescue up to five kerbals stranded in orbit, there is another version of the Dart just waiting for you to take out the middle module, stick one of the ones on the back, and put the engine section back in. Just remember to grab the engine section by the shielded docking port, and you may have to turn on part clipping to get things to connect again, the editor is sometimes finicky.

That is not only difficult to do, it also means that the CoM stays put in the same spot for 80% of the flight, and even on almost-empty tanks it doesn\u0027t move to where you can\u0027t compensate with thrust vectoring and reaction wheels. So perfect VTOL handling from full to empty, whether it is on airbreathing or rocket VTOL engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022Science!\u0022 and \u0022Scout\u0022 versions sport VTOL rocket engines, and have the delta-V to make a Duna SSTO run, up-and-down or the other way around. So they are more or less designed to be able to land on most places (save the usual suspects, Tylo and Eve) and take off again, if starting from low orbit. The scout, in fact, is mostly just a stripped-down version with the least dry mass and the greatest fuel capacity. Unrefueled, it is capable of Minmus orbital missions, and I have a hunch if you do things very, very well, and burn the monoprop when yo have to (ASAP, since it\u0027s the lowest-isp propulsion), it has enough oomph to do a Minmus surface mission (which, done right, takes a lot less delta-v than a Munar landing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAerodynamic handling is what you should be expecting on a ship by me with this name: a dream. You can lock pretty much any heading on SAS at any time, and if you drop controls it will still stabilize by itself prograde in almost no time. The low wing loading means it lands on a breeze and takes off at about 50m/s, and it still has the T/W to make a rather fast climb. Having the single engine means that airhogging is simple as it can be, and you milk every last m/s out of the atmosphere before switching on rockets (the RAPIER is on manual setting by default so you can push it further after it flames out by dropping throttle).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZHZGtQf.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZHZGtQf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow this is mostly subjective, but the looks have also been a staple of the family: across all versions, the thing that has made the White Dart distinctive in my mind from the other SSTO\u0027s I build is, that when I\u0027m done with them I just can\u0027t imagine how to build a cooler looking one. Seriously, this is perhaps what took the longest: a hundred little details and tiny corrections in the placement of parts to get the cleanest, coolest lines possible without screwing with the practicality of the design. As a tiny example, consider how the docking port is placed: it faces down, so when you dock you get enough clearance, you kerbal can exit the ship without bumping into anything, it puts the RCS tank close to the CoM to help balance, and it means these things can still dock in pairs to my Medusa class transports and look even better than they did when docked (check the last pic at the album). I hope you guys think the same thing about the aesthetics, because it is the reason I didn\u0027t release this \u003Cem\u003Eweeks\u003C/em\u003E ago: I knew I could make it look better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, part count is plain ridiculous. All versions are between 50 and 55, if I recall correctly. So even if you play KSP on a crappy netbook, this is still a ship you can use. Consider that the whole file with the three extra modules is just 80 parts: I outdid myself there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/6HXR0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

In atmosphere it is downright sporty, with low wing loading yet a high-ish TWR, while having a CoL close behind the CoM (that itself stays quite put, if anything it increases in stability as you go lighter to compensate for it) and ample control authority. Meaning it handles like a fighter, yet it will stabilize itself if you let go of the controls (if you have the time for it, of course). At high altitudes, the air routing solution will keep both engines lit as they spool down until one of them goes for good, and the nuke, while having lowish TWR, is more than enough to complete the push to orbit, and it makes the best out of the ample supply of fuel to give over 4km/s of delta-v from low orbit. With that kind of propulsion system (and I\u0027ll freely admit, \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E sorcery is involved), you can visit petty much any rock, if only to fly by it, and you can actually plant flags in a lot of places, including Laythe and Duna.

Goes like this, if you are interested: you take two standard crews (pilot, scientist, and engineer), zip off the runway, and if you burn the excess delta-v in a smart way (i.e: you do a fast-ish initial transfer to Minmus, but not too much into hyperbolic territory, and then you try to cut the travel time by flooring the pedal to the floor going outside kerbin\u0027s SOI and, especially, on the way back), have them put boots on Minmus, zip to outside kerbin\u0027s SOI, then turn around and scream back to base flying by Mun with all the m/s you can manage while timing it right so the Mun is in the right place when you cross its orbit. I\u0027ve completed such a tour of the kerbin system in about two weeks, kerbal time, which is somewhere between three and four Earth days.

But why is it so squat? And does it work like the thing in the movies? Well, for that I have to show you the hardest thing of this build: the stock cargo bay with working ramp to offload \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E recover the included rover. Yup, it carries a rover.

So I guess with enough fuel depots, you could perfectly use this on Laythe. Efficient airbreathing jets as lift engines mean that Duna is off the table, but I\u0027m working on that for another \u0022slightly bigger\u0022 design. Suffice to say I have yet to find a way to move battle tanks around the system! But that one will probably end up using KAS to secure the payloads, so in the meantime, have fun deploying your scientists/troops at any point where they can breathe the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022p7uMWbu.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p7uMWbu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat should give you and idea of its capabilities, so let\u0027s talk user manual. The bay is perfectly workable (I have done rover contracts with this, for 100% recovery at the runway), but it is finicky. You should deploy both stages of the \u0022ramp lowering mechanism\u0022 (AKA the landing legs) in sequence. If both engage at the same time, the ramp actually works as a misaligned kraken drive, so be careful with it! If the Quinjet starts floating, disengage the rear landing legs quickly and try again, it should work if you take your time and look up the action groups in the description. The good part is, when they disengage, the bay bounces back into a very clean dock with the locking docking port, so the RCS engine for pulling the ramp up is not really necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, getting this to orbit is \u003Cem\u003Etight\u003C/em\u003E. Your rocket delta-v is kinda limited, and this isn\u0027t the most arihogging of designs, so you can\u0027t go much over 1,500m/s without switching to rocket power. And even though I tried to get both engines to flame out at the same time by having a thought-out intake placement, the small differential you can\u0027t get rid off is enough to screw with you due to the engines being placed so far apart, so let them switch automatically when they want to. You have ample T/W on rocket mode, too, but in airbreathing mode, it is nothing to write home about, just enough to climb too quickly and run out of air before getting to sufficient speed if you are not careful. And while I am talking about the ascent, a word of caution. Everything is completely misaligned! Not in a bad way, though, but you thrust 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA below centreline, and the main cockpit is angled down 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA. The end result is that, if you control from the cockpit, you are thrusting in space about 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA higher than the navball tells you. Which is kinda cool, since in low level flight that means you velocity vector likes to stay in the same place you are pointing at. Yup, the way I worked things out, when you think you are horizontal the engines are thrusting 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA upwards and the wings see a 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA angle of attack. Like real planes! (short off) However, when you are on VTOL flight, you have to keep an eye on that: unless you point yourself 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA below the horizon, the VTOL engines are thrusting slightly backwards, and you don\u0027t want to go backwards on a VTOL designed to actually work like a conventional plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd come to think about it, I almost forgot about that part! The VTOL system \u003Cem\u003Eis a total aesthetic choice\u003C/em\u003E: rip it out, and this still works just fine, lifting off about halfway into the runway, at about 70m/s.

This one comes form the other side of the world, a very original concept from the russkies to make use of the world\u0027s largest plane (the An-225 Mriya, already in production for the Buran program, for those living under a rock) to launch a small shuttle using a disposable external tank. And not being happy with that much revolution in a single design, the shuttle itself utilized revolutionary \u003Cem\u003Etri\u003C/em\u003Epropellant engines that could run on a kerosene/LH2/LOX mix, increasing thrust at the beginning of the burn and decreasing tankage size and weight, then switching to pure LH2/LOX mode for the highest efficiency possible (and throttling down in the process). But really... what could be more kerbal than launching a rocket form a big plane?

The Mryia is horribly unbalanced while it has the heavy spaceplane on top, so as soon as the air starts getting thin and you can\u0027t use the ton of lifting surfaces on the tail to stabilize, it\u0027ll pitch up because of the engines. That, turns out, is kind of a feature: this is the time you want to pitch up to light the rockets up anyway. Afterwards, it\u0027s kind of a standard climb to orbit, but keep in mind that T/W is kind of tight at first, so make sure you pitch up slightly to 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA until you time to apoapsis has climbed to at least 30 seconds. The fuel in the external tank runs out just as you get an apoapsis outside the atmosphere, which is handy, and afterwards you need to turn off the main engines and allow the fuel to be drained from the orbiter tanks. Orbit is really tight, unlike in the shuttle, so even if it has a payload bay I wouldn\u0027t put anything there much fatter than the MMU already in place.

I had to cheat a bit because KSP aerodynamics, but only a TINY bit (two clipped control surfaces on the back to bring CL backwards). Other than that, no hidden magic: two intakes, two fuel lines, no other clipping at all anywhere and just a couple of struts to keep it firm. And it draws fuel perfectly fine! CoM doesn\u0027t move at all during all the flight, and cares not about the payload you put in there since it\u0027s right in the middle of the bay. The 5.1mT test payload means that for very little fuel, you can lift a considerable fraction of your takeoff weight to orbit (\u0026gt;25% of GLOW as cargo!). The only difficult thing about the design was actually lifting off: rotation speed might be ~70m/s, but actual liftoff with the clearance it has takes about 105m/s, the clearance to get enough angle of attack is a couple millimeters (if the tail wasn\u0027t raised, you wouldn\u0027t be able to take off before the lip of the runway), and I was insisting on doing it by hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery true to the original of course, which also has an insane wing loading when full, and taking off at similar speed!

See, the idea going into this build was to make a big SSTO that looked good. Perhaps with a hint of the Valkyrie bomber in there. With a cool side-looking cabin to stick a shielded port laterally. But midway into the build, I started to think that with that much fuselage, I could explore the limits of the RAPIER engine. So, I exchanged the extra cabin for even more fuel, and I got a very good looking all-chemical SSTO that still managed to do 3km/s after making orbit! Considering the logarithmic nature of the rocket equation, that\u0027s impressive at least to me. It isn\u0027t lacking on T/W or wing loading either, I reckon I could slap a couple of drop tanks and/or ion propulsion systems and perhaps do a Duna mission from runway to runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/oezeCms\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oezeCms.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oezeCms.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr alternatively, You could get a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E cool looking two-kerbal transport that can take them to the Mun\u0027s surface without using nukes.

The central RAPIER is positioned under the centerline, offering an upwards torque that makes the vehicle behave perfectly fine while under thrust. To compensate, the Spatha has much higher fuel margins all around than the Broadsword, making it capable of accessing most medium orbits with ease, while still being able to perform a safe return to launch site under power. It is recommended to fool around with switching the central engine on and off, and into and out of airbreathing mode, to milk the most performance out of it, but by default the RAPIERS are toggled on automatic mode in case you don\u0027t want to mess with that. I usually switch the central one to manual toggle, just so it keeps on when the others go into rocket mode. Then I have them staggered, and pressing 2 to switch modes will get me the two lateral ones in airbreathing mode and the central in rocket mode. Then when I get the second flameout, two again changes it around, allowing me to milk air a bit further, then I just let the central engine flame out and switch it off because the thrust is not on the center of mass and you don\u0027t really need the extra thrust by then.... That sounds much more complicated than it actually is. Anyhow, it\u0027ll work without those shenanigans, too! And then you won\u0027t even get asymmetric thrust at any point, just a smooth if a bit less efficient climb to orbit.

Lots of clipping and liberal use of Ed Tools during building, but the result looks good, and as an added bonus you don\u0027t have to clip the camera inside the build to select any of the tanks, they all have at least part of them visible form the outside. The engines are another thing, but you will use those through action groups,a s well as the landing legs, and the release of the rover (mapped to abort, in case you want to try a risky drop without landing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to flying characteristics, with nothing but LFO and a 80l liquid fuel reserve on the tanks she can make 4km/s at T/W 0.4, which in plain terms means she has the legs to make a Duna mission with surface sample return if you refuel on LKO before departing. That in turn also means Laythe should be a breeze, and of course anywhere closer in terms of delta-v is trivial. The kerbin system doesn\u0027t even need refueling, both moons are well within its capabilities and the auxiliary landing legs are placed so that landing on the tail is both easy and safe, for those places where you don\u0027t have an atmosphere to glide with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/UtF2ssB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UtF2ssB.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UtF2ssB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut all of that performance is not free, of course. First, by the time you can build this on a career save, you don\u0027t need it (as usual). It uses pretty advanced nodes, though I suppose it could be somewhat simplified (i.e: substitute RTGs by solar panels). Not the point of the build. I guess with the new contract you might very well do this for the \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1 (BTW, \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1188k on the runway, but the idea is to recover pretty much all of it). Second, it is pretty deep on the low side of T/W. The climb to orbit is looong, and you have to know your airhogging stuff to make orbit at all, the nukes alone can\u0027t cut it unless you are already going over 1,800m/s, and you can\u0027t really go that fast on jets alone, so the final speed run is done on a combination of half the jet engines and all the nukes blasting at full thrust. Still, only 4:1 intake ratio, four jets, and three nukes, for what it does, it is pretty efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, some balancing magic went on in the build. The low altitude benign flying characteristics when full come from the engines actually giving a slight pitch torque keeping your nose pointing up, but when you go ballistic at high altitudes, you have to shut off the inboard jets of said torque will flip you out of control or at the very least mess with your vertical velocity management. Good thing that starts to happen when you have to shut off a pair of jets due to low air and open up with the nukes, but this is definitely not a ship for beginners , you have to manually correct her at several points, fighting her a bit at times.

Basically, the stuff that they have in common is that they use the same wingform (the old one, slightly tweaked) and a single RAPIER. That is kinda important now, since it means you can put one of these one the runway for less than 45K Funds (Whatever those are!). Well, except the Science edition, those delicate instruments sure are expensive, but even that is \u0026lt;70K, and none of the part counts goes over 65 (or under 50).

It clocks in at over 2.5km/s in the KER simulation when loaded with 100% LFO mix (standard load leaves some oxidizer out to account for the ride out of kerbin\u0027s atmosphere), which makes it capable of landing on Duna under rocket power and then taking off again to orbit, with a big margin. And I say \u0022land under rocket power\u0022 because it is a rocket VTOL, with enough T/W to actually fly on kerbin, so lowering speed to safely put her down on Duna should be a breeze. The VTOL system also comes in handy to put her down on airless moons on its wheels, and the added weight is minimal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/TLDkYcA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TLDkYcA.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TLDkYcA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe downside is that the craft does little else other than carrying a kerbal around, but that is what this game is about, ain\u0027t it?

The VTOL system is completely overhauled, with the successive weight reductions in the family allowing a single jet to take the place of the rocket VTOL system, and giving unprecedented autonomy in hover mode.

Sadly, all that performance in air comes at the expense of performance in space. It is the model with less delta-v in space, by far, and does little else than the Duna version at that, carrying the single kerbal and no payload of note. But have I told what a joy it is to fly? There is a reason I haven\u0027t uploaded a standard boring 100% airbreather plane in ages... they don\u0027t fly as good as this SSTO.

In those cases you want an empty seat, and flying the ship there by remote control (all Darts are equipped with on board computers capable of autopilot) either feels cheaty, or you just want some extra room to roleplay extended missions or whatever.

In all other respects, this version is functionally identical to the Duna edition, other than the added weight of the passenger cabin both decreases delta-v somewhat (Duna orbit-land-orbit missions are dubious if you have to dip into the fuel to land too much) and T/W to the point where this is the sluggiest one to get to orbit.

The prototype also has amazing T/W on rocket power, so if you don\u0027t like tedious waits on the way to orbit, that is definitely your version. It also has somewhat cleaner lines, with less parts due to the missing subsystems.

And if I may say so myself, the results were great! The test flight was from runway, to VAB, then 120 circular orbit, then back to VAB roof. Because of reasons. I must warn you all, it\u0027s a complicated and demanding ship, and it\u0027s still not perfectly balanced. The reaction wheels allow full control at all times, even ignoring assimetrical flameouts and unbalaced fuel loads, but the ship has a tendency to not stick to exactly where you are pointing. Lots of manual flying to be precise on burns. Also, although I added boost engines, the full potential of this craft on range is very dependant on a good climb to orbit. The way this works best for this craft, is to level at about 25kms, build speed more or less horizontal until 1,500m/s, then light the rockets (I did so at 27,000m, see the album for details) in a soft climb to build vertical speed with good T/W, and then hope you can reach 1,800m/s or thereabouts before flameouts force you to go under 50% thrust (at around 30kms).

So since it is a decent glider, I would advise to transition back to VTOL at low speeds, and with a decent clearance to the ground. Don\u0027t worry, I made it to the VAB in the end without quickload, so you should be able to do so too, I\u0027m no piloting genius and I use a keyboard to play (and an unfamiliar keyboard this time). Without further due, the pics to prove my exploits, and the file I know you are waiting for. From pic 4 onwards on the album, that\u0027s the test flight, chronologically ordered, and without quickload used (but a jump to the SPH to fix a fuel line issue on the boost engines once on orbit). Oh, one final detail, I got around to pin a name on it.

First, a few of the numbers so you see I\u0027m not kidding around. GLOW is 100mT almost exactly, so it is easy to translate into percentages. Well, \u003Cem\u003E69.5% of that makes orbit\u003C/em\u003E. Yup, mass ratio 1.5 if you want to see it that way. About half of that (\u0026gt;36mT, or 36% of GLOW) is naked payload (the big red fuel tank with docking ports), so the plain payload ratio isn\u0027t bad either, putting most rockets to shame. And that counts the crew of three, the two MMUs to move the payload around and dock it, and the payload bay door (completely aesthetic), as structural mass and part of the SSTO. Of course, all of it is able to be reused. Notice how I developed for it a nifty engine assembly of 1:1 RAPIER/Turbojet ratio that works beautifully giving you just the right T/W ratio for each leg of the flight, and a smooth rocket transition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou get 3 flameout events, BTW. Don\u0027t worry! They are pretty benign, you get fair warning and a couple of seconds to press the appropriate action group. First one, you switch the RAPIERS to rocket mode and leave the turbos on (4). Then the outer jets go out (cut \u0027em with 1), and then finally it\u0027s 100% rocket power when the last pair go (2), closing the intakes to cut drag (0), and lowish T/W, but by then you are already bringing your apo over 70 kms and don\u0027t need it. You can also recover from relatively big deviations , ~30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA is not an issue you can\u0027t recover from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole time after you climb over 20kms and level out, you don\u0027t have to raise the nose over 20-30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA to get sufficient vertical velocity, so it turns out pretty efficient getting the speed. Getting to altitude with a full load, however, can take a long time, so you know, leave it at a 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA climb and go websurfing, or admire the cool (stock) exhaust my TurboRAPIER gives:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/CZ3bdiC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CZ3bdiC.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CZ3bdiC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate!\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cem\u003ENow also a version with the exploration payload shown in the last album picture already integrated.

No, it is mostly there so you can have a base when building your own payloads for the bird.

(solar panel is optional) And they look just the right size for your kebals, too, not to mention they allow me to handle dumb payloads just by sticking a couple docking ports on the sides, something much more part-friendly for bigger builds than giving each section independent RCS controls for docking.

Anyhow, don\u0027t worry about the RCS groups being so far back. That reaction wheel can compensate if you put fine controls on and take things slow, but I heartily recommend using Navyfish\u0027s docking alignment indicator. Once you master docking (and not before), it greatly cuts down on the time and frustration required to make a multi-dock like the one the payload rack uses to secure itself firmly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, refer to the mission album for more screenshots, including a couple with the UI up so you guys can check out my payload ratio claims and such. You can also check out how the older version without payload door did (in case you want to get rid of it to put another custom payload), as well as notice I didn\u0027t use my usual 70km orbit with this, I went for the full 100kms circular... and I still had a healthy margin. So if it fits the bay, it\u0027ll take it to orbit, I can say that with confidence.

Time to get some SSTOs going! I went for elegance and utilitarianism on this one: It is not only beautiful, but it actually does something useful! It carries with it up to 12mT of payload in a bay that is very accessible and spacious. In fact, to show this usefulness while I was testing the hell out of it, I went ahead and designed a bundle of subassemblies (included) to assemble a deep-space vessel/station with modular parts, and we will talk more about those a bit further down. I even documented it quite extensively, check out the imgur album for a somewhat chronological graphical account. Plenty of MMU action in there, since I designed the payloads without any kind of control to save on parts, and just a couple of docking ports to grab it with MMU\u0027s for assembly: I think I get points for \u0022NASA style\u0022!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/T4ue66t\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022T4ue66t.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/T4ue66t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow some juicy details, because I\u0027m proud at how well this all worked out: it\u0027s simple, it\u0027s elegant, and it performs brilliantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe traditional wing\u002Btail arrangement gives it very good handling characteristics, and a low wing loading means it is an excellent glider, maintaining the agility of much smaller crafts. Combined with the clearance the raised tail gives you, it\u0027s very easy to take off and land, and flying it is a dream. The new ASAS doesn\u0027t always stick perfectly, but after a few tries I can usually lock \u0026gt;45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA pitch headings with ease at all altitudes, and land her almost on a pin\u0027s head (I usually stop on the runway before the third perpendicular dotted line).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fuel is a bit on the tight side, though, with the maximum payload: make sure you airhog below 30kms as much as you can before letting the RAPIERS transition to rocket power! That happens a bit after 30kms always, and by then you should aim to have \u0026gt;1600m/s speed, with a healthy vertical component (but RAPIERS give it such an awesome T/W on rocket power, you don\u0027t have to worry too much about that last one). Also, the part count is about 150 without payload, so pretty good on that front for potato computers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/lwOgvA4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lwOgvA4.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lwOgvA4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome more interesting details on the payloads... See the little docking ports along the spine of the broadsword? That\u0027s because the payloads are only supported by a double dock, so you can actually put them out and then back in, and return them to the runway without them wobbling to death or whatever. That means that if you design new ones, you either keep to the distance I use on one of the three different ones, or place another yourself (which is a bit tricky which ever way you go about it). You could, of course, add a few struts to forgo all that and be even more rigid, but you would lose the really nice feature: the Broadsword can be \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E reused! The second file here is called \u0022Broadsword support crawler\u0022 for a reason: it can reload and refuel a parked Broadsword. Awesome right? Well, it\u0027s actually not the most practical thing, but I recommend trying it at least once because it\u0027s really cool. And I bet someone finds a reason to modify the crawler and put it on top of a rocket so you can load modules on Laythe or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe payloads are also really part-limited, so the resulting space station/deep space vessel is also quite light, while still fulfilling pretty much any role you want from it, form fuel depot to crew transfer station and orbital laboratory, complete with full science suite. You could also use the skeleton of the one with the nuke to place other smaller components, or you know, whatever you want really, it\u0027s a very flexible set of parts... perhaps lacking a good lander in there to fulfil all roles, but hey, I\u0027ve got to leave something to the imagination, don\u0027t I?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note that while the payload capacity of the Broadsword is only around 10-15mT, one of those payloads is a humongous orange tank. Obviously, it\u0027s not full, and in fact it is there as a yardstick so you can see what the maximum payload is (and length, with that inside, you have to use the drop at the end of the runway to pull up without scraping the runway with the payload). You are actually have to move some liquid fuel to the front of the ship, since the climb takes so long! But it will still manage 1,600m/s in the end, and make orbit just fine with excess liquid fuel on the red tank and not having touched the oxidizer in there.

You seriously have a dedicated launcher for each?\u0022 ... I hear you think. Well, this is where the \u0022two different building methods\u0022 comment applies. I should have said \u0022delivery methods\u0022, actually. See, I first built a rocket to launch a bunch of modules in one go. A very ugly, jumbled together rocket, with excess delta-v, and upper stage that doubled as universal skycrane and could be refuelled, and ugly as sin. It sometimes fails spectacularly during liftoff even! Very kerbal. That is how I built Munbase in three launches, two of the file I labelled \u0022Base Basic Pack\u0022, which has the Node, Hab, Fuel Dump, and construction rover; and one launch with the \u0022Base Science\u0022 file, which carried the lab module and the pressurised rover. Pretty functional, and it did the job. It is expedient and I anticipate it will be the most used one. This is the biggest thing to launch of the files I provide, and paradoxically the easiest way to expand bases, because quickload and exploding runaway boosters are cheap in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, once I got that to work (mostly), I started to get fancy. I though to myself this may be a very convenient way to set up a test munar base, but it would be a very big bother to, say, resupply one on Laythe. You would have to refuel it a lot of times to get the modules there, including on Laythe orbit, and end up with too many copies of one module and not enough of others. No, the best way to go about this would be a single-stage skycrane, that could accept any kind of module, especially a Fuel Dump, and deliver it (relying heavily on orbital refuel, I\u0027m not that crazy) to \u003Cem\u003Eany place where you could ever want a base\u003C/em\u003E. Tall order, and I knew before I started that I wouldn\u0027t be able to get Eve and Tylo in there. But I did manage to get a skycrane that can lift either a big red partly fuelled, or two of the other modules, form kerbin to orbit in a single stage. And it looks awesome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/6BnKiOM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00226BnKiOM.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6BnKiOM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis here is the \u0022Skycrane\u0022 file, and it could deserve its own post by itself. Its alternate configuration you will have to build yourself from the other files, one with the Hub\u002BHab\u002BRover bundle (which weights pretty much the same as this light lab\u002Bpressurised rover pack), and the other with a Fuel Dump. Fun fact: it does not, in fact, have T/W\u0026gt;1 on jet engines, you need to turn on the spikes to lift off after you spool up the jet engines. Once you get to 2000m, toggling on and off the spikes to remain under terminal velocity, turn them off and turn the nukes on: they have higher isp by then and are enough to keep accelerating slowly. From then on airhog your way to just-before flameout as you would with another SSTO, then its away with the jet engines and in with the aerospikes. Complicated as boop, but it works beautifully. It\u0027s either a rocket-assisted airbreathing SSTO skycrane, or an airbreathing-assisted rocket skycrane. In any case, it looks cool with that trilateral symmetry and clean lines for such a big clearance for payloads, and it can drop any of the three bundles in any place with atmosphere (and many without it), and make it back to orbit from all but Eve and Tylo. A feat, IMO, and it means I could slap the \u0022reusable\u0022 sticker on this. Oh, it\u0027s equipped with a universal docking port, BTW.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, that makes three files out of six. The other three? Well, two are the other bundles you can take with the skycrane (Hab\u002BHub\u002BConstructin Rover, and Fuel Dump), only mounted in a much more reasonable 50mT parallel-staging crossfed rocket. What other would call \u0022asparagus staging\u0022. To save a lot of time and lag, and to keep on reusing the same skycrane to drop modules on an expanding base. Also, they are the perfect file to get any of the individual modules to convert into a subassembly or modify. Convenient, right? Something had to be! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd last but not least, this should definitely get its own post, but I am giving it away with the pack just so you have all the pieces together.

Which is actually due to the only inaccuracy that sneaked in, BTW: since I couldn\u0027t get SpaceX\u0027s awesome tankage mass fractions, a single \u0022Merlin\u0022 (LV-T45s) just can\u0027t give TWR over 1 going down, so you have to go with three like in the retro-burn.

Well, mostly the fact that I eyeballed the fuel level on the first try to the point where staging the (empty) second stage after landing the core (no mods and all done in one go sequentially) leaves the Dwagon on a 99x70km orbit while the second stage goes back to a disposal 55x80km orbit (two big decouplers working on such small weights can do wonders). Talk about nailing it! The Dwagon itself is clipped to kingdom come, of course, but it has 500m/s, TWR 1.3, and the four (pressurised) seats baselined for NASA. I have yet to land it, though, and I didn\u0027t put chutes in the prototype (truth be told, I didn\u0027t expect to make orbit without something going wrong). Maybe I\u0027ll regret that when I get around to testing reentry... I threw in a couple when I revised the action groups for you guys, though, so that should pose no problem.

And we usually even intend to use them as refueling depots. But you know what also usually happens? We think that they don\u0027t look cool enough just being a bunch of tanks with a crew hab on top... and in the end we end up using dumb tankers just like that because our glorious stations are lag monsters, where time seems to stand still. But still, they look awesome right? And the second main problem would be, no matter how big or small you make your station, you are bound to make a ship the next week that is just big enough, so that the depot you just set up has not almost but not quite enough fuel capacity to fill it in one go. So, how to actually have a useful space station that looks good and is fun to play around?

You can\u0027t deny it looks pretty, and you also can\u0027t deny those are probably more crew spots than you will ever need. 101 kerbal seats! But still, the whole core (basically, everything above the top Big Red) is a puny 75 parts. That\u0027s right, 75, not 175. And it carries no fuel tanks itself, I know, but just because that way you can choose exactly how many Big Reds is enough for you. The guys that kind of follow my designs will recognize the fuel tanks as my standard Big Red assembly, which stack laterally as well as vertically, and that can be found in my Modular Propulsion System. Also there you can find the Klaw Pods and Drive Pods that complete the picture, and it is heavily recommended to use these two craft files together: this kind of configuration has everything you might need, can self-deploy to anywhere with not-so-awful TWR, has two construction Klaw drones that together can move pretty much \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E, and, best of all, is a mere 122 parts: probably less that the ships you want to dock to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what exactly comes in the file?

Might be a lonely NASA tank to have a fully functional fuel station under 80 parts, might be your favorite tanker design you already use, might be anywhere from one to dozens of my Big Red assemblies. Hint: if you dock my fuel tank assemblies in a 3x3 grid, they stiffen themselves thanks to the side connections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd best of all... you get a very nice view!

Still, it still manages to climb to orbit in a frighteningly short amount of time, and it has TWR out the wazoo at all times. It even manages 800m/s afterwards! Refueled, of course, it has much more, over 2km/s IIRC, so Munar missions from LKO depots are totally possible, as is Duna shuttling (which is what it was built for, really). Landing is also a breeze with the chute (though you need some engine assist to land intact, that\u0027s trivial), so this should be a craft for everyone.

But what the hell am I talking about? Well, the MPS is a modular system, so it obviously consists of modules. The idea is that for a given tank size (the standard is a Big Red, of course), you can strap as many as you need together and drop them as you use them. And of course it\u0027s the same with the engines: they are in individual pods you can move around, so T/W is also something you can tailor throughout the mission. The final module is to move the other pieces around (or, potentially, to tow \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E, including asteroids): a cute Klaw probe that provides amazing stability and control if attached in pairs around the CoM. Plus an adaptor on the nose for additional flexibility.

You can of course move them around, but I recommend using Navyfish\u0027s docking alignment indicator for that \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E, and doing it as little as possible. The problem is that if you dock them misaligned, you can pick up unwanted torques and rotations, and since you can\u0027t use gimballing due to the tractor nature of the system, it\u0027s bugs you even with very tiny misalignments unless you have plenty of reaction wheels to counteract. You can of course put them on the back with the front docking port, that\u0027s the main reason that 1.25-2.5m adaptor is there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course the Klaw pods add the ultimate docking flexibility: you can pull \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E if you drag it through its center of mass, and I don\u0027t think I have to show you how you can put one of the pods at the end of the adaptor. Plus, it\u0027s a very cute little subassembly with all the round edges and stuff, downright scary-looking when you reveal the Klaw next to a EVAing kerbal (for a proper sense of scale). Oh, and if the eagle-eyed among you notice they use the old size of reaction wheels, don\u0027t worry: I switched to the proper 1.25m ones when I revised the file for 0.25 compatibility and even more black and yellow diagonal strips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIMGUR ALBUM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/AkabN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Then with RCS you maneuver the rest of the stack out of the impact trajectory into a suitably close periapsis: the Soyuz-K3, the LK lander, and the Blok D braking stage. I know, this particular version of Soyuz isn\u0027t supposed to have solar panels, but batteries wouldn\u0027t give me that skirt that the real one had.

If you mess up the landing and do anything other than a very, very good suicide burn with the lander after you ditch the Blok D to blow up in the surface (ending at a few hundred meters altitude tops when you kill your lateral velocity), and perhaps save a bit of fuel by touching down at 10-20m/s (the legs will hold! just keep yourself pointed upwards with as little lateral velocity as you can), then you won\u0027t have enough fuel to get back to orbit. And even then you might have to finish the orbital burn with RCS, but don\u0027t worry since the mere 15 units of monopropellant you have give you upwards of 100m/s delta-v (make sure you save it for this moment!).

Now some juicy details on how that works. You will notice that I provide 4 craft files at the end, but the ship itself is just the first one. The thing is, as it comes, it\u0027s just a completely useless heatshield (completely crucial in the aesthetics department, of course) and the long spine that houses the habitat, comm gear, and a lab to process the scientific data (equally useless of course, since you need pretty much the whole tech tree to build this). No engines, no fuel, but everything docks here. Oh, and a tiny probe you can drop during Jool aerocapture to explore the atmosphere of that unlandable planet. 6 chutes on the probe means I\u0027ll actually try to land it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the second file is the tanker that lifts big reds to build the fuel section. This is where it gets interesting. See, the whole idea is to have a reconfigurable ship that you can tailor for a specific mission, and alter as you go. I have no idea the delta-v I\u0027m going to end up using to do a grand Tour, but I\u0027m pretty sure I won\u0027t be able to pack it in a single stage, so I\u0027ve accepted that the mission will have to be flexible and preposition some extra supplies along the way (the most important, the yet-to-be-designed Eve Lander). So, the number of fuel tanks and drive nacelles you install is entirely up to you, and will change you range and possibilities to make this one of the most flexible designs I have ever made. In fact, I\u0027m in the process of repurposing it to transport base modules across the system, more on that soon I hope. This is how it looks once you bring the first tank to orbit and unpack the structural section and the heatshield:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/McaOXMp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022McaOXMp.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/McaOXMp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI must admit doing the exact same flight 9 times can be boring, of course, but for most destinations you don\u0027t need that many tanks, and you could always pick some other launcher and launch the tanks two at a time or more.

It sports a full science suite and weights only 50mT, and yet it packs more than 4km/s in each of the two stages and T/W 1.2 under kerbin gravity. Yeah, huge overkill, but I want the dreaded Tylo landing to be as easy as possible. And since I put landing gear on the upper stage, well, it can double as a short of universal lander. It carries itself to orbit with a bit of fuel rom the upper stage, and careful! it carries no RCS tanks, so you have a very limited RCS supply. The two SSTOs are mostly to look good, if chutes were added to the lander you could make do without them, but I wanted to do the atmospheric planets special, and besides, they are really light in both parts and weight (7.25mT and 41 parts).

In fact, what you get out of a single pack is much more modest, albeit a still fully functional base, with a Hab module, a Lab module, a Fuel Dump, a Node module connecting everything and giving communications capability, plus the construction rover that moves all the pieces around. And now, my kerbs, I suppose it\u0027s time to get to the user instruction manual... which is much more simple now than it used to be. I\u0027m going to assume form now on that you either use the Deluxe or Deluxe\u002B versions, meaning you deploy with the Shroud/Lander. We will get to the alternative, complicated deploy methods later (because they are hugely fun to do! Plus, it allows you to build the non-standard bases much more cheaply, if you care about that).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, we are basically launching one ginormous rocket. No big pointers there, get it to LKO and if you are any good, you will do so using the upper stage only for the last tens of m/s of the circularization. Now we get to the main difference between the Deluxe and the Deluxe\u002B version of the pack: the legs. Basically, the Deluxe\u002B version has more than twice the deltaV, or 5km/s, without tapping into the fuel of the lander. That means this is indeed capable of launching to any planet in the system... if you have patience. And I mean \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E of patience. It has a tiny 0.75m/s^2 of acceleration at the start of the burn, so be prepared to read a book while it\u0027s performed or something... Or you could use the Deluxe version\u0027s chemical stage with TWR of 1.1 to get to anywhere between Jool and Eve, because it still has 2.3km/s and is much less tedious to get there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, if we know out navigation stuff, you will have the pack inside it\u0027s lander/shroud, orbiting your target planet/moon. EDL time! It\u0027s dirt simple since you have chutes and everything, but just in case, make sure you are controlling from the top docking port so the navball makes sense, and remember that \u0022Abort\u0022 drops the nosecone and transfer stage, drops the gear, and deploys the chutes. 1.8km/s and TWR of 0.8 under kerbin gravity means that you can comfortably set it down \u003Cem\u003Eanywhere\u003C/em\u003E. Afterwards, it\u0027s time to open the presents!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does look indeed like Santa dropped by... of did we drop by Santa?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/MboAWFx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MboAWFx.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MboAWFx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this group picture you can (almost) see them all. Three corridors still on the ground, the Hab and the Fuel Dump already up, and still together are the Lab and the Node module, with the rover on the other side of the lander. The position is no accident, because I have to warn you: deploying the rover\u002Bcorridors package is best done in the upwards direction to avoid explosions and give room to the pieces to short themselves out. It should work, but follow this procedure: with the rover under control, set the throttle to about 50% (for kerbin\u0027s gravity), and hit stage: all corridors will unravel under you, as you gently \u003Cem\u003Efly away\u003C/em\u003E to a safe distance... (yes the rover is a rocket VTOL too) with maybe a few explosions of the decouplers. Nothing major hopefully. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Come to think of it, you might want to quicksave before starting this whole operation, the kraken preys on those who don\u0027t. Anyhow, let\u0027s get to the individual modules and how they do their thing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/5u3RXN7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00225u3RXN7.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5u3RXN7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis here is the cornerstone of the whole modularity thing, the module that is not good for anything in itself, but that makes it possible to build \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E different bases with this pack and still have each of them look nothing like the others. And it is not pure eye candy, it is also a stock way of having all your base modules docked together in a single unit, sharing resources among them and simplifying both gameplay and you flight list (which in my case, never falls below 40). Make sure to put a pilot in there to operate it before you drop it, because it is the only one without a built-in probe to take care of deploying the landing gear and making sure it stays upright when doing so. It kind of shares form factor with the Hab module (vertical cylinder), and like it, it is positioned sideways on the bay, so be very careful when you drop it so that it ends up the right way up, or you will have to do some crazy thing with the rover and other modules pushing and such to flip it over. Needless to say warranty will be voided at that point (though if you are in some low gravity moon the problem is mostly non-existent). The Hab, though can right itself from any position thanks to a hidden reaction wheel and the legs, so don\u0027t worry about that one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/SRUpjtF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SRUpjtF.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SRUpjtF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis here is the other form factor, the one shared by the Lab module and the Fuel Dump. Very easy to drop and assemble, and you can actually also dock them with the lander (and with my Eagle shuttle, BTW), so you can refuel between those. All it takes to do those dockings, BTW, is some fiddling with the suspension depending on the local gravity: lock it for high gravity fields so the rover can slide under the modules to pick them up, and maybe do a little hop with RCS on the low-gravity moons if the rover doesn\u0027t want to connect because the gap is a hair too big. It is tested to work both in kerbin and on Minmus, so you should have no troubles there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gymDEag\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gymDEag.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gymDEag.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd last but not least, the construction rover. This useful little bugger will not only put all of the other modules in place by docking itself to their ventral nodes, it is equipped with seats so it can serve the base as a joyride when it\u0027s done building it, and it carries one of each of every scientific instrument. It even carries monopropellant rockets to do short hops! And you know, with some ingenuity, I\u0027m sure you can figure out some way of putting a whole base on wheels, and rove your base all over the planet/moon to get to the juicy places.

Plus, it would do a more than decent job at hauling them the long distances. That is pretty much the way you get all those modules to where you want to set up the base. Don\u0027t worry about landing them ultra close to each other, but it saves time if you don\u0027t have to rove too far to get the pieces, since you don\u0027t have the most stability when you are carrying the big, tall modules in the tiny rover. Make sure you maximize the load you bring down on each trip by putting the corridors and the rover on the top docking port while you bring down other payloads, saves you a few flights and they can right themselves from pretty much any position in almost any gravity field (not actually tested on Laythe!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there is the part of actually getting the modules on orbit.

Nice! I like the hopper, very clean lines....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! I was really inspired that day, I got away with playing with angles and yet getting an inherently stable design. Have you noticed how well it flies without ASAS and using only trim (ALT\u002BWASD) to control altitude?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Henri von Braun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Henri von Braun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERune, these ships are awesome; By the way, the Venture Star is INCREDIBLE. Big beast being launched * holy moly, how big is this thing * , and also one of the only times I got into SPESS in thing like that. Keep up the good work!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHehehe, not the biggest thing you can make, that\u0027s for sure. Or efficient. But it sure packs a wallop if you refuel it on orbit, and it\u0027s real easy to get up there. Glad it suits you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. Yay!

But I\u0027ve strutted it a bit firmer, and conducted a couple of successful launches in a row. No need to turn gimbals off, but I still recommend throttling down a notch after you get to 100m/s and during 1st and 2nd stage burns. It is indeed more than possible now, and waypoint station is growing: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gsya4jz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gsya4jz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gsya4jz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
