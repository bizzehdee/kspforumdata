Originally I was just rendering out the scene, background, foreground\u002Bsmoke. Then I decided to render just the background, adjusted so clouds wouldn\u0027t be where the smoke was, and I could use that over and over for different tests. Then I just rendered the foreground\u002Bsmoke with the background transparent. I am using a node setup for the cycles smoke, where the various nodes go into the volume socket of the output. Thinking about it now though it might have saved some time if I had also just rendered the foreground and saved it then just rendered the smoke, and composted the background and foreground together. Although, part of the foreground is set as collision for the smoke, so I guess I would have to leave that in, or clone it and set it to not be rendered, maybe that would work. I might try it one more time, but with a different shape for the emitter. If that doesn\u0027t work I\u0027ll just call it done for now and post what I have over at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111540-Show-off-your-KSP-Blender-Renders%21/page18\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EShow off your KSP Blender Renders Page 18\u003C/a\u003E.
