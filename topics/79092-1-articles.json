I had everything set and ready in the KSP website to make a smooth and clear release, but you should always keep in mind that Murphy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s law will get you anyway. So, as expected, there were some issues with the downloads and then the KSP Forums. In the end, after a few hours, I managed to fix the issues and left everything up and running for the weekend, so all of you could get the First Contract update.
