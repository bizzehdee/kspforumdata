The issue for space station cores is that the station 6-direction hub does not allow surface attach because of the concave surfaces and discrepencies between the collision model and the visible model. This means you cannot close the fairing but well on the other side.\n\nI am building a new size2 core with no appreciable concavities so that the lower size3 fairing can be close on a bottom flange on the hub and a second size3 fairing can be placed on top. \n\nThe other problem is that the fairings will not accept strut connectors. \n\nTo fix this problem I am going to create a thin physicsless \u003Csize3 plate,=\u0022\u0022 maybe=\u0022\u0022 0.1=\u0022\u0022 m=\u0022\u0022 with=\u0022\u0022 very=\u0022\u0022 high=\u0022\u0022 breakin=\u0022\u0022 torque.=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/size3\u003E\n\nSo physicswise here is the basic problem... over 250 m/s below 24000 m the wide parts will create alot of downward drag. \n\ntypically the SAS will be close to the top. Between the SAS unit and the fairin base you have on the station hub a size2 port which has weak twisting force resistence. \n\nTo solve this problem the plate goes on the fairing and the port goes upside down on the plate. The bottom half of the station and bottom half of the hub is covered by the 1st fairing, then inside the fairing will be stut connectos (from plate to hub bottom at ~ 1.4 m out). This then allows the station to have all manner of junky parts on the bottom (gigantor, batteries, sci experiments, light, etc) on karmony or storage. The top fairing will unfortunately be a vistigual part on th station since I want it to have a command capsule. \n\nIn any case, this is how I solved the fairing size limitation. The other solution is to change the docking pots, which given thier current bugs, im going to leave alone."},{"CreatedByName":"TiktaalikDreaming","CreatedById":136290,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T01:32:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The fairings can expand outward to accomidate wider payloads. \n\u003E The problem i found is segmental flexibilty within the fairing can lead to part-part collision and failures.

I\u0027m not asking about this for one or two bits that are wider than normal. That\u0027s what the stock fairings are for after all. I\u0027m talking 18m diameter etc.\n\nWhen you mess with the fairing sizes, they go to hell. I suspect if I had an idea of how the module works, I could just tweak with cfg files.
