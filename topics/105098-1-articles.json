A small rock was spotted moderately distant from Jool; it was on a different plane than Tylo and the two new moons discovered, and it is not known if is orbiting Jool or simply flying past it. It is likely smaller than Minmus. The probe descended into Jool\u0027s atmosphere seven years after being launched, and two after entering its SOI. It recorded pressures upwards of 15.3 bars and recorded temperatures above 1000 degrees. It was crushed by the immense pressure 250 meters below the cloud bank. Slight changes in Tylo\u0027s orbit have shown that there is at least one small object orbiting Jool close enough to measurably perturb Tylo\u0027s orbit. It is probably the effects of the small rock on the inclined trajectory, although this means there is either more than one of it or it is very dense. Extensive analysis of the photographs of the ocean moon show barren islands dotted around its surface. The liquid on the ocean moon is believed to be water, however the probe\u0027s spectrometer could not reach through the thin clouds over the moon as they were opaque on its wavelengths. Kerbals were surprised and intrigued by the probe\u0027s discoveries. They say if the world does not end the next day, they will explore this system more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T00:51:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 12:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Findthepin1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
