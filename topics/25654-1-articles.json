There is always tire rolling noise in reality (in cars and planes alike), it is a perfect feedback, a perfect indicator that you have actually left the runway or landed on it and it gives an amazing depth to planes. I always admired this loud rumble in reality when leaving the runway and the vibrations that you feel, and then when you leave the runway, it feels so quiet and calm suddenly. I have seen so many great games that don\u0027t implement these sounds and the feeling is completely lost for me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am making a .wav file right now for it, and I will post it soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESo, this is the code in plain language:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- switch on when wheel touches the ground;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- speed = sample intensity (more wheel speed, louder the sound is - so that you don\u0027t hear it when stopped);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- speed = sample pitch (more wheel speed, higher the pitch);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- vertical force = sample intensity (in reality, louder when there\u0027s more tire contact surface and this happens when you apply more force to the tire (or deflate the tire). shortened for in-game: the more vertical force there is on the wheel, the louder it is, this should manifest like when you lean the wings down so the plane pushes wheels into the runway, or a short loud burst on the touchdown. if this is hard to implement, it doesn\u0027t really matter as the two above);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- that\u0027s all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022wheel speed\u0022 could be either obtained from wheel rotation speed (if it is detectable with script), or just with surface speed (but of course that\u0027s your job to find out how to do it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis code should be generic (if possible) and be easy to add to existing gears\u0027 .cfg-s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe coder will take most of the credits =)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-06T01:07:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2013 01:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by nothke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bs1110101","CreatedById":58438,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T05:18:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea how to code plugins, but here\u0027s an idea, bind the noize to the suspension, or better yet, weight on suspension times surface speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T10:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bs1110101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bs1110101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have no idea how to code plugins, but here\u0027s an idea, bind the noize to the suspension, or better yet, weight on suspension times surface speed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get ground contact, RPM and contact force from the WheelCollider directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@nothke: How would it handle multiple wheels on a part?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothke","CreatedById":51185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T12:11:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EndlessWaves\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EndlessWaves\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow would it handle multiple wheels on a part?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, in reality, the sounds multiply per wheel. If it is doable in KSP, it should be done that way, either by multiplying intensity by number of wheels having contact, or by playing a sample for each wheel. Unless the simultaneously running samples cause some trouble. Many engines already play lotsa simultaneous samples and it works ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is how it should sound. Only counting intensity per speed, couldn\u0027t find a way to envelope a pitch shift in Vegas, but the pitch shift should be minimal anyway. Turn on the bass to hear the full power of the rumble, but it should be audible without as well:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_8wJkO-y0qg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: The rumble sound is overpowered for the purpose of this video. I am now searching real videos where you could hear the rumble and it is very hard to find one xD Because they are either taken poor low frequency quality mikes, or the engine produces the rumble that masks the tire rumble. In reality you can clearly tell the difference between the engine and rumble.
