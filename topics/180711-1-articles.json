When I time warp with Kerbals on EVA, they always twitch, and get stuck walking in two different directions. They are running, but more at half speed because they\u0027re motion is always split between two directions. If Squad fixed this so that they ran in a single direction smoothly, then it\u0027d be an improvement, but then there\u0027s a second problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals still clip terrain and have a tendency to \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Epoof\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E when running in time warp.
