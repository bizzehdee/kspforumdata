This challenge is simple if you keep it simple but I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll all do far more amazing things than I have so far :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObjective: Dock two vehicles from the greatest initial separation without controlling either of them. \u0027Controlling\u0027 here means applying thrust or rotation once separated from their launch vehicle(s).

After a delay I then separated the rear vehicle which accelerated faster than the forward one, caught up to it and docked. My \u0027record\u0027 for this is only 30m, which should be no problem to beat ^^.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDetails, details:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no sub-orbital or landing requirement (as in the other challenge).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay be one or more launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe range that counts is when the second vehicle separates from its launch stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse any mods you like, how you get the vehicles up there is your concern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce either vehicle separates from its launch stage it may no longer be controlled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, you can use the launch stage(s) to aim the vehicles at each other before separation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythic_fci","CreatedById":58577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T08:17:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust tried it, something strange happened.

It\u0027s a great effect, using the magnetic influence of a pair of clamptrons, you can in fact deflect an asteroid! With a large enough orbit you can even cause a Trojan to go terminal - using NO fuel)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
