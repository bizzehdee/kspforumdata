When you leave one it unloads, and when you enter one it loads. Stargates kind moves away from what this game is supposed to be by a large margin. Instead when you leave a system a timer starts for when your ship will arrive in the next system. And you can have an option of staying behind in the system your leaving, and just sending your ship on its way with notification for when it arrives in the new system, which you would load separately. Low level stuff in all systems can continue to be updated without having those systems actually loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
