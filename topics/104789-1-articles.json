Does your laptop\u0027s chipset/CPU/motherboard allow you to upgrade/add more RAM?"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T08:09:49Z","Content":"Well, if you tried most of the other things, I would say double check your settings.cfg file and set the TEXTURE\\_QUALITY line to TEXTURE\\_QUALITY = 3\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t work for you, I have had luck with loading KSP onto a low end laptop by first culling out some of the parts. I removed about half the parts and loaded the game. Then moved in the other half of the parts and ran it again. I think there\u0027s something with the way .NET compiles things the first time you run it.\n\nAlso, try to make absolutely certain that you have as many as possible of the background process and programs closed. If you want to get fancy, do some googling on how to use MSCONFIG to modify the programs that are allowed to run during system startup. (Generally speaking, leave all the Microsoft ones running, and anything essential for your computer such as video drivers.)\n\nWelcome to the forums! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
