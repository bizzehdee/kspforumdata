It is more noticable if you can compare graphs from previous FAR versions and latest FAR on the same plane. More easy to see if you use low AoA area like up to 10 degree on higher speeds like 2 or more mach. L/D ratio is noticable lower in new versions and red line is visible lot above X axis on graph, meaning some amount of drag is present even if plane is near zero AoA angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is still some bug present with FAR stability analysis, especially if you have some control surfaces with AoA(%) set with other values than zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreviously that was problem with flaps/spoilers when you have to click on analysis button couple of tmes until you always have same numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn latest version problem with flaps is solved, but with other control surfaces with some AoA(%) it is still present.

In absolute terms, they can be wherever you want, but relatively, they should be close to each other. About 1 balls distance away works well and be sure to check dry CoM as well as it may surprise you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwept wings aren\u0027t more stable (though, it depends what you mean by stable..), they create less drag and lift in general and as such, are more suited for high speed designs. Yes, FAR simulates any and all wing sweep. The best advice I can give you is to make your plane look like it\u0027s supposed to do what you want it it to do. Take inspiration from real life designs. Install pWings to help get that perfect shape and size with none of the messiness and part count stock wings give.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for FAR-specific craft, as I said, I\u0027ve only made SSTO planes with FAR so they could be classed as such.
