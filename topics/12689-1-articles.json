Unfortunately it lacked the range needed, so I added more fuel, then it lacked the power, so I added more/bigger engines and added a takeoff booster. Then it lacked lift, so I extended the wings, and even added more wings. After all this, it was completely unstable, so I had to go back and move all the wings around, then it would fly. Its very very stable, only downside is it tries to climb until it backflips. Even with the autopilot on itll slowly do that, so you have to keep an eye on things. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dogon11","CreatedById":20786,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T21:19:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made it all the way around Kerbin with a glider.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T21:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn principle, the infiniglide bug allows for infinite range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dogon11","CreatedById":20786,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T21:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did not use\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) magic turbine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E SAS power\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI simply took off via one SRB, and pointed the nose up at 20 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T21:47:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESkip glide? ???\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Extemporary","CreatedById":20795,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-15T01:52:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy record holder for distance is also my record for altitude and speed. 1330km distance before I intentionally crashed it (it was taking too long), 29500m altitude, and 750m/s airspeed.
