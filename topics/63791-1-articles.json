Eve is the most useful target in the game but the mun is easier to reach if you havent got experience with interplanetary travel. Change how you approach the encounter: pass in front of the moon as it moves a long its orbit, behind it, over it or under it. The properties of your approaching orbit will then determine how you leave the muns sphere of influence and therefore your orbit after the encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA gravitational sligshot increases the energy of your orbit has around a primary body after you pass through an encounter with a second body orbiting the primary.

When you just want to get to Sun orbit then yes, Mun slingshot can get you there for less dv. But when you actually want to visit some other planet, then Oberth effect from accelerating at low Kerbin orbit is comparable in effect and much easier to implement than Mun slingshot. When passing Mun at speeds necessary for interplanetary transfer, the deflection and whole gravity slingshot effect is very small.
