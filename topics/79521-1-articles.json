You get back 98% of your funds from parts you recover. (This is what makes the space-plane concept a good idea)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Use Solid rockets as much as possible (while less fuel efficient, they are substantially cheaper for the amount of delta-v they generate).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Keep it small.

See the mod support thread (\u0022power or aero?\u0022) if you\u0027re interested in how it\u0027s going. My little sports runabout is still flying well, though; the only thing I needed to change on that was to set the canards as flaps to give a bit more supersonic pitch authority.

The dinky VTOL jets are for Mun landings; don\u0027t try using them on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually go for all-or-nothing on the intakes, but gradually shut engines down as I ascend to concentrate the thin air. The intakes are more than enough to feed the six engines at low altitude, but once you get to 30,000m you\u0027ve only got enough for one pair, even with all intakes open. Shutting some intakes at low altitude reduces the drag, but I didn\u0027t really care about low altitude drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPre-nerf, the D7 could climb near vertically, so low altitude flight usually only lasted a minute or two. The surplus drag is trivial when you have that much thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy general approach was to climb as fast as possible to 18,000m, then level off into a slow climb to 30,000m, shutting off the RAPIERs in pairs as I go. Once the turbojets die (or get so weak that I start losing speed, typically around 30,000m/Mach 4.5), I pull up the nose and turn the RAPIERs back on. The ram-air effect would revive the turbojets and allow me to keep half of the RAPIERs on air-breathing mode for a bit longer. I\u0027d typically have the apoapsis over 70km before the turbojets died completely and it was time to shut down the intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, splitting the intakes would be useful for fine control of air braking during reentry. But with the D7, I was running into an action group shortage: 1 was intakes, 2 for turbojets, 3 and 4 were the RAPIERs, 5 and 6 switched the RAPIER modes, 7 was the emergency brakes, 0 is always science on my planes and 9 was generally used for the cargo decoupling/undocking. 8 was the only one spare, and I often wanted that to activate something in the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T15:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/et4mcneguukur4o/Kerbodyne%20D7%20revision%20WIP.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/et4mcneguukur4o/Kerbodyne%20D7%20revision%20WIP.craft\u003C/a\u003E is the current D7 prototype, BTW.

To me it seems there are two possible avenues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Fly upward until 12k altitude, then level off and fly mostly horizontal. This maximizes your horizontal speed and keeps your air breathing engines happy for as long as possible. The downside is that you\u0027re basically riding your own apoapsis and once the air runs out at around 35k, you find that you\u0027re no where near your desired altitude of 70k, and have no momentum carrying you upward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Fly upward until 12k altitude, then level off way less and continue rocketing upward at maybe 30 degree angle from the horizon. You very quickly run out of air, but at least in this strategy your apoapsis is way out in front of you, and your rocket engines can readily push it to 70k and beyond. The downside is that you have very little horizontal momentum, and it takes ages and tons of fuel to circularize this very eliptical orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m suspecting there\u0027s an option 3) here that\u0027s way better and I\u0027d love to hear it. Some posts talk of craft getting their apoapsis to 70k before the air breathing engines finally starve, which I have actually managed to do, but only with super lightweight fightercraft type SSTOs. Doing it with a rockomax 32 (or 64!) strapped to my back seems impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T23:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot impossible but an awful lot of work.
