However, the flight dynamics are frustrating me to say the least. I\u0027m an aerospace engineer irl and all of the things that /should/ contribute to aircraft stability seem to have no effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built an aircraft with the following characteristics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Main Wing on top of fuselage. Slight positive dihedral angle. This should give inherent roll stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Horizontal tail with negative angle of attack in conjunction with COL behind COG should give inherent pitch stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Vertical tail of ANY KIND even with no control surface should give inherent yaw stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, after I takeoff, my aircraft starts randomly yawing/rolling. This should NOT be happening. Everything is symmetric, and I\u0027m using winglets for my empennage (tail) control surfaces to make sure the control surfaces aren\u0027t off-centered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this just the nature of KSPs flight engine? Or am I missing something obvious?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OdinYggd","CreatedById":26917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T17:08:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP\u0027s implementation of aerodynamics is very minimalistic and horribly flawed- such as control surfaces being capable of producing infinite thrust in the so called infiniglide phenomena. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll probably be much more comfortable flying using the Farram Aerospace Research (FAR) mod, which revamps the stock drag model and aerodynamic behaviors with one that is much more realistic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECenter of lift behind center of mass usually works, although the control surfaces are too aggressive and lack of good feathering support means the craft will usually overcorrect and show symptoms of a fugoid cycle when flying- although this disappears on heavier craft because the increased mass helps dampen it out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve yet to notice any benefits from diehedral on my craft, but KSP does seem to respond best to canard and delta type wings over conventional arrangements. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiplanes and triplanes fly well in KSP too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T17:27:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECorrect.
