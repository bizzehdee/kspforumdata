I\u0027ve only just unlocked it in my career mode and haven\u0027t really messed with it. My guess is that only double chute can do both drogue and main chutes from the same compartment, and the stack chute can only do one chute from each compartment, so you\u0027d have to set it to have a drogue come from one and the main from the other... which would cause the vessel to twist over as they change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be cool to have the stack chute set up with two drogues and two mains, allowing it to drop station section on planets upright (again, still haven\u0027t messed with it, so I don\u0027t know that it can or can\u0027t do this or if there\u0027s another part that can).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T23:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kowgan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kowgan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think you misunderstood the concept of my question.
