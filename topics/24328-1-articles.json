It actually looks like a station, rather than a large cylinder of several modules with a big solar array at the end, like mine do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I think the part count could be greatly reduced in some areas, here\u0027s some pointers if you care to think about it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Those ladders, you\u0027re using the small three-rung ladders. Why not do the job of several small ladders with one big ladder, especially for walking out on long trusses? You could probably eliminate several good groups of parts in that manner. If you have a module that you know is going to extend onto another module, try to plan and use a ladder that will just reach to the next one. Try using as big of a ladder as possible to go between two points, it\u0027s less parts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The way you have your solar panel arrays put on there looks to be several of the structural fuselages concatenated into a long tube via docking ports. Why not just use a single, very long structural truss (maybe two or more if you need that many panels) and place the panels on there in the VAB. When you dock several ports like that, you\u0027re using many parts you might not actually need, like the docking ports, and the use of many connections between all the ports means more wobble when doing any kind of maneuver. The ports also do not auto-align when you dock, so they\u0027re probably out-of-rotation a bit. Send a whole array up in one launch, they\u0027re very light to handle so it shouldn\u0027t be a big issue. Less launches and more structural integrity!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Those small RCS tanks really aren\u0027t necessary, as they\u0027re small capacity and their total capacity could be accomplished by a single large tank. This gives you similar capacity for less parts. More \u0022bang for the buck.\u0022 Really, those RCS tanks only belong on very small craft where other larger tanks simply won\u0027t fit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The small OX-STAT panels are probably not needed, as you have a LOT of them. Yes, I understand that having more panels will give you a bit of extra power when you\u0027re leaving peak output hours and descending into the dark, but ultimately there will be a period where you will not have sunlight. The panels will really only add an extra minute or two of actual charge time over a small, conservative array. I guess you could say the OX-Stats are a good alternative in case a main array were to break for some reason, but really, why not just send up another array at that point? Basically, a small, well placed array of the Gigantor-XL\u0027s would be sufficient for a station that size and likely much much larger. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You have a lot of docking ports where you don\u0027t really need them, basically, aim to send up as big of modules as possible, in as few of launches as possible. Docking ports should really only be used to connect major modules, do as much construction in the VAB as possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s a great station, though, and I quite like it, but there\u0027s a lot of places where you could shave off parts from your part count to make it much larger! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AustralianFries","CreatedById":57660,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T05:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice station.
