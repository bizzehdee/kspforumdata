The tiny wheel weighs 50kg but puts out 214 kW? That compares very well to a Tesla\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/152782-122-kspwheel-physics-based-alternate-wheel-collider-api-only/#comment-2872469\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E1.2 kW/kg\u003C/a\u003E - let alone the sort of figure one might expect with parts designed for offroad travel. (I suggested 1kW/kg for wheels, 0.75 for tracks). If you\u0027re using stats for real-world motors, there may be some confusion there - it\u0027s not the power/mass ratio of a motor we need, but the power/mass ratio of a motor\u002Bwheel\u002Bsuspension\u002Bbrake assembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(It\u0027s driveshaft torque for the Tesla, BTW - since the wheels don\u0027t turn at circa 6000 RPM).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock has never had a very clear value of what a unit of EC is worth. At 1EC = 1kJ, a Probodobodyne OKTO2 draws 1800W, as much as an electric bar fire! Between that and the solar values, we might think an EC is about 100J. (That said, solar panels aren\u0027t as absurdly good as your figures suggest - solar energy flux is about 1.3 times higher in space and efficiency is higher (because it\u0027s worth spending a lot of money to have a smaller and less massive solar panel to launch)).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, batteries hold 20 EC/kg, which would correspond then to 2 kJ/kg at 1EC=100J, 20 kJ/kg at 1EC=1kW. A Tesla 85kWh (sigh units) battery, conversely, holds 560kJ/kg! (Lithium thionyl chloride batteries, actually used in aerospace, do better, but it\u0027s not a rechargable chemistry). Battery masses suggest that an EC might be of the order of 30kJ.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAerospace fuel cells provide c. 700 W/kg. A KSP fuel cell array (different chemistry, mind) provides 0.075 EC/s/kg, which would make an EC about 9.3 kJ.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(A SNAP-27 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E as used on the Apollo missions provided about 3.3 W/kg. A PB-NUK provides about 0.1 EC/s/kg, suggesting an EC is about 300J).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(You say \u0022what is 1EC as a stored energy unit, what is 1EC/s as energy flow?\u0022 but of course these are the same question).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a factor of 250 between solar performance and battery performance, it\u0027ll never be possible to pick a \u0022correct\u0022 value; a vehicle that gets realistic endurance on solar power (needs a lot to drive a very light vehicle) will suck its batteries dry in an eyeblink overnight - and a vehicle with realistic endurance on batteries will get absurdly high benefit from solar power. There\u0027s a reason Teslas don\u0027t have solar roofs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this has to be a scalable difficulty setting but the default must be sensible. It might scale from values of 1EC=150J (for realistic performance on solar-powered rovers) to 1EC=30kJ (for realistic battery capacities), and suggest values of 1EC=150J, 1kJ (compatibility with KSPI and realistic performance if you run your vehicle on 1EC=1kJ nuclear reactors from other mods), 10kJ (realistic performance with fuel cells), 30kJ.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 1EC=30kJ, if the overpower is also reduced, a KSP \u0022tiny\u0022 wheel draws 50kW, 1.7 EC/s. (This may seem like a lot, but the tiny wheel isn\u0027t tiny - it weighs 50kg, over 4 times as much as the entire Sojourner rover). Four of them drawing from a Z-4K battery pack will drain it in ten minutes. (This seems short, but that\u0027s going absolutely full power - if a Tesla was running its 85kWh battery pack at a steady 270kW, it would be dry in under twenty minutes.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 1EC=150J, four \u0022tiny\u0022 wheels need 1,333 EC/s, flatly impossible to do on solar. Good - it\u0027s not practical to run a full power motor car on solar. If people pick this setting, they\u0027ll be building very small automated solar-powered rovers, where the square-cube law works to their advantage (the power of Tweakscaled-down wheels will diminish with the cube of linear dimension, but the available top-deck area of solar will only diminish with the square).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I would put the default at the generous end of the scale. People are much less likely to be unpleasantly surprised by parts working too well! (Ideally, I\u0027d like to see it adjustable in-game - sure, people could use it to \u0022cheat\u0022 but they can do that anyway with the debug menu - and it lets the properly hardcore drive different vehicles with \u0022correct\u0022 settings each vehicle).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-11T01:54:59Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2017 01:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by damerell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFix hilarious PB-NUK error\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-09T02:22:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123074-damerell/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022123074\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123074-damerell/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@damerell\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 Excellent write up, as usual.\u00A0 Thanks for the input and sanity check on my all-over-the-place math \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, apparently I am going to have to add in some sort of.... fudge factor.... to handle the input powers to convert them to something sane.\u00A0 Not a huge fan of cheating physics in a physics-central game... but the inconsistencies in stock handling of EC leave no other option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as the current stats on the parts for torque - they were derived from the calculated max-load for the part at default scale and an arbitrarily chosen acceleration at that max load at stall-torque (usually 10m/s/s or ~1g of accel, less on tracks and smaller wheels).\u00A0 As a result many are grossly overpowered for \u0027normal\u0027 use.\u00A0 Certainly room for improvement and a bit more realism in the stats/how they are calculated.\u00A0 I wouldn\u0027t mind basing it off of power density for the motors as a portion of part-mass; but that brings us back to the inconsistencies in EC in stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou point out one of the largest problems I\u0027m going to have trying to get this figured out -- it is impossible to balance the EC use for both battery density and solar-panel power density simultaneously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently I\u0027m going to have to give this a ton more thought and consideration before I can activate the new motor-power code....
