The most important part of the design (other than just straight up being capable) is for it to be reasonably easy to land so I don\u0027t have to retry the landing eighteen times to avoid crashing or wasting excess fuel. I am skilled enough to perform either extended burns or suicide burns, efficient trajectory landings from low orbit, apoapsis sailing, and basic flight adjustments on the fly, but I fly by the seat of my pants--no piloting mods, no MechJeb, no Kerbal Engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve gone through several ideas and one by one I\u0027ve failed to meet my minimum requirements. Here\u0027s a summary of my best creations so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) With LV-N engines, 8000\u002B dV and with a TWR of over 2 when empty. Problem: it seems to not have enough dV due to the very long burn time required to decelerate. It is also just very time consuming to fly, and can\u0027t land very easily until its fuel is too low to take off again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) With a Skipper engine, large fuel section, high TWR and over 5000 dV. Problem: doesn\u0027t seem possible to get enough dV, no matter the TWR, with conventional rockets and single stage, not even if it\u0027s prohibitively large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) With LV-909s and extra drop-tanks, which can be attached at station and dropped off during landing- gets some 7000 dV. Problem: pretty slow to decelerate, runs even lower on fuel than the LV-N design by the time it reaches the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking the extra drop tanks is a good idea because it allows the rocket to gain some of the benefit of a two-stage rocket. Perhaps also I could put engines on the drop tanks to improve TWR during the first stage? I can\u0027t think of a way to get them on such that the fuel tanks can be docked with and the engines will fire in a balanced manner. Let me know what you guys come up with, or just how impossible you think this is!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T07:56:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etry Aerospikes\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T07:59:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot a bad idea, though their TWR is only marginally better than the LV-909 and Isp is the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T08:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eor maybe an 49-7S cluster... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T08:13:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA very large fuel section increases efficiency by greatly shrinking the payload fraction, but the dV gain as you increase fuel percentage comes with a diminishing return.
