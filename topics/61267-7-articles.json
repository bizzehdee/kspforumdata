This allows me to land like a dirt bike, or at least spread the impact over my set of wheels. Once I land I find that it helps calm the bouncing that usually follows. I switch back to Docking for when I have to accelerate again. Update: I found that I could simulate the pitch up effect by placing the center of mass just a little behind center.

Sending the pieces up separately means I can use a much smaller booster set, and can customize the lander and drive module(s) for the mission. I was finally able to do a Jool return this way and hit Layethe and Val while there. I sent the Layethe lander as a separate launch.
