But it\u0027s getting bigger with each update. The same thing has happened with other brilliant mods and some simply have become too big. Not only is size but also in part count. They offer such a wild variety of greebles and doohickies in able to support as many other mods as possible one looses the forest through the trees.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBac9 did an amazing job with B9Aerospace. SuicidalInsanity did and equally great job on his Mk2 Expansion. I liked and used both mods with gusto but both packs have become huge and the amount of parts are mind boggling. KBPS is a mod that lends itself ideally to support other mods. Doing so will introduce very specialized parts that do not serve any other purpose, to many people those parts are just clutter. A player not using life support is probably not interested in carbon scrubbers, food storage and waste disposal. Just like storage containers will be useless for people not using KIS/KAS. What good are kethane or karbonite drills and refineries when you only use the stock resources?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I hope KBPS will become is similar to what was done with Kerbinside. A modular mod consisting or a core and several support packs.
