I should have explicitly mentioned windows 64 bit it seems. Whether I understand that the issues are with unity and the 64 bit windows client would seem irrelevant to my point which is that if blizzys toolbar fails to work for whatever reason it takes a lot of mods down with it and an alternative just makes sense especially as we have a stock implementation now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue still remains that if there are any windows 64 bit issues they are not supported by blizzy and without blizzys toolbar a lot of mods do not have any way to access them or their settings.
