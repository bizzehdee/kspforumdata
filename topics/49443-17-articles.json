I will add them to the SQUID mod today.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I believe it has to do with how much force the suspensions/shock absorbers are designed to handle on the Model 1 and Model 2. At a power level of 10 the model 2 suspension is flatened to the bar. The solution is to either change the squid increments from 10 to 1, so instead of from 0 to 10, 20, 30 it goes from 0 to 1, 2, 3 for the model 2 wheels, or to beef up the suspension which is also available in the .cfg. I would do the former so the wheel behaves the same as a normal wheel when the squid is off. Or as I presently do it to simply have only one wheel squided out of several so that way the squid forced is divided amongs several wheel suspensions. The Model 1 wheel though can handle alot of compression forced, in fact the wheels pop before the suspension flattens out completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the solution to pausing: turn off the squids first, if you hot key the squids it no so bad, got a hot key for on/off all wheels, increase, decrease and pull/push for jumping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-28T18:39:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2014 06:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RuBisCO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kolago","CreatedById":103729,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T20:06:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny problems with 0.23.5 ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JewelShisen","CreatedById":71737,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T20:15:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kolago\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kolago\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny problems with 0.23.5 ?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to the best of my knowledge though i have not tested landing an asteroid with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T02:46:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you did not like the squided wheels?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JewelShisen","CreatedById":71737,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T02:47:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo you did not like the squided wheels?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do!
