I haven\u0027t tried this yet, but I\u0027m guessing the theory is that you could choose to continue running on more engines to keep higher thrust if you needed it, as opposed to dropping a pair of engines too early and ultimately taking \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E delta-v to get somewhere because you\u0027re fighting gravity losses?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, without having tried it, I would think that to optimize it \u003Cem\u003Eeven more\u003C/em\u003E if you\u0027re running into a situation where more thrust is needed at a certain point during the ascent, it would be better to tweak the amount of fuel you have in each asparagus pair. For example, instead of running your extra fuel line to burn an extra couple of seconds before staging, you should instead add a FL-T100 tank to your first stage and subtract one from the following stage. The end result is you\u0027re dropping the dry mass of a FL-T100 tank when you stage, which is not the case in your initial suggested optimization. The downside however would be that it would take more math and/or trial and error to get right, so it\u0027s not as adaptable \u0022in the moment\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-13T00:00:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting.

I disagree, I think it means you should shift fuel from the core stage to earlier stages. My entry to the lightest eve sea level lander challenge had a 7 aerospike asparagus lifter (lv-909 stage on top). The first two engines to drop also had the most fuel above them\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf X engines can lift Y tons, then (X-2) engines can lift (X-2)/X * Y tons. By having the fuel capacity of a stage drop for later stages, the TWR stays more constant. It is true in this case that the core stage ultimately must either be the payload itself, or have a lower TWR, or a very low fuel load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving equally sized fueltanks for each asparagus stage means that as the engine number goes up, the staging comes really really fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1x FL=T800 tank feeds 3 engines a lot longer than it feeds 7 engines, for instance... and to me it seems really wasteful to have these asparagus stages with engines, that burn for really short times. You might as well just have drop tanks... and at the lower stages, the weight of an empty fuel tank is minimal compared to the rest of the fuelled craft. Then factor in the added drag, decoupler mass, etc.. and I figure its more efficient to take that \u0022drop tank\u0022 and stack it on top of another stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can see my asymetric stages here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xZTmWgF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xZTmWgF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe bigger the stages are, the earlier they are in the staging order/ (well there are side drop tanks to be used for deorbit and propulsive landing, not during the ascent)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving a really beefy core stage means your TWR may be much higher than needed at the end of the burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot depends on the mass fraction of the rocket\u0027s payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf 30% of the starting mass is payload, then your core stage should be strong enough to handle that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-13T00:47:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes it\u0027s true, you can distribute the wet mass of the rocket outwards to the boosters if you really want to have a weaker core stage. For special cases like Eve that might even be desirable since you need much more TWR at left off, yet final climb to orbit can still be done with upper stages that have \u0026lt;1 Kerbin TWR. In other words for an Eve rocket the optimum TWR curve has a steeper shape than Kerbin optimum TWR curve.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe fact that asparagus staging rockets jettison the first pair of boosters very early in flight is by design and intended. If you think about it, the rate that the rocket consumes fuel (ie how fast is the rocket becoming lighter) is almost linear relationship with number of engines firing (not exactly, as it\u0027s affected by atm ISP). So at the start of the flight the rocket burns through a vast amount of fuel every second, hence the engines needed to accelerate that fuel becomes rapidly redundant. Towards the end of its flight there are fewer engines so the rate that the rocket lightens is much slower, hence why you hang onto the engines for longer in later stages.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith Kerbin launch vehicles, making the core stage too small has the unfortunate effect of making the core stage shorter. There\u0027s only a finite amount that you can do this before the core stage becomes shorter than the boosters and the resulting \u0022bowl\u0022 shape means there will be form factor limitation on the payload.

This causes a strange drainage pattern, which I find useful and\u00A0I thought I would share it. Each outer tank drains as it would in standard asparagus, and can be dropped as it runs out of fuel just like asparagus. The unique thing, I think, is that the tank remains empty but the engine keeps thrusting.\u00A0\u00A0And the top center big rockomax x200-32 is the last tank to empty, keeping CoM high so less chance of flipping.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T00:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222360832\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129816\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452730895\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156905\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jfischer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, Jfischer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit would start below a twr of 1 by the time I released my second tank\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s your liftoff TWR?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jfischer","CreatedById":156905,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T00:43:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout 1.3 but I hope that will go up when I get better engines.
