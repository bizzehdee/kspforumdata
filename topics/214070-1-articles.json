I made a large rocket and went to save it. It said something about overwriting but it had said that the other times. When I went to load a different ship, It was no longer there. Due to autosaves of the rocket, everything had been overwritten. Not sure if I need to log in w/ my private division account to have more than 5.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Miles1109","CreatedById":227074,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-06T01:01:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisregard.
