In your last log, it seems as though KSP launched using OpenGL, regardless of you not having specified to launch with OpenGL. Switching to OpenGL is usually a fall-back from DX9 not launching correctly. I also noticed that the game is launching using your integrated graphics, not your dedicated graphics. Try disabling your integrated graphics using Windows Device Manager. Before I continue, I take no responsability for any damages to your computer that are caused by my advice or instructions. By following the instructions below, you agree that the responsibility of your device is yours and yours only, and no responsibility is to be placed on me. If these steps are performed incorrectly, or something in your system is configured wrong, your system can become unusable. That said, you should be able to tell if something is up. To open Device Manager, do the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Search for \u0027Device Manager\u0027 in Windows Search, and open it. If prompted for an admin password, or a \u0027Yes/No\u0027 admin prompt, click yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Once device manager is open, you should be greeted with several \u0027tabs\u0027 inside a window with headings such as \u0027Computer\u0027, \u0027Disk drives\u0027, \u0027Display adapters\u0027, etc\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce device manager is open, the \u0027Display Adapters\u0027 tab may already be expanded. If this is the case, then one of your display adapters is in an error state, due to a software/hardware issue (usually software). If this is the case, a full Windows reset will likely be in order to fix the issue. You can tell if your display adapter is in an error state as it will have a yellow triangle beside the icon of the device. If the tab is not expanded, and the display adapter devices have no errors (yellow triangles), you can continue with the following.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Open the display adapters tab and find your integrated graphics. It should be listed under something containing \u0027HD 8750M\u0027 or similar. Right-click on this entry, and select the \u0027disable\u0027 option. When prompted if you do want to disable the device, click \u0027Yes\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, the system should switch to the dedicated graphics. If it does not, then your dedicated graphics has a severe issue. If it does, try launching KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re frightened by all of this, then the TL;DR non-scary version is reset windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BRShooter","CreatedById":47917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T05:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for all your help.
