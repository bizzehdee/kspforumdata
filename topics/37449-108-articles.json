So the process (for me at least) is something like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip full of LS supplies coming in to dock. Yay!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Dock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupply ship becomes part of MunStation X\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources status update on vessel focus.

Instadeath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut from the little I understand about how KSP works, umm... that\u0027s how KSP works, so no blaming the modder or the mod on this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main general issue I see is that while resource consumption is calculated very well, the production of resources (recyled air, etc) is not calculated at all if the vessel is not active. I\u0027m not complaining, far from it, as I read all the information regarding this issue before I downloaded it and so far I like it a lot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you only run one mission at a time and have no stations or surface bases, then the mod works perfectly as intended and there\u0027s no real issue because there\u0027s only one ship to update, which is likely going to be the active vessel. The problem arises when you have multiple long range (say to Eeloo or Laythe) and/or long term (ISS or Munbase) crewed missions. If you focus a vessel which can max time warp, then the mod almost (as you say in the wiki) always tells you when resource y has run out on vessel x but it almost never does this in the tracking station. This is a particularly troublesome issue when you try to align planets for transfer windows. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also point out that I wasn\u0027t specifically referring to the BackgroundProcessing mod, but rather similar functionality relavent to TACLS. The only issue is resource production on out of focus. Nothing else needs touching IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was why I ended up toggling LS off (your assumption about this is correct btw) but doing this essentialy meant not using the mod anymore without extensive editing of the Persisitence file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, I love the mod.

The general power draw is .04 for crewed capsules, I don\u0027t expect the generators to draw much more than that. You\u0027re looking at something like .12 per sec, but don\u0027t take my word for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T14:19:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat are the power requirements of those machines?
