It has been developed not only for performance, but to resolve \u003Cem\u003Eall issues\u003C/em\u003E with consumption/production at high warp speeds. And it worked well.\u00A0One of the thing that were required to make it happen was to have \u0027atomic recipes\u0027 of resource transformation. However order matter, and is not trivial to solve dependencies because there are loops in the resource transformations. Up until now the order of some processes was hard-coded: this worked in most cases, but it was possible to fabricate some problematic sets of producers/consumers that would break it to some extent. That was always a temporary solution, in fact, and the last \u0027hint\u0027 that the time was ripe for me to actually solve the problem came today when, dealing with the new pressurization system (and after my sixth espresso), I realized that hard-coded order was not possible because the correct order is \u003Cem\u003Edynamic \u003C/em\u003Ebased on resource levels, in that specific case. So the actual good news: I found a simple algorithm to deal with order automatically and dynamically. It can digest messy chains like this, and it just work in all cases (tm).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022messy_process.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://s12.postimg.org/6wzek3xst/messy_process.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGood news #2: fast simulation of massive numbers of converters\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one is even more complex to explain. The problem encountered was that, with the new converter-galore, I was simulating a ton of ModuleResourceConverters in background, and there were a ton of them in general. And\u00A0ModuleResourceConverter is not exactly lightweight. It does a lot of things, all of them useless to me. So in a single stroke I found an elegant way to just get rid of it once and forever and to finally scale to huge numbers of converters simulated at once, both on loaded and unloaded vessels. The way it work: there is an hidden pseudo-resource defining the \u0027capability\u0027 of some part to execute a resource conversion. Then, elsewhere, there is a definition of that resource convertion process. Finally there is a token module used to \u0027start/stop\u0027 that process but in reality it just set the flow to true/false (just like that little arrow icon next to a resource indicator). In code then I merely check the amount of the pseudo-resource and run the process at most once per-vessel, irregardless of the number of actual converters the user see. This work transparently for unloaded vessels too.

It has been developed not only for performance, but to resolve \u003Cem\u003Eall issues\u003C/em\u003E with consumption/production at high warp speeds. And it worked well.\u00A0One of the thing that were required to make it happen was to have \u0027atomic recipes\u0027 of resource transformation. However order matter, and is not trivial to solve dependencies because there are loops in the resource transformations. Up until now the order of some processes was hard-coded: this worked in most cases, but it was possible to fabricate some problematic sets of producers/consumers that would break it to some extent. That was always a temporary solution, in fact, and the last \u0027hint\u0027 that the time was ripe for me to actually solve the problem came today when, dealing with the new pressurization system (and after my sixth espresso), I realized that hard-coded order was not possible because the correct order is \u003Cem\u003Edynamic \u003C/em\u003Ebased on resource levels, in that specific case. So the actual good news: I found a simple algorithm to deal with order automatically and dynamically. It can digest messy chains like this, and it just work in all cases (tm).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022messy_process.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://s12.postimg.org/6wzek3xst/messy_process.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGood news #2: fast simulation of massive numbers of converters\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one is even more complex to explain. The problem encountered was that, with the new converter-galore, I was simulating a ton of ModuleResourceConverters in background, and there were a ton of them in general. And\u00A0ModuleResourceConverter is not exactly lightweight. It does a lot of things, all of them useless to me. So in a single stroke I found an elegant way to just get rid of it once and forever and to finally scale to huge numbers of converters simulated at once, both on loaded and unloaded vessels. The way it work: there is an hidden pseudo-resource defining the \u0027capability\u0027 of some part to execute a resource conversion. Then, elsewhere, there is a definition of that resource convertion process. Finally there is a token module used to \u0027start/stop\u0027 that process but in reality it just set the flow to true/false (just like that little arrow icon next to a resource indicator). In code then I merely check the amount of the pseudo-resource and run the process at most once per-vessel, irregardless of the number of actual converters the user see. This work transparently for unloaded vessels too.

So, if you (e.g.) have two Kerbals in a lander can (2 kerbals)\u00A0attached to a Hitchhiker (4 kerbals), the morale rules will assume that each Kerbal has (2\u002B4)/2 = 3 \u0022units\u0022 of room, plus the morale benefits of a Hitchhiker. The more space they have, the less stress they undergo. Fine so far.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith shielding, though, it\u0027s not clear exactly how the different parts \u0022add up\u0022 to provide protection. This can get complicated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s suppose that in the above example, the Lander Can is heavily shielded while the Hitchhiker is not shielded at all. I think the mod applies 1/3 of the shielding of the Lander Can to the radiation coming in, again because the assumption is that they\u0027re moving happily between the parts.
