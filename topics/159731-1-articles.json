But here we are, after a few years, running on the holy Unity 5. *fun note: the people in the threads above didn\u0027t know how Pluto looked like back then*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor those who don\u0027t like opening links, the idea basically suggested the option to, when making a new save, creating randomly generated solar systems (aka random planets and moons in random - not so crazy - orbits). Most of the answers were doubting that the old engine can handle that, and now, this is why I\u0027m here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the current Unity 5, and the extremely amazing mod makers here, is this possible to implement? I understand how hard it\u0027d be, since the random seeds would need a lot of algorithms that\u0027d generate different gravity, atmospheres, orbits, terrain, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember some SQUAD devs talking about this, and how they want the game to be the same universe but different experiences. But the idea is suggesting a MOD (which is always optional) to add that, for people (like me) who enjoy exploring more than anything else and feel like the game is getting repetitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo tell me what you think about this. I think it\u0027d be amazing to have a mod doing that. Yes I know there are many different solar systems here (and that I can make one myself) but having random and infinite possibilities\u00A0would be\u00A0beyond awesome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-25T12:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA slightly more complicated process, but basically what you\u0027re asking for:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/151998-indev-122-to-boldly-go-an-external-application-designed-to-procedurally-generate-an-entire-galaxy-for-ksp/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Martian Music","CreatedById":154849,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-25T14:51:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223033905\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159731\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493123092\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022155685\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DStaal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, DStaal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA slightly more complicated process, but basically what you\u0027re asking for:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/151998-indev-122-to-boldly-go-an-external-application-designed-to-procedurally-generate-an-entire-galaxy-for-ksp/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a pretty cool mod. Although the main idea was to start out with a different solar system. Meaning that Kerbin would (possibly) be the same, but everything outside would be different, randomly generated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the thing with this mod is that it\u0027s still developing, I tried it out and the planets/moons are not unique which isn\u0027t really what I\u0027m asking for. But as I said it\u0027s developing and it\u0027s planned to have unique planets although I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s on the priority list because this mod focuses on other stuff as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo having a mod specifically made to generate different solar systems would be better overall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
