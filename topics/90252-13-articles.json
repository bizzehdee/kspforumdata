Getting a constant direction only requires a consistent reference, the difficulty lies in establishing that reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest/most obvious reference would be the current velocity vector, which works until you travel about 1/5th of the way around the planet and that reference points almost straight up. Essentially, it just shifts the location of the poles and doesn\u0027t really solve the problem. The solution is to create that direction vector on a regular basis wrt to other constants. The candidates for this are fairly obvious, the two vectors perpendicular to the one we actually want and parallel/perpendicular with the surface. The horizontal reference becomes the fixed direction used to align the target at 90 degrees to itself, while the vertical reference is used to maintain the proper forward facing that is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything is calculated as if you are always in a trajectory aligned with the equator (see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egreat circle\u003C/a\u003E).

Flight sims (and real aircraft for that matter) hide all the configuration options because no/minimal tweaks are needed when the vessel is always the same. In addition, the Stability system (what KSP refers to as SAS) is a very low level part of the overall system (similar to how it is in Pilot Assistant. There\u0027s a whole lot of logic before it reaches the raw pitch/bank/yaw control). KSP is the first time I\u0027ve ever seen it used as a complete system outside of some microController programs for very small operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnabling SAS or SSAS while Pilot Assistant is functioning\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilot Assistant will always have the final say on how an axis responds and completely overrides both flavours of SAS when it does so.
