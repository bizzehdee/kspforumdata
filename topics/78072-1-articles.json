Sadly it too suffered the issues that the aircraft I had designed that it had been based off of had. It was prone to tail-strikes and had a far too narrow wheelbase. Since it was a test flight only 1 kerbal flew, but 3 max could have. Joezer Kerman flew the aircraft. The aircraft got to orbit but upon touchdown upon the runway the aircraft flipped onto it\u0027s side and the cockpit was crushed. That was the only flight of that design. R.I.P.
