When the gravity of Minmus pulls you it will pull you \u0022back\u0022 and slow you down some. You can do the opposite if you want to leave Kerbin (though using the Mun for this is more effective).\u003Cp\u003EA picture is worth a thousand words, though, so have a ponder:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/f/f8/Gravity_Assist.svg/180px-Gravity_Assist.svg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022180px-Gravity_Assist.svg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I did that on my kerbed attempt.
