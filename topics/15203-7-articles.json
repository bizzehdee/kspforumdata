Simply creating enemy Kerbals and having them shoot at you is very hard work that would take away from the rest of the game OR make it so expensive nobody buys it. And once you\u0027ve written that basic code, making the \u0022enemy\u0022 shoot at you in a balanced and enjoyable fashion takes a huge amount of work. One of the constant criticisms of RTS games is that the balance is wrong - get it right and the enemy are defeated too quickly and easily, get it wrong and they are impossible to defeat - and the difference can be down to a slight imbalance of units or a slight territorial advantage. And these are \u003Cem\u003Epurpose-built\u003C/em\u003E RTS games, not sims with RTS tacked on!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wrathos","CreatedById":35527,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T21:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould someone post a link to the mods used in this video?
