The mining/processing speed and efficiency could then be affected through different grade processing parts, like Kethane has with Medium and Heavy converters, etc. At the same time, building the rocket in place could take a certain amount of time, and then need to be manually fueled/balanced.

I was just using it as a reference (I didn\u0027t mean to convert it from actual money into parts) to make more complicated components use more parts. Yes, the mass of a component would be logical for consistency, as in you have X tons of parts, this gets converted to X tons of rocket... but I was more thinking game play and how to balance the difference between, say, building a poodle rocket engine and a Nerva, ton for ton.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also recycle, and recycle. True, for recycling back into cash that would be fine, but for recycling back into components at a remote landing pad you\u0027d need to recycle back using a percentage of whatever formula you used to begin with for the pad to build things from parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-03T09:24:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2013 09:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Patupi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T10:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the conversion efficiencies will cover the \u0022costs\u0022 of ore-\u0026gt;metal and metal-\u0026gt;parts, but there\u0027s not really much that can sensibly be done about parts-\u0026gt;ship, other than making the ship building take time (it would be rather interesting (the first few times) to watch parts pop into existence as the ship was built), but even then, putting a ship together from parts would take less time than it takes to make the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"harold1363","CreatedById":66366,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T13:24:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the concept but it need to be able to fold so it can fit inside 3.75 m fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"elfindreams","CreatedById":68362,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T13:51:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt some point I want to do a series of modules for mining/refining/etc...

This would be cheep energy wise but slow to mine since a lot of the material would be re-vented back out and would require ore storage to be attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMicro-Gravity Auger - A shrouded auger that feeds into a chamber where a high-powered laser atomizes the source material... which is then fed into a vacuum condenser separating out the metals from the ore in an extremely efficient rate [venting any non-ore waste], which are then fed into a micro-gravity fabricator that churns out needed parts. This would need /a lot/ of energy to operate and generate a lot of waste heat but would get a near perfect conversion from ore -\u0026gt; metal -\u0026gt; rocket part (I am thinking around a 90%) but would only operate in a limited gravity (the micro-grav fabricators I have seen theorized require it as well as this specific method of \u0022smelting\u0022) It would however be very fast as 3d printing of parts speeds up the rate of production a large amount. It would however by its nature be a single non-splittable stack and probably need at least 4 of the larger stock solar panels worth of energy to operate. Operating this one in the dark would take a lot of batteries and wouldn\u0027t last very long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh-powered Smelter - A liquid smelting system in a large compressed centrifuge that can operate in higher gravity environments. It would be smaller than a conventional industrial smelter but would be expensive and use a fair amount of energy (although not as much as the micro-grav one) it would take ore and convert to metal at a rate that is more around 60-80% (haven\u0027t decided where) and would be fairly slow. The output would be molten metal which could then be fed into a fabricator or stored in specialized tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERobotic Fabricator - Takes the molten metal and fabricates a series of standardized parts (creates robotic parts) and can work in any environment, however it is big and slow and due to the methods used in manufacturing there is a small amount of waste product (~90% conversion from metal -\u0026gt; part)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have a couple of ideas on how the storage stuff should look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just need to sit down and re-learn 3d modeling (it has been a while) and see if I can do the parts justice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T13:59:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eharold1363: The hooligan labs pad flew quite well in FAR, however, I suspect FAR didn\u0027t model it correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hooligan Labs","CreatedById":45359,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T14:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022elfindreams\u0022 data-cite=\u0022elfindreams\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAuger / Micro-Gravity Auger\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be the same part but with the efficiency scaling with gravity.
