The difference would be how you plot your landing zone. Rotating with the planet and you overshoot the LZ a little because you\u0027re compensating for the rotation. Rotating against the planet means that you have to undershoot your LZ. It boils down to personal flight preference. This would only be different if you\u0027re landing on a planet with atmosphere because you would want to overshoot the LZ due to the aerobraking of re-entry. Trying to land back on Kerban rotating against the planet would be difficult if you\u0027re trying to aim at the KSC as being your LZ.
