I went for Duna after seeing that it was perfectly aligned for transfer.

Lozer went out, planted the flag, and wrote down the stuff, which was great. I just needed to get Richfry out to take one last screenshot before returning to orbit... But when Richfry EVAed, he hit the ground and things got weird. Everything disappeared.

I\u0027ve had weird things happen in the game before, but nothing quite like this. All is not lost tho, the mission consisted of 3 ships that were flown on 2 different flights. One carried the crew, the lander, and the return ship, while the other carried 4 mapping satellites that I got on polar orbits around Duna and Ike. I think I might cheat a bit and get the last kerbal down there using the debug menu just to plan a flag to remember this happened \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T05:47:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an unusual bug, but it does happen from time to time when a Kerbal jumps from a ladder onto the ground.
