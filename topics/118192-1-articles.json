The term usually, but not exclusively, refers to reusable vehicles\u0022 (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-stage-to-orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-stage-to-orbit\u003C/a\u003E). It seems pretty clear to me - if it only uses a Single Stage to get To Orbit, it\u0027s a SSTO. Doesn\u0027t even have to come back or be able to do anything once it gets there (although there\u0027s no real point if it isn\u0027t reusable). Doesn\u0027t matter if, having got To Orbit with a Single Stage, it separates, refuels or turns pink and plays Ode To Joy. It\u0027s a SSTO. My whole point is that that design is definitely NOT a Single Stage To Eeloo, which is why I called it SSTO to Eeloo. That\u0027s why misusing the term \u0022SSTO\u0022 all the time is annoying. panzer1b has it right with SSTL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T21:30:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xtoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xtoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBuuuuut, technically, while using only one stage to get to orbit, you\u0027re still launching two stages to orbit, even though you use the 2nd stage once IN orbit...
