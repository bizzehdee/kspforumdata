I grew up in USSR next to a military base which had one of these unplanned explosions of their arsenal back in the late 80s. I got to watch the mushroom from it\u00A0after the pressure wave forced open\u00A0our windows and alerted us to the event. Based on the size of the small lake marking the site and stories from people who served there, it was something in the 20-50T range, most of the energy coming from a stockpile of AA missiles, probably S-300 or similar.\u00A0Trying to find any additional information on the event hasn\u0027t gone anywhere, because the town with the military base was classified at the time, so even though it was early glasnost\u0027 times and a few papers did print that explosion took place, none of them named the place where it happened or any details.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, there were a lot of very concerned people for a while, until word of mouth spread some information about what happened. A lot of people initially thought it was a nuke and, well, no internet. Fortunately, the actual city I lived in is also home to Institute of Combustion and Explosion and a few other research centers. And if you were a theoretical physicist in these years, odds were good that your military training was in artillery or missiles, so the word that it\u0027s definitely not a nuke spread pretty quickly. My father\u0027s military training was in ICBM navigation, so his entire reaction was to take a look, close window, go back to eating food. But a lot of people had to get info from their neighbors, and until then, many assumed it was a nuke. At a guess, the only thing that prevented panic\u00A0is that nobody was quite sure which side\u0027s nuke it would have been. Again, late 80\u0027s USSR. Attitudes were... cynical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yeah, that was much smaller explosion, with a much darker, sootier mushroom, and none of that magic cloud action, and a lot of people still thought it was a nuke. The fact that this was the first thought of many people in Beirut or rest of the world when watching the video\u00A0is not surprising at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-06T03:46:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Dore-munchausen-illustration.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022134.38\u0022 height=\u00221075\u0022 width=\u0022800\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Dore-munchausen-illustration.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(And every time I read your biopics, I get ensured moar and moar).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid they change your classes schedule every time when an unplanned nuke explodes aside?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-06T03:48:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2020 03:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-06T04:08:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223832401\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196122\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221596672470\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arugela\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Arugela said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve posted the actual footage at the beginning of the event.
