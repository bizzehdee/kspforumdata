Re-install\n\n2. Copy in my old save files\n\n3. Start KSP and open old carrier\n\n4. Go to assembly building\n\n5.

Please try copying the installation to a different location -- the Desktop is sometimes a very problematic location for KSP to be run from, so try copying the folder to C:\\KSP or something similar.\n\nOther than that, the other possibilities to eliminate are:\n\n1. You\u0027re missing folders for the SPH and/or VAB to save files into. Ensure that within your save folder there is a Ships folder that should contain the SPH and VAB folders. If not, create any missing folders.\n\n2. The permissions on the folder(s) themselves. Check that you have ownership of the folder and full read/write permissions."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T10:05:45Z","Content":"Are your parts visible? I recently had this happen to me after removing an addon, the editor would not show parts and some text was doubled up.\n\nI fixed it by reinstalling KSP over the top of the existing install, though as you say you are using a new install, you can\u0027t rule out a bad file.\n\nAlso, don\u0027t run KSP from your desktop, it can break the game if KSP is forbidden from writing to the game folder, re-install to a non-Windows folder.\n\nAnd test a new save, if the new save is working the old one may be broken, it may be looking for Mechjeb.\n\nYour log says \u0022Ship file error!\u0022 so I think you may just have one bad craft file, you\u0027ll need to remove them one by one until you find it.\n\nJust before that error there is this \u0022[shipConstruct]: Trying to load cricket - No AvailablePart found for mumech.MJ2.AR202\u0022 so yeah, you are using a moded save on a stock game, you are missing files."},{"CreatedByName":"Joshen","CreatedById":144646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T12:10:17Z","Content":"Moved files to C:\\KSP - no success\n\nTried to check several of the ships to see what have the MechJeb2 on them so i can remove the files, that resulted in one rocket was opened on the old one, so i had 3 rockets open on each other, messy :-) \n\nChecked permissions - cant find any issue there\n\nAll the folders exist \n\nJoshen\n\n\\*Folder Ships\n\n\\*\\* SPH\n\n\\*\\*\\* all created \n\n\\*\\* VAB\n\n\\*\\*\\* all created \n\n\\*Folder Subassemblies\n\n\\*Save files\n\nNow tried removing all saved ships and planes from the structure - no success, still have issues with construction\n\nCan a issue in the save files be the problem?
