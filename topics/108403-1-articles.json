I just wanted to notify the community that KSP received a 9/10 rating from Gamespot. Comparing this to other games, it looks like it got a pretty nice rating, especially because they only rate 1-10.

Kevin Macleod is great but it gets quite boring after a while.\n\nIf you want to try something new and totally different, play the EVE Online soundtrack (available on Soundcloud) in the background. If anyone ever makes a mod that allows us to add custom music to the game, I\u0027m so adding that soundtrack.\n\nIGN is yet to make a \u0022review\u0022 of KSP... I sort of hope they don\u0027t, it\u0027s just painful to watch them screw around with no goal whatsoever. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen a single video of them actually making it to orbit. All they do is throw some random parts together in a way that will result in a structural failure. It\u0027s almost as if they\u0027re completely incapable of playing and/or reviewing a game that requires any sort of planning and knowledge.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T16:49:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainKorhonen**"}]}
