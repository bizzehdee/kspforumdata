installed at any one time, the one in your Steam folder, and you have to fight Steam to keep it at an older version once Squad releases a patch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a lot easier, and also safer, just to have completely different installs.\u00A0 I never play my Steam install anymore, I just keep it pristine stock and fully updated, to be cloned when I want to start a new game or update an ongoing one from the previous version.\u00A0\u00A0Installs elsewhere than in the Steam folder never update so you can play them forever, with their compatible versions of mods.\u00A0 This is handy because each time the game updates, some of the mods you\u0027re using simply don\u0027t survive and the ones that do might take weeks to months before they update and get the resulting bugs ironed out.\u00A0 So while this is going on, you can keep playing your games in the separate install of the older version.\u00A0 Then, when you think the time is right, you can copy the new version of the game from Steam, install the new versions of your mods, and then copy your old save folder into the install for the new version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-12T23:55:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022
