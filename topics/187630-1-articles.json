You spent all that time making a station or ship and getting it into space but it feels hollow and empty the same with colonies you would spent all that time getting the stuff there building a colony just to stare\u00A0at some 3D models to me it feels like an old GTA game where 90% of the buildings you were unable to enter, were unusable or you had to pretend it had a function. Now this is only my opinion but I think its a shame that all the work that go\u0027s into making it almost like a realistic space program where you build and test your creation but can not explore your own creation it kind of brakes the emersion. I also think that internals would make MP more interesting i.e. rather than bolting science experiments to the side of a rocket use compartments inside modules the more experiments you want to run or materials you want to bring the more compartments/modules you will need this intern would lead you to think more about space, weight and design of your ship, station or first colony buildings.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-24T23:05:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2019 11:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Cyborg_delta1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crenelatedcheese","CreatedById":209272,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-15T17:28:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t believe no one replied to this.
