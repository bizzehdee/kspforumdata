I am open to suggestions if you think there are things that I have wrong or should have mentioned. I intend to expand this guide to include procedures for re-entry, rendevous, docking, orbital transition, etc. I have tried to make this as similar as I could to real aviation checklists. It is a PDF file for easy printing. I hope you enjoy! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://sharesend.com/745albj8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sharesend.com/745albj8\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dronkit","CreatedById":67237,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T17:18:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhy 55000? o.o\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T05:39:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECreate a checklist as a wiki article and link it here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorials\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorials\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T06:20:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks very good ... and I second the person who wrote that it should be included in the Wiki \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe could be expanded for chapters regarding Descent and Ground operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Well, O.K., Ground OPs may be too short to deserve an own chapter \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for completeness sake (and as I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m sure that it will be mentioned by another person, if I wouldn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t mention it),\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might point you to a slight spelling error you made in Orbit - 6: Guages instead of Gauges \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
