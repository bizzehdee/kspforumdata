Perfect if they are a part of the city, but not if they are the population center. There would be outlying areas, less population and building-dense areas, etc. What I would offer as a possible solution, if you are using random number generation to determine the height (influenced by the surrounding area, distance from center, etc) would be to add a value for an empty plot of land, or a park, or... you get the idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E So in the center of the city, there would be no chance of this item coming up, but as you move further and further away from city center, the likelihood of single-family homes with larger yards, city parks, fields, etc, becomes more and more possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso one other idea, as you mentioned the idea of farms and \u0022support\u0022 stuff outside of a city.
