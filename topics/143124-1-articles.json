use two heatshields in serial or an 2.5 meter one as the atmosphere get dense fast.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd dafinge says keep \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E low, be liberal with reaction wheels.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor an manned landing and accent craft you use the inflatable heat shield, its very hard to overheat and is lighter than the 3.75 meter one.\u003Cbr\u003E\nhere its an idea to put lots of airbrakes on top of the accent stage, put them on decoplers so you can drop them before takeoff, you might even drop before landing.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain be liberal with the reaction wheels, my eve lander uses two large and 6 medium ones.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI dump them with the heatshield once I\u0027m slowed down the other option would be to land on them but I had an decent stage with deorbit engines and fuel, then an rover and the accent stage so it was best to split up high in the atmosphere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-05T15:25:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s a one-way lander, then that\u0027s simple:\u00A0 \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EKeep the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E as close to the heatshield as possible, so that you don\u0027t flip during the hot part of reentry.\u00A0 Once you\u0027re through the hot part, it doesn\u0027t matter whether you do backflips or whatever.\u00A0 For landing, if it matters whether you\u0027re right-side up, that\u0027s easy-- just put the parachutes on the top of the craft and gravity will take care of things.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027m guessing that you\u0027re talking about a lander that needs to climb back to orbit again.\u00A0 And yes, that can be tricky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason it can be tricky:\u00A0 trying to have your cake and eat it, too.\u00A0 Specifically:\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhich orientation\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E do you want it to be aerodynamically stable in:\u00A0 prograde or retrograde?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the paradox that a lot of people get caught by:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Elanding\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E, many folks want the craft to be \u003Cstrong\u003Eretrograde-stable\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 People tend to put the heat shield beneath the craft, so it needs to stay pointed in the travel direction.\u00A0 Also, when you\u0027re landing, you need to land right-side-up so that you can take off again.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eascending\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, you need the craft to be \u003Cstrong\u003Eprograde-stable\u003C/strong\u003E, for obvious reasons.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it\u0027s really hard to have it both ways.\u00A0 So, what can you do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are different approaches, but my personal favorite is, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edon\u0027t even try to have it both ways\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Design the craft so that it\u0027s prograde-stable, period.\u00A0 It enters atmosphere nose-first, and it also leaves nose-first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy typical Eve lander looks like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nHeat shield on the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efront\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of the ship.\u00A0 I like to use the inflatable, since it\u0027s easy to launch off Kerbin, and then when inflated is plenty big enough to protect my whole ship.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPut some hefty fins on the back of the ship, for aerodynamic stability.\u00A0 For example, a quartet of delta wings, with ailerons.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAs much as possible, try to keep the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E high, close to the front end of the ship.\u00A0 However, given the squat nature of the typical lander, this may be of limited practicality.\u00A0 I don\u0027t worry too much about this-- as long as I\u0027ve got big fins on the back, that tends to take care of the aero stability.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEnter Eve\u0027s atmosphere nose-first, and stay that way all through the \u0022hot\u0022 part of reentry.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe next challenge is to get tail-first for landing.\u00A0 This is what parachutes are for.\u00A0 I have parachutes at the top (front) end of the ship.\u00A0 When I pop the chutes, this changes the ship from being prograde-stable to retrograde-stable.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe one tricky bit is ditching the inflatable shield.\u00A0 I typically do that during the unstable transition phase when the ship is tumbling a bit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLand with the parachutes, tail-first.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAfter landing, blow the chutes (I\u0027ve got them all mounted on radial decouplers)-- no point in hauling all that heavy, draggy stuff back to orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen it\u0027s time to take off, just point nose at the sky and go.\u00A0 The fins at the back of the ship keep it pointed the right way.\u00A0 Keeping \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E forwards is important here.\u00A0 There are various strategies for this; one way to help do that is to use vertical stacks of asparagus tanks, and hook up fuel ducts in a way that tends to drain the bottom tanks before the top ones.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHaving steerable fins, and sticking strictly to straight-up prograde for the first 20 km or so of the ascent, helps to avoid flipping.\u00A0 Also, during ascent, be careful not to go too fast.\u00A0 You want to be sticking close to terminal velocity all the way up.\u00A0 The hard part is having an idea of what your terminal velocity is... but that\u0027s what F5 is for.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022
