I do not use NEAR, I use Ferram. I have tried uninstalling it and it still doesnt work. In fact I have no mods in common with Lord_Potato, but I do use the latest version of KSP x64. All the mods I use are compatible with 0.25, I do get my firespitter plugin flagged, but it has always gotten flagged. It can\u0027t be the aerodynamics mods though since both of us run separate ones and experience the same issue. It isnt a parts mod because it is happening with all control surfaces not just modded ones. I am running out of ideas though and I have verified through steam that all KSP files are present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I actually unistalled B9 Aerospace not Ferram, upon uninstalling Ferram control surfaces worked again.
