Lots of smart cookies discussing useful concepts there.... also they often post pictures of their craft which can serve as great inspiration.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally I just note, a good piece of advice I can give is design you craft from the end of the mission to the start. What I mean by this is don\u0026#39;t think Step 1, getting to orbit, step two transfer burn... etc. Step one should be (for a manned or returning craft) how do I get it to the ground safely, Step 2, how do deorbit it. Step 3 how to I get back into orbit around Kerbin.... etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy travels!!\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T23:24:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 11:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tourist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MAFman","CreatedById":101780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T23:48:28Z","Content":"\n*waves hand* Hi, Giocomo!
