It takes several seconds to load a simple flag! It\u0027s not the Virtual NW Adapter issue either, the only NW adapter I have in my NW and sharing center is my LAN Connection. I also checked whether I have any hidden adapters, but couldn\u0027t find any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I thought it was caused by one of my 60\u002B mods, but even after completely removing and re-installing KSP the issue persists. Before yesterday, KSP loaded with over 60 mods in about a minute. I run KSP from an SSD, so the HD should not be the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas what could cause this? And more importantly how I get rid of that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is highly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T18:00:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Zoidos, do you have Hamachi installed?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zoidos","CreatedById":133853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T18:04:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi sal_vager,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, at least not to my knowledge and not according to the Windows Search function. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks exactly like the unused NW Adapter bug, but I have no networks apart from my LAN connection.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T18:08:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could test disabling the LAN, it\u0027s hardly a proper fix but it\u0027d help diagnose what\u0027s causing this, also if you updated anything since yesterday I\u0027d try rolling it back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zoidos","CreatedById":133853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T18:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis solved it (instantly).
