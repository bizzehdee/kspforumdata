And I love 0.22 and I really like the science / career mode. My only gripe so far, and I can\u0027t work out if this is just me or if it actually detracts from the experience, is that I can build suborbital and LKO craft quickly (ie first couple of tiers) that can lift goo pods but I can\u0027t really build a believable reentry vehicle that can bring them back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CP Mk1 with a \u0027chute looks and feels right but clamp a goo pod to the back and it looks daft. Ditto if you build a lander / service module type thing which you reenter retrograde on the engine bell... looks wrong. I would be tempted to try and return samples separately except we can\u0027t.(yet?) Is this just me or have other people thought this? And am I destined to have to radio in the results and jettison my science pods to burn up my glorious science points in exchange for an honest(ish) landing? I\u0027ve faked heat shields with fairings in sandbox, but that isn\u0027t going to fly in career!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh the choices!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXL\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T17:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, there\u0027s no re-entry heat in the stock game as of yet, but there is the deadly re-entry addon until then, so feel free to try it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure that when Squad add re-entry heating there will be options for protecting our craft and our experiments from harm, from thermal tiles for our pods and space shuttles to high temperature capable science return cannisters \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"macegee","CreatedById":38721,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T18:40:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I feel you. And I\u0027ve got something to add to this. Compare how transmitters and experiment containers work - you can\u0027t close the latter (casings) without destroying results, if I understand it correctly. But you can deploy/undeploy transmitters. So when you\u0027re trying to re enter with your experiment results, all of them have to be opened. And it looks silly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I love \u0022more realism\u0022 mods out there. Tried Deadly Reentry some time ago, but then thought that reentry heat doesn\u0027t change anything much since you don\u0027t even have to return anything back. I try not to use too much addons for compatibility and stability reasons, so I decided to stop using Deadly Reentry pretty quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now when we gain more by actually returning stuff from space, reentry heat seems an important aspect and I\u0027m thinking about getting DR asap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, I don\u0027t really feel that reentry heat is a good idea to have without proper atmospheric drag model. If you know how reentry is actually done IRL, you would understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo uhm.. yeah.. I can relate to this problem. Oh, yeah, payload fairings.. Those are lacking too of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T18:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can add the science parts\u0027 doors to an action group.
