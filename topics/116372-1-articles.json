While not much can be done about that, the dust raised by rocket landings and such is an issue and concern, because the Apollo landing sites (and others) are of \u0027historical/heritage\u0027 value. The concern is such that NASA has drawn up guidelines for preservation, as [outlined here](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/617743main_NASA-USG_LUNAR_HISTORIC_SITES_RevA-508.pdf)... no-fly / no-go zones."}]}
