To make things more easy I set it up to first seperate the lower stage from my flipped bi-coupler and then the bi-coupler itself.

Like when you try to attach a tank to two radial decouplers it\u0027ll only attach to one, it\u0027s because it can codewise only be attached to one thing. So the bi-coupler is in reality only connected to one of the tanks/engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich leads to engines clusters, there\u0027s various ways to do it, I\u0027ve used the cubic octagonal strut, set to symmetry mode (as many engines as you wanna have) and free (not click to angle), put them on the underside of your tank/ship, then rotate them up into the tank. sometimes the top of the framework/strut is visible, sometimes not, but the connection points will show up when you go to attach engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo connect the cluster to a stage below you\u0027ll need an engine or strut/item in the middle of the tank to connect your decoupler to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joe_Bender","CreatedById":60838,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T11:31:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMay I suggest you look up \u0027asparagus\u0027 staging?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be more effective if you put boosters on the main tank that you jettison as they empty instead of trying to duel-prop your second stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do a tri-tank, just use the tricoupler and strut the heck of the tanks down at the bottom......unless you are launching a really heavy payload, three large orange tanks is just a little bit of overkill and youre just launching fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T12:30:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Joe_Bender\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Joe_Bender\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eunless you are launching a really heavy payload, three large orange tanks is just a little bit of overkill and youre just launching fuel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am still new - but already in love - to this game.
