Most parts waggle. The parts they are explodet are wings."},{"CreatedByName":"socket7","CreatedById":3956,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T17:44:46Z","Content":"The Rocket ASAS has a bad habbit of using full deflection and slamming the control surfaces and gimbals back and forth rapidly to maintain a a straight trajectory.\n\nIf your space plane is using a rocket ASAS, the resonant wobble from it can easily tear the ship apart at 2x in some situations. \n\nYou\\\u0027ve got 2 options. You can use the space plane avionics package, which acts much the same as ASAS, only you can actually steer the plane while it\\\u0027s on and it doesn\\\u0027t do that wobble thing. \n\nThe second option is to use a lot more struts until things stop shaking off your plane ;D\n\nEDIT: just looked at your craft. You need more struts holding the front engines to the hull, and the rear wings to the front hull as well. (you can see the hull section the rear wing is attached to is sliding about on it\\\u0027s collider like it\\\u0027s about to fail) \n\nIf you add some struts I think it will get rid of your problems."},{"CreatedByName":"socket7","CreatedById":3956,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T20:58:52Z","Content":"Try this craft file instead! It\\\u0027s your craft, with a few more struts on it.

If it turns out to be a bug after all I will happily move it back to the dev section and wear a dunce cap for a week.
