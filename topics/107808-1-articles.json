Like, when i press and hold A, the angle in a control surface increases? I hear you say: \u0022don\u0027t they do that already?\u0022 Well, what i intend for, is to be able to use my pedals to slightly increase the angle on one side of the plane in a gradual way, with 2 control surfaces extending in opposite directions........ much like a B-2 or the decelerons of an A-10..... get where i am going \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Currently, the only thing control surfaces can do in action groups 1-10 is be normal or toggle all the way, so any insights/ideas would be welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T04:03:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIve managed to create quite a few flying wings though use of clipped control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther then that, its very very tough, you might be able to take advantage of airbrakes such as the way a HO-229 worked, but aside from this, without clipped control surfaces your options are minimal. As for axis binds, you can bind normal axis to stuff liek picth, yaw, roll, ect. Now sure if you can specify a control surface to a certain axis only, at least not without mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hiddengnome","CreatedById":33678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T16:33:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood suggestions, but i want to eliminate any vertical control surfaces or using torque from a Sas-wheel, ah well, guess i can always learn to code.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hiddengnome","CreatedById":33678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T18:37:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: i found out that it is possible in stock to do it, with the airbrakes as they had.......dun dun dun... a yaw button, they just act a little sluggish, but that means i don\u0027t have to break my head on learning C# anymore \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
