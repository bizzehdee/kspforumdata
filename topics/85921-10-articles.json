For example, mercury is small and the orbit is fairly eccentric, but then it\u0027s neighborhood is devoid of small bodies (due to tidal forces of Sun, radiation pressure, maybe other things). Earth and Venus goes the same, Mars seems to have nearly no neighbors. Pluto, instead, have fairly many similar bodies in similar orbits - hence why there would be too many if Pluto has to be a planet. The same went for Ceres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy own opinion (and interpretation), but maybe we should start to draw the borderline. Does the mass of stable scattered things (ie. asteroids, comets, etc.) becomes larger the farther they are from the Sun ? Are there any average trends ?
