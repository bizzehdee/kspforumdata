While trying to put things in orbit I noticed when I hit escape to leave my space in orbit the game wouldn\u0027t allow me to go back to the space station, only exit the flight. The Space Station button was grayed out. So I went to check and make sure I had my throttle off and sas and rsi (whatever the acronym) where off, when I unpaused the game my engines throttled up on their own. So I back the throttle down and tried to go back to the space station and again and it was still grayed out and when I hit escape to unpause it throttled the engine back up again. WTF! So then I had to exit the flight as it was my only option, checked my key bindings to make sure there wasn\u0027t and issue there and restarted the game. Sent up another space station and boom does the exact same thing. I\u0027m about to rage on this game. Am I doing something wrong or is this a known bug? Checked the fourms and can\u0027t find anything on it. I checked the game integrity and there wasn\u0027t an issue, so now I\u0027m reinstalling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sovek","CreatedById":57251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T03:41:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis MechJeb or something similar onboard?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T03:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have a joystick installed?
