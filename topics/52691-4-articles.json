On planets with atmosphere, the air-resistance is going to eliminate whatever difference in surface speed that resulted from prograde/retrograde orbits. P.S., I\u0027m pretty sure atmosphere rotates with the planet, otherwise reentering Kerbin with parachute will give you a surface velocity of 174 m/s (the sidereal rotation velocity of Kerbin) if the atmosphere don\u0027t rotate with the planet. In short, prograde/retrograde rotation shouldn\u0027t matter if your goal is to land on atmospheric planet (it might matter if, say, thermal damage is modeled, the difference of about 340 m/s on Kerbin might be the difference between your spacecraft entering atmosphere successfully or blowing up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s look at planets without atmosphere and has a fairly high sidereal velocity, Dres, and Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres has a sidereal velocity of about 25 m/s, which translate to a delta-V difference of 50 m/s between prograde/retrograde.

Let\u0027s take a simple example and start with an orbital speed of zero, in which the ship immediately begins to fall straight down. As it does so, the world will be seen to rotate beneath it, and when the ship reaches the surface, it will find the ground moving past it in the direction of the planet\u0027s rotation, and the ship will need to expend delta-V to match that speed in order to come to rest with a speed of zero with respect to the planet\u0027s surface. Matching surface speed and eliminating orbital velocity are two separate issues, though in some conditions the difference in magnitude is minimal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that when you think this through, you are unconsciously using a rotational frame of reference when you consider the orbit, and then switching to a stationary frame of reference (with respect to the world) when you consider the landing, without carrying over the velocity from one frame of reference to the other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAnd under my moderator hat: \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you folks for keeping this discussion civil despite the heat of disagreement, and please continue to do so. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-11T19:16:23Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2013 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T18:59:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know this forum\u0027s policy on reaction images but I FEEL LIKE I\u0027M TAKING CRAZY PILLS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re going 100 mph and landing on something going 50 mph you need to slow down 50 mph.

This means that their Velocities to the ground in both cases are equal. That means that they both have to decelerate the same amount in order to land. That gives us the wonderful conclusion that a craft will consume the same amount of fuel to decelerate the same velocity to ground in both cases because again V = GT\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. Just....
