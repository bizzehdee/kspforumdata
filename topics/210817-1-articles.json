I don\u0027t know how many kerbals require one ring, but maybe the number of artificial gravity spots depends on the number of kerbals. Why not add rings of different diameters\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso why not add other centrifuges besides rings for variety, different number of kerbals and with different characteristics. These could be discs, dwelling blocks on either side of the beam, and so on. That way you\u0027d have an easier time choosing the right part just for your ship\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhysics:\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe all know that a centrifuge will have a kinetic momentum as it rotates. But since the system is closed and the total kinetic momentum must be conserved, the rest of the ship will rotate in the opposite direction, which will be uncomfortable. In addition to the centrifuge, it will be necessary to put more parts to compensate its rotation\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the first thing that comes to mind is the gyroscopic effect\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/osuniversityphysics/chapter/11-3-precession-of-a-gyroscope/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/osuniversityphysics/chapter/11-3-precession-of-a-gyroscope/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have compensated the centrifuge as I described above, this effect will not appear. But this effect is very important\u003Cbr\u003E\nI suggest that all these effects will be different because of different angular momentums of different centrifuges. So angular momentumsof disks, beams, rings will be different\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wish that all these points were taken into account in the KSP2 and the physics would be more realistic and truthful\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-26T23:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simplest solution is to rotate the entire station and docking craft approach on the axis and roll to match the rotation, ala the\u00A0 station in 2001 Space Odyssey.\u00A0 \u00A0Yes there are tradeoffs.\u00A0 Solar panel alignment is problematic if all rotates unless cost to orbit is low enough that you just have more panels with some always in sunlight during rotation.\u00A0 If the panels are also radiators then same principle.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"intelliCom","CreatedById":209738,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-27T00:56:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224203083\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210817\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221669504091\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darthgently\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, darthgently said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simplest solution is to rotate the entire station and docking craft approach on the axis and roll to match the rotation, ala the\u00A0 station in 2001 Space Odyssey\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably also the most realistic solution.
