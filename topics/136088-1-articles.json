I went to delete it, but then I thought \u0022Hmm... I wonder what I was doing?\u0022, seeing as I hadn\u0027t played on it (that version) in forever. So I transferred it over to the computer I use now, and imagine my surprise when it contains over a dozen saves, some stretching back to I think version .22 . I was apparently pretty ambitious, with saves called Asteroid Base, International Kerbal Space Station, Mission to Jool, and World War Kerbal. I took a trip through nostalgia lane, looking at crafts on saves that hadn\u0027t seen the light of day in close to 2 years. I\u0027m looking at these crafts, and suddenly, I feel like finally going onto KSP and finishing all the missions I abandoned halfway through or never even started.\u00A0 I took a couple of screenshots to share with the rest of you. I could be pretty creative when I tried. Keep in mind that this all really old and that I wasn\u0027t very good at designing things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1st I have an artillery piece that was pretty cool.

Which it can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA station that I know went to Jool at some point or other, but seems to have disappeared.

As far as I can tell that was the first save I ever made. I had a ship on almost every planet, and I realized, I hadn\u0027t ever gone to most of these planets without cheating. Out of the dozens of vessels on that save, I think only 4 of them at most were sent without cheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EI looked through the screenshots and found the oldest one I had.
