When I tried to change tactics and apply 6 S engines the upper stack would not snap to center even when Snap was disabled. After this I attempted to utilize fairings, but the fairings have to be applied in a overly specific way and would break the rocket on liftoff\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me know if I can provide more details. some of this could be a symptom of being new to the series, I\u0027m happy to admit that but this is an incredibly cumbersome process and makes me feel like I wasted an hour and a half of my time and the only thing I got from it was frustration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
