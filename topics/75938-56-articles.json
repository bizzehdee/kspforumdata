I copied the coordinates for the attach node and put them on a second node defined as a stack node. I then changed the attachment rules to allow it to be stack-attached and initial tests are very positive. So, in the most basic terms, the part now has a stack node in the same position and orientation as the attach node so it can be attached to those rover-wheel nodes in the same way that it would be surface-attached when no nodes are present.

For instance, the side-mounted repulsors have the center of their surface and stack nodes set a little higher than the center of the area of the model that would be expected to be the attachment spot. I don\u0027t know how that would affect the attachment of the part though, just an observation. It\u0027s a little like some of the bobcat wheels and landing legs. Those things were huge and looked awesome if you\u0027re going for \u0022nuttier than modern sci-fi\u0022 but their attachment nodes were in such a horrible position that trying to surface attach them to your craft was a huge pain. The attach node was at the center of that side of the model, but the modeled part that \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be the attachment point on the hull was 10 feet above it. I tried adjusting those nodes in the past, but it was a real pain without knowing what the scale was. I\u0027ll experiment a bit more if I get the chance. As it is, the stack node hasn\u0027t interfered with the placement of the parts unless a stack node in the same orientation was placed on the part I was attaching to, and sicne most stack nodes will be aligned with the... uhh... stack, well... I see little chance for anything out of whack to happen. Still, might have to add compatibility for a toggler anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and the node size is up for debate.

Especially baffling is the fact that the textures being messed with are internal KSP textures, loaded from shared asset files, and already in a DDS format.

The idea is, when deployed, they will telescope until they hit the ground, then stop. Tweak their individual height to your hearts content, then lock them into collective movement mode so you can slowly and controllably raise and lower your craft/pod/habitat/whatever without it tipping over. Classic landing legs don\u0027t really work on an incline or uneven ground, so this is my attempt at a solution, and something to allow the pods to be loaded/unloaded on and off the rover chassis in flight. A few visual tricks I\u0027ve picked up while working on the tracks will come into play too, so should end up being something quite unique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYES!
