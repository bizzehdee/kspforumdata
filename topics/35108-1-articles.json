Under one government and one flag, the Kerban\u0027s have conquered the atrocities there home planet. From hunger, war, environmental damage, Kerbals only have one place to look to, the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder the \u0022Make Things Go Boom Boom\u0022 law, the UKG (United Kerbal Government) has decided to create the Kerbal Space Agency (KSA), with the KSA\u0027s goal to increase a Kerbal presence in space, conduct science, and seeing how many boosters you can fit on one rocket. Sadly, the UKG does not have a lot of money to spare, so it is looking to members of the Kerban nations (aka you guys).\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t know whether to put this under missions reports or fan works, but I figured it would work best here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince career mode isn\u0027t out yet, I figured i\u0027d try to make a game that I and you guys could play, so here we go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSA needs funding, and you guys provide it. To play the game, all you have to do is say, I wanna play. You will be given 3,000 kbucks (KB) and the you bank account info will be kept on this page. What you will do is submit mission reports, fund them by yourself or collaboration with forum members from your bank (as the missions get bigger and complex that will be required). Or if forum members see a mission they want to contribute to they can. With the fund given, I will attempt to carry out these missions (in the game), less funds=higher chance of failure, more funds=higher chance of success. Each mission has a prize. If the mission is successful, you get the percentage of the prize money that you contributed (aka you were responsible for 50% of the funding, you get 50% of the prize). If the mission fails, you lose all the money you contributed. For the missions you propose, I will determine the award amount. When the mission is finished, ill write up a mission report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow a tip, you should follow the natural progression of a space program. No testing will be done, so I would recommend starting off with something like a sub orbital satellite and going from there. But in the end, its your KB, if yall go broke pushing me, well sorry \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo any interest, questions, am I making sense (its 3 in the morning when I write this). I think it would be fun, not only do I get missions and money (like a career mode haha) but you get to decide what I do, while figuring out what to fund. Keep in mind if I do go through with this, I may change the rules slightly in the name of fairness, so don\u0027t get pissy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso Mods I have Installed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eremotetech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrdan Telescopes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMapsat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan on using all of them since Remotetech add need for satellite and Ordan/Mapsat gives science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlayers:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1:ninjakids 3,000 KB\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-28T17:18:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2013 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Rocketman1994\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ninjakids","CreatedById":70896,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T13:30:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI want to join this game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocketman1994","CreatedById":66335,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T17:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESweet, since we have one player you can start whenever you want and give me a mission report (try to make it somewhat detailed if you could).
