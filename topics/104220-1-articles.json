I do think that it\u0027s polite if you want to be heard to consolidate your feedback. A simple poll should help the devs (if they are interested) in canvasing the user feedback without having to paw through a 20\u002B page thread. I hope that if this is not helpful it\u0027s at least not impolite."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T00:54:00Z","Content":"People realy should look at the suggestions board more often lol\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115621-Do-you-think-Squad-should-leave-the-Round8-Toroidal-Tank-alone](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115621-Do-you-think-Squad-should-leave-the-Round8-Toroidal-Tank-alone)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T00:54:23Z","Content":"INB4LOCK\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115621-Do-you-think-Squad-should-leave-the-Round8-Toroidal-Tank-alone](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115621-Do-you-think-Squad-should-leave-the-Round8-Toroidal-Tank-alone)\n\nETA: Ooooo, double Ninjas.\n\nETA: Erm...one of them disappeared?"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T00:55:55Z","Content":"This may get locked.\n\nanyway i vote to keep it the sqme because otherwise my Apollo LEM replica would only have 600m/s DeltaV instead of the 3km/s it has right now."},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T01:18:26Z","Content":"Badly worded questions in this poll.
