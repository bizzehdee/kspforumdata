Looking at some posts and this seems to have been an issue over a year ago but not now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running the most recent version of KSP as updated by Steam. Is there some config or settings file that I need to delete and recreate to iron out some old data? \u00A0I remember needing to do something similar after another hiatus where my maneuver nodes were missing until I deleted and recreated a file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBarring that I\u0027m using the same old design I\u0027ve always used. \u00A0Science pod with some Goo containers. A heat shield glued to the bottom and the command pod glued to the top with a droge chute and big boy chute. My re-entry is fairly shallow and nothing is burning up due to heat. \u00A0Is there a new design out there that I should be using?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-06T19:22:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect that you are running into a small drag issue in 1.1.

At least if I understand Octanis\u0027 description right. I rather think he has too little drag at the top and too little weight down below - the service bay is so light that the center of mass (dominated by the pod) is moved away from the heatshield too much for the vessel to be aerodynamically stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T08:14:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the drogues are below his CoG, that would cause him to flip.\u00A0 I\u0027m wondering if he didn\u0027t put them on the sides of the service bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T12:11:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you reenter on Kerbin, try to ditch everything. You should only have the pod with chutes and a heatshield (if interplanetary). Nearly all science experiment are cheap, don\u0027t bother bringing them back. Just EVA and collect all the data then ditch everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, a MK1-2 pod need only 3 radial chutes (or 1 big nose one) for reentry. Even returning from Duna you don\u0027t need heatshield. Dump every thing after setting your PE around 30/32km. That won\u0027t flip. The internal battery is enough to keep the pod steady at high altitude and is not needed at middle/low altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve or Laythe reentry is a totally different story as you need to land a complete/complex ship. Multiple testing is mandatory, especially for Eve...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T01:22:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started a new career playthrough in 1.1 and noticed a \u0022structural fuselage*\u0022 (.1ton empty mk1 cylinder) on the list. \u00A0It has been critical in adding additional aerodynamic \u0022length\u0022 to a craft so the center of mass can be lower. \u00A0Other than that I\u0027d just say put the drogue chutes higher (they unlock earlier, so are hard to pass up) and hope the bugs don\u0027t bite too hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* comes in \u0022general construction\u0022. \u00A0You probably want struts, mk1 passenger cabin, and launch clamps. \u00A0The structural fuselage is thrown in as a package deal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T13:33:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Warzouz says, the easiest way is to dump everything except the capsule, the conical capsules are then very stable and robust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the early game I tend to not to try and land anything other than a capsule, but once I start wanting to take passengers up one thing I found worked well was to put a service bay on the top of the stack, they\u0027re light but cylindrical so move the aerodynamic centre up more than they move the centre of mass.\u00A0 I\u0027m not 100% sure if drag of the doors is calculated correctly but in theory leaving the doors open should increase drag at the top of the stack and improve stability even further.\u00A0 Parachutes work fine from inside the service bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
