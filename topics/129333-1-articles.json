The main reason for the move was that Mercury and the first few Gemini flights were very short duration. They could easily be completed by a single shift of controllers. After that the flights got much more complex and required many more people so a larger facility was needed.\u00A0 The Cape still had all the facilities needed for providing support for a launch so they retained control of that, but switched control to the larger facility at Houston shortly after lift off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ten Key","CreatedById":123319,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T20:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCape Canaveral was (and still is) an\u00A0Air Force base, so some of the reason might have been tied up in the \u0022military vs civilian\u0022 dynamic.

LBJ was unimportant when the decision was made to move to Houston (in 1961, before Kennedy was shot; Kennedy and LBJ didn\u0027t get along at all well, and his influence was low at the time). There was some thought given to political considerations involving Albert Thomas, who was a Congressman from the Houston area\u00A0who also happened to be chairman of the subcommittee responsible for NASA\u0027s budget, but the leading contender for the human spaceflight center (and therefore Mission Control) just before the actual decision was made was MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, with Houston coming in number two and a location in the San Francisco Bay area number three. However, moving to MacDill was predicated on the Strategic Air Command moving out of the base, and when they decided not to at the last minute, Houston became the number one contender and was subsequently chosen. Mission Control was moved once the facilities were ready, which took several more years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, it\u0027s really a pretty boring story.

There are good reasons for this choice, Houston is located near a ship channel and a new one was recently built near bayport. The chemical industry is very strong between Texas city and Baytown. You have in Houston: Rice university, University of Houston, couple of other private universities, Texas Medical Center, UTMB in galveston, Texas A\u0026amp;M moody campus down in Galveston ....so there are lots of local nearby universities to collaborate with. Housing was relatively cheap in the area, though many of the houses built around NASA at that time have foundation problems and are basically worthless now. There is still space to expand housing around NASA. Recreational activities are water sports and fishing on Galveston bay, the Island(cough). 8 hours travel time to New Orleans, 4 hours to San Antonio, 3.5 to Austin, 5 hours to Corpus, 7 hours to Mexico, South Padre Island . . Right next to NASA is the Kemah boardwalk. There is also Ellington field, about 7 miles away hobby airport, and another 30 miles to IAH.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
