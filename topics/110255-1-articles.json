I am a hardlined PC Gamer from Boulder CO. I get a fair share of outdoors, dosed with countless hours in front of my LCD Gods. I go fish for an hour come play KSP for 10. lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently picked up KSP after following it and wishlisting it for some time. I must say, this game is beyond anything I expected or have gotten from a game in a number of years (and my steam library is over 200). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe community is great (modders and not), the Devs are on point.
