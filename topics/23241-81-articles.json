About 25 KM, 1100-1300 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI heard that others managed to get their craft up to 40km high, but my crafts simply can\u0027t go fast enough at an altitude above 25 KM, because i have a paranoidal strong feeling of a flameout, and that\u0027s the very reason why i tune my engines down just a little bit and in about a minute my plane can\u0027t climb really well and tends to go a bit sideways and tip down untill it has enough lift and speed. That\u0027s about the time when i switch the engine mode, and end up at an apoapsis of 72-91 km, with the trajectory ark hugging about half of the kerbin AT BEST. Also i always have quite a lot of jet fuel to spare. I really need some help and advice about proportions of rocket/jet fuel per sabre, or any other advices. Maybe for such a rookies as me would be more effective using 2 engine types? Also, a little note: designing a cargo plane, the size is quite good. About as half as Strugatsky, maybe wings a bit shorter, and all in all a bit shorter. The goal is carry at least 1 jumbo tank into orbit. Quite successfully climbs throughout the atmosphere with a jumbo(36 tons) in it\u0027s belly untill 25-26 km, but getting into the orbit is the problem... It is armed with 4 Sabre-M\u0027s, and 2 additional jet engines which i added in my desperate quest for TEH SPESS. Also, it can\u0027t lift off earlier than the runway\u0027s end.
