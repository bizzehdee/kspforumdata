I\\\u0027m increasing my stock of modelled engines from 1 to 2. Here\\\u0027s the problem: I basically have it almost the same as the RD-180 engine... With a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s meant as a first stage, which generally means a gimbaling engine is needed to maintain control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set the gimbal amount to 30 degrees just so I can see if my obj_gimbal works properly... Alas, it does not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some screenshots;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8159/7660565062_dcb589e1c1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227660565062_dcb589e1c1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7132/7660565186_e11a7081bb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227660565186_e11a7081bb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may not be obvious in the first picture, but it definitely can be seen in the second. Clearly, my pivot point for the engine nozzle is not set properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s how I made them nozzles (With Cheetah3D)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Join the gap between the 2 cones\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Copy \u002B Paste whole thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s where I named them BOTH obj_gimbal; In game however, only one of them was actually gimbaling... So I\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Dragged one of the nozzles on the other one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Tools \u0026gt; Import Children\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Double clicked on the PolygonObject model (Effectively joining the meshes of the 2 objects)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow both engine nozzles are one object, obj_gimbal. In-game, you see what happens... Is there a way to change the pivot or centre point of the object, either in C3D or Unity3D?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: It just came to my mind; independent gimbaling engine nozzles could possibly mean controlling roll with 2 or more nozzles...
