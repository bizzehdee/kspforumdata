MechJeb has been nothing but a pure perfectionist since 2.1. At least on my end... I\u0027ve come to trust him with my ship entirely when docking/rendezvousing. It\u0027s been so good that I tend to just leave it on for longer manoeuvres. By the time I have my tea (earl grey, hot) MechJeb\u0027s usually done with docking and I\u0027m like... \u0022Oh wow... That was fast...\u0022\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I was having was due to the fact I was trying to make two extendible berthing ports kiss... You might imagine their reluctance, both being... Um... Erect... Exchanged the one on the shuttle with a normal berthing port and we\u0027re good as gold! MechJeb even parked it the right way I wanted!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I find his obsession with phasing orbits a bit too much... Really... I set a good 555 km orbit and he goes on to change it to 556 km. Really MJ... That 1 kilometre of extra phase time that important?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELol, oh, I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s not precise, it\u0027s just... vigorous, that\u0027s all.

For myself, MJ\u0027s docking autopilot has been pretty hamfisted in that regard ever since version 2.1.x of MechJeb was released. I think this may be because a lot of people were having problems with the autopilot being too tentative in certain situations. Well, it ain\u0027t tentative no more, folks!
