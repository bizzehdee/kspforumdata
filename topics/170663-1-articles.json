This mission has four primary goals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(1) Land a large mobile base on the surface of Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(2) Rescue three new Kerbals from Eve for contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(3) Rescue Bob and Bill who have been marooned on Eve in my first tiny rover for over three in game years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(4) Get 16 of the Kerbals off Eve and back to Kerbin. This has proven to be the most difficult step to prepare for. Most of my prototype liftoff craft either could not make it to the surface of Eve in one, or even 10, pieces, or could not make it back into orbit. The rocket I eventually developed is massive, and will have required 4 large tankers to refuel it for different stages of its part in the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are the vehicles that will perform this mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFirst\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E my mobile base, technical designation \u0022Base Crawler Type 4-B\u0022, current designation \u0022Eve Crawler\u0022.

It is designated the Type 4-B because a smaller version, the Type 4, is already on a mission to Tylo. Ironically the 4-B will arrive at its designation before its older sibling.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gm1yjQI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/gm1yjQI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere the Base Crawler Type 4-B GT (Ground Test) is just sitting on the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ba5zhzG.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Ba5zhzG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here is is with the bay doors open, and all of the various types of panels and the drills deployed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022C6yi3FN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/C6yi3FN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a top view clearly showing the three on board science labs and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E converter (covered in radiators).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mhjl5eo.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/mhjl5eo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the rear view. The Type 4 and 4-B are actually the first time I\u0027ve ever used the cargo ramp as a ramp. Normally I just use it as a mouth to collect marooned pods that contracts require me to retrieve. In both Base Crawler models, the ramps are used because the vehicles\u0027 destinations have too high gravity to use the jet packs to boost up to a hatch, and it\u0027s of course cool to have a back door. You\u0027ll notice the entry way to the craft here is in fact a Hitchhiker pod recessed into a fuel tank bulkhead head. It works, and it looks cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226y3lm8l.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/6y3lm8l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the 4-BGT next to the GT model of my first Eve Rover. The Eve rover currently on the purple planet has traveled over 1000 km, across 4 different biomes,\u00A0and collected a metric f*ckton of data, which is stored in those new(ish) lunch boxes. This data, and Bill and Bod\u00A0who have been stuck in the thing for years,\u00A0 will be transfered to the Eve Crawler when they eventually rendezvous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BZFKhoE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/BZFKhoE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here is why I have Klaws mounted on the front.

I used a combination of autostructing, rigid joints, and structs, so I didn\u0027t even have to use cheats to get it to hold together during launch. Interestingly this is actually a much older design compared to the other launch vehicles used in this mission. I settled on it before spending a solid month trying to get a liftoff vehicle to work, and in that time discovered the wondrous technique of tightly clustering Vector engines, which the other large launch vehicles built for this mission use. But the Eve Crawler launcher wasn\u0027t broken, and didn\u0027t need fixing. Needless to say the massive part count slowed the launch to about 1 fps, so it took over a half hour to actually get into a holding orbit around Kerbin. It also had far more Delta-V than was required for an Eve landing. I found the best way to get this thing down was too burn\u00A0about 2500 m/s of Delta-V before atmospheric insertion, and use four inflatable heat shields\u00A0 (two fore and two\u00A0aft), and essentially let is gently waft down through Eve\u0027s annoyingly thick atmosphere until it falls to around 10 km and then deploy parachutes. I also discovered in testing that this design is not a good boat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NmlAHqI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NmlAHqI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere the Eve Crawler is in its holding orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022G7VM172.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/G7VM172.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a front view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dG1Kkja.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dG1Kkja.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a dorsal view during the transfer burn to Eve.

This will land the hot and dirty way on Eve, to conserve fuel. I eventually got a design that I not only liked, but survived Eve atmospheric entry almost 75% of the time. In vacuum, it has about 8300 m/s of Delta-V. This gives it more than enough speed and power to reach a low orbit around Eve if launched from anywhere above 1.3 km ASL. My target area in the equatorial highlands averages around 3 km ASL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228orgVdb.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/8orgVdb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere it is during launch. The actually Lifter lander launched with empty tanks, and will not be fueled until it arrives in Eve orbit. I do realize that I could land it empty and use the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E converter and klaw on the Eve Crawler to fuel it before launch from Eve\u0027s surface, but I don\u0027t want to do it that way.

To save credits (a bit), but mostly to allow the launch to progress at above 1 FPS, I decided to refuel the orbit acquisition boosters (the stacks of the black and white tanks) in orbit and use them for the Eve transfer burn and for stopping in Eve orbit. The weird hat thing with the giant airlock sticking our of the top is for refueling.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UaBo0hn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/UaBo0hn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere it is about to dock with the \u003Cstrong\u003Ethird\u003C/strong\u003E craft used in this mission, my Kerbin Orbit Tanker. There was nothing really special about it, just a bunch of the biggest fuel tanks launched using a crazy amount of fuel and vector engines. Launching it cost about 8 million credits. Thankfully I built up a massive reserve of credits through contracts and selling science. Once the Lifter was refueled for its transfer and eventual parking burns, I dropped the tanker into the atmosphere and let it burn up. It was built to be expendable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lEyXF19.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/lEyXF19.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is was taken use a few moments before it started to explode.
