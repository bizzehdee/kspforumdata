How does that work? When I do it, if I put the SRBs on the same stage as the main LFE and hit space to jettison the SRBS I obviously decouple the main engine. How do I get rid of the solid boosters and keep the main engine? I don\\\u0027t know if I\\\u0027ve explained myself well enough or not, I\\\u0027m sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Doctor Lag","CreatedById":23856,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T07:23:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo you\\\u0027ve got it right. What you want to do is add your SRBs and main engines in the bottom stage so they fire at the same time (I\\\u0027m guessing you already have this set up). Then put your SRB decouplers one stage up by themselves. That way, when you hit spacebar only the SRBs will be jettisoned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"randyrules711","CreatedById":13988,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T07:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to move the radial decouplers that hold the SRBs onto a seperate stage, before the main decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lanceh","CreatedById":22228,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T08:28:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow. That was stupidly simple. I guess I was thinking that if I put them all in the same stage then hit space that all control would be cut from the main engine and I wouldn\\\u0027t be able to cut power.
