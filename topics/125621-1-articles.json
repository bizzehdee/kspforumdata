I\u0026#39;m not sure if this is the case with real extra-planetary rovers, but I\u0026#39;m under the impression that they have some kind of stepping motor for their drive power that allows for more precise control. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think it would be nice to have the ability to toggle the motors on KSP rover wheels to some kind of \u0022stepping\u0022 mode- where the wheel is only allowed to rotate when throttle is applied. To me it would just feel a bit more \u0022robotic\u0022, for lack of a better word. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThoughts?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T08:48:04Z","Content":"\nTalking about boredom ...

But the wheel-system is completely reworked right now for version 1.1. So I am not sure, whether this would be still necessary then.\n"}]}
