The alignment of the leading edges of the engine inlets is designed to scatter radiation to the sides. Fixed fanlike reflecting structures in the inlet tunnel divert radar energy away from the rotating fan blades.[55]\u003Cp\u003EThe Super Hornet also makes considerable use of panel joint serration and edge alignment. Considerable attention has been paid to the removal or filling of unnecessary surface join gaps and resonant cavities. Where the F/A-18A-D used grilles to cover various accessory exhaust and inlet ducts, the F/A-18E/F uses perforated panels that appear opaque to radar waves at the frequencies used. Careful attention has been paid to the alignment of many panel boundaries and edges, to direct reflected waves away from the aircraft in uniformly narrow angles.[7]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is claimed that the Super Hornet employs the most extensive radar cross section reduction measures of any contemporary fighter, other than the F-22 and F-35.

This sort of thing works for AEWs and SAM sites, because they have the range and radar power to either get out of the way or shoot you down first. For an air-superiority fighter, active radar is just an invitation to be shot down. Most modern systems will let you lock onto enemy\u0027s active radar without turning your radar on at all. The active radar on the missile only kicks in when it has closed most of the range or if active radar goes silent. Flying with active radar is a way to get shot down with minimal warning.

Seconds can be valuable too, but it doesn\u0027t make that much of a difference in this case. If a stealthy fighter snuck up to within passive radar range, it got its advantage, whether it gets detected opening bay doors or not. For starters, a weak signature on radar that you can\u0027t get an NCTR on is not much to go on. If you get Doppler off it, you might recognize it right away as a hostile fighter. Otherwise, you have to track its range for a while, which can take several seconds as well, if it\u0027s not heading straight towards radar.

Yes, the moment F-35 fires, or perhaps even as soon as it opens doors, it reveals its position. Now it has to run and hide. Difference is that it\u0027s networked with any number of other F-35s which now have all the same targets as the first one did, but they aren\u0027t on enemy radar yet. While the Typhoons are reacting to one jet and one attack they can see, F-35s are adjusting their position based on that reaction for a second attack. And more importantly, they don\u0027t have to run, because they aren\u0027t being fired on.
