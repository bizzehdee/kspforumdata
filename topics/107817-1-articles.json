I removed the thermal animation in Unity and it worked fine, so that\u0027s definitely what\u0027s causing the problem. I read that someone else was able to solve this issue by using an older version of Unity, so I downgraded to the same version they said they switched to (version 4.2), yet strangely, the problem persists. \n\nMy only thought is, is this an issue with Part Tools .23? Otherwise I\u0027m totally confused why this doesn\u0027t work, even when I followed the guide posted on here to the letter..."},{"CreatedByName":"Ven","CreatedById":109931,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T23:08:05Z","Content":"I occasionally get the same problem, but the only way I\u0027ve found to solve it was to redo the entire animation unfortunately.\n\nIs this part using any tags? Because if you use an incorrect tag (IE: no\\_attach vs noattach (ignore caps here)) the models refuse to load in game."},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T08:09:44Z","Content":"I had this exact same problem yesterday and what I had to do was select the object in the assets folder of unity, and at the side in the inspector window click animation, then untick import animation, now do your thermal animation in unity as normal and it will hopefully work (if yours is the same problem as mine) seems with me it was blender deciding my object had an animation when it didnt and the blender and unity animations conflicting. hope this helps!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T09:26:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 09:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy**"}]}
