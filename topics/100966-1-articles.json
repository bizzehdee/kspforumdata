I can go and return almost anywhere in kerbol system with rockets (didn\u0027t bother to return from Eve, but it\u0027s a matter of packing more DV...)\n\nWith 0.90 I decided to give creer mode a serious try, and now I\u0027m stuck with something didn\u0027t bother to do before: make a SSTO spaceplane capable of lifting heavy payloads. I have some desings that get to orbit, but without payload and with little DV to spare. I can lift more than 300 tons with SSTO or multi stage rocket lifters, but that approach is too much expensive for early/mid career.\n\nI read some threads about optimal ascent profiles with spaceplanes and many people say to climb to 35K or more on jets. My spaceplanes only get to 25K on jets, then flameout makes impossible to climb more. At 25k I can\u0027t build up enough horizontal velocity to reach orbit easily.\n\nSo.... how do you manage to get higher than 30k on jets?. The only way a ever got that high on jets was with a little spaceplane fully covered with intakes, and I want to stay away from intake spamming if posible.\n\nImportant note I forgot to mention: stock aero. Never used FAR (only made 3-5 planes before) and I want to see how the aero for 1.0 behaves before installing FAR\n\nAny help is welcome\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-01T00:11:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2015 12:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DoToH**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T22:49:08Z","Content":"The absurdities of the stock drag model are particularly punishing to large spaceplanes.

If you place intakes and engines in symmetry, they will ALWAYS be directed to one engine, any air \u0022overflow\u0022 goes to the next engine and the next and the next and so on. This leads to your asymmetrical flame outs. The way to get around this is to turn off symmetry mode and place Engine -\u003E Intake -\u003E Engine -\u003E Intake because the last engine placed is the one the intake is assigned to.\n\nYou can also do Engine -\u003E Intake -\u003E Intake -\u003E Engine -\u003E Intake -\u003E Intake if you want more intakes.\n\nThe last options is a mod called [Intake Build Aid](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104704-0-90-Intake-Build-Aid). \n\n(Note that this problem will affect you in stock or with FAR)"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T23:09:33Z","Content":"The way I do it is by limiting my climb rate. NMT 500 m/sec up to 25 km altitude, then NMT 100 m/sec up to 32 km altitude. Once at 32 km, maintain altitude until periapsis is established, then use just enough throttle to maintain it.\n\n It sounds like you\u0027re climbing too rapidly, which will cause you to be too slow at altitude, which runs you out of air.\n\n You need to have low enough wing loading to climb efficiently at terminal velocity (about 1.0 Cl per tonne), enough intake area (about .018 m^2 per engine) and enough engine (about 1 turbojet per 15 tonnes or 1 RAPIER per 10 tonnes.\n\n As an aside... lifting 300 tonnes with a spaceplane sounds like a nightmare.

Since you\u0027re in stock aero, I can give you guidelines; I recently made the switchover to FAR and am still learning there.\n\nSo I design stock aero planes along these lines - \n\n\\* 25% payload fraction. A lousy spaceplane can usually still hit this threshold; most plane designs will actually get you at least 27% or higher (as compared to 15% for asparagus). Start with your payload design, multiply it by four, and *assume* that\u0027ll be the final mass of your plane. So if you\u0027ve got a 300 tonne plane, you better not be trying to lift more than 75 tonnes of payload...\n\n\\* Pick what kind of engines you\u0027re using. If you go with RAPIERs, you want one for every full thirteen tonnes; if you go with a combination of Turbojets and rockets, you\u0027ll want one Turobjet for every full fifteen tonnes. Round up to the next multiple either way. 300 tonnes = 20 Turbojets. That rocket\u0027s starting to look a LOT more attractive...\n\n\\* You\u0027ll want an intake area of .03 per Engine; this is not airhogging. I\u0027ve done planes with nine Ram intakes per engine before; three per engine is WAY easier to design and generally looks cleaner too. What you can do is build \u0022engine units\u0022 starting with an Engine Nacelle along your craft\u0027s centerline. Slap an engine on the end (if you\u0027re going with Turbojets and rockets, put a trio of 24-77s with each jet - that\u0027s probably more than you really need!!) and then move the Nacelle off to the side of the craft. Put a tricoupler on the other end, and then put Ram Intakes on that. That\u0027ll get you a good Nacelle design. Of course, what Alshain told you is 100% true - if you just leave it at that without rebalancing the intakes and engines, you\u0027ll be more subject to asymmetric thrust. So, use the engine units for design purposes, and then tear off the Intakes and Engines and rebuild them properly, or get Intake Build Aid - I\u0027d recommend the latter personally; that mod is just FAR too useful for spaceplane users.\n\n\\* Fuel wise, you\u0027ll want 40 units of Liquid Fuel per (theoretical) tonne of craft, and 25 units of Oxidizer per (theoretical) tonne of craft. So 300 tonnes - you\u0027ll want 12000 units of Liquid Fuel and 7500 units of Oxidizer. My advice here is to use rocket fuel tanks and drain off some of the oxidizer - big thing there is that it\u0027ll keep your part count down. Which brings us to...\n\n\\* 1:1 Total Lift Coefficient per tonne. If you\u0027ve got a 300 tonne plane, you want the total of the lift coefficients of all your wings and lifting bodies to add up to 300. Delta Wings have a lift coefficient of 2, so you\u0027d need **150 Delta Wings at a minimum**.\n\nNow, I won\u0027t discourage you from trying to build a monstrosity like this. I will say that I myself have successfully lifted a plane to orbit that was about 130 tonnes before, with the purpose of lifting a full orange tank to orbit - \n\n![shTk6cq.png](http://i.imgur.com/shTk6cq.png)\n\nIf you\u0027re serious about wanting to lift payloads with planes in stock aero, I can\u0027t do much better than to suggest you check out DocMoriarty\u0027s [KSP Space Plane Construction and Operation](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/223333-ksp-space-plane-construction-and-operation) Guide. It was designed for stock aero and focuses on use of RAPIERs, and it has an extensive section on the design and flight of transporter spaceplanes. It was written for 0.24.2, but the general principles inside it will be applicable until the current stock aero is replaced in KSP 1.0 (I must be the only one who thinks Squad should go to 0.91 from 0.90 instead of 1.0, but that\u0027s a discussion best left for a different thread.)\n\nAnyways, good luck. If you do get the 300 up, let us know - cuz that would be a sight, no doubt.\n\nEDIT: Incidentally, if you need a rocket booster that\u0027ll lift a 300 tonne payload, holler; I designed one a few months back that\u0027d do 450 without breaking a sweat. I\u0027d have to find that thread again, but...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T14:07:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 02:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ion Man","CreatedById":138259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T12:08:50Z","Content":"The intake build aid, as mentioned above, is very nice.
