I\u0027ve taken the units apart as part of identifying the issues and without doubt they have the longest and most complex hierarchy i have ever seen, and I\u0027ve built in previous versions some stupidly complex suspensions and they don\u0027t even come close, and without some insight as to what any part actually does and why it\u0027s a case of making little steps and reverse engineering the whole thing from scratch, it has been mentioned that it would probably be easier to start from scratch than even attempt to fix the
