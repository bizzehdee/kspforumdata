I reinstalled KSP because I wanted to get back in to it before KSP 2 and now I\u0027m running vanilla KSP but still cant find my decouplers. I verified files and it said all were accounted for but nothing is working. I don\u0027t know how computers work but is there a possibility a part file is in another folder and is not moved unless I do it manually?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-23T23:54:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/187883-more_heat_shields/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022187883\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/187883-more_heat_shields/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@More_Heat_Shields\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a couple of things I would check first. Start yourself a new sandbox game so that you begin with all parts unlocked and make sure you are looking under the \u0022coupling\u0022 part category. A couple (haha) of years ago all of the decouplers were moved into their own category in the parts list. They are no longer listed under structural like in older versions. The coupling category is the sixth one down, between \u0022structural\u0022 and \u0022payload.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also try using the part search function. At the very top of the parts list there is a search box that should say \u0022Enter search.\u0022 Simply try typing in the word \u0022decoupler\u0022 or even the terms \u0022TD-\u0022 or \u0022TT-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they still don\u0027t show up anywhere then you may have a problem with missing or misplaced files or folders. The folder path the decouplers are located in is your install folder for KSP, then \u0022\\GameData\\Squad\\Parts\\Coupling\u0022 and then you should see a list of decouplers and separators in that folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would also be helpful to know if you\u0027ve noticed any other missing parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-02-26T23:14:42Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2020 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"More_Heat_Shields","CreatedById":187883,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-13T19:39:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I just fixed it the other day after get really motivated to play. The problem was since it was on steam the game settings hooked it up to my cloud. So whenever I would verify game files and the decouplers would be recovered, steam would think its a bug and delete them. All I had to do is disable cloud sync for KSP and verify game files again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
