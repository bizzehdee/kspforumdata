The idea is that you can see items from the map view and select them even if they are beyond physics range. So taking advantage of this you select your target in this manner and then the plotting computer that the missiles use to track to the target show a colored marker (red was my thought) on the navball. From there you must have control from the gun itself before firing (so instead of toggling the turret you control it like a probe body or cockpit), then line the navball indicator up with the marker and fire. The projectile will then \u0022fall\u0022 to it\u0027s target (i.e. thrust=x for .1 secs let physics take it form there) This should \u0022bypass\u0022 load range problems unless you switch to the slug itself which since it\u0027s behaving like a vessel the most that should happen is a slight lag upon loading the other craft in.
