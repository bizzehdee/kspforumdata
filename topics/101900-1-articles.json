I\u0027d appreciate some feedback on the idea. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that may sound boring, but; the way I picture it is that it would be similar to something like Farmville, except instead of waiting for your crops to grow; you\u0027re waiting for your spacecraft to arrive at it\u0027s location. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike with KSP, this game would focus a lot on what happens prior to the mission beyond just designing the rocket. What I\u0027m thinking is designing missions, playing with simulators of space missions (with time accelerations) and training astronauts to fill in the gaps between your flights. (Note; the game would probably include futuristic yet realistic rocketry in order to shorten the gaps between flights to planets to months instead of years, although the technology would start as simple chemical rockets.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the idea sound okay?

Even if you did manage to shorten the trips from years to months.... It\u0027s still going to be real-time?
