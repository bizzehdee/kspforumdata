I mean like more than 18hrs a day! Florida day night cycle is nothing like this, even in the winter. But regardless of the day of the year (and using Principia which accounts for planetary tilts and stuff), the day night cycle in the northern hemisphere is more like Norway in the winter!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a bug or a feature?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boribori","CreatedById":116708,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-19T07:19:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did notice that the sun rises really late, I normally warp till 11am to get some light on the launch site.
