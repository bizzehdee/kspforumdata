I have fuel and electrical power, a set of turning wheels and regular trailer wheels.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENowhere. Generally if a mod comes with a \u0022Source\u0022 folder, that\u0027s for if you want to edit the mod for any reason, it\u0027s the source code. Don\u0027t install the source.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for modular multi-wheels.. I don\u0027t know.. Does it depend on other mods to operate?

Is there by any chance a \u0022Drive Wheel\u0022 or something like that? (Assuming steering wheels can roll and steer, trailer wheels can only roll, and the power wheels can roll but also provide power, but cannot steer...?)
