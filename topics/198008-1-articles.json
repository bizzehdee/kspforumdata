Mods do and often affect game performance. What are you playing the game on? A lot of mods plus an older machine equate loading the game after scene changes at the speed of snail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn some systems, there is a slight performance boost when playing it in windowed mode. There are some forum members who swear that playing the game in windowed mode helps performance. I am not one of them.
