I have been, however, toying around in KSP for about 6 months. Love the game, way more than most games I\u0027ve played in many years. Anyway, here is the bug I\u0027m experiencing, sorry if it has been addressed I did extensive searching before posting I promise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically in the Chaka Monkey, Mark IV, and Panopticon mods I have attachment nodes that simply won\u0027t allow attachment or attach to anything, or if they do it is on the wrong side of the node (with the part clipping) and no other parts can be added. Now I know these are 0.90 compatible and not yet updated for 1.0.x and honestly I wasn\u0027t using them in 0.90 so I can\u0027t confirm or deny if they ever worked properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I suspected my PC to be the problem, but I\u0027m now sure it\u0027s not consistently the PC. I have done extensive web searches and even tried to wrap my head around the node attach rules in the wiki. I suspect something has changed in 1.0.x regarding attachment rules that is causing this. If anyone has some insite on how to fix it, that would be great, or if someone wants to help me understand the wiki documentation better so I can experiment myself that would be awesome too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETIA, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.A.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T23:12:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Aaron Also, Squad have enforced part attachment direction with nodes now, but many old parts have nodes pointing the wrong way, you can disable this in the Alt\u002BF12 debug menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T23:41:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next version of Chaka monkey, which will be available soon, has fixed nodes on every part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aaron Also","CreatedById":144689,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T01:34:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFIXED\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome Awesome Awesome\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat fixed the problem entirely.
