This is making the game unplayable, and me a very dissatisfied player. The problem has not been present from the start, and I\u0027m still running 1.0.0 or whatever the release day version was. Any fix for this or do I need to start my career mode again? If I do I\u0027m pretty much just going to drop KSP at this point."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:16:14Z","Content":"Try updating KSP, your buildID file should say 842, I have experienced the bug you mention and it\u0027s fixed in the latest version."},{"CreatedByName":"DebatedNothing","CreatedById":79974,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:26:53Z","Content":"Can I keep my save?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:32:02Z","Content":"Yes, I even had a save from .25 and that still works ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T12:33:58Z","Content":"I have build ID file 842, and I experienced this failure while warping to node around the Mun.
