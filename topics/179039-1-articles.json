To use them and keep them going straight in the lower atmosphere is easy -- you just need steerable fins. Once the atmosphere thins out enough that steerable fins won\u0027t steer, then you almost certainly need to use a gimballed engine. Meaning the Swivel. Beyond that, probe cores have tiny little reaction wheels in them, that may be enough to keep you going straight -- maybe. Alternately, you need to research \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and turn it on while you are still in the atmosphere.
