To save UV space i work out what sections of the mesh i can duplicate, and what sections can be mirrored. The less surface area i have, the more texture space is allocated to whats left. I then delete what i don\u0027t need, and scale the UV co-ordinates to match the amount of space i want them to have on the texture map. Small areas at the front that need to be crisp (like the label, which will have text) are enlarged, while areas that you wont likely see, or will have a solid color with no noticable pixels (like pipes, or the bottom of the bag) are heavily reduced. Then once its textured, i put it back into Maya and re-assemble it back together, hiding seams away in secret places...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/54Xuplh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002254Xuplh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing it this way means i can squeeze a ton of detail out of a smaller map by re-using sections of the UV that people arent normally going to notice. This map here is a 256 pixel one, which is one quarter of the 512 map used in the wedges. The other 3\\4\u0027s are the hatch, the black corrugations, and the internal structure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T15:13:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are looking for game testers I volunteer.
