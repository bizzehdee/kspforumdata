I had the mothership that was supposed to land and refuel on Vall, so it needed enough thrust to land on Vall. And of course since it was big I assumed it was a good idea to use the Nervs. The ship was fairly big, carrying fuel for 2 big landers, so I needed 24 nervs to land it on Vall. I also had issues because the mothership used liquid fuel, one lander used oxidizer, and one used a mix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater, when I got more experienced, I made some calculations. Those 24 nervs were 72 tons heavy. I could get more thrust with just 4 wolfhounds, for 13 tons. I made some calculations with the rocket equation, and it turned out, I would have gotten a greater deltaV if I had used 3 wolfhounds. the increased mass was just making me lose so much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNervs are great to manuever a large ship in deep space, but they have limitations and drawbacks like everything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
