Korporation Systems Alliance) is a non kerbin faction right now, led by sentient AI alongside a small number of high ranking organics.\u00A0 They were accidentally created by BCorp (Breakthrough Corporation) way back when they were trying to make more advanced warships that could fight without requiring kerbals to man them, and well the AI didnt quite agree to be used as fodder, made its own faction, and the 2 have been at war ever since.\u00A0 The other major factions i have are KG (kerbin government), basically control \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and like 95% of all manufacturing facilities on kerbin, so any faction that wants to do much of anything on kerbin needs to at least work with them somewhat.\u00A0 They dont really do squat though besides selling launch stages to bring vessels into orbit and patrolling super low orbits.\u00A0 Anything below 500km is technically protected by them, but this never works as their warships are pathetically useless and everyone knows this so yeah, they dont really do anything defense wise and dont want any part in the AKS-BCorp wars.\u00A0 There is also a unnamed faction that originated before the destruction that resulted in all of kerbin\u0027s cities being wiped out which left kerbin to live in low kerbol orbit (i actually made their space station\u0027s control room look like that mass effect illusive man room with sun visible from command chair) and more or less are a ghost faction that has the best tech of anyone and occasionally interferes with the rest when they have a reason (they have jump beacons which lets them instantly transport their ships to anywhere they managed to get a beacon to the old fashioned rocket way), but theyve never been proven to exist by any of the rest.\u00A0 Finally, its worth mentioning that i do have a pirate faction, but they have no real organization, more or less appear randomly to try and steal valuable ships/materials, and tend to be blown to bits by the weakest ships from BCorp (and AKS just ignores them as they have long range scanners and way more range with nuke engines).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, at this point in time BCorp is sitting on what little tech remains after the 2nd battle of minmus was barely won by them (technical victory at best since every AKS asset in or around kerbin was destroyed, but AKS itself already had setup a very limited operation beyond kerbin).\u00A0 AKS sacrificed its entire fleet during the latter stages in attempt to destroy BCorp\u0027s ability to manufacture and develop tech, and succeeded to the point that BCorp is now unable to either understand how any of the advanced tech works, let alone actually manufacture any of it.\u00A0 Adv tech includes RTGs, pretty much any engine with higher then 350 isp, aerospike, IRSU tech, mk-2/mk-3 armor tech, reaction wheels, most plane parts, rapiers, all long range form of ship tracking and communication, ect.\u00A0 They still have a small stock of pre-war ships that are actually advanced, but these are for all intents and purposes irreplaceable when destroyed and most ships that they can manufacture are extremely underarmed (since the last remaining good ship-ship torpedoes are also only available from those that hoarded them b4 the end of the last war and both expensive/hard to find).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAKS didnt get away free either, they did retain all their technological knowledge, but lost their entire fleet, and the 1 shipyard they do have outside of kerbin is limited in its ability to make anything due to only 1 refinery supporting it and constant issues with getting materials from the ground to the shipyard.\u00A0 The few ships that did survive the 2nd battle of minmus are currently split, half defending the shipyard, rest harassing BCorp\u0027s attempts at colonizing minmus and supplying mun operations after the loss of IRSU technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only actual company that still sells ships and ship components left in universe is RT (Replitech), a company that i make most of my replicas from movies and such with.\u00A0 They have a huge pile of old tech, and are able to manufacture some more stuff then BCorp can, but are in a very similar situation to them and also cannot really manufacture a ship from ground up based on old tech (they can repair a destroyed ship if its core is still intact, thats it).\u00A0 They also sell BCorp most of its weapons from stocks of old tech (since all of the new weapons BCorp has been trying to make using new tech cant reliably do anything to AKS).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot entirely sure how youd be able to fit my story in with yours, especially as there are no nations period in my KSP universe (mostly to justify the complete lack of surface infrastructure besides \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and the few other launch points around), but thats what i have in my game.\u00A0 there was a very old war on kerbin b4 BCorp even existed, and that supposedly wiped everything out.\u00A0 The factions that actually do anything and still exist on kerbin (BCorp namely), are mostly spread throughout various underground shelters, and purely go to space using KG controlled space centers after manufacturing said ships in KG factories (also underground).\u00A0 AKS ofc doesnt care as they arent a kerbin based group and purely use kerbin now to manufacture sections of their low tech ship lines (novas and supernovas mostly, both of which as specifically designed to use only tech available to the others besides the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E that can still be obtained from RT\u0027s stocks at a very high price).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, best way i can think of adding my universe into yours is to attribute the BCorp ships to RT (Replitech), since RT actually outfits BCorp\u0027s stuff with weapons available from their rather extensive stocks of old tech (those torps are not a BCorp design in the 1st place), and while they arent a nation (purely company that sells ships/weapons), their HQ would have to be near one of the space centers on kerbin (so either \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, the desert port, or that super north one that i forget the name of), and would ofc be underground and just transport stuff using a network of tunnels like everyone else on kerbin does in lore.\u00A0 As for AKS ships, they would be from the black market, since there are enough wrecks from old battles for scavengers to recover to some degree.\u00A0 AKS itself doesnt really sell their tech period (namely to prevent anyone on kerbin from learning how it works), but enough of it is available on the black market at insanely high prices that it isnt uncommon for even higher ranking BCorp captains to fly onboard refit AKS warships (specifically the class-I from like ages ago which is super outdated and i may or may not provide since its really disfucntional now and last used in like 0.90 or so).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, i should have the ships ready for upload tomorrow if nothing else comes up and i can finish my current project, a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E -\u0026gt; duna capable dropship that can deliver a 20t tank in its dual mk-3 bay without refueling (if i can actually find a way to make the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E work as the robotics parts are too floppy to support such overly heavy engines (each side has 3 NTRs, 3 rapiers, and 2 aerospikes to get the monster into orbit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SDILtrn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/SDILtrn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mrIg5pc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/mrIg5pc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if you are interested in non combat vessels, but this thing is genuinely cool if i can pull it off (and redo the wings a 100 more times before im happy with its looks).\u00A0 I can add it if i ever finish it and get it to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fulgur","CreatedById":195204,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-31T06:40:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like it!
