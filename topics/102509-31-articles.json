I was talking about the rocket there, not the rover. My rover has three types of energy suppliers: \n\ntwo RTG\u0027s, which combined provide insufficient power to keep on driving 24/7. ,two fuel driven generators as backup and one solar panel as a last resort backup.\n\nTesting might seem unneccessary however during the Pol expedition i was confronted with several things which might have been done better (if only i had tested before). The current rover managed to explode during testing when dropped from 18 meters, after a slight redesign it now can survive undamaged a drop from 59 meters (provided it lands straight on its tracks. So the advantage of testing is evident. Besides, how else can you chack if your vehicle can survive a certain situation. Kerbin has a slightly higher gravity than Tylo, so you now it will survive on Tylo if the same happens there.\n\nI wil make the rocket as stock as possible, so you can use it as well (if you want, that is.) \n\nMore details about the rover, preparations etc. on the [mission page](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138024-The-Elcano-Challenge-on-Tylo)."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T16:01:43Z","Content":"Anyhow, good luck!

The rover I\u0027m using has the ability to drill and re-fuel herself, both to run the fuelcells and to fuel the RCS thrusters.

The RCS thrusters circle the R/W wheels, and I have two vernier\u0027s positioned in front and back, to cover all 6 directions. Even at speeds of 20 m/s, my wheels seldom come off the ground, and a quick translate down fixes it if they do. An average 15 m/s seems about perfect.\n\nBut even with all that, I\u0027ve seen craters that terrify me!
