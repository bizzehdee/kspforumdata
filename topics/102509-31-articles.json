It will bring you to apprecaite the beauty of Kerbin and the Challenge has Challenges in the Challenge if that makes any sense? I did a little research before starting and began my journey and to my surprise I forgot to name my saves, my craft stopped and I refueled but didn\u0027t notice that the Engines had broken off while I wasn\u0027t looking so now I will be starting again. This was roughly 10 to 12 hours of travel real time. Lesson learned and this is a lesson for those who plan to take this Challenge.

The rover I\u0027m using has the ability to drill and re-fuel herself, both to run the fuelcells and to fuel the RCS thrusters. And let me tell you, those thrusters are a godsend!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have two of the large R/W wheels, positioned just inside the front and rear wheels. The RCS thrusters circle the R/W wheels, and I have two vernier\u0027s positioned in front and back, to cover all 6 directions. Even at speeds of 20 m/s, my wheels seldom come off the ground, and a quick translate down fixes it if they do. An average 15 m/s seems about perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even with all that, I\u0027ve seen craters that terrify me!
