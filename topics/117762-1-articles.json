This resulted in you thinking your entire ship will soon explode when in reality its barely warm. what are some setting that better fit their actual in game effects, so I know when I really do need good shielding or not, and understand whats happening."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T11:49:45Z","Content":"In base KSP reentry effects are not related to craft heat or shock heating but solely to speed. You can have a blazing-red hot ship in very high atmosphere before it even starts to heat.\n\nDut to this, I don\u0027t think it is really possible to edit settings to make effects and heat correspond. At least without editing half of the game\u0027s config files. Maybe mods can help you here"}]}
