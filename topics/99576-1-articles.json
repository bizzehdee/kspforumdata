The above example didn\u0027t work either at 1361190 it wont get me an encounter either. Sigh... I\u0027ve no idea how to resolve this... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean prograde is a vector in 3 dimensions which means there are 360 different directions one could burn in that are all at an angle of 34.15 degrees from it... :S See I\u0027m just getting in such a muddle.. I should go read more, though doing a crash course in orbital mechanics so I can play a game doesn\u0027t sound like fun... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: this cross posted, sorry for the rant, so I want it to say 214.15? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, to address this in the same tone of the post: You may want to \u003Cstrong\u003Estart\u003C/strong\u003E caring about what a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHohmann transfer\u003C/a\u003E is if you want to start going interplanetary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing the math yourself is probably the best because you\u0027re going to understand the basics of what has to occur to make the transfer effective.

I was trying to learn how to turn the info in the twp into a maneuver node, so that when a hohmann window opens, (about 179 days from now) I can enjoy firing my ships at the red planet instead of having to spend days messing about trying to learn the tools, and maybe even messing up my first window and having to find something to entertain myself with in Kerbin\u0027s SoI for another hundreds of hours! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do care what a Hohmann is, it is just that it isn\u0027t relevant to what I was trying to achieve. I expect that the advice given here about 34.15 being from Kerbin\u0027s prograde rather than retrograde will fix my current problem. I intend to test that and report back, in a happy bunny, style once I get a chance to try it when my 2 year old isn\u0027t advancing my stages on a whim, which normally means in the evening, but I also need an evening where I can play without my wife thinking I\u0027ve started to care more about odd shaped over evolved frogs and their space program rather than her!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MoridinUK","CreatedById":110633,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T08:23:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDear all, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for your help, I did finally get back on KSP last night and yep, I can get that Duna encounter!
