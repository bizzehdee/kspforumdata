I don\u0027t see much reason to avoid debris though, if you can switch by clicking. Sometimes it\u0027s useful to be able to easily switch to a debris piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - I never needed that but I think it\u0027s a good idea. It should be possible to put it to action group, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - I\u0027d say, one of the two: either the time should be stopped in space center, VAB, etc, or we should be able to see the real space center. Meaning, if I have a rocket on launchpad, I should be able to see it. It\u0027d be nice to allow time warp in tracking station, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 - there is a way, change it to something you can filter out (e.g. rover) and filter it out. You can use the same approach to filter out everything else, too. But there could be some more comfortable way to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 - you can, using Tab or Shift-Tab (hide the navball before pressing Shift or you\u0027ll throttle up).

It used to be that when you click-dragged outside the screen it would remove the window. It doesn\u0027t do that anymore as far as I can tell. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- I\u0027m also getting some major, major lag on menu updates when I transfer science experiments. I hit \u0027store experiments (2)\u0027 and it stays in the menu. Thinking I mis-clicked or it didn\u0027t go through (which is also happening a LOT), I click again. and again. About three seconds later I get a massive amount of popups and side information telling me that Jebediah has been juggling all of my experiments in and out of the pod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- Would it be possible to let us type in the thrust limits or fuel amounts while we\u0027re in the VAB? I can\u0027t seem to ever hit exactly 50%, sticking me with either 49.5 or 50.5. It\u0027s annoying, and I imagine when I get to more complex mission profiles (space shuttle here I come), I\u0027ll need that precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4- Could you please make it so that we can change tweakable values via action groups? I have a lifter where the center column runs at 50% throttle until the boosters disengage, then burn full once they drop. Right now that requires manual right-clicking (with the sticky menus) and manually adjusting them up. God knows what I would do if I needed to bring them down in-flight. I\u0027d love to be able to set up a set of action groups that let me run the booster separation and throttle up simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5- I know this has been asked elsewhere, but can we get at least one fuel tank that we can fill with just liquidfuel, just oxidizer, or both?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6- Werner von Kerman\u0027s lab... yikes. It\u0027s shiny, but it is really confusing. Until I did some serious playing around, I thought the \u0027X found out of Y\u0027 was the number of completed experiments versus the total number of available experiments for whatever planet/biome I had selected. It\u0027s actually, I think, the number showing of the total you\u0027ve ever collected. I\u0027m unsure where I would ever need that info.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you click on a side section, it gives number shown, and then number hidden. I don\u0027t get this. To me, that\u0027s like Google\u0027s search page at the bottom telling me that it\u0027s found 5,000 results, but hidden 50 billion. Every time I see it I keep thinking that the menu is hiding entries from the category I\u0027ve selected for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I have no idea what those bars are underneath each entry. Some are full, some are completely empty, and I can\u0027t discern a pattern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a possible suggestion, I\u0027d make the X found out of Y be the total number of experiments you\u0027ve done in that planet/of that type/in that biome, or whatever you\u0027ve got selected. This would tremendously help completionists. I\u0027d also suggest that von Kerman tells us some science he\u0027d like us to bring back. By this I mean that when I unlock, say, the thermometer, I get a big list of greyed-out entries in there which show me just where I can use it. I\u0027m sick of seeing \u0027temperature scan can\u0027t be done here.\u0027 \u0026gt;.\u0026lt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T08:19:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe bars underneath each entry are a bit confusing, but I think they indicate how much science that experiment was worth. Many experiments/reports/etc cannot retrieve all available science from the one task all at once. Transmission of the results also has an additional cap, so you have to return the data to Kerbin to get 100% of the science out of it, and sometimes you need to retrieve the data several times in order to squeeze all possible science out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Max Grant","CreatedById":3166,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T14:58:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can only think of a couple of things, one is the whole which astronaut did I pick for this mission issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI build a vessel.
