By the time you get a functioning orbital lab running, odds are you\u2019ll be doing a lot of timewarping for long-term missions so the wait times will be minimal and the science gains will be huge, though by that point you\u2019ll probably have the entire (stock) tech tree completed. Labs have the added bonus of being able to restore experiments like materials bays that would otherwise need a Kerbal scientist to make them usable again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also store multiple copies of any science experiment on the same vessel either by having a Kerbal collect the data and store it in e.g. a crew pod, or by adding experiment storage boxes which can store the data even without crew. Take several copies of every experiment, put some in a lab (or labs) and return the rest to Kerbin to maximise the science points gained, since most experiments need several runs to get the full data and will only give partial rewards for transmitting the data (materials bays are a good example). Transmitting data means reduced science gains, but it\u2019s a lot easier than doing a sample return mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
