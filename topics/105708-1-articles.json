You used to be able to climb up to the helipad ladders where you\u0027d get stuck and not be able to climb further, but now *all* the ladders are glitched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou sometimes can\u0027t climb the ladder at all, despite getting \u0022grab\u0022 \u0026amp; \u0022climb\u0022 messages, and you have real difficulties at the top of each ladder. Not a big deal, but hey, it\u0027s broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo check this out, run a Kerbal to the stairs on the pad side of the VAB, and up the stairs. Keep going forward until you get to the ladder. If you make it up the ladder and off the top, there are two more wall ladders to the roof, where you can go up another set of stairs to ladders to the helipads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also launch a Mk 1 capsule, EVA, hack gravity and jetpack to the top of the VAB helipad, unhack gravity, then have the Kerbal fall to each of the ladders you want to try to climb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the top of the ladders, you\u0027ll get situations like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* \u0022[F] Climb Out\u0022 message but F does nothing, and you can\u0027t climb any further. You also can\u0027t go back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* \u0022[F] Grab\u0022 and \u0022[F] Climb\u0022 messages (sometimes also \u0022[space] Let Go\u0022 too) where the Kerbal ragdolls a couple meters above the ladder and can\u0027t do anything, or just does the climb animation w/o going anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* \u0022[F] Climb Out\u0022 AND \u0022[F] Climb\u0022 messages and the Kerbal just ragdoll spins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using stock 1.0 on Linux 64-bit (Debian Jessie) and Windows 32-bit (Windows 7) - I\u0027ve tried it on both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll add some screenshots where poor \u0027ol Jeb is stuck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/x5tFG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
