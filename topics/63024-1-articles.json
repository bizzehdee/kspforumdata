This would add use to rovers because then you could set it to go to another biome with the a* as opposed to driving it manually for days, time warp and then go to your rover collect science and set it to the next mission. This I think would give a purpose to a rover in career other than pure asthetics which is a sandbox thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say to prevent exploits, add time warp to the tracking station and only allow the a* to work from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn unity squad wouldn\u0027t have to make an a* as there is a premade unity version and a free from online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and for those who don\u0027t know a* is a generic term for a certain type of ai pathfinding, its pretty efficient and therefore its pretty popular\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-13T00:46:45Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2014 12:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Specialist290\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMerging sequential posts.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T22:50:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo are you suggesting putting it on rails once you engage the autopilot\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemrav","CreatedById":91029,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T22:53:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ekind-of but more, in the tracking station you can set an ai to pilot a rover to a set location, and you can time warp. to save time and add use to a science rover\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T23:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk.

A planet isn\u0027t 2D, so you have the problem of how to wrap your 2D pathfinding map around a sphere, and dealing with your rover wandering around the planet and getting near the poles where the top and bottom of the map converge to a point, or toward the seam (meridian if you like) where the two vertical edges of your pathfinding map wrap around and meet each other again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA* could be useful as part of the solution, but it needs to be a bit more clever than \u0022wrap a massive pathfinding map around the entire planet\u0022. Perhaps plot a new map for every N kilometres that the rover travels, centred on its current location, extending for N*2 kilometres from the rover, and scanning the planetary surface for slope angle to determine whether a cell is clear or blocked? This could perhaps be explained as a game mechanic, requiring some kind of radar equipment on the rover before it becomes capable of autonomous travel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming surface deformations will never, ever happen, it might be possible to bake in fixed nodes and paths on each planet (another pathfinding method, similar to how the Unreal engine does it), and have any rover autopilots steer themselves along those lines?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T00:45:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nemrav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nemrav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, for now its only a suggestion, but i\u0027m just happy that my idea\u0027s aren\u0027t being shot down \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003Cp\u003EMaybe there could be overide code to the \u0022rails\u0022 in this case...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, if anything, the \u0022rails\u0022 would make things easier.

Just plot an appropriate course, and have the rover ride the rail until you switch back to it or it comes into view.
