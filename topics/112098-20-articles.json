The payload was a bunch of ore tanks weighing 70 tons in total. This I believe was the Ares V\u0027s intended payload to LEO in real life, so I guess my Ares performs similar to how the real one would have. This does mean that i will have weight limitations for the Duna landers if I ever get around to them, but 70 tons is quite a lot to work with.\n\n![39airc3.png](http://i.imgur.com/39airc3.png)\n\n![IQvK0OB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IQvK0OB.jpg)\n\n![BuV0OFp.png](http://i.imgur.com/BuV0OFp.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-06T15:55:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2016 03:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by pTrevTrevs**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T17:56:18Z","Content":"![2rreoDE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2rreoDE.jpg)\n\nThoughts?"},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T18:13:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 minutes ago, Mad Rocket Scientist said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![2rreoDE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2rreoDE.jpg)](http://i.imgur.com/2rreoDE.jpg \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thoughts?\n\u003E \n\n*What is it, my precious?
