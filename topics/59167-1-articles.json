There\u0027re entire blogs dedicated to roleplaying, many of them borrowing characters from various fandoms (read: books, movies, tv shows, you name it) or creating their own to roleplay in an existing fictional universe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T13:45:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s like dungeons and dragons, except the only thing you have is written word?
