Using tweakables, KSP science could reflect this kind of customization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, compare the mirrors on the Hubble, Chandra, and James Webb space telescopes. All are used for capturing images of the skies, but are sized differently, have different resolutions, and were designed for different types of light. The cost of each telescope is based on the size and quality of the mirrors, the computer hardware they run off of, and the cameras.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach (appropriate) science part could have sliders, much like those used for fuel and oxidizer in fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E 1. Slider: Precision vs. Working Range: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Precision: How Precise is your measurement? How much science do you get under ideal conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Calibrated Range: What range of conditions can you get a good measurement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Reasoning: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost real world measuring tools are only good for measuring values within a certain range (e.g. You wouldn\u0027t a bathroom scale to weigh a feather), and the accuracy that you can get a measurement has some connection to it\u0027s range (A good chemistry scale isn\u0027t mean\u0027t for more than say 500 grams, but can measure to 0.01 milligrams).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Implementation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA thermometer calibrated to get temperatures on Eve might give you such great results on Eeloo. You could give it a wider range, but then you wouldn\u0027t get as much science, because you have to sacrifice precision. By default, all science instruments would have the maximum calibrated range, but maybe only 20% of the maximum science return value. This gives players an incentive to consider measurement conditions on a mission by mission basis. Additionally, this could give players a better reason (other than spamming) to put more than one thermometer or barometer on a probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E 2. Slider: Recording Device Quality (How much of Science can be Transmitted) vs. Cost and mass \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Reasoning: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce science instruments have made measurements, they need to record those in the pod\u0027s computer in a form that can be transmitted back to mission control, or analyzed when the pod returns to Kerbin. While it makes sense that players should be rewarded for returning science instruments to Kerbin, there should be a way to minimize science transmission losses (at a price) for really remote locations. Better recording equipment costs significantly more, as well as increase its mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Implementation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The higher the quality of your recording device in your experiment, the more expensive it will be. This would be controlled by a slider. At the center of the slider would be the default transmission loss, mass and cost (1). This would allow players to beam back experimental results from Eve or Eeloo with a minimum of science loss, but could increase the cost of the experiment by as much as 10x or more. If we move the slider to the left, the experiment weighs less, and costs less (but no less than about 50% of it\u0027s initial mass and price), but transmission values become even worse, going down to maybe 10%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E And an aside: Antenna quality needs to matter \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E While not central to this discussion, transmission quality needs to be linked to the choice of antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-20T16:57:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2014 04:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Vallius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EKept messing up my html for [B]bolding[\\B]...\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-21T12:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery good ideas, makes sense, once you go once, you know what range is appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
