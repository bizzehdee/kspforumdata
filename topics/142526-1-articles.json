Accumulated heat will normally start to dissipate even without radiators, although if the total sources of heat are higher than what can dissipate, (Kerbol, running ISRU, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.

Usually parts return to their exact original position after, but not always. Check closely, because depending the position and mass, it may be a source of imbalance now. This is very rare though, and much more likely would\u0027ve exploded the part first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-26T11:38:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2016 11:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by swjr-swis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-26T12:48:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeat isn\u0027t issue after many iterations of rebalancing across versions. However a much worse problem is if engine A heats part B while A and B are on the same ship, then A loses its thrust. It\u0027s physically correct - you don\u0027t produce thrust by propelling things to yourself.\u00A0Apart from sepratrons, this is the most frequent situation I\u0027m seeing this engine thrust message, and it\u0027s an immediate revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E for a design correction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
