The buying/selling mechanic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould be easy to implement, once resources are fully developed by Squad. It could be as easy as the transferring fuel game mechanic, but with an added money ticker. How the prices are decided and how they fluctuate can be decided by a supply/demand method, or some other combination that could prevents players from gaming the market. Currently, there a couple resources that are ready to go now, from the hugely popular Kethane and Interstellar mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Added parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a first pass, a module that is a \u0022commodity exchange\u0022 part that can be added to space stations/ground bases. This could reflect the Kerbal Systems\u0027 market. The module part could have \u0027infinite\u0027 storage, to make it easy to use. If it didn\u0027t have that, and required a place to store the wares, then additional storage units to offload your cargo would be required, and then that would require the added necessity to transfer those barges to a base, another ship, or another station. A benefit of having the commodity exchange module on a ground base would be that it could be considered to be tied into \u0027underground\u0027 storage tanks, thereby greatly increasing storage capacity(unlimited, if wanted) without the need for extra parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Transferring goods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf docking is required, then the space station could quickly become a crowded place. What if a player docks and doesn\u0027t undock in KMP? What if he decides to grab a drink, and then leaves a line of other player\u0027s cargo ships waiting to dock with the station? If trying to dock on ground, will there be an easier method to do this? The ability to adjust landing legs, or rover wheel height, would alleviate this. Docking a huge cargo ship to the commodity exchange module might be impossible. KAS mod? Or have rovers that can offload the different resources and transfer them back and forth to the commodity exchange module? Dunno, but I think the player base would figure out what needed to be done, and the best way to do it, anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. KMP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasiest way I can think of is to have the player\u0027s handle and flag be his \u0027company\u0027. That will tie his different ships, resources, and money to him. Other considerations could be to increase the variance in required resources at different locations, i.e. hydrogen/water/oxygen/kethane/uranium/thorium/etc... Whatever Squad or the community develops. Different places in the Kerbal System could have different needs and surpluses, there-by setting what needs to be traded where. A stock-market feed could be set up for the different locations, but that adds to the complexity and I have no idea how you would go about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Large Scale Possibilities\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of these ideas are on the \u0027wall of crazy\u0027, but could be pretty cool in-game. Players would gravitate to profitable \u0027trade runs\u0027, which could set up piracy by others(Macey Dean), which could create the need for a military to protect different trade lanes, or valuable cargo runs by the employers of private security, and so on. Lots of mechanics could be created in-game by the players if this was implemented, and was allowed to evolve. Different players would try to control different areas/stations/bases, which would lead to more conflict as people \u0027encroach\u0027 on another\u0027s territory. Lots of possibilities. If other star systems were ever added by expansion/mod....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Single Player\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESingle player would be the easiest to test out, just need a buy/sell mechanic, the commodity exchange module that you can sell to (I guess owned by the Kerbal government?), and some method to regulate the price of goods. Would be very cool to set up a trade empire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInput appreciated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T11:32:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about we wait with suggesting things for this until we see the base?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
