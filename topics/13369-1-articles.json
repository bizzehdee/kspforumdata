This law is commonly stated, \u0027for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn his law of universal gravitation, Newton states that two particles having masses m1 and m2 and separated by a distance r are attracted to each other with equal and opposite forces directed along the line joining the particles. The common magnitude F of the two forces is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF=G(m1*m2/r^2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere G is an universal constant, called the constant of gravitation, and has the value 6.67259x10-11 N-m2/kg2 (3.4389x10-8 lb-ft2/slug2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\\\u0027s now look at the force that the Earth exerts on an object. If the object has a mass m, and the Earth has mass M, and the object\\\u0027s distance from the center of the Earth is r, then the force that the Earth exerts on the object is GmM /r2 . If we drop the object, the Earth\\\u0027s gravity will cause it to accelerate toward the center of the Earth. By Newton\\\u0027s second law (F = ma), this acceleration g must equal (GmM /r2)/m. g=GM/r^2\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow I understand everything up until \u0027If we drop the object, the Earth\\\u0027s gravity \u0027ect... is g=GM/r^2 the same as F=G(m1*m2/r^2) if it\\\u0027s not or im missing something basic i\\\u0027m sorry -.-... \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnswered from post 2 through 12 \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RevJB","CreatedById":21960,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-28T11:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Power,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI read physics at university/college so hopefully i can help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou asked...\u0027is g=GM/r^2 the same as F=G(m1*m2/r^2)?\\\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are similar, and this can trip people up but they are different in a subtle way. g in this case is the acceleration the object is experiencing and F is the Force.
