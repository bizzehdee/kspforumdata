CoM/CoL height, I believe a higher CoL should increase roll stability, as you roll the aircraft the CoM will end up to the side of the CoL, which will help pull it back level, but as you\u0027re also generating sideways lift I\u0027m not certain how much effect this has, certainly having a CoT of a rocket above the CoM doesn\u0027t improve stability in this way. \u00A0A more effective way to achieve roll stability\u00A0is with dihedral, ie the wing tips higher than the wing root, in this case as you roll the lower wing effectively has a greater lift area than the upper wing and therefore rolls you back up again. \u00A0Again with no gusts and plenty of reaction wheel torque this isn\u0027t much of an issue in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-27T15:04:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2016 03:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RizzoTheRat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stormdot5","CreatedById":112625,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T01:56:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222543270\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138044\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461762661\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002262412\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Callmedave\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Callmedave said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought the general rule was CoL was to be just behind CoM yours is behind and above, what affect does that have?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat would happen if it was below?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Centre of Lift being above the Centre of Mass should result in a more stable aeroplane.
