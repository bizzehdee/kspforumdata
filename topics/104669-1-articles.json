I didn\u0027t think it would be hard at first since I can make regular NASA\u0027s space shuttles in KSP but I\u0027ve been struggling with it for hours.![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nAs of now I made this version that works relatively well and can deliver up-to 36t in LKO. I\u0027d like some feedback on how you think the craft flies and what may need improvement. \n\nI didn\u0027t want to replicate all the intricate details of the real Buran as it will only add more parts and makes it even harder. But the core concept is very well the same.\n\nBalancing it all out was very hard. I wonder how the real Buran did it? As I don\u0027t think the mass of the shuttle and its payload was negligible as to there would be no need for \u0022tilted\u0022 engine to compensate for the center of mass being shifted.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Perform a roll program and after launch you can enable or the monoprop tanks on the craft.\n\nI tested it without mechjeb and it was actually easier to fly!\n\n![XS2d3Ci.png](https://i.imgur.com/XS2d3Ci.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T17:30:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Devinci**"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T14:45:07Z","Content":"Wow, that looks really nice!\n\nRepped!\n\n(PS: Are there any mods used?)"},{"CreatedByName":"Devinci","CreatedById":71469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T14:45:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wow, that looks really nice!\n\u003E Repped!\n\u003E \n\u003E (PS: Are there any mods used?)\n\nNo,it\u0027s all stock!!
