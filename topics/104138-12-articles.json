Making a (often major) decision on a whim and then ignoring the community feedback seems to have happened multiple times in my observation, the largest and most glaring example being the infamous 1.0 decision (not to mention Curse, I\u0027m glad to see that the modding community has largely ignored it and created the excellent KerbalStuff instead).\n\nI really hope that Squad listens to the feedback this time (and Harvester gives some kind of apology for his rather slap-in-your-face answer of \u0022mod it back yourself if you don\u0027t like it\u0022 instead of actually listening to what was being said). There\u0027s already enough of a wedge between Squad and the community due to Squad not properly addressing these kinds of issues, I really appreciate what Squad has done in creating KSP but I honestly don\u0027t really have much respect for them anymore based on how they\u0027ve treated the community.\n\nI don\u0027t expect them to bend over backwards for the community\u0027s every whim, but I do expect them to interact and dialogue with us, especially when making these kinds of decisions (especially when the community voices concerns) and at least explain their reasoning and be open to discussion on the issue even if they still ultimately go with their initial decision. Just ignoring a community breeds all kinds of FUD and speculation that could be largely avoided if Squad were a little more open on their decision making process instead of simply \u0022my way or the highway\u0022.
