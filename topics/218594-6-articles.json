I planned to have Valentina land next to them, and do\u00A0 a good old fashioned rescue (even if I did land fine!) So I built a new ship. Tried to name it in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and it changed to the map. Whereupon it jumped to Jeb\u0027s ship, which had then fallen \u003Cem\u003Einto\u003C/em\u003E the mun, and in some kind of unlit Kraken Zone, it fell 150km to the barycentre of the mun before imploding.\u00A0 Oops.\u00A0 I think there\u0027s a couple of minor little krakens lurking in here that aren\u0027t going to make it\u00A0 particularly playable for a while.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am however finding the flight control UI unintuitive in some areas.

I really like that and look forward to dropping landers around to try them out.\u00A0 So that\u0027s definitely to be commended.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nGetting them there might be a headache, though.\u00A0 I\u0027m not finding any delta-v change being displayed for burns, making orbital alterations difficult. I noticed the last time that there was a little \u0022progress bar\u0022, for an ongoing burn but its not intuitive, clear, nor conveying sufficient data.\u00A0 In KSP1 I have regularly managed to do landings on the mun without any manoeuvre node controls, and that is what probably helped me land.\u00A0 I\u0027m not convinced that a complete newcomer to KSP would enjoy the experience as much.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn a similar data problem, I\u0027m not finding it easy - or even possible - to get data on what my orbital periapsis or apoapsis are in the map. Again, insufficient data being displayed, or displayed in an unintuitive location I\u0027m yet to find.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd creating a manoeuvre in the map isnt as intuitive either, as the UI icons are bulkier and less crisp, so I think it needs a bit of cleaning up.\u00A0 But I am confident that it will be resolved to make a better game overall.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAmidst all the bugs and glitches, etc,\u00A0 however, I must say that I do see there is another diamond in the rough in the core of the game, and I\u0027m going to look forward to that. Those first impressions of the gameplay are positive.\u00A0 And while tutorials are mostly redundant for someone with more hours in KSP than I want to ever admit to, they\u0027re excellently done so far - albeit at the moment intrusive at moments - I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll be able to disable them later.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E(side note: Is it just me who thinks the voice actress for the tutorials sounds like\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003ENo\u00EBl Wells, the actress who played\u00A0D\u0027Vana Tendi in \u0022Lower Decks\u0022?\u00A0 \u00A0I know its not, but to my ears, it sounds rather similar. and I\u0027m laughing at the idea of someone getting typecast into playing green aliens...)\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n--\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is however one area which I\u0027ve not seen anyone else comment on, which does disappoint me greatly - and that is that it doesn\u0027t feel like a new game at this point. I know all the features of colonies etc are down the road some way, but here I am, building a ship with a Mk 1-3 capsule, a LTV30 or 45 engine, a Mk 16 parachute, etc etc.\u00A0 It feels like I\u0027ve just paid \u00A345 for the same game I bought 11 years\u00A0 ago, with a graphics update. While the core gameplay of KSP is excellent, and if its not broken, it would be foolish to try to fix it,\u00A0 this doesn\u0027t feel like a new game.\u00A0\u00A0Having the exact same components tarted up with a fresh lick of polys, to me, feels like KSP2 as it currently stands is not a sequel,\u00A0 but a remaster. Intellectually, I know that there probably isn\u0027t a single line of code shared between the two games, but emotionally, that it seems to be repeating the exact same thing so slavishly disappoints me.\u00A0 I\u0027m not sure I entirely like that aspect of KSP2.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n--\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m confident this will be a fantastic game, and will carry on KSP\u0027s legacy for another 10 years.\u00A0 I want to congratulate every one of the developers, And I hope that those criticisms don\u0027t hurt them, because I know what its like to be in their shoes.\u00A0 For each of those criticisms, I\u0027ve tried to emphasise a positive impression too.

eventually put it down because there was just not all that much new under the sun (so to speak).\u00A0 I\u0027ve been very much looking forward to many of the promised features of KSP2 for a long time now.\u00A0 I\u0027m pretty sad that we finally hit the EA date only to discover that there are none of the new features that I had been waiting to try out.\u00A0 Not only that, but the science collection gameplay mode has not even made it back in again.\u00A0 I was never a huge fan of just sandbox mode, but I\u0027ve always enjoyed the modes where you unlock more-cool stuff by doing things in game with the less-cool stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u00A0 said, I\u0027m sure that stuff will get better over time.\u00A0 My disappointment really comes from feeling like I have been on edge for so long now, and then when The Day finally arrives, I find out that it is still going to be quite some time before I can even just play what amounts to KSP1 with better graphics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProvided that things keep going, and don\u0027t just collapse for no good reason, I\u0027ll be back.\u00A0 But not until the game hits at least almost-feature-parity with KSP1 from a gameplay loop perspective.\u00A0 Even better would be when some of the new features/content comes online.\u00A0 Hopefully once a few of these milestones have been hit, some of the more difficult bugs and performance issues will have been worked out as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m glad to see folks here who are thrilled to be playing the game as it stands, but I\u0027m going to go back to waiting-and-seeing for a little while
