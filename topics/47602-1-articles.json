Whenever I build big, there\u0027s a certain beast I have to slay. I call it resonant stress calving. Struts are GREAT at keeping things from moving. The problem is with the really large scale structures, during launches and thick atmospheric decelerations, is that significant stresses can build up. I can\u0027t say for sure, but I imagine the stresses reflecting back and forth from one end of the craft to another, like in those physics games where link get redder the more stress they have. Struts don\u0027t have any give to them. If they give even a little, they snap. And the number of struts used seems to not have much effect on the resonant stress calving. While I was toying about with making handmade lander gear, I went with trusses instead of girders. During one of the many tests I did where I never even bothered to take pictures, I had one drop test going where I had a significant weight being dropped onto a prototype set of heavy lander legs. The feet survived, even down to the \u0022toes\u0022, with nary a snapped girder anywhere. However, components I just had strutted on had sheared clean off. Adding more struts did nothing. Then I suddenly noticed that parts of the lander legs had as few as one strut, and they held up fine. I realized that a combination of girders and struts can hold parts fast and secure, but still flex a bit under fantastic stresses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, from there on out, girders and struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T04:55:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NGTOne\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NGTOne\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2800 tons, with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38732-The-Far-Wanderer-Class-Mobile-Base\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis bad boy.\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELag-tastic, but it made it to Eve (as planned).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhackjob, care to compare notes? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertainly.
