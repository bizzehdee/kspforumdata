This is a bit of a shorter chapter; mainly showing off the CKFN\u0027s new toys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7ittO0xt.png\u0022 alt=\u00227ittO0xt.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECKFN:\u003C/strong\u003E Facility for Space Research, Danford\u0027s Office\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETwo Weeks Later\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanford leaned back in his desk, watching as the engineer standing in front of him drew the presentation to a close. The kerbal in question was lead engineer on the Space Programme\u0027s division working on the \u003Cem\u003EAurora\u003C/em\u003E capsule, \u003Cem\u003ECaelus\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 successor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanford reflected on what he\u0027d heard so far. It was really quite remarkable what the team had accomplished; in just over three months, they\u0027d come up with a far more capable and technologically-advanced ship compared to \u003Cem\u003ECaelus\u003C/em\u003E. The engineer\u0027s face positively shone with pride at what they\u0027d done as he pointed at a technical diagram of the capsule. Danford liked that, it really showed how dedicated his crew was towards the Programme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ffbGBbT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ffbGBbT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineer concluded his speech. \u0022So as you can see sir, \u003Cem\u003EAurora\u003C/em\u003E has a completely redesigned thermal cooling system, which can and will prevent any incidents like the one with \u003Cem\u003ECaelus III\u003C/em\u003E on its Munar trip. Do you have any further questions?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanford did. \u0022I noticed that the capsule appears to have two docking ports, one fore and one aft. Are those both going to be functional?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes sir, the capsule will indeed be able to connect to two spacecraft at once. In fact, we envisioned it as connecting both to the Munar lander as well as a \u003Cem\u003EJanus\u003C/em\u003E refuelling spacecraft.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1KKqldf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221KKqldf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ah excellent,\u0022 Danford then glanced at some of the more detailed specifications for the spacecraft. \u0022What\u0027s this I see? There\u0027s no liquid fuel carried on board?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This was a suggestion from one of the Propulsion Engineers; we wanted to make \u003Cem\u003EAurora\u003C/em\u003E as safe as possible. So we did away with conventional liquid fuel and oxidizer, and designed the monopropellant in the RCS system to be used for main propulsion as well as fine position control. This will make for a ship which won\u0027t detonate if a tank is breached, as well as giving it exceptional long-term capabilities. The fuel will be just as viable two years from now as it is today. Of course, that does come at the cost of reduced delta-v once in orbit.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oRo57ev.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oRo57ev.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s not too big of a problem,\u0022 Danford replied. \u0022\u003Cem\u003EAurora\u003C/em\u003E should mainly act as a command-and-control vessel for larger spacecraft or carry crew up to low orbit. I don\u0027t expect it will have to venture out into deep space on its own. Speaking of which, you mentioned \u003Cem\u003EJanus\u003C/em\u003E during your presentation. What\u0027s the news on the updated version of that vessel?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ah yes, \u003Cem\u003EJanus\u003C/em\u003E is a very simple craft so it was trivial to simply widen the body to accommodate \u003Cem\u003EAurora\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s ventral docking port, as well as fit more fuel as well as an engine on-board. In fact, we have an early version of that ship ready for launch, which can occur as soon as \u003Cem\u003EJupiter I\u003C/em\u003E is ready.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Fantastic. I just heard from Dilbrett that he\u0027s planning to launch the \u003Cem\u003EJupiter I\u003C/em\u003E prototype within the week, if everything goes well.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UPS7MM2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UPS7MM2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That is excellent news. I think this is everything you need to know about the capsule. I\u0027ll get an intern to give you a complete technical readout of our designs.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanford leaned back in his chair. \u0022That would be much appreciated, thank you. Now, speaking of launch dates, how long do you think the capsule will take to complete?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineer deflated somewhat, losing his earlier good cheer. \u0022Well, sir, that\u0027s something I wanted to talk to you about.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Go ahead.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The Vehicle Assembly Building is proving to be entirely unsuitable for our needs; the facilities simply aren\u0027t up to the task of the high-precision work necessary to assemble the capsule. We\u0027ve tried to outsource as much as possible, but the most we can give you is a simple boilerplate, with only basic systems included.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hmm. So basically we can\u0027t get to the Mun without better tech?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Exactly, sir. There\u0027s just no way to build a spacecraft which is rugged enough to get to the Mun and stay there with our current equipment.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ve been trying for months to get Bilcas to allocate more funds to the Space Program for precisely that reason, but he keeps refusing me. Maybe this news will pressure him into finally coming through for us.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hopefully, sir. In the meantime, what would you prefer my team focus on? We could assist Dilbrett\u0027s team with the \u003Cem\u003EJupiter\u003C/em\u003E prototype, get it to the launchpad a few days ahead of schedule?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, no, your time is better spent elsewhere. Continue working on \u003Cem\u003EAurora\u003C/em\u003E, at the very least build the boilerplate, as we can launch \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E. Make sure your team is ready to begin building the capsule as soon as the required facilities become available. When you\u0027re through with that, focus on the Munar lander. We\u0027re going to want to put a kerbal on the surface, after all.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Very good sir! I\u0027ll let my team know!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F1pwRXB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022F1pwRXB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few days later, in the VAB, Danford paid a visit to Dilbrett\u0027s team. \u0022How goes the \u003Cem\u003EJupiter\u003C/em\u003E?\u0022 the Director called out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA kerbal in the middle of welding a seam in a rocket engine, face covered by a mask, looked up. Upon seeing Danford, he shut off his torch and lifted the mask. Beneath was Dilbrett\u0027s face, smeared with grease. \u0022Hey Danford! Everything\u0027s going well, thanks! It\u0027s good to see you! Want a coffee?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDilbrett pointed at a battered, ancient coffee machine which looked like it predated the Great War. Danford wouldn\u0027t have been surprised if it burned \u003Cem\u003Ecoal\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ah, I\u0027ll pass, thanks.\u0022 He looked up at the body of the prototype \u003Cem\u003EJupiter I\u003C/em\u003E, looming large overhead. \u0022I see you\u0027re making good progress on the rocket. When\u0027s the expected launch date?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shouldn\u0027t be much more than a few more days,\u0022 Dilbrett said, somewhat preoccupied with working his thick welding gloves off his fingers. \u0022The fuel tanks are complete, and once we finalize work on the main engine, she\u0027ll be ready to fly!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanford took note of the massive engine bell. \u0022That certainly is a main engine. I think I could fit my car in there!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ha! We\u0027ve taken to calling it the \u0027Mainsail\u0027 around here, the thrust it\u0027ll output is comparable to one of the city-states\u0027 total power plants\u0027 outputs in a year!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanford chuckled. \u0022So will this be the final version of \u003Cem\u003EJupiter\u003C/em\u003E which will fly, Brett?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not entirely. The rocket you see here is just the final prototype of the \u003Cem\u003EJupiter I\u003C/em\u003E lifter. When we launch, it won\u0027t even have a second stage on board; it\u0027s just to test the engine and to make sure that all systems work properly. 2.5 metre rockets are no joke, after all.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDilbrett\u0027s smile faded as his thoughts obviously turned to the USKK\u0027s ill-fated \u003Cem\u003EUranus IX\u003C/em\u003E. Danford tried to take his mind off the situation by changing the subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So, uh, I heard you guys were planning on making this recoverable?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvidently, this was the right thing to say, as the smile returned to the lead engineer\u0027s face. \u0022We are! Of course, today\u0027s rocket won\u0027t be, but there are plans to outfit future rockets with the technology.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So will it let you land the rocket stages safely?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, the initial designs will add landing legs and parachutes to the \u003Cem\u003EJupiter\u003C/em\u003E first stages. This should let the stage come back down, be refurbished, and reused on a future launch. This should bring costs down a great deal!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s good to hear. Apparently we\u0027re going to need more advanced facilities in order to make it to the Mun with \u003Cem\u003EAurora\u003C/em\u003E, so we\u0027re going to have to do some major cost-saving efforts around here. Recycling our rockets will be a great way to do that!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Cost-saving? You mean we won\u0027t be able to replace the coffee machine?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe machine in question chose that moment to unleash a particularly nasty-sounding gurgle, and belched a cloud of thick, black smoke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ah, well, we\u0027ll see about the coffee maker. I may be able to pass its replacement off under \u0027kerbal rights\u0027.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Excellent, that\u0027s good to hear! I\u0027m beginning to suspect it may be possessed by some sort of demon.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Really? You believe in that sort of thing? Why that\u0027s just---\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe coffee maker let out more smoke, this time emitting a noise which sounded a little too much like a roar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I---er---I\u0027ll look into it. Good luck on the rocket, Brett!\u0022 Danford beat a hasty retreat, making a note to get that coffee maker replaced---or at the very least exorcised---immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RUbCH8k.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RUbCH8k.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree days later, Danford grinned as he watched the \u003Cem\u003EJupiter I\u003C/em\u003E rocket roll out to the launchpad. Completed at last, the ship shone in the morning sun. For a change, Mission Control wouldn\u0027t be monitoring this launch. No complicated payload stood atop this rocket, rather it was Instead, the engineers had the run of the launch controls. This would be as simple as one of the old sounding rocket launches they\u0027d done a year or two ago. Rocket lifts off, rocket reaches highest point, rocket comes down. Simplicity itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA shout from the launchpad alerted him that fuelling had completed, and the rocket was nearly ready for takeoff. Soon enough, the ship\u0027s umbilical cables disconnected, and it leapt into the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N2SOyBO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022N2SOyBO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELeapt\u003C/em\u003E was perhaps an understatement; the thrust of the main engine was designed to carry both an upper stage \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E a sizable payload, so its Thrust to Weight ratio was far greater than the rockets Danford had seen launched so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the blink of an eye, it cleared the tower and was on its way to climbing higher than the mountains near the Space Facility. Soon, it was almost too small to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/haYF2Cz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022haYF2Cz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanford looked over to the engineers manning a makeshift Mission Control; a tech kept a radio dish pointed at the rocket, receiving telemetry and performance data from the vehicle. This was displayed on a number of screens all connected together with some unholy tangle of wires. Two engineers monitored the data, and a printer was busily outputting the most important information onto a long strip of paper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How\u0027s the rocket looking?\u0022 the Director asked. One engineer looked up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022She\u0027s performing very well, but the higher acceleration is playing all sorts of havoc with our aerodynamic results. She\u0027s barely made 5 klicks and already is at Mach 1!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other piped in, not looking up from his monitor. \u0022We\u0027re getting a nasty temperature rise on the upper portions of the rocket, I don\u0027t think that nose cone\u0027s going to last much longer!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EeJ5sqf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EeJ5sqf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the tech said that, several numbers went into the red, and suddenly they cut out altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well dang, there goes the transceiver, probably fried by the heat. If that\u0027s gone, we don\u0027t have any control over the ship anymore.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbal pointed up to the sky, where the trail of smoke left by the rocket was now tilting to the left, as the rocket tipped over and began its long fall back to Kerbin. Fortunately, the Space Facility wasn\u0027t near any civilian-populated areas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LM8Yr3m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LM8Yr3m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanford was somewhat worried by this. \u0022If you lose control authority when things get warm, isn\u0027t that bad?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second engineer chuckled. \u0022Well yeah, if you wind up going over Mach 2 under 10 klicks, shock heating\u0027s going to cook your goose for sure. With an actual payload underneath, there\u0027s no way we\u0027ll reach those speeds that early into the flight.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first tech showed Danford the long strip of output numbers. \u0022Look at these thrust and temperature readings on the Mainsail itself! Gorgeous!\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanford thought that the numbers looked rather like random values, but he smiled and \u003Cem\u003Emhmm\u003C/em\u003E\u0027d at the kerbal. Still, if the engineer was happy, Danford was happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe walked away, adding elements to his mental checklist. Now that the launcher was well on its way to completion, all the Space Programme needed was to build \u003Cem\u003EAurora\u003C/em\u003E, and design a Munar lander system. The Mun drew ever closer, and with the USKK out of the picture, his workers had the luxury of time and being able to double-check their work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were making excellent progress; he had no doubts that one day soon the CKFN would land a kerbal on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rolanvorxariat","CreatedById":117146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T06:20:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmazing as always.

Aerospace developments don\u0027t happen overnight!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoliana\u0027s jaw set. \u0022With all due respect, now that the CKFN has proven they have a 2.5 meter launch vehicle, it may be best to re-task the division to focus primarily on a wide-bodied lifter of our own.\u0022 She picked up a grainy surveillance photograph and waved it around to punctuate her point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe sighed. \u0022Perhaps you could get them to dig up the \u003Cem\u003EUranus IX\u003C/em\u003E specifications, focus on solving the first-stage overheating issues?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob was adamant. \u0022Give them time. \u003Cem\u003EUranus IX\u003C/em\u003E was a rush job, built just to beat the CKFN to the Mun. It failed. The techs need to take things slowly and make sure they don\u0027t miss any rocket designs which could be more efficient than the current ones.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Very well sir.\u0022 Joliana grumbled. She pulled another paper out of the stack she was carrying. \u0022In other news, it looks like there are still complaints about lack of direction from the Space Center staff, though those have decreased substantially from the engineers. In my opinion, sir, we need to get Bill to decide what the Space Program should focus on.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What\u0027s the mood in the capital? With those government observers finally gone, maybe Bill will want to finally focus on the Program? Then again, he\u0027s been over there for a good week now. It doesn\u0027t take a genius to figure out that something big\u0027s going down.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t know, sir.

Well, whatever it is, it\u0027s been consuming a great deal of Bill\u0027s time. In fact...\u0022 Bob\u0027s face drew into a wide grin, the one Joliana associated with one of his schemes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOh no,\u003C/em\u003E she thought to herself. \u003Cem\u003EWhat does he have planned now?\u003C/em\u003E \u0022Sir?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It may be time to take a little vacation.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A...vacation?\u0022 Whatever it was Joliana expected to come out of Bob\u0027s mouth, it was certainly not this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, but not to the Dazian Beaches. I\u0027ll have need for your skills; I\u0027m planning to go hunting for a certain kerbal, one who can tie .\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And that kerbal would be...?\u0022 The question was almost redundant, as she realized there was only one possible answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jebediah Kerman,\u0022 was Bob\u0027s response, and Joliana sighed, suspicions confirmed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022*With all due respect---*\u0022 Before she could commence her rant on why bringing back Jebediah was a *terrible idea*, Bob cut her off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I know what you\u0027re going to say; his policies caused the death of three kerbals, chaos in the engineering department, and put us seriously behind in the space technology race with the CKFN.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You are correct, sir.\u0022 Those three topics were \u003Cem\u003Eprecisely\u003C/em\u003E what Joliana was going to mention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Which is why I want to bring Jeb back, but in an advisory role only. You can\u0027t deny the kerbal had *vision*! His plans and ideas brought us to dominate Low Kerbin Orbit for nearly a year, doing research which is still bearing fruit for scientists here on Kerbin.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Then launch more kerbals into orbit. It doesn\u0027t take Jebediah to tell you that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The game has changed, Joli. Jeb\u0027s got more imagination than the entire administration of this Program, and we\u0027re going to need that if we want to beat the CKFN to the Mun, especially with their advantages over us so far.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoliana massaged her forehead. \u0022All right. \u003Cem\u003ESuppose\u003C/em\u003E Jebediah would be an asset to the Program, rather than the liability he\u0027s proven to be. How do you propose to find him? He\u0027s dropped completely off the map.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I have a few ideas, the first and foremost his old hometown. There\u0027s bound to be someone there who he\u0027s talked to recently.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You do realize you don\u0027t require me if all you want to do is talk to Jeb\u0027s old friends, correct?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, I do require your connections. Bill\u0027s likely to be back within a few days, and I need to get up north quickly. Do you happen to know of any jets I could borrow?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe sighed. \u0022I do know of a craft or two I could borrow for a day or two. But I doubt you know how to fly one, they\u0027re fairly new technology.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob bowed his head, conceding that much. \u0022You are correct, I can\u0027t fly a plane. Besides, I have a bit of an...issue...with heights. Perhaps you could chauffeur me? You \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E my personal assistant, after all.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I suppose so, sir.\u0022 While Joliana grumbled externally, she was secretly glad for this opportunity. She quite enjoyed flying the new prototype jet planes USI had been developing, and this would be an excellent opportunity to get away from the dullness of her duties here at the Space Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Excellent, let me know when you have it ready, I have a few last-minute arrangements to make. The sooner we leave, the better the chance we get back before Bill returns.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vMg8ySGt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vMg8ySGt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUSKK:\u003C/strong\u003E Kolus City, Legislative Buildings, Prime Minister\u0027s Office \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThree Hours Later\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill Kerman leaned forward in disbelief. \u0022So what is it you\u0027re saying, sir?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Prime Minister of the USKK leaned back in his seat. \u0022I am saying that Parliament was not satisfied with the governmental investigators\u0027 reports.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But I\u0027ve worked to include their suggestions over the past few months into Space Program policy! That\u0027s the entire reason I\u0027ve been here so often over the last few months.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Now, don\u0027t get me wrong. I appreciate your cooperation with the government regarding the policy changes, but there is a subset of Parliament which thinks that more extreme measures are needed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And those extreme measures are to put the Space Program under government control.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes. Bill, I know the independent Program has covered a lot of ground over the past few years and done wonderful things for science and public inspiration, but to be honest, Parliament has lost faith.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What? After a single accident?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Prime Minister sighed. \u0022It\u0027s not just that. Look, Bill, we\u0027ve been seeing diminishing returns from the Program. Your most recent missions haven\u0027t given much of a technological advantage or done as much useful science as the initial ones. My colleagues and I believe that greater good can be accomplished by beating the CKFN on the home front, rather than trying to explore a new frontier.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill\u0027s shoulders slumped. \u0022Surely public opinion counts for something? The people are incredibly enthusiastic about the Program!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not particularly. The most recent public opinion polls reveal that the explosion of *Uranus IX*---the debris killed nineteen civilians, thank Harv it wasn\u0027t more---has made the public far more worried about the impact that space travel has on both themselves as kerbals, and on the nation itself. I daresay very few kerbals will go out to watch the next rocket launch.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill conceded the point. \u0022You\u0027ve stated Parliament\u0027s worries. What are these increased governmental controls?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Prime Minister passed a sheet of paper over the desk to Bill. \u0022As you can see, the document---Bill UK-67---outlines the transition towards a government-overseen space agency. The Director---which is you, of course---will be replaced with a governmental-chosen candidate who will answer directly to Parliament, and the Program\u0027s funding will also be overseen by that body. Naturally, you are free to continue working with the Program, just not as its Director.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill kept reading. \u0022What\u0027s this at the bottom? You\u0027re restricting launch sizes? This would prevent the Program from launching anything but tiny probes! Correction, tiny probes to *low orbit*!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ah yes, an excellent suggestion from one of my colleagues. There was a great deal of concern over the \u003Cem\u003EUranus IX\u003C/em\u003E explosion, and many in Parliament feared that more kerbals would be at risk if there existed additional, less obvious, flaws in the engineering work or policies. This size and payload restriction will let any unforeseen kinks work their way out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But this puts us completely out of the race for the Mun! The CKFN will surely beat us there if we\u0027re stuck launching tiny payloads!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Prime Minister raised an eyebrow. \u0022Bill, I believe your Program is operating under the impression that the USKK is desperately competing with the CKFN in space. While they have admittedly made some progress there, their achievements have merely matched your own. This government believes that effort should be spent on beating the CKFN in more functional applications, such as economic dominance, or militarily. Your Program should be focused on that as well, rather than attempting to send kerbals straight for the Mun, which is as far as our scientists can tell, a featureless rock.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So that\u0027s it? The Program is finished?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s *finished*. The Bill is still in its early stages, and Parliament will not vote on it for a few months. I\u0027m informing you of its existence now to give you time to let go of non-essential staff, gear down production, and prepare for a successor.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You mean the Bill isn\u0027t in effect yet? There\u0027s a chance to stop it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this, the Prime Minister let out a sigh. \u0022No. Bill, this---*ahem*---bill is a near-certainty in my books. I highly advise against trying to fight this; all it will do is tarnish your reputation further.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill stood up. \u0022Very well. I suppose we\u0027re done here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Bill walked towards the door, the Prime Minister spoke. \u0022Bill, don\u0027t get me wrong, I admire what you managed to do these past few years. But this nation needs to stand \u003Cem\u003Etogether\u003C/em\u003E against the CKFN, not be divided over the Space Program.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill left the office. Regardless what the Prime Minister said, he was going to fight this bill. The Space Program couldn\u0027t be snuffed out that easily!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vMg8ySGt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vMg8ySGt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUSKK:\u003C/strong\u003E Tenby, Jebediah Kerman\u0027s hometown \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOne day later\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a practised hand, Joliana set the aircraft she\u0027d procured down on the cracked tarmac of a back lot. She suspected that a town as small as this wouldn\u0027t get much air traffic, particularly a cutting-edge Vertical Take Off and Landing design. She just hoped it was out of the way enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Where did you have in mind for searching for Jebediah, sir?\u0022 she asked as the two exited the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I thought we\u0027d walk around and get to know the place, see if anyone knows of Jeb, then take it from there. We\u0027re in no real rush, Bill\u0027s not due back from the capital for a few days.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it turned out, finding information about Jeb was less difficult than they\u0027d initially thought. The town appeared to be proud of their famous kerbal, and most kerbals they talked to had some anecdote or another about Jeb. However, it wasn\u0027t until they met the local general store owner when they found information of value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ah, Jeb! You know, he\u0027s a bigwig at the Space Program now! I did so enjoy watching those rockets go up on the TV---except for that most recent one. \u0027Tis a pity. Ah, I remember when Jeb still lived here though, must have been, oh, twenty, twenty-five years ago? He used to pop down to the store for snacks every weekend! Ah, that was before the Great War, you know, I nearly had to shut down the store during that conflict! Terrible for business, that was.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, ah, I can imagine. Do you know if Jeb has been back in town recently? We\u0027re looking for him; he left the Space Program nearly four months ago.\u0022 asked Bob, clearly a little impatient with this kerbal\u0027s stories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Huh, well I can\u0027t recall Jeb being back in town recently; he\u0027d surely have come by to visit me! But if you want to know more about where Jeb might be, I\u0027d check with Valentina. She\u0027s an old flame of his; they were close for a while a few years ago.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hmm, do you have any idea how we could get in touch with her?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I think she\u0027s one of them fancy new fighter jet pilots now, but I just heard she\u0027s back in town. You can probably find her at the bar down the street, to tell you the truth. But what\u0027s this about Jeb not being with the Program any more?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoliana could see that Bob had no desire to continue the conversation now that he had the information he needed. So she quickly intervened. \u0022I\u0027m afraid we don\u0027t have much time, and have to run. Thank you for your cooperation!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bar the shopkeeper mentioned was a quiet affair, certainly no wretched hive of scum and villainy like what Joliana was expecting. Evidently the locals preferred their drinks in peace. Still, she must be cautious. Entering, Bob made his way to the barkeeper, a heavyset kerbal cleaning out some glasses. Joliana followed, keeping her eye out for trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Excuse me,\u0022 Bob asked. \u0022Is Valentina Kerman here tonight?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe barkeeper made an affirmative-sounding grunt and jerked a thumb towards a corner booth. Bob thanked the kerbal and the two made their way over to the table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon reaching it, Bob spoke. \u0022Valentina Kerman, I presume?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Who\u0027s asking?\u0022 came the response. The kerbal appeared uninterested. \u0022Look, whatever it is you want, I probs won\u0027t be able to give it to ya, my squadron\u0027s shipping out tomorrow morning.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t worry. All I need is information. On one certain Jebediah Kerman.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this, Valentina raised an eyebrow. \u0022Jeb? Jeez, I haven\u0027t spoken to \u003Cem\u003Ehim\u003C/em\u003E in years. Why are you asking me, by Mu? Isn\u0027t he some sort of bigwig at the Space Program now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob slipped into the seat opposite Valentina. \u0022Yes, up to about four months ago. He\u0027s vanished off the map, and we\u0027re trying to find him. I\u0027ve been told you were close to him...do you have any idea where he might have gone?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other kerbal\u0027s eyes narrowed. \u0022Before I go telling you Jeb\u0027s life story, mind if I ask just who you are?

This here is my assistant, Joliana.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina leaned back in her chair. \u0022Ah, so \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u0027re\u003C/em\u003E Bob. I recall Jeb mentioning you a couple times. Nice to meet you.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Likewise. So, how about it? Any idea where Jeb may have gone?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina\u0027s brow wrinkled. \u0022Well, I can\u0027t tell you much for certain, but I do know he\u0027s got a cabin up in the northern woods. You used to only be able to get to it by hiking, but nowadays I\u0027m sure you can just fly there, though you might have a bit of a time landing your plane! I\u0027ll give you the coords if you want to check the place out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027ll manage, and the coordinates would be most helpful, thank you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, I\u0027m not sure why you\u0027d need them again, \u0027specially after your guys asked me about this a few weeks ago. Maybe they got lost, heh?\u0022 She scribbled down some numbers on the back of a napkin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Our guys?\u0022 asked Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, the big dudes with weird accents. Said they were from the Space Program too.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this, Joliana\u0027s eyes widened, coming to a realization. She caught hold of Bob\u0027s sleeve. \u0022Excuse me, sir, but we need to leave.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking around, Bob looked like he was about to protest, but thought better of it when he saw the look in Joliana\u0027s eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ah, very well. Thank you for the information, Valentina. I\u0027ll say hi to Jeb for you when we see him.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, yeah, whatever...\u0022 The pilot turned her attention back to her drink. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutside, Bob turned to Joliana. \u0022Do you mind telling me what that was all about?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe didn\u0027t turn around, but kept walking quickly towards where they\u0027d parked the aircraft. \u0022The CKFN.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Were there agents in the bar? I didn\u0027t see...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, they were the ones who talked to Valentina!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You sure? It could have been just a couple of concerned citizens, looking for the founder of the Space Program.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Think about it, your rival\u0027s space program\u0027s leader just up and quits after a rocket blows up. If I was the CKFN, I would spend all my efforts determining his whereabouts. An opportunity like this would be too good to pass up, if you ask me.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob had caught up to her now. \u0022You don\u0027t mean that Jeb\u0027s...in danger from these agents?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHer face darkened. \u0022I don\u0027t know. But we need to get to that cabin before they do.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShooing away a couple of small children who were enamoured by the plane\u0027s sleek lines, she climbed in the cockpit and began the engine start-up sequence, before rocketing into the sky and towards the provided coordinates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--- \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vMg8ySGt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vMg8ySGt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUSKK:\u003C/strong\u003E Jeb\u0027s Summer Cabin, Northern USKK \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETwo hours later\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEyeing the terrain below, Joliana glanced over her shoulder. \u0022We\u0027re less than five kilometers out, sir. I suggest you strap in; this could be a rough landing.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENervously peering out at the endless expanse of trees, Bob did as she asked. \u0022Doesn\u0027t look like any clearings ahead. Is this plane strong enough to survive a landing on top of a tree?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Theoretically.\u0022 This did not appear to calm Bob\u0027s nerves, already appeared to be on edge due to the height. \u0022I imagine the cabin has some sort of clearing around it, though.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo Joliana\u0027s relief (and likely Bob\u0027s as well), the cabin did indeed have a patch of grass surrounding it, flat and wide enough to serve as a makeshift landing pad. She brought the plane down once more as smooth as a feather, though she did catch a wing on one of the surrounding trees\u0027 branches. Hopefully the paint wasn\u0027t scratched, or she\u0027d never hear the end of it back at USI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter exiting the plane, Joliana crept carefully up to the cabin, sitting serenely on top of a rise in the grass. She motioned Bob to get down behind a rock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You can\u0027t possibly think those CKFN agents got here first, now do you? We were going so fast in that plane I thought it was going to split in half!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob, they\u0027ve had weeks to get here. Even on foot, it\u0027s not too far from the nearest town.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, it doesn\u0027t look like anyone\u0027s here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s what I\u0027m afraid of,\u0022 Joliana said darkly. If the agents had already come and gone and encountered Jebediah---, well, Bob\u0027s plan to breathe more life into the Space Program would very quickly fall apart. \u0022Let\u0027s move up.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two crept closer to the cabin, and Joliana tried the door. \u0022Locked.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good or bad sign?\u0022 asked Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not sure, give me a second and I\u0027ll get this open,\u0022 she said, pulling a custom-built lockpick from her utility belt and reaching for the lock. It was an old-fashioned single-tumbler design and she unlocked it easily enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the door opened, a wave of dust poured out. Bob looked like he was about to begin a coughing fit, but he put a hand over his mouth and stepped to the side, suppressing it. Joliana held her breath and ventured into the cabin. It didn\u0027t take her long to conclude Jebediah wasn\u0027t there. In fact, it didn\u0027t look like anyone had lived there for years, based upon the lack of personal belongings and several-centimetre-thick layer of dust that lay over everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob walked in. \u0022Well---*ahem*---it looks like Jeb didn\u0027t come back to his cabin after all. By Max, where could he be?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not sure. Any more ideas as to places to look for him?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There might be another place he could be at, but it\u0027s hard to say if it\u0027ll be another wild goose chase or not.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ll take any lead over no lead,\u0022 Joliana said as she walked back outside. Then she froze. A tall kerbal dressed in hiking clothes stood outside, about halfway down the hill. He spoke crisply, in a clear CKFN accent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ah, hello there! Do either of you chaps happen to know where one might find a certain Jebediah Kerman? We were told this cabin belonged to him.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoliana drew her service pistol and levelled it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Put your hands up, Confederate scum.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CKFN spy, for his credit, did not freeze, but leaped behind several rocks in one swift, fluid movement. That didn\u0027t stop Joliana from letting off several shots, but their only effect was to send a few rock chips flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027re going, Bob!\u0022 she yelled at the kerbal still inside the cabin. A second or two later, Bob emerged, half-covered in dust. He looked like he dove to the floor the second he\u0027d heard gunfire. \u003Cem\u003ESmart.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom behind the rocks, she could hear the CKFN agent speaking into his wrist radio. \u0022Nox 2, I\u0027ve come under fire from enemy units at the cabin, repeat, hostiles engaged.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowing the agent was calling for backup, Joliana grabbed Bob by the collar and took off running for the plane. She managed to get a few shots off, but unfortunately didn\u0027t hit anything. Still, it stopped the agent from returning fire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the two reached the aircraft. Joliana shoved Bob up the ladder, and quickly followed. She wasted no time with pre-flight checklists, but rather fed fuel to the engines (still warm from their landing not ten minutes earlier) and shoved the throttle forward. The aircraft\u0027s vertical-facing engines roared to life, scorching the grass underneath. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the aircraft had cleared the treetop, Joliana immediately spooled up the main jet engines, shoving them both back in their seats as the plane accelerated away. She could see Bob\u0027s knuckles turning white as he desperately clutched his seat\u0027s armrests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, putting some distance between them and the agents, she let out the breath she\u0027d been holding. She turned to Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Confirmation of CKFN agents operating here is \u003Cem\u003Edefinitely\u003C/em\u003E something USI should know about. I\u0027m going to need to call this in. Mind getting in the back while I call?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure. I imagine you want to know where we\u0027re headed next first, though?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Right. You said you had an idea to where Jebediah may have gone?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes. A year or two back, Jeb wanted to open up an airbase on one of the islands north of the Space Center. He intended it to be a hub of shipping and transportation. He even started spending a lot of time up there, flying back and forth himself in an early-model aircraft.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So is that airbase still there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, but it never proved to be financially viable. The Space Program\u0027s funders wrote it up as a loss and the place was shut down. I can\u0027t imagine why Jeb would want to go there, but it\u0027s the place with the next-closest connection I can think of.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022All right, I\u0027ll set a course for the airbase now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vMg8ySGt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vMg8ySGt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUSKK:\u003C/strong\u003E Space Center, Bill Kerman\u0027s Office \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFour hours later\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill watched shadows outside getting longer and longer as the sun set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe sighed. What could he do? From where he was sitting, the government was right. The Space Program \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E divided, unfocused, and would probably not make it to the Mun before the CKFN regardless. He\u0027d recently seen some improvement, particularly with the engineers, but it was almost certainly too little, too late. In a few months, the Space Program would be over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot for the first time in recent days, he found himself wondering what Jeb would have done, if he was around. Then, he cursed himself for thinking of that kerbal. It was \u003Cem\u003EJeb\u003C/em\u003E who was responsible for all this. His policies, his apathy towards proper safety procedures, and then dumping the whole Program\u0027s responsibility onto Bill at the first sign of trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, Bill sighed. *If only that blasted rocket hadn\u0027t blown up*. He\u0027d tried his best to keep the Program together in the aftermath of *Uranus IX*, but he just wasn\u0027t cut out for the job of Director. No matter how much direction he\u0027d tried to give the Program, it never seemed to be enough. There was always more work to be done, another governmental investigator to satisfy, another document which required his signature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMaybe this is for the best, though,\u003C/em\u003E he thought, as the sun disappeared over the horizon, shrouding his office in darkness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--- \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vMg8ySGt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vMg8ySGt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUSKK:\u003C/strong\u003E Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Personal Retreat \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFive hours later\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It appears the runway is not in terrible shape, I\u0027ll land conventionally.\u0022 Joliana brought the plane down and taxied towards the main aircraft hangers. \u0022Where do you expect to find Jebediah?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob scratched his chin. \u0022There\u0027s a series of old administration buildings further inland, but let\u0027s first check the aircraft hangers. Jeb\u0027s always loved planes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane came to a stop, and the two exited, approaching the largest of the hangers. Before they got halfway there, a voice stopped them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hello, Bob.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lone figure emerged from the base\u0027s aircraft control tower, and walked toward Bob and Joliana. It was Jebediah Kerman, looking tired and scruffy, with week-old stubble and large bags under his eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, it\u0027s good to see you! How have you, ah, been?\u0022 Bob said, quite happily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe former Director took a moment to reply. \u0022I\u0027ve...been getting by. Why did you come here?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, I\u0027m going to be honest with you. We need you back at the Space Program.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this, Jebediah turned away. \u0022Didn\u0027t you hear me after \u003Cem\u003EUranus IX\u003C/em\u003E exploded? I\u0027m done. Done with killing kerbals and done with space.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t believe that for a second. What happened to the optimistic kerbal who believed in the Space Program? Who believed we could make a difference in the world? Who believed we could explore space peacefully, and for the betterment of all of Kerbin?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022He\u0027s gone, Bob.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoliana smiled to herself. Having witnessed the inspirational speeches Bob liked to whip up, she had a feeling this would be an entertaining exchange. Meanwhile, Jeb continued his self-pitying spiel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022After \u003Cem\u003EUranus IX\u003C/em\u003E exploded, I saw first-hand what \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E had done to the Space Program, and I hated myself for it. I can\u0027t go back. I stay here, and wander this base. The empty hangers remind me of my penance, and I must stay here to live through it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoliana suppressed another smile. \u003Cem\u003EReally?\u003C/em\u003E That sort of thing sounded like what an adolescent would write into their diary while trying to be all \u0027deep\u0027 and insisting to their mother that \u0027this wasn\u0027t a phase\u0027. She deeply hoped Bob would put some sense into the kerbal, because she was on the verge of speaking up herself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022C\u0027mon, Jeb. If you feel like you committed a crime, turn yourself in, go to jail. Don\u0027t wander around an abandoned airbase for three-and-a-half months! Don\u0027t beat yourself up over *IX*, it was as much Danbro\u0027s fault as yours.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb\u0027s shoulders slumped. \u0022Maybe---maybe you\u0027re right, but how can I help the Program any more? I drove it straight into the ground.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m damn sure I\u0027m right, otherwise I wouldn\u0027t even be here! Jeb, you\u0027re a \u003Cem\u003Efantastic\u003C/em\u003E asset to the Space Program. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m no Director. You saw first-hand the results of my policies.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Maybe so, but you can\u0027t deny that your imagination and drive led us to soundly beat the CKFN to low orbit, and we very nearly beat them to the Mun as well!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoliana saw Jeb smile. It was a very faint smile, but a smile nonetheless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s...that\u0027s true.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022By Harv, it\u0027s true!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But I caused *Uranus IX*. The kerbals at the Space Center and across the USKK won\u0027t accept me back.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027d be surprised as to what can be forgiven, Jeb. And besides, there\u0027s one more reason why we need you back at the Space Program.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoliana saw Bob pull a photograph out of his pocket and show it to Jeb. By that kerbal\u0027s reaction, she could tell exactly what photograph it was: the CKFN\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EJupiter\u003C/em\u003E rocket from earlier. She\u0027d have to liberate that from Bob at some point, classified information like that \u003Cem\u003Ecertainly\u003C/em\u003E did not belong out in the field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Is that what I think it is?\u0022 asked Jeb, dumbfounded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It sure is. The CKFN launched a 2.5 meter rocket without any issues. Now do you see why we need you back? If the CKFN makes it to the Mun first, they\u0027ll establish a massive lead in space travel. Who knows what they\u0027ll find up there? Maybe the new territory will give them the confidence to declare war on the USKK and wipe us all out!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb snorted, then smiled a little bit more. \u0022Don\u0027t you think that\u0027s just a bit unreasonable?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Maybe, but who really knows what\u0027s up up there? Besides, keeping the CKFN from establishing a monopoly over space travel will be good for everyone.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hah! You think they\u0027d start selling meteor chunks or something?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022At ridiculously steep prices, no doubt.\u0022 Bob started chuckling, and Jeb joined in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe former Director broke into a full smile. \u0022You don\u0027t know how good it feels to laugh again.

The term was nearly up for the CKFN\u0027s current President, and the entire country was preparing for the elections next week. With \u003Cem\u003EJupiter\u003C/em\u003E coming along on schedule, a boilerplate of \u003Cem\u003EAurora\u003C/em\u003E nearly finished, and work beginning on the Munar lander, Danford didn\u0027t have a whole lot to do. Thus, he sat idly in his spartan office, watching one of the most recent presidential debates on a small television set an intern had brought in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, nothing terribly exciting had occurred, unless one counted the various insults the candidates spouted off at one another, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll three candidates stood on a stage erected in some small town in the middle of the CKFN, bickering about today\u0027s topic. The candidate furthest to the left hailed from a more conservative-leaning political party, who strongly believed that altogether too much information was flowing between the USKK and CKFN, far more than should be tolerated (they were \u003Cem\u003Eenemies\u003C/em\u003E after all, they had insisted), and demanded a complete border shutdown and an overall isolationist policy on the world stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second candidate was more liberal, and believed that some trade should be opened between the two great powers, arguing that the CKFN could dominate the USKK economically, particularly if more attention was paid to upgrading and modernizing industrial sections in the southern half of the country. Unsurprisingly, this candidate hailed from that region, and no doubt had several kerbals with a great deal of self-interest in the region supporting his candidacy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the final candidate was far more interesting to Danford. She spoke little of international relations, but was an enthusiastic supporter of the Space Programme. She found a way to bring up the subject nearly every debate she spoke in, and stressed that rather than attempting to out-compete the USKK on the Kerbin itself, the CKFN should do so in the skies above, by establishing a permanent kerballed presence in orbit. She empathized that the Space Programme was the way to the future of the CKFN, by research and developing new technologies, as well as exploring new worlds. Needless to say, she\u0027d be getting Danford\u0027s vote.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, today\u0027s debate was about as far from the topic of space exploration as one could get, as the candidates were arguing whether or not current cabbage import legislation was too strict, too lenient, or should be abolished altogether. Wild tales of cabbage smugglers had been circulating around the CKFN for a few months now, of kerbals attempting to dodge the expensive import fees by making tremendous journeys across kilometres of open desert with their wares. Of course, more often than not, these tales were pure fiction or highly exaggerated, but the fact remained that the import fees were quite high, and there existed a significant demand for the goods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo Danford, each candidate had entirely too strong of an opinion upon these cabbages, and he sorely wished they\u0027d actually get back to talking about subject matter which did not cause their viewers to fall asleep (as most of the audience onscreen appeared to be napping). But the debates went on, for better or for worse. Finally, when Danford was on the verge of switching the television off altogether, his desk\u0027s telephone rang. Thrilled to have some form of distraction, he grabbed the receiver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hello?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe voice on the other end was deep and gruff and belonged to General Geoffnard. \u0022Danford.

Peace had reigned supreme for the last twenty-four years on Kerbin, why was the USKK spoiling that with a Max-damned \u003Cem\u003Einvasion\u003C/em\u003E? \u0022You can\u0027t be serious,\u0022 he found himself blurting out. \u0022Would\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACwould this mean a repeat of the Great War?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m afraid the situation is all too serious, but we may yet avoid war.\u0022 responded the General. He unfurled a map of the region, southeast of the USKK. Additionally, Geoffnard had marked upon the map diagonal lines which showed the extent of the USKK\u0027s invasion, enveloping the entire country of Malentia.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VidCKPy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VidCKPy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Allow me to explain the background on this area for those unfamiliar.\u0022 Danford saw the General glance towards him, and narrowed his eyes. No doubt the General was rolling out the history lesson because he was present. Danford wasn\u0027t an \u003Cem\u003Eidiot\u003C/em\u003E, for Harv\u0027s sake, he remembered just as well as any kerbal what had gone on during the War.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeoffnard began. \u0022In the aftermath of the Great War, the full extent of the Malentian Isthmus was promised to the USKK in return for its liberation of several nation-states. However, the signing of the Treaty of Okheka in the final days of the war froze the borders of both the USKK and CKFN, and forbid either from adding more territory in the future, essentially nullifying this promise. The Treaty was signed to avoid precisely this sort of preying on the weaker nation-states, which I\u0027m sure you all can recall was one of the primary causes of the War.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe General\u0027s eyes darkened. \u0022In the event of such a breach of the Treaty, it called for the other nation to declare war upon the aggressor, in defense of the smaller nation. This was written in the hopes of forcing the other to back down. Ideally, this threat of mutual warfare would discourage either side from even \u003Cem\u003Etrying\u003C/em\u003E to break the Treaty. Unfortunately, the USKK has evidently decided that the Treaty no longer applies to them, and has moved troops into Malentia.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe passed some grainy, black-and-white photographs across the table, clearly showing USKK tanks doing battle with an unidentified militia-type force. The President looked at them and sighed heavily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Has the USKK declared a \u003Cem\u003Ecasus belli\u003C/em\u003E? Do they have any sort of justification for this attack?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022None officially, but I believe this was a diplomatic annexation gone bad. Malentia\u0027s leaders have long sought to join the USKK, but dissident factions may have started riots and popular movements against the current governing body, which led to the images you see here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Regardless of intent, the USKK still violated international law. I presume you called me in here to ask whether we will declare war in Malentia\u0027s defense?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That was indeed the purpose of this meeting, sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, the President sighed. \u0022I can\u0027t condemn the nation to war, then leave office three days later. Nor will my successor have an easy time of it; the government typically takes \u003Cem\u003Emonths\u003C/em\u003E to reorganize when a new President enters office. It appears the USKK has lucked out in their timing of this invasion.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not luck, sir,\u0022 the General stated. \u0022The details of our elections are not exactly private, I believe it was very precise timing on their part which led to this invasion happening now, when they \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E we are unable to respond quickly.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe President massaged his temples. \u0022So what are our options, then? Do we declare war? I was under the impression that most of the military is currently either disbanded or off patrolling the borders, and it would take a great deal of time to organize the forces.\u0022 The President continued. \u0022I suppose declaring war immediately, then taking some time to send an attack isn\u0027t out of the question.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanford sat in disbelief. While certainly not eager about the whole thing, the President was discussing declaring a war which would undoubtedly consume most of the planet once again. And he did so while looking \u003Cem\u003Eannoyed\u003C/em\u003E. Danford had always imagined a certain gravitas was present when discussing such matters, but he supposed reality never really did match up with what one saw in the movies, did it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe General was now pacing at the front of the room. \u0022Sir, if the USKK so wished, they could invade \u003Cem\u003Eus\u003C/em\u003E during that interim period and force our surrender. Recent intelligence reports show that they have conducted alarmingly extensive modernizations and upgrades to their military, and I believe have the potential to strike a devastating blow against our nation.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Surely they aren\u0027t so stupid as to \u003Cem\u003Eattack\u003C/em\u003E us? It would take them weeks just to cross our defensive lines!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sir, based upon the intelligence we have, their modern tanks can cover a great deal of ground, and can concentrate a great deal of firepower on a single point. Static defenses won\u0027t last long against the USKK\u0027s armies. Also, there is the matter of aircraft, whose military application is still poorly understood, but which could easily overwhelm us.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe President was silent. \u0022So what is it you\u0027re saying? We don\u0027t declare war?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022As always, the final decision is up to you, sir, but my recommendation is to allow the USKK to continue. Entering a war which the defender \u003Cem\u003Ewants\u003C/em\u003E to lose with an unprepared military is just not strategically sound. Besides, it \u003Cem\u003Ehas\u003C/em\u003E been over twenty years since the Treaty, and one could argue that it may need some readjustments based upon the events which have occurred over the past two decades. Naturally, I recommend condemning the USKK at our earliest opportunity; they should certainly not get away with this scott-free.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I agree, Geoffnard, thank you,\u0022 the President stated. Around the table, Danford could see the other council members nodding their heads in agreement. He continued. \u0022Does anyone else have an opinion on this development?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBilcas cleared his throat. \u0022If we are to let this incident go without taking military action, well it sets a bit of a precedent, doesn\u0027t it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvidently confused by Bilcas\u0027 vague statement, the General responded angrily. \u0022A precedent for future invasions by the USKK?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not necessarily. If the Treaty of Okheka is truly null and void, why \u003Cem\u003Eany nation\u003C/em\u003E could then annex its neighbors\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6if it so wished, of course.\u0022 Bilcas clarified, smiling in a bit of a conspiratorial manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6I see,\u0022 remarked the General. \u0022This will no doubt have to be more clearly defined in the future, though. Thoughts on the Finance Minister\u0027s words, sir?\u0022 he asked, turning to the President, who was looking thoughtful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStanding up, the President responded. \u0022All I can say is I believe the CKFN\u0027s current borders to be sufficient for our prosperity. A re-evaluation of those will have to be a question to ask my successor. Now, if that\u0027s everything, I very much wish to get home. It\u0027s been altogether too long of a term in office.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7ittO0xt.png\u0022 alt=\u00227ittO0xt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECKFN:\u003C/strong\u003E Front Steps of Legislative Buildings, CKFN Capital\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFour Days Later\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanford stood in the centre of the CKFN\u0027s capital, in front of the main governmental buildings, where a cheering crowd had gathered. Fortunately, he was not speaking to them today, giving as many speeches as he\u0027d had for the Space Programme had made him rather sick of the whole thing. Still, today\u0027s speech would certainly be interesting, though the content of the speech did not nearly interest him as much as the speaker herself, or rather what her future policies hopefully would contain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Adming Kerman, the space-loving Presidential candidate had won the election, not quite by a landslide, but by a significant margin which evidently reflected the public\u0027s enthusiasm for space travel. He smiled. It must mean he was doing a pretty good job at the Programme, if the public voted for a candidate who promised to make advancements in that area!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe began to speak, reciting grand words no doubt memorized the night before, but still impressive. For the most part though, it was a pretty generic \u0027thank you for electing me\u0027 speech, but the last few segments caught his interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022For as you all know, in a vile and despicable move, the USKK has invaded the sovereign state of Malentia with overwhelming force, and we are unable to intervene. We can only condemn them for such a shameful act of destroying the twenty-three-year peace we all have worked so hard to maintain since the Great War!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this condemnation of their rival nation, the audience let out a cheer. Danford suspected that this didn\u0027t mean much; if the President got them riled up enough, the crowd would probably cheer for anything. Still, there was something to be said about the national pride the President was inspiring. The previous President never was one for grand speeches and usually preferred to work on things such as cabbage legislation, much less visible or accessible to the public.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Indeed, our great nation is focused upon greater achievements, ones which will bring the CKFN into the future! Take Danford Kerman here, his crew at the Space Programme are reaching for the very stars themselves, reaching to bring us all a better tomorrow!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, the crowd went wild, and Danford gave a little wave, once again amazed by the positive opinion of the Space Programme. One would expect that kerbals would be distrustful of his agency after the USKK demonstrated the deadly consequences of rocket failure, but these kerbals didn\u0027t seem to be thinking about that at all. Truly, understanding public opinion was a more difficult task than rocket science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the President continued her speech to the crowd, Danford looked skyward to where the Mun was rising above the horizon. He imagined kerbals walking on that body, clad in space suits and planting the flag of the CKFN proudly, to show the world the fantastic achievement they\u0027d attained, which would be talked about for years, and no doubt live on throughout history as kerbalkind\u0027s first step out from their home planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBringing his gaze back down to Kerbin, he reflected upon the road he\u0027d need to travel to get to that future. The Space Programme faced a few issues, certainly, but he was confident that this new political regime would allow for those to be smoothed over quickly enough, he was certain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings were looking up!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CommanderSpock","CreatedById":147594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T20:26:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I would never have expected that!

As such, you may see a little bit of inconsistency between the first few chapters written a year and a half ago, when I was under the impression that the entire story would be about ten or fifteen updates long, and the current chapters, written while keeping story themes I\u0027ve come up with in the interim in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I will go back and edit, add content, and no doubt take a new set of pictures for all chapters, and publish them in a nice readable format once I\u0027m done. Yes, that\u0027s right folks, I\u0027m going to pull a George Lucas on you! \u0027Kold War Special Edition\u0027, here we come! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
