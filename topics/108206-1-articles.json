As a result a have barely touched KSP 1.X. I have, however, noticed a lot of complaints about the updates and i have even heard of negativity towards the developers (and even some misplaced sence of entitlement..but thats besides the point..). \n\nAs some people have pointed out, people suck with changes. Besides, unhappy people tend to be more likely to voice their opinion. On the other hand, other people just call the updates \u0027\u0027different\u0027\u0027 in stead of better en more realistic. And there are those who love the updates.\n\nAll of this makes me wonder:\n\nWas 1.0.0 that bad? did 1.0.1 make it beter? Is 1.0.2 best?\n\nI realise this is a matter of personal opinion so i am curious to the results of a sample test.\n\nThank you for your responses.\n\nKind regards,"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T14:12:50Z","Content":"I\u0027m all in favour of bugfixes, and didn\u0027t play 1.01 or 1.0 because initial KSP releases are ALWAYS bugged.\n\nSquad just doesn\u0027t have enough testers to find everything, but that\u0027s where the user base comes in."},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo Kerbonaut","CreatedById":65299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T14:18:57Z","Content":"I like 1.0.2."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T14:20:10Z","Content":"Okay, well, first off I must say that I certainly don\u0027t play as hard as some of the biggest complainers/critics of the game. And of course criticism isn\u0027t all bad, but there is certainly quite a harsh amount of negativity.\n\nIn my experience, the game is working fantastically with the new updates. Sure, I don\u0027t push my game quite to the limits like some other players do, but it\u0027s all in the name of having fun and doing what I want to do. I happen to love the new aerodynamics, and they make flying things fun and exciting, particularly with the new camera wobble. Some users say that the wobble makes them nauseous, but it doesn\u0027t particularly affect me. In fact, during re-entry sometimes, when things explode, it becomes increasingly and horrifically hectic, things exploding and sounds exploding and the screen almost exploding from the wobble! It\u0027s intense. KSP hasn\u0027t quite made my heart beat like that before!\n\nThe other stuff is cool too, the new parts look nice, and I\u0027m particularly loving the new ram intake, it looks very nice for planes I design with it. Other than that, the new dust and smoke effects are cool, and rocket design is much more challenging because you basically have to apply FAR principles to everything now. I didn\u0027t have much experience with it, as a religiously stock player (apart from KER, that is...) and the new learning curve wall has been pretty interesting to learn. I\u0027m currently doing experiments with resource mining so I don\u0027t have a lot of information for you on that.\n\nSo that\u0027s basically my review!

There are a few things to improve like better heat, when I drop my capsules with insane speeds and unreasonable angles into an atrmosphere. And maybe the SSTO people have some nasty troubles.

I\u0027m also playing closer to stock (still can\u0027t shake that mod habit) than I ever have, and I\u0027ve been playing with FAR and DRE since my second save. We\u0027re in a place where things are good enough and stable, such that I\u0027m not stressed about anything waiting for the next update. Re-entry heating is a bit underwhelming at this point, and there is still more tweaks to the aerodynamics (and part balance, specifically for planes) coming, but that\u0027s all to be expected. Career and contracts is another place where I\u0027d like to see a more thorough balance pass, but I\u0027m still having tons of fun in my late-game career planning all sorts of extravagant missions and acquiring sweet, sweet science.\n\nSo, in short, problems exist, but are being exaggerated and the worst of them will likely be fixed by the end of the month. That should definitely not keep you from diving in and checking things out, since even with things as they are right now, it\u0027s the best iteration of KSP SQUAD has ever delivered."},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T00:54:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Biased poll is biased.\n\u003E Of course pre-1.0 wasn\u0027t the best (no reentry heat and totally faulty aerodynamics being two biggest flaws) but 1.0\u002B versions were definitely rushed and are nowhere near of what they should be to deserve being called \u00221.0.something\u0022.\n\nagreed. i can understand the jump to 0.90 but skipping the last ten releases caused us to miss out on many features that could have been added."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T00:57:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1.0.2 is the way forward but 1.0.3 will be awesome ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nYeah, where\u0027s the 1.0.3\u002B options?\n\nOf course that\u0027s counting our chickens before they hatch but Squad did squish a lot of the old bugs (just not enough of \u0027em to meet my standards of a \u0027release\u0027 game.

Integrated FAR\u002BDRE, plus fuel cells, and they fixed the inverse square law for solar panels. Plus bigger landing gear for planes. It looks good. I already knew about proper gravity turns with rockets in FAR so I haven\u0027t had any issues with rockets flipping over or anything.\n\nNot sure how I feel about science and career mode. Got real life to deal with so its been kinda slow plowing through career mode and getting science, and I never liked the science game much.\n\nI suspect that I\u0027ll probably start playing sandbox after installing RemoteTech, TAC-LS, MKS/OKS and just focus on colonizing the solar system without too many deaths rather than playing career, but that\u0027s kind of my style anyway.\n\nHaven\u0027t tried SSTOs yet. That looks like the most interesting challenge with 1.0.x\n\nAnd as far as bugs in 1.0.0 goes... I\u0027m part of the brotherhood of software developers and can appreciate how much work it clearly took to put out 1.0.0 and the fast turn around of bugfixing the critical bugs and releasing 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 is really the right way to go about it. There\u0027s probably a hundred bugs they could spend their time trying to fix and they could have released 1.0.0 next fall sometime. Instead release it now and let actual usage dictate the priority of the bugfixes, get the new features in front of people and the iterate quickly on fixing the biggest issues. People who are whining about 1.0.0 being buggy don\u0027t write software and don\u0027t understand how its written."},{"CreatedByName":"TheBadAstronomer","CreatedById":89508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T11:32:28Z","Content":"For aerodynamic purposes, I\u0027ve stuck with 1.0 for the time being until they fix it.

I like the way modding has been made easier (in some ways) for people like Ferram in that (AFAIK) there are better hooks n stuff to remove standard aero etc. I like that stock craft now have to look slightly real and have to be built to cope with stuff that puts design restrictions closer to real ones in place.\n\nI really really like the heat modelling that is now in place.\n\nPart of me likes the nerf that jet engines now experience, it brings home some of the real world design challenges experienced by the people trying to make a real world SSTO, part of me just want totally overpowered unreal rockets, although that is the vastly smaller part.\n\nI\u0027m torn on the ISRU. While I like the way it makes long term mission criteria more viable, like bases etc it really brings home just how little there is to do once you land a kerbal somewhere.\n\nCareer seems more balanced than pre-1.0 although timewarp is your only friend when moving from multiple mun/minmus missons into your first Duna/Eve ones.\n\nI\u0027d like specific asteroid missions between Minmus and Duna ones.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 1.0\u0027s aerodynamics were waaaay out of balance.
