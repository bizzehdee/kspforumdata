I found myself realising that I didn\u0027t in fact want realism (which is something I\u0027ve thought I wanted for ages), I wanted the game to be \u003Cem\u003Ebelieveable\u003C/em\u003E. Let me give you some examples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClouds. An atmosphereic planet like Kerbin, with obvious trees and mountains and water, doesn\u0027t have any in the stock game. Why do I like EVE? Not because it makes things realistic, but because it makes me actually believe the planet could exist in real life (because those things make clouds). Granted, it\u0027s a bit more problematic on Duna, but it has an atmosphere and no doubt places that heat up quicker than others. This creates wind which kicks up dust storms. It\u0027s believable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIon drives. People say their thrust is unrealistic, but before KSP, I hadn\u0027t even heard of them. I researched them and found that they use electricity to accelerate argon/xenon etc ions up to a high speed and spit them out the back. Huh, sounds believable.. I don\u0027t know enough about them to know if they\u0027re similar to KSP but I know inert gas ions don\u0027t have a high density so the thrust will be pretty low and oh look, it is. That\u0027s believable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerodynamics. I like FAR not because it makes aerodynamics more realistic but because it makes them behave more like I would expect them to. Yes, there\u0027s a fine line between them but when you can create such ridiculous designs \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U4GwQal.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elike this\u003C/a\u003E with pFairings, it breaks my sense of immersion and I stop believing something like that could exist (it\u0027s why I see pFairings as cheating with FAR and prefer KWR fairings where I have a fixed space to work with).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife Support. Granted, I don\u0027t know how kerbals survive (photosynthesis? Snacks?) but I don\u0027t like going to Jool and Eeloo in a Mk1 lander can because I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s something that could happen in the KSP universe. It takes years to get there and they were sat in their seat the entire time? I\u0027m not looking for mental/physical health deterioration or anything like that, I just want to be able to say to them \u0027don\u0027t worry guys, you won\u0027t run out of oxygen\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoteTech/AntennaRange. I do find it hard to believe that a single extendible whip antenna on a probe on Eeloo can transmit stuff directly to Kerbin. I know Voyager does it, but it\u0027s packet size and speed is extremely low. But I do believe that, with a proper relay around Kerbin to catch incoming transmissions, a directional dish would be able to reach Kerbin and deliver decent speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are just a few examples, but it helps me with the \u0027you\u0027re talking about realism in a game with 75cm tall green aliens?\u0027. No, I\u0027m talking about believability. KSP, while it does contain 75cm tall green aliens, is based on real world physics. The orbital mechanics are very real and can easily even be transferred into real life situations and vice versa (I do know that some guys at NASA play KSP). It\u0027s realistic \u003Cem\u003Efor the world that we\u0027re given\u003C/em\u003E and that is what I want the direction of the game to head. Many films ignore this - sure, have aliens or vampires, whatever, but at least stick to your own rules that you\u0027ve outlined. KSP makes it very clear that the process of getting into orbit is extremely similar to how it\u0027s done IRL - again, given the universe it inhabits. Yeah, the atmosphere isn\u0027t terribly realistic for the gravity well, but it\u0027s believable enough - there\u0027s no \u0027point straight up and thrust and you\u0027re in orbit\u0027 or \u0027ships are planes in space\u0027 incorrect tropes, it\u0027s very real because it\u0027s very believable. If it had such tropes, I\u0027d wouldn\u0027t be half as interested (although getting spaceplanes into orbit would be easier..) but as it stands, that\u0027s what keeps me coming back. The fact that I believe this universe/solar system could exist somewhere (before you mention n-body physics or the fact that stable orbits do still degrade or whatever, I am aware of the game engines limitations and am willing to cut it some clack in that area). Asteroids are step towards believability. The new NASA parts are too - no longer are massive asparagus-staged, orange-tank lifter necessary for lifting heavy loads. As I mentioned, when I see something that ridiculous, it breaks immersion and honestly, lowers my fun a little. The ARM parts didn\u0027t allow for more realistic rockets, they allowed for more believable ones. There\u0027s no need for asparagus pancakes, just a liquid core with big can of boom at the bottom. I believe that kerbals would more likely consider that as the next step in the space program rather than radially decoupling 40 orange sides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy have I posted this here and not in the general discussion? Because this is the direction I want KSP to take. I want it to become more believable given the rules already laid out. Yes, this would mean making a few mods stock, but it also should give devs an idea of what to aim for with regards to \u0027what do we do with KSP next?\u0027. And the answer to that is simply \u0027make me believe Kerbin exists. Make me believe kerbals are real things in a far off solar system.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T00:19:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei agree with everything you said.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T00:22:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was a very read.

The main problem being that believability (for lack of a better word) is entirely subjective. While you and I may consider pancake rockets to be totally absurd, for example, to a lot of people, that might not be the case. And that\u0027s what makes this so difficult to balance. I guarantee that there have been plenty of people playing KSP who just thrusted, straight up, into space - and were confused when they fell back down to Kerbin. In that way, being realistic may even \u003Cem\u003Estop\u003C/em\u003E the game being believable for some people. But, overall, I do agree with you. Even though we are playing a game with little green men who occasionally die of shock, the link to reality in the form of believability is what makes KSP what it is. Without it, it\u0027s just some fun little game that might entertain you for a few hours. But, having that link allows the game to work on so many different levels - from MOAR BOOSTERS to hardcore pen-and-paper orbital mechanics. And I feel the ease with which the game can be modded exists mostly for this purpose. Are more realistic aerodynamics believable for \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E? Then download FAR. Want to design your rockets perfectly for the task at hand? Kerbal Engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in summary, I wouldn\u0027t worry about this too much. The way I see it, the game has only been getting more and more believable with time, both through stock development and mods. Chances are, the career and multiplayer mode stuff might put it all on hold for a bit, but I doubt it will be forgotten. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T00:47:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GluttonyReaper\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GluttonyReaper\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe main problem being that believability (for lack of a better word) is entirely subjective.

But yes, the trouble comes when people disagree and want something that at least looks like it could go to space. People aren\u0027t stupid, they know what a rocket looks like. I remember my first creations in KSP and I was thinking \u0027well, if it works, it ain\u0027t stupid..\u0027 and I can kind of see the draw for that, but since I downloaded various mods that make the game more believable (FAR, KW, EVE etc), I found myself enjoying the game a whole lot more because I could see my rockets on a real life launch pad. I could see real people in the command pod, I could, with the help of Hullcam\u0027s launchpad camera, see my launch being televised around the world.
