She has two \u0027decks\u0027 giving very high internal fuel capacity, short takeoff and vertical landing ability from lift jets concealed in auxiliary payload bays in the mission pods, and space propulsion is provided by the comical GhettoSpike plug rockets at the back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t want to spend 3 million in kash to unlock the Level 3 research facility, so I searched Jeb\u0027s junkyard for a cone shaped thing and stuck many, many little rockets on it using the Editor Extensions mod to provide 13x radial symmetry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the craft is not yet test flown, all the important parameters check out in the SPH and I am using \u0027research data\u0027 provided by fellow KSP Facebookers to qualify the radical Switchblade wing system. This was done last night and no vices were reported. Infact the shift of CL forwards during supersonic flight could be a beneficial thing for beyond-Mach maneuverability in FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout further ado, here\u0027s a little 4K wallpaper and some development shots of the new leader in low cost, low performance space porkpulsion - the El Cheapo GhettoSpike engine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrivia:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ship has \u003Cstrong\u003E42 engines\u003C/strong\u003E total!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/1b1Hw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The supersonic handling is impressively good but there is reduced stability on the roll axis form having such a tiny wingspan!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to adjust wing geometry also serves as a sort of trim function over a range of speeds and altitudes, and the stability is significantly superior to my previous delta-winged spaceplane designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I do post the craft file I will need to provide extensive flight instructions as well.
