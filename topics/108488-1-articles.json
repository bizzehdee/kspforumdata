Good idea? Bad idea?\n\n1) Detach from station.\n\n2) Burn to reduce orbit from 120km down to 70km\n\n3) Rendezvous with new module\n\n4) Burn to push orbit back from 70km to 120km\n\n5) Refuel/repeat to bring future modules from 70km.\n\nGetting a ~1t taxi from 120km down to 70km seems like it\u0027d be almost nothing(based on experience pushing tiny satellites around), and then pushing the combined 5t craft back up to 120km seems like it\u0027d be many times cheaper than the alternative, which is to push it with the 15t dry weight SSTO that originally put it in the low orbit(total 19t with payload).\n\nLong story:\n\nI\u0027ve built an SSTO that\u0027s capable of putting one station module at a time into low orbit(~72km), so now I\u0027m thinking about how to build the station in orbit. My SSTO would be barely capable of rendezvous each module with a 70km station, but it\u0027s dry mass is 14.9t(without payload or fuel). \n\nIf a module such as a lab is 3.5t, then it would seem more efficient to detach the module once stable orbit is attained, and let a small engine on the module get it the rest of the way there.\n\nA side effect of my SSTO design is each module has a \u0022nose cone fuel tank\u0022 which is a 2.5m to 1.25m adapter with a detachable cone. (Oh well, the station will double as a fuel depot.) So fuel tank is not a problem really.\n\nBut then every module needs its own controller, engine, RCS. (as well as a few other things like solar panels/batteries but those would be useful on a station).\n\nPlus the engine will be centered somewhere that would likely be better as a convenient docking port location.\n\nSo it seems like it\u0027d be easier to have a small craft dedicated to grabbing modules and bringing them up from low orbit.\n\nWhat approach do others take?\n\nIf you wanna see my craft, this is it(linking to steam so hopefully will work). You can see the docking port on the nose cone, and there\u0027s another on the backend of the lab. The fuel tank with the two winglets are permanent fixtures of the module. There\u0027s a small storage bay where the SSTO\u0027s controller is mounted, and there\u0027d be room for the small taxi there. So it could be delivered with my first module. I don\u0027t have access to larger storage bays yet, hence the nose mounted module...\n\n![2369876AE32EF5C26B54586EF5C5E5213BF58C18](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/27364031625067969/2369876AE32EF5C26B54586EF5C5E5213BF58C18/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T23:44:40Z","Content":"People do build orbital tugs to move their stuff around, but they tend to be ion or nuclear powered for their better Isp.
