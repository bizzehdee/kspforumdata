My SSTO would be barely capable of rendezvous each module with a 70km station, but it\u0027s dry mass is 14.9t(without payload or fuel). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a module such as a lab is 3.5t, then it would seem more efficient to detach the module once stable orbit is attained, and let a small engine on the module get it the rest of the way there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA side effect of my SSTO design is each module has a \u0022nose cone fuel tank\u0022 which is a 2.5m to 1.25m adapter with a detachable cone. (Oh well, the station will double as a fuel depot.) So fuel tank is not a problem really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then every module needs its own controller, engine, RCS. (as well as a few other things like solar panels/batteries but those would be useful on a station).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus the engine will be centered somewhere that would likely be better as a convenient docking port location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it seems like it\u0027d be easier to have a small craft dedicated to grabbing modules and bringing them up from low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat approach do others take?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanna see my craft, this is it(linking to steam so hopefully will work). You can see the docking port on the nose cone, and there\u0027s another on the backend of the lab. The fuel tank with the two winglets are permanent fixtures of the module. There\u0027s a small storage bay where the SSTO\u0027s controller is mounted, and there\u0027d be room for the small taxi there. So it could be delivered with my first module. I don\u0027t have access to larger storage bays yet, hence the nose mounted module...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/27364031625067969/2369876AE32EF5C26B54586EF5C5E5213BF58C18/\u0022 alt=\u00222369876AE32EF5C26B54586EF5C5E5213BF58C18\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T23:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople do build orbital tugs to move their stuff around, but they tend to be ion or nuclear powered for their better Isp.
