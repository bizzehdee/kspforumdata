All attempts to manage the throttle in order to maintain a reasonable engine temperature have been... futile. So I\u0027ve given up on that avenue and instead have turned to managing the heat. Problem is, the stock radiators are... a little draggy, and can\u0027t attach to the engines directly. So, are there any good ways to pull heat out of an engine and reject it in a low-drag manner?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T23:52:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 11:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MaverickSawyer**\n  \ntitle typo correction"}]}
