The transfer window planner works great, and I\u0027ve done quite a few Mun-Minmus transfers with it, but remember: it assumes a perfect transfer, perfect optional midcourse plane change, and perfect capture. In the game, from\u00A0things like shaking from gimbal and imperfect SAS, the capture will not be perfect.
