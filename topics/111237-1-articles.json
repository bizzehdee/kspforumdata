Clearly Unity 5, with it\u0027s reworked wheel colliders, is likely to make significant improvements in this regard, but for the meantime, wondering if anyone has any hints?\n\nThose I\u0027ve managed to deduce thus far seem to be:\n\n1) Consider if you need powered wheels at all - plane landing gear, especially the original (LY-10), coupled with rocket thrust can work quite well in low gravity vacuums.\n\n2) Less may be more - more wheels (often needed to support greater mass without compressing suspension down to it\u0027s stops) seems to correlate to wheels shaking themselves to pieces the moment you encounter slightly uneven terrain or try to turn.\n\n3) Enable steering on as few wheels as possible - steering sets up all manner of friction differentials which seem to overwhelm wheel mountings.\n\n4) Try using the inflatable (Rovemax Model M1) wheel rather than (TR-2L) rugged wheel. Whilst the rugged wheel would seem the obvious choice (and is lighter, and more impact tolerant than the inflatable wheel) it seems to have extra friction - a great thing on smaller rovers, but enough to rip wheels from their mountings on larger 8\u002B wheeled rovers.\n\nAny other tips people can offer? Any mountings which people are finding better than others at keeping wheels attached? Landing gear \u002B powered wheel combinations? Maximum mass per wheel in a given gravity? Trail steering or forward steering?"},{"CreatedByName":"Docsprock","CreatedById":113468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T11:54:23Z","Content":"I use the ruggedized wheels on most of my rovers. Very few problems unless going too fast. I usually attach them to the ends of I-beams, (depending on design)\n\nI also use struts to web the wheels into position. Generally 2 tons mass/wheel is the maximum I feel comfortable with."},{"CreatedByName":"MiniMatt","CreatedById":78749,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T12:10:27Z","Content":"Thanks, I\u0027ll have to try with i-beams, been using modular XL girders a lot lately, and they\u0027re not as sticky as I\u0027d like. Been trying to avoid strut-welding each individual wheel if at all possible as it increases part count significantly once you\u0027re into the realms of 16\u002B wheeled 50 ton tankers."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T12:39:16Z","Content":"I use the ruggedized wheels with only front pair steering and only back ones powering, it might get a bigger turning radius but its very stable if I keep 10 ton per wheel rule (thats kerbin only info, not so sure about mun)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T12:50:40Z","Content":"Don\u0027t be ashamed to part-clip the large landing gear. They prove quite useful as rover wheels. Do be wary of retracting them if they are clipping, though, as Bad Things^tm^ may happen.\n\nLess wheels are better for steering.\n\nEven distribution of wheels if you have more than six is not beneficial to handling. Try grouping them as front steering, middle locked (powered, though) and back steering. All may be powered.\n\nInverting steering as an action group for rear wheels has an interesting strafing effect.\n\nMore brake torque on rear wheels will lessen the chance of a braking-induced flip."},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T13:11:15Z","Content":"Maybe an advanced grabbing unit underneath the rover as an immediate brake?"},{"CreatedByName":"ArchGaden","CreatedById":116362,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T13:35:37Z","Content":"I-beams and most structural elements are heavy. If you\u0027re going heavy, you might as well just throw on some RoveMax XL3s instead. I say \u0027instead\u0027 because you can mount the RoveMax on structural fuselages or fuel tanks and still reach the ground with plenty of clearance to keep your vessel safe. Structural fuselage is only 0.1t... compared to 0.38 for an I-beam, it practically sells itself! The RoveMax mega-wheels are practically indestructible for any rational use. Structural fuselage weight is low, so you can spread out a bit and make a wide-stable design. Then you can cover some distance without having to drive timidly. Bring some silver cake spray so you can chrome up before the drive. \n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/RoveMax_Model_XL3](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/RoveMax_Model_XL3)\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Structural_Fuselage](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Structural_Fuselage)\n\nFor big mining rigs, I generally mount the ISRU in the center and stick a big SAS below that, which acts as a mounting ring since parts don\u0027t want to attach to the ISRU. I\u0027ll fix four structural fuselages to the SAS and then add fuel tanks, ore tanks, and fuselages to square off the design. I stick some rovemax XL3s wheels at the corner and fix some terriers for engines wherever they fit, as long as it stays balanced. I generally create an extension with a fuselage that will have a grabber on it, so I can refuel surface vessels as needed. My drill will be on the opposite side from that to keep a better balance. A utility bay a the top will have a probe core, RTGs, batteries and other small bits. A few big solar arrays will finish it off. The whole thing weighs under 20t and will have 2-3k d/v for the engines, allowing landings on most bodies, and for most moons the ability to get back into orbit and land again, sparing some fuel for an orbital refueling operation if needed.\n\nI\u0027ve tried various combinations of the smaller rover wheels, hoping to cut my weight down, but a mining rig with an ISRU will have to be heavy, and only the XL3 can take that weight. I could go with 10\u002B ruggedized wheels, but those won\u0027t reach the ground from a fuselage, so I\u0027ll have to use I-beams and heavier stuff... resulting in a vessel about the same weight in the end, but with a higher part count and lower durability. The ruggedized wheels can hit a much higher speed though...so if you\u0027re going a long distance on the ground, that might be your best bet. I generally use the terriers and just fly out if I need to go a long distance though.\n\nI haven\u0027t tried some of the heavier landing gear though... that might be even better for my use cases."},{"CreatedByName":"MiniMatt","CreatedById":78749,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T15:00:28Z","Content":"Perhaps some pictures would help:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/lqUh3)\n\nFirst picture, 16 wheels - just about works ok, but a lot of disconcerting wheel wobble and absolute max speed of 10m/s (~22mph) around even the gentlest of KSC terrain or it\u0027ll rip it\u0027s own wheels off.\n\nSecond picture, 6 wheels clearly insufficient for the weight, just rolling off the runway is enough to take all six wheels out.\n\nThird picture, 10 wheels with all wheels individually strut welded to their mounting girders, results were very similar, slightly worse, than first 16 wheel design.\n\nFourth picture, hybrid landing gear \u002B two powered wheels - this thing is by far my most successful design - only 2 wheel drive, but can speed around the KSC taking all the slight dips and inclines at full pelt (just under 20m/s) without a hint of wheel wobble or explosions.\n\nFifth picture, full size tank wheels - I think this design may have some promise (and thanks for the hint ArchGaden - you\u0027re correct, mass difference is fairly negligible) but nevertheless, rolling off the runway at under 15m/s was still sufficient to take out a tyre.\n\nI suspect it\u0027ll be a case of all these working much better in the field rather than in the relatively high gravity of Kerbin - I\u0027m aiming these things at Dres \u002B lighter gravity environments. Further I\u0027m testing at max load, whereas in the field the most arduous driving is likely to be when it\u0027s near enough empty (ie. landed a km or two out from the refinery)."},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T16:09:16Z","Content":"Funny to have all these rover threads pop up as I\u0027ve just started seriously experimenting with them too. I\u0027ve noticed that the ruggedized wheels can do this.. bugging out thing. Where you\u0027re driving on Kerbin at 20m/s and the whole thing will bounce about like it was in a frying pan for a few seconds. It also loses some speed and acceleration while this is happening. Perhaps an engine limitation?"},{"CreatedByName":"Peebothuhlu","CreatedById":105537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T16:21:06Z","Content":"Hello!\n\nLong time lurker and down loader of the forums. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nSo!\n\nRovers!\n\n[Image](http://postimg.org/image/z6eunic4t/75c2300a/)\n\n[Image](http://postimg.org/image/4ggml6f8n/44e0b17e/)\n\nThis is my current (In 1.0 what ever) fastest rover design.\n\nThe rugged wheels are the \u0027fastest\u0027..
