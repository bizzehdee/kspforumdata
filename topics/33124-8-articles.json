I\u0027ve actually been having a lot of problems with it lately. The RCS thing, the parachute/docking port part, other things. I only want the Orion capsule and related parts, so I don\u0027t have any of the Altair stuff installed. At one point I did have all of it installed, and flew a successful Mun mission with it. But then I got rid of most of it due to memory limitations. Now, ever since I\u0027ve been trying to reinstall it, I\u0027ve been having problems. I need to check a few more things this weekend, fiddle with it some more before I totally give up, though. Honestly, I may have borked something in the Orion pod when editing the config, so my first step is to re-download what I know is the latest version of the entire mod, and start from scratch with that.
