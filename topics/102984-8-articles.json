The first few of these dreams, particularly the ones where I was alone (like when I went for walks/runs in the forest) were scary as crap, but after a while, most of them started taking place in public and crowded places, and the T-Rex became this \u0027background noise\u0027 type of thing. I would avoid it, and every so often I would run away quickly because it was catching up, but it was always there, always getting closer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, it got less and less scary, until it just kinda puttered out and died.
