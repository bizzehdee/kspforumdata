Mk1 and Mk2 parts are much more aerodynamic than the stock Mk3 parts, with all their pointiness and stuff, which would make them better suited for hypersonic flight. That\u0027s actually what encouraged me to make a hypersonic Mk3 mod in the first place (see my signature). But in case you are referring to other aspects, there\u0027s the Heat Resistant Mk2 parts mod, which of course would make them better suited for hypersonic flight with their superior heat resistance. Here\u0027s the link to the heat resistant spaceplane parts mod \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/230254-heat-resistant-parts-hrp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/230254-heat-resistant-parts-hrp\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T01:09:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nothalogh\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nothalogh\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not a bad thing, as one would be unwise to strap P\u0026amp;W J57 Turboramjets to a Cessna, IRL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnwise?
