My camera settings for the direct eclipse photographing was:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF-stop: f/27\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExposure time: 1/4000. sec.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISO: 100\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in my case the camera received as minimal with light as technically possible without resorting to any solar filtering... in fact I didn\u0027t even have any filters at all. Was afraid if I tried experimenting with any longer exposures multiple times in a row it\u0027d risk damaging the sensor. The region was mostly covered by heavy clouding, but there was some moderately clouded patches that allowed me to photograph the event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably will a picture of the then just recently peeking Sun give an idea about the scenario:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5DtyKaX.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5DtyKaXl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225DtyKaXl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T23:06:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApparently it was a total eclipse, but the brightness of the court was the same as always at this time of the day, I wonder if I will ever in Poland such eclipse that was dark as night, just pitch dark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember as a best friend and my cousin watched the eclipse of Sun in 1999, my father was a construction worker colleague so that each of us got our welding glass, so that we could watch the eclipse without fear that we damage our vision,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even then, the sun shield wasn\u0027t fully covered by Moon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the last eclipse, unfortunately, I could not watch it because I was at work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T23:22:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kurja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kurja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eworir4 and others - awesome work getting the crescent sun in a picture with terrestrial elements on it, I tried but couldn\u0027t get it to work; I suppose you need to wait for a right kind of cloud to get in front of the sun, or was there another technique you used..?
