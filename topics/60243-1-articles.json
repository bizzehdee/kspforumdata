Do you mind if I ask which service you intend to join?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs sal_vager has already stated, a big part of learning to dock is just having the patience to get the maneuvers right. Don\u0027t be surprised if your first successful one takes a while to get down; it gets quicker and easier with practice as you get a feel for how the mechanics interact. If you\u0027re stuck on a particular part of it, feel free to ask questions or check out one of the rendezvous and docking tutorials I\u0027ve listed on the Drawing Board, which is conveniently linked in my signature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
