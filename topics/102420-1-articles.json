I reverted from a killed EVA\u0027ed kerbal while the plane was still flying on SAS. I previously had a minor problem similar to this one on the same plane, where I couldn\u0027t retract the ladders, but I didn\u0027t think much of it. I also got some shock cone intakes on radial attachment ports clipped inside the cabin, and I think my problem may be something to do with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EResult:\u003C/strong\u003E All the other stock planes work just fine, and I can load, save, and begin new spacecraft from this plane in the SPH, but if I load this particular one, I am unable to exit, move, rotate, root or offset any parts (when I try to do so the parts are just highlighted in blue), nor can I place new parts (when I click a part it just places itself somewhere around the area I clicked in the SPH despite having clicked on the menu). When I try to launch, it doesn\u0027t do anything other than make the buttons on the top right, symmetry mode, crew, action groups, parts and angle snap unclickable, making me have to terminate the task using task manager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever I load the craft, the menu messes up and I have to click on action groups or crew to fix it.
