I currently have four radially mounted engines directly mounted on mkII liquid fuel fuselages and some other liquid fuel storage on the vessel; each fuselage also has two gigantor solar arrays for power (and potential helping to radiate heat, I have read?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrustratingly, as the vessel heats up, the engines abruptly throttle down. Since this seems to occur unevenly, often leaving one engine firing on full, I basically have to turn the engine off and wait for another pulse, or risk spinning the asteroid far out of control. I can\u0027t seem to make out which component overheating causes the sudden drop in engine performance (possibly the fuselage temperature?) This is also happening long before the components are reaching dangerous temperatures...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts or suggestions on how to keep the engines firing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dspan_000","CreatedById":144320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T21:20:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell LV-N\u0027s are known to overheat when on 100% throttle so go for about 50 or 75%.

I\u0027m currently trying to pulse the engines to make a ~500m/s delta V maneuver; after about a minute of full throttle burn, which consistently gives me 5.3 m/s of delta V before the engines cut down to a fuel usage of 0.00065U, at which point I very briefly put up the timewarp to 1000x to reset the heat of the components, and go around again. When I use 1/3 throttle, I only get to about 7m/s before exactly the same thing happens - not a great deal of advantage, the burns are much longer, and it\u0027s actually a lot harder to spot when the engines cut out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the ship layout, they\u0027re not particularly close together - again, radially mounted around a 2.5m centre, with a little extra because of the shape of the mk2 fuselage. picture here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=451596981\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=451596981\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"anopheles","CreatedById":145247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T23:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, I posted a reply which appears to have disappeared - or is possibly still awaiting mod approval.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it\u0027s not the throttle - the effect still happens within a closely comparable amount of time, even using below 30% throttle.
