Essentially a probe core, with some large tanks and the main sail engine. I have a tonne of paracutes designed around the centre of mass to give a nice gentle slashdown. Under the crash limit of 6 m/s every time! Testing it a couple of times and it worked, but first time in a real mission all I had to recover was the core and parachutes. Is there any point in trying to add more parachutes to slow it further, or is this just luck/buggy. The speed is under 6 m/s (5.79 last time) which isn\u0027t all that fast. I\u0027d expect my parts to survive hitting water as fast as I can sprint...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny advice? short of building huge space planes which I can\u0027t do \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s653.photobucket.com/user/MoridinUK/media/screenshot0.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu260/MoridinUK/screenshot0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T10:47:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight as well use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-0-90-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-3-%2812-22-14%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStage Recovery\u003C/a\u003E if you already know your parts can and will make their way down with parachutes and hit the water at a leisurely 6m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to recover parts manually (or at least, tried to) but I find it simpler to use Stage Recovery, set the cutoff lower than default (I think it\u0027s 11m/s) at 8m/s and work with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise (if you want to keep stock functionality), you could keep a tiny bit of fuel and soften the touchdown by activating the engines at the right moment (you could get away with less than 10m/s left of delta-v to land the whole thing at 0.1m/s if you have \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Erad skills\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.
