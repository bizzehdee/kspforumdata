I\u0027ve started to get the hang of this, but there is one thing bugging me. When I watch (and learn from) other people doing this, they can clearly see the object they are trying to hook up with in external vehicle view since it\u0027s marked with a green \u0022diamond\u0022 with information about the distance. I don\u0027t have this, and I don\u0027t understand why this is. It\u0027s quite frustrating since it can be extremely difficult sometimes to actually see the object you are approaching, and I have to rely only on relative velocity and the navbal somtimes. I guess I should also mention that I have set the object as target in map view.\n\nI\u0027m playing career mode with the tracking station fully upgraded. I\u0027m using the mods Kerbalengineer, Europeflags and Planetshine. Have I missed something here? Do i need to press a key, upgrade something, have a specific part on my vessel?\n\nAny help much appreciated.\n\n- V\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T13:56:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 01:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Valday**"},{"CreatedByName":"Valday","CreatedById":144727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T13:54:29Z","Content":"Disregard this post, I didn\u0027t think my first thread on this got registered for some reason, now I have 2 :S"}]}
