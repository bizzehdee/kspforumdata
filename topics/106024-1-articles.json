I tried yesterday bringing Valentina back from the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, but didn\u0027t seem to be able to pull it off. In fact, I just seemed to prolong the most dangerous part of her ride by coming in too shallow. I really thought I was going to lose her, but those new shields have amazing amounts of ablative material slathered on them. The thermometers radially attached to the upper part of the capsule weren\u0027t so lucky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall though, despite some of the expected buggy-ness, I am seriously impressed with Squad\u0027s new stock aero and heating system. They add to up to making for a great thrill ride. I\u0027ll probably still use nuFar, and Deadly Reentry, when they\u0027re ready because I like that level of realism, but I really think Squad did a bang up job on 1.0.
