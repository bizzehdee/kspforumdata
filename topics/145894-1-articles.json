Feels kinda nice. Quick question. Ive got a rover on Duna with two busted wheels. I failed to notice the engineer I sent out there doesn\u0027t have the adequate level to repair them. Is there anything I can do? Ive been looking into the persistent files and I cant seem to find a way to up his level or fix the wheels. Anything I can do to cheat the fix\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-14T15:28:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe status of the wheels in the persistent file should indicate broken, and swapping that out for whatever term they use for \u0022working\u0022 should be fine. \u00A0Paste here what you saw in the listing for the rover\u0027s wheels in your persistent file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
