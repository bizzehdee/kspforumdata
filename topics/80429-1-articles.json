You may have learned of the QVPT, or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_vacuum_plasma_thruster\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EQuantum Vacuum Plasma Thruster\u003C/a\u003E. I am here to present to you: the Quantum Kraken Solar Thruster. It\u0027s the same concept, but worded differently. The QKST will have the same thrust as ion engines(pre-ARM). But, the main difference is: infinite ISP as long as you can maintain enough power. Which ten SP or OX-4 solar panels can do. My planned tech tree node for this is the same one as the ion engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff3300;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Arial Black\u0027;\u0022\u003EDevelopment starting soon!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-02T04:17:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2014 04:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T01:29:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds OP.
