The largest payload for now was a small vessel based on the HGR two-kerbal capsule for getting science from Minmus and I must say that - at least for me - FAR makes quite a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E While it does take you less dV to reach orbit it nonetheless is not really easier if you are not used to FAR. My first rockets with FAR were dancing ballet in the air before being subjected to unplanned rapid disassembly. While I always made somewhat \u0022classical\u0022 launch vehicles FAR made me put some more thought into building and flying. And over the time you get better and the rockets stop flipping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing about FAR that I really like are the aerodynamic failures. Yes, it is frustrating if your rocket flips and falls apart for the third time. But on the other hand it really fits the \u0022spirit\u0022 of KSP in my opinion. There are the mistakes which - I guess - everyone makes. Like not strutting SRBs and so on. You fail. You redesign. You try again. Maybe it is better, maybe not. And with a realistic-ish model you can go to wikipedia or take a book from the library and read about design principles for planes and rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yes, I would say that KSP would benefit from a better aerodynamics model and I would disagree with those saying that it becomes so much harder for newbies. It will be different but not necessarily that much harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same thing goes in my opinion for dV and TWR readouts. NASA didn\u0027t send a manned mission to the Moon without knowing how much dV their lander has. Yes, I know, KSP is not NASA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you ask me what I would find more frustrating as new player, designing and flying a mission to the Mun and noticing that my ascend stage does not have enough dV/a too low TWR or my rocket flipping and being subjected to unplanned rapid disassembly on launch because of better aerodynamics I would say the former is more frustrating. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe former is a design mistake because I do not get the numbers which is annoying. It is like an RTS not telling you how much ammunition your troops have left. (Not a perfect comparison.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latter is a real design and/or piloting mistake which only I am responsible for. The same goes for placing engines in the wrong place or crashing into the Mun at 120m/s because of bad piloting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP doesn\u0027t need to be 100% realistic but I found that for me the mods adding little bits of realism like DRE, FAR and TAC-LS really add to the game experience because they add a new layer of possible failures and things you have to consider. But it also adds a new feeling of success if you return from the Mun the first time with those mods and life support runs out before you even enter the atmosphere and you don\u0027t know if your periapsis is set right for direct re-entry but you make it and return Jebediah and all the precious science to Kerbin safely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T13:05:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was always under the impression that Squad chose Kerbals over humans is simply because you kill them.. like.. alot lol.

As things stand right now, each person can play the game however he wants. If he doesn\u0027t want \u0022realism\u0022 getting in the way of the parts of the game he considers fun, then he can go stock. If he for some strange reason actually thinks \u0022realism\u0022 is fun, then he can get whatever mods he likes to make that happen. So everybody should be happy, and KSP thus appeals to a wide audience, so more people will buy it, so Squad gets more money, so KSP will have a longer life. Isn\u0027t this a good thing? What can you possibly find to complain about?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, realism-mongers being realism-mongers, they\u0027ll find something to complain about anyway. But from what I can tell, they can only raise quibbles, such as \u0022KSP can\u0027t be taken seriously until it has all this stuff as stock.\u0022 Or perhaps they complain that the \u0022realifying\u0022 mods can only do so much with the base game, and the result is still unsatisfactory. To THEM. To these folks, I say the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP was designed from the ground up as an entertaining GAME. It\u0027s supposed to give the general idea without being rigorous. It was never intended to be a SIMULATION, so will never become one unless it\u0027s totally rebuilt, which probably will never happen. HOWEVER, there\u0027s this other game called \u003Ca href=\u0022http://orbitersimulator.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOrbiter\u003C/a\u003E, which has been around in various incarnations since the mid-80s. It has ALWAYS striven to be a rigorously realistic SIMULATION, designed from the ground up as such. And it has everything the KSP realism-mongers could possibly want, and probably quite a few things they haven\u0027t even thought of. It also has a very big, long-established community and more mods than KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you want true realism in your space game, I strongly suggest that you go play Orbiter and leave KSP alone. They\u0027re apples and oranges, intended to be entirely different things for entirely different markets. Neither can do what the other does, and neither should. It\u0027s good that both exist. Let them each stick to what they\u0027re good at and leave it at that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I played Orbiter in all its incarnations for nearly 30 years. Then I kicked it to the curb when KSP came along, because I find KSP to be a lot more fun.
