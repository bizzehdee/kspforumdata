My dad figured this had to do with the number of possible things that could have happened in the Universe. I hardly believed this, and soon discovered that there wasn\u0027t much basis to the claim, with no actual mathematicians being named or a paper about the topic being published.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, it did make me wonder just how many things could have happened since the Universe was created, and so I decided to give it my best (and probably very inaccurate) attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few important assumptions/exemptions being done here due to their inability to be quantified for the math. These are (A) The whole of the Universe is the Observable Universe. Since we can\u0027t measure what we can\u0027t detect, there\u0027s no point in trying to guess the true size of the Universe.

Well, since we have an assumed lower limit of space and time, you can look at the total number of possible things as the total number of Planck times that have passed since the beginning of the Universe for ever single Planck distance in the Universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, before we get started, I\u0027m just going to put it out there that I am in no way a mathematician...
