These points could give you extra credits on test scores. We did the assignments in small groups, the teacher would come over to the group. Check the answers and note your points. \n\nthe very first week was a couple of very simple assignments to familiarize our self with this idea of doing homework. They where very simple questions with very simple answers. Then for a couple of questions every second answer was the opposite of the answer before. If the answer to #10 was \u0022it gets bigger\u0022, the answer to #11 would be \u0022it gets smaller\u0022. Except for the last two questions. \n\n# 19 : \u0022What happens when you turn the gas valve on the bunsen burner to the right\u0022\n\n \u0022The flame gets hotter\u0022. \n\n#20 : \u0022You are holding the burner from the bottom and slide your hand slowly up. What happens to your hand\u0022.\n\nWell Obviously, your hand would get hotter, as it moves closer to the flame...\n\nBut my group totally rejected that answer. It was simply not possible since \u0022we already gave that answer\u0022. I complained that the assignments nowhere mentioned that we could give the same answer twice. But alas.. \u0022You don\u0027t understand how it all works hugo!\u0022 Luckily I wrote my answer in my book, hoping that my book would be checked by the teacher next week... It did ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) .

Yes, I went to an American high school ran by the Department of Defense - and let me tell you, I am so thankful for what DoDDS had for a high school curriculum. Besides the normal four years of English classes, basic maths and basic sciences, and physical education we ALL had to take, there was also Band, Jazz Band Ensemble, Choir, Calculus II, Physics II, Basic Astronomy, Chemistry II, Trigonometry II, Latin (up to four years worth), German (up to four years worth), Spanish (up to four years worth), and French (up to four years worth). You also had the option of taking classes during the summer, which I did because I LOVED school. During the summer I took basic electronics, advanced electronics (I can fix my own small electrical appliances, thank you! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)) along with academics. \n\u003E My father retired from the Army after 27 years of service in 1987; we moved back to his hometown, and in January 1988, I transferred to the high school where he graduated. That school was the physical anomaly that Bart Simpson talked about - it both sucked and blowed. No Physics II, No Basic Astronomy, no French above French II, no Spanish above II, no Latin, no German and certainly no vocational classes beyond auto mechanics or farming. So, the last semester of my senior year consisted of band and six study halls - I already had exceeded the requirements for graduation. What really sucked is the narrow mindedness of most of the student body, not understanding that one can live in Germany as a military depended and NOT be a German citizen, would call me a \u0022Kraut\u0022 or make other derogatory comments about me. I was often told that I, as a German citizen, had no rights in the United States. Even had an argument with one of the high school zombies teachers who insisted that I could not be an American if I went to German schools... At first, I would argue with them, but after the first six weeks, it just became so much easier to ignore them. So, needless to say, I didn\u0027t go to the prom, or any of that other stuff normal folks did their senior year. Instead, I began taking college courses.\n\u003E \n\u003E About ten years ago, in 2008, for some reason, I had the desire to go to my 20th year high school reunion - and may I add I will never attend another one. One of the girls that I had band with walked up to me and introduced me to her husband as \u0022the Kraut from Germany\u0022 Her husband, shocked, looked at me and said, \u0022where was your dad stationed?\u0022 Well, after ten minutes of conversation, we discovered that we both had gone to Hanau American High School, and he was a freshman my senior year. He and his wife met in college, so she was unaware he had graduated high school in Germany. She simply had assumed that Hanau was a small town back east, where his parents were from. As she listened to our conversation, all she could say was \u0022Let me get this straight. You\u0027re not a German? -- why didn\u0027t you say something then?\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E Wow, a facepalm from the facepalm thread...
