From what I understand I have a lot of mods, but I am also not sure how many of them I am using. But I am having some compatibility problems and am looking at upgrading to a more current version potentially looking at getting the DLC. The big issue is that I have been running a career mode where I have several off-world colonies, bases and research facilities that I would like to carry forward. What I would like from people is feedback on what difficulties and resources work with this. I have 2 installs (1.3.1 and 1.4.1) that I have been trying to get mods updated to run my setup and I am getting loads of notices that mod x or y is a different version. I have tried using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECkan\u003C/abbr\u003E but even \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECkan\u003C/abbr\u003E seems to install mods that are not compatible and I am having a harder time finding the best compatible older versions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt isn\u0027t the end of the world to use the F12 menu to rebuild incompatible relays or probes or even empty rovers and sending them back to location, but doing that a lot or when dealing with active bases is a lot more difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-30T17:26:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*facepalm* Back-up \u0026amp; try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it works: success.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf it doesn\u0027t: restore back-up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Provisional Name 12","CreatedById":158174,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-30T17:59:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I have several backups, I have just spent about 3 hours trying to align my 1.3.1 release that I have setup with a compatible version using gethub releases of old versions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe the question seems stupid, but I have add-ons 72 installed add-ons according to the add-on version checker, or 95 installed mods according to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECkan\u003C/abbr\u003E.
