I appreciate your creativity though, but I was asking for different creativity; it just really makes it too easy if you can safely and reliably be able to point your ship towards the sky before hitting the ignition button, unless its tiny enough to do it by just pitching rolling and adjusting the yaw\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT EDIT: actually, I\u0027ll take what MarvinKitFox did and allow it as long as its a condition for a different victory for what might as well be a different (sub?)-challenge; if someone wins by doing that then someone else can still win the (main?) challenge by doing something not involving gyros or making a ship that can have its propulsion systems be otherwise pointed upwards on the runway before launching, jeez this is a mess, but I view the rulechanging I did as a condensation and clarification of the rules that were already present\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadditionally, the following things are not allowed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETT18-A Launch Stability Enhancer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea ship that blows up or is otherwise unusable if you don\u0027t begin the first stage in the first 20 ingame seconds after the crew becomes visible in the bottom-right corner\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eme, I disallow myself from winning the challenge with a qualified ship that fulfills either of the winning criteria\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaking the ship point upwards before stage 1(condition 1 only)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estarting with the liquid fuel boosters at an extremely low% of maximum thrust then pointing the ship upwards then making the thrust strong enough to lift and/or significantly move the ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003Eand all mods\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Ethat add and/or change parts or physics or allow part rotation during ship creation where its otherwise disallowed\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epreviously I had disallowed some other parts in the structural category in order to try to prevent the abuse of them to make the ship point upwards on the runway after some minor adjustments before the first stage;

Completely horizontal rolling takeoff, no seesaw gimmicks, just through manipulation of center of thrust. I tied the bottom row of thrusters and top row of thrusters to action group toggles.
