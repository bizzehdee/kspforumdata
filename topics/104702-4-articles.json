So odin\\_spain would\u0027ve had to rotate the craft to make them look right.

Most of the time when it does not go away it just spawns a different ghost ship, but sometimes it will just re-position slightly. Also, it\u0027s not always that thing that appears and not always there. Sometimes it\u0027s that starter plane/drone, or whatever it is. Other places I\u0027ve seen it appear is right next to a ship in orbit about the same relative distance. Again I make it go away by saving and reloading.

I\u0027ve loaded 3 different games now, all fresh, and each one ends with the ship stuck in the ground.\n\nHowever, I believe that the problem itself is in how the ship is spawned in. Whether this is a problem in the contract pack itself or in Contract Configurator is unknown to me, but I can say that the planes are perfectly fine when loaded into the SPH.\n\n-----EDIT-----\n\nI decided to take a look at the contracts, I can\u0027t find anything in the SpawnVessel behavior that defines the plane\u0027s heading. This actually does seem to be a problem.\n\nAdmittedly, I would prefer that it detect how it needs to place the vessel to keep this from happening, but it can be overwritten. I can do that for the basic plane, but that\u0027s it.\n\nIt would be easiest to go through and figure out where each one is at, then manually set the data that way (i.e. for the basic plane set heading to 90 then roll and pitch to 0, since KSC is completely flat).\n\n-----EDIT 2-----\n\nThe problem was, indeed, the configuration. For some reason, Contract Configurator sets a pitch of 0 to be nose down. Turning the plane to 95 degrees fixed it (95 because 90 meant that the wheel was still stuck in the ground).\n\n-----EDIT 3-----\n\nYes, I know, a lot of edits, but really I was just writing these as I figured out more about the problem.\n\nSpeaking of which, the problem is not, I repeat, NOT *just* in the contract pack (although missing coordinates is a problem); I found that, even with appropriate coordinates, the vessel would load properly, then instantly flip onto the right wing and blow itself to bits.\n\nWhy this problem occurs is beyond me, but there\u0027s definitely something fishy here.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T05:03:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 05:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Blazer Nitrox**"},{"CreatedByName":"Volwen","CreatedById":78186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T21:31:44Z","Content":"The only problem is the way the vessels were designed. Each one is built around a probe core that is facing skyward. When the vessel is spawned, it tries to orient it with the core facing forward and it ends up sideways.\n\nI copied the .craft files to a sandbox save and edited them to have default forward facing cores. They spawn just fine now. I had to edit the .craft files afterwards to set guard mode to True so that they actually fight you.\n\nEnded up making custom replacements for each craft in the contract pack and have been having a good time.\n\nMight try adding more contracts soon."}]}
