A specific issue, problem, question, etc. You do need to be careful about old KSP versions, but in general if someone is posting in the thread it is relevant regardless of the age of the thread.\n\nYet it still gets imported from other forums where necro-posting is a big deal because a lot of those other forums deal with things where the poster, not the thread topic, is why people read it. So a thread has no activity for 6 months, then someone necro-posts and all the activity alerts go off and all the users rush to the thread only to find it\u0027s a necro-post and not by the thread starter and get angry. Cue flames and unplesentness all around.\n\nIt causes enough bad feelings that users then import that expectation to other forums, that \u0022necro-posting is bad, don\u0027t do it!\u0022 where in fact it really isn\u0027t a big deal.\n\nAnother forum I\u0027m active on, it\u0027s gotten bad enough that if you post in a thread that has had no activity for 14 days you are 99% likely to get banned for a day, skipping just getting a warning/infraction entirely.

That\u0027s one good reason why we have moderators from different cultures too, so we discuss things together and come to understand better what a poster may mean in his own culture. Because all public messages  on the forum are visible to everybody, there is always the possibility an innocent thing (from the poster viewpoint) could be regarded as offensive in another culture. Basic mutual respect always helps, and that\u0027s a reason for the forum rules we have and how we act. We always try to make so offensive content is removed from public view, though not always easy. We may still be unaware of particular nuances (e.g., something could not raise concern to any of us but still have an undesirable meaning to others) so we find reports from users useful in this regard too."}]}
