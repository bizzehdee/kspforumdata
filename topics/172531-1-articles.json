And yes its is a problem with the way people think. I can remember going into group meetings and a director asking\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0027why are they asking for statistics, they never asked before all we did is given them numbers, it was good enough\u0027. And by and large what happens next is that researchers do the minimal statistical analysis that gets them published (as better published in a journal edited by a close colleague, which can get really bad if that colleague happens to be a member of the national academy of science and recommends your paper for publication in PNAS).\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo the basic problem is that these things are what you call multi-layer problems. For example suppose your asked to determine the accuracy of a string of numbers, but that string may contain characters or garbage also.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe original algorhithm only looks for numbers, in the same way an author only looks at one source of variation. But if there are several layers of variation, the authors don\u0027t look beyond that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLets take a few real life problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuppose you have dinosaur fossil X found at three points in time. Then you claim dinosaur appeared at T\u003Csub\u003E1\u003C/sub\u003E and went extinct at T\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E. This is actually wrong, the dinosaur appeared before T1 and went extinct after T3.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThats the second layer. The first layer of the problem is that the dating has variance also, so that needs to be cross multiplied into, which means you now have two inequities that are represented by a cumulative probability function (0ne rising and the other falling) on both ends. Still not done with the problem. What if at a long period after you find a new species that most likely descended from the one you think went extinct at T\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E There is a certain probability that this is a split, a continuous evolution or a result of parallel evolution. This specific issue will likely never be addressed formally. Even when this is known it will unlikely be stated.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother example, suppose you discover a gene that appears to perform the same unique function in two species. The gene also has some similar sites and some different sites (once such example was published by a very famous author, and it was later found out that the argument was biased and more sequence proved it to be in fact the conclusion were wrong). SO the probability then sorts many different ways.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-What is the probability that two SNPs appear twice.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-What is the probability of the gene passing from X population to Y or vice versa.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-What is the probability of the gene passing from Z population, independently to both.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-what are the probability that independent variants existed in both populations (incomplete constriction at the locus) and that similarities were simply due to \u0027gene conversion\u0027 (for many human evolution studies abortive recombination was not even considered as a possibility until after 2005).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn these cases authors will employ clocking methodologies (often biased) to rule in favor of one conclusion over the other, but often not present the probabilistic comparison. IOW the authors satisfied by their dating (or other guessing technique) and their sequence comparisons will draw a conclusion without finishing a proper statistical analysis. (Prior to 2010 this used to happen all the time).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf science or AI was a horse, we would call this putting the blinders on, restricting interpretation to a certain restricted field of results and ignoring sources of variations that one does not expect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AntINFINAIt","CreatedById":185060,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-17T20:58:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#c0392b\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:48px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cu\u003EThey copyed the brain of a warm and put it in am machine!\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYS7UIUM_SQ?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-17T21:00:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few things.

The classification\u00A0problem has been around forever, its not the fault of technology but humans. On many forms and most old forms i am classified as white. There in no part of my body that is white, the other term\u00A0is caucasian, none of my ancestors are from the caucasus mntns that i know of. White means not black or asian,\u00A0latino or native americans, even if there are blacks than lighter skin pigmentation than whites. What created this problem is the concentric circles of identity, as western Europeans moved out beyond their peoples they classified based upon their relative distance from them by several metrics, not the mean differences between groups but perceptional us-them metrics (somewhat better than the way the Norse used to do it). If you measure strictly based on all genetic differences there would be no tripart or quadrapart\u00A0races outside of Africa, all eurasians would be classed with NE and East Africans. So the race system is flawed from its derivation. If you do a learning algorhitm\u00A0\u00A0based on skewed references, then it will be skewed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore if the references are biased or skewed it is up to the standards organizations to remove the skew. In terms of the AI \u0027gadar\u0027 I have no idea what the concern is about, they are probably picking up on grooming habits etc. I once went to see a LBGT movie and throughout the movie the \u0027hip\u0027 members of the audiance were laughing their .. off for which me and my wife couldn\u0027t understand at all why they were laughing. \u00A0This happened repeatedly so it appears that the director of the movie was targeting information specifically to certain members of the audience and not others. So maybe the IA is picking up on things the general population cannot see.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe broader question is why classify if not required. What is the interest in classification, to review FB pages to determine who is gay. . . . why are we so interested of what people on FB think about us? I think this idea that everybdy wants to be somebody identified is silly. Do something dont just be something.
