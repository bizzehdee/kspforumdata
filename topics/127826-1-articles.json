It\u0027s a jack of all trades since you can attach it basically everywhere, has comparatively high thrust, and a high degree of vectoring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever.... the Thud is excruciatingly heavy for what it does and guzzles fuel. Especially since we now have the Vector that can basically do the same (sans attaching radially), but better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich raises the following questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIs there a good use case for a radially-attached LF/O engine with the stats of the Thud? If not, what would be proper stats to make the Thud more useful?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWould the engine be better off as a Monopropellant-fired service engine, like a large version of the \u0022Puff\u0022? Since the engine already looks like the shuttle\u0027s OMS, feeding it with the right fuel and statting it as a properly usable OMS engine would be sensible.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAre there any other purposes for the engine as it is right now? What would be better improvements on it? Remove it altogether?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nYour opinions are welcome. IMO, the Thud already has the looks of an OMS, and feeding it with Monopropellant means we can fly more realistic shuttle mission profiles since the shuttle does not need to carry LF\u002BO on board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T09:59:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Vectors do attach radially, although you\u0027ll need to whack a nosecone on top if you want sleek aerodynamics like the Thud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E2) Vectors and Thuds are balanced by science and funds.
