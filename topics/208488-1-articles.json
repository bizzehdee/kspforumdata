But when I try to make my own probe, I noticed that the \u0027stock\u0027 solar panels were bugged and were misbehaving? the panels were fully extended the moment I took the panels out from the part selector and won\u0027t close unless I pressed extend and retract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first, i thought this was \u0022Oh, it is just mods being mods.\u0022 as I had known that some of my mods were Solar Panels or Electricity related mods, like Near Future Solar, etc. So I retracted the panels just in case if it got extended at flight, in which would destroy the panels if it got fully extended mid flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut guess what? The panels were extended mid flight, soon after I left the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E for the launchpad regardless of whether I retracted the panels in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or not. Which surely resulted in my solar panel\u0027s destruction when I opened the fairing. I tested the panels on a probe and i noticed that it wasn\u0027t making any power, despite it was fully opened and the panels instantly closed itself when i pressed \u0027Extend panel\u0027 before the proper extending animation played out and the panels were \u0027\u003Cem\u003Etrully\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 extended. I suspect that the game thinks the panels were fully retracted, but in reality, the panels were opened. I was quite frustrated as my options were limited to non-stock solar panels, which were extremely oversized for my probes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any solutions to this before i resort to reinstalling all the mods? I have made a lot of changes to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E configs (I added some custom launch sites and ground stations for Real Antennas mod and that\u0027s probably all), and installed tonnes of mods. it would be tedious to re-apply those configs again if i were to reinstall all the mods. I have tried reinstalling Kopernicus and it fixes nothing.
