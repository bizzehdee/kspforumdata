He is smiling despite knowing that he is being sent to Duna on a one way mission (or at least until the Space Program decides to send another vessel to collect him) all on his own, within a space suit, within a tiny capsule and with no other entertainment than a minute window that will show nothing but cold cold space for the whole 200\u002B days of journey. Once within Duna\u0060s sphere of influence Jebediah can look forward to a couple of days of achieving orbit, landing and performing a couple of experiments on the surface. After that, nothingness... \u00A0nowhere to go, nothing to do, no one to speak to... alone in the planet, the omega kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, you guys get what is bugging me: we have great mods to deal with the lack of life support gameplay, great mods to give us more realistic aerodynamics and soon communications networks in 1.2 \u00A0all fine and dandy...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals however\u00A0seem to have 0 mental health needs, they will happily be put into a capsule for months on end... \u00A0You might say it is an acceptable break from reality, but I for one make sure that any mission that is going to go longer than 1 month HAS to have at least two kerbals in it and a some kind of crew cabin (usually the hitchikers storage container). It is not neccesary for the game mechanics, but it makes me feel like I am at least giving my little kerbalnauts the chance of leaving the cockpit and taking a shower, sitting down, just plain go somewhere else. Still, even that might be \u0022less than enough\u0022 for missions that count their duration in years instead of months... \u00A0what to do then?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, send a robot instead! And I am not talking about those crude drone core\u0060s than can pilot a ship and even land it, I\u00B4m talking about humanoid robots that can do everything (well, almost) a Kerbal can do without the mental breakdown that should come from being in an enclosed capsule with no company or entertainment for years. Hell, you can even send them to distant planets to set up surface bases, get them going, and then send the actual kerbals. Robots would not consume life support (great advantage) but would have no specialisation or leveling in career (big disadvantage), they wouldn\u00B4t be able to send crew or EVA reports, but they would be able to take surface samples and take experiment results\u00A0\u00A0from sensors just fine. They would be unlocked in career mode with one of the later drone techs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would love to build a mod that offers precisely that as I think it would add an interesting role-playing edge to the game that, as of now, is lacking.\u00A0I worked as a 3D designer for a few years so I offer myself to build the models (the idea is to use the current mesh, textures and animations from Kerbals and make some changes to make robots out of them, piece of cake!), I am however painfully ignorant when it comes to building mods and what it entails, I would need help (plenty of it) in that department.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny takers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-22T07:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel you. I do the same exact thing with Hitchhikers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the robots though, I think that\u0027s the role probe cores should be given. Sending a robot in a command capsule feels like a waste of space, mass and resources. The problem is robots can\u0027t do as much as astronauts even in real life, but in KSP they can do even less. We still have no scoop part that collects soil samples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I think the best way to deal with this problem is to give the player option early on in the career. IMO the tree should split into manned and unmanned branches as soon as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be fun to throw test dummies all over the place though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-22T07:10:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2016 07:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
