Of course I could give the part docking port or maybe probe core functionality, but that would have side effects I\u0027d rather avoid. Is there a part module that would just add what I need? I\u0027m not looking for a plugin, I want to do this entirely stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ABZB","CreatedById":98947,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T17:26:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei see the issue with giving the engine that thing - your navball would be off center from your ship, I would think.

The problem is that it makes the plane unmanned, which isn\u0027t that big a deal, it\u0027s just not what I want to do.
