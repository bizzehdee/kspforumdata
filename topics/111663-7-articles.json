Sad thing is now I cant recommend this game to anyone because the things I love about it (the accuracy of the orbital mechanics and parts used to build space craft) would not be enough for other to overlook the bugs, graphics and price for friends who are not as into it as I am.\n\nNick, if what you want is a traditional space simulator, get Orbiter. KSP is NOT supposed to be a full-on accurate-to-real-life space simulator. It is, first and foremost, a GAME. Personally, I have long wanted some sort of space simulation game that is reasonably realistic, but reasonably easy (or perhaps I should say non-frustrating) to play. When, some years ago I heard of Orbiter, I was at first delighted, then sorely disappointed - because it is so realistic that in order to make use of it, one had to understand all the controls in the ships, and as it happens, I don;t want to spend half an hour going through realistic pre-flight checks messing with various electrical systems and making sure valves and pumps ae operating OK. \n\nWhen I heard of KSP a little over a year ago, given it\u0027s cartoony appearance, I was hoping like heck that it wasn;t yet another game that is too UN-realistic to hold my attention. Luckily, and to my amazement, it hit the sweet spot for me - pretty good physics (good enough that you can actually learn things about real-world physics), but with fun game mechanics. And the Kerbals are , well, just so cute, too!\n\nSo far so good - but add to that - no DRM, the developers are at pains to make the game as easily moddbale as possible, and they actually listen to the community and respect their wishes to a reasonable extent? I still pinch myself now and then that such a wonderful thing has come into my life to entertain me so well for such a reasonable price.\n\nI\u0027ve not come across any other game giving even remotely so good value as KSP. And considering some of the ridiculous prices I see games advertised for these days, KSP in my opinion is excellent value. Orbiter - though actually free of charge - is not, to me, because it is not fun, to me. \n\nSo if what you want is full-on realism, try Orbiter. But KSP not being Orbiter doesnt detract from its excellent value for money.
