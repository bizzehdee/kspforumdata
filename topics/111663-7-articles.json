KSP is NOT supposed to be a full-on accurate-to-real-life space simulator. It is, first and foremost, a GAME. Personally, I have long wanted some sort of space simulation game that is reasonably realistic, but reasonably easy (or perhaps I should say non-frustrating) to play. When, some years ago I heard of Orbiter, I was at first delighted, then sorely disappointed - because it is so realistic that in order to make use of it, one had to understand all the controls in the ships, and as it happens, I don;t want to spend half an hour going through realistic pre-flight checks messing with various electrical systems and making sure valves and pumps ae operating OK. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I heard of KSP a little over a year ago, given it\u0027s cartoony appearance, I was hoping like heck that it wasn;t yet another game that is too UN-realistic to hold my attention.

And the Kerbals are , well, just so cute, too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far so good - but add to that - no DRM, the developers are at pains to make the game as easily moddbale as possible, and they actually listen to the community and respect their wishes to a reasonable extent?
