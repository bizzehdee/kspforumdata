There is, however a workaround! While the KSP2 faring\u0027s don\u0027t have interstage nodes, the simple engine mount has something that will work! It\u0027s a kludge, but it can get you there. I just did something like this to carry three comm sats to the Mun and deploy them. I got the idea from another post that I can\u0027t find right now or I\u0027d credit that clever person, but basically you can do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuild the internal structure of what you want to enclose with your faring using appropriately sized engine mounts from the structures group. They\u0027re all 0.7 tons so you whichever size makes sense, but flip them over to orient with the small side up. This will put the interstage node where you need it. On the engine plate I stick an XS truss and a XS stack separate or stack decoupler. You can use decouplers to let go of your payload, but be careful they\u0027re oriented the right way. If you use separators they weight a bit more but you do\u0027t have to worry about their orientation.
