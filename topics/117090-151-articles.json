UKS is going to push a few of these further, especially as far as logistics is concerned, but full details aren\u0027t available on that quite yet, but Roverdude has hinted that he wants his own EPL solution at some point, and I\u0027m fully expecting that propellant depots will end up being automated in a similar manner that\u00A0Planetary Resources are currently.

UKS is going to push a few of these further, especially as far as logistics is concerned, but full details aren\u0027t available on that quite yet, but Roverdude has hinted that he wants his own EPL solution at some point, and I\u0027m fully expecting that propellant depots will end up being automated in a similar manner that\u00A0Planetary Resources are currently.

Since you\u0027re not trying to make a \u0022gameplay\u0022 mod so much as a \u0022parts\u0022 mod, this means you are limited in some of the things you can do.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne major part that I haven\u0027t seen anyone build is a zero-boil off propellant depot, with a deployable sun\u00A0shield:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn terms of having this make sense in KSP terms (since you already offer ZBO tanks) - perhaps these have a lighter tank structure than the ZBO versions, but they only offer zero boil-off when the shroud is deployed?
