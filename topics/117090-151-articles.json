The baseContainerIndex is used mostly by the ModelSwitch module to determine what container to edit; you can safely (and should) leave it set to zero (\u00270\u0027) for your purposes (as you only have a single container anyway, index = 1 would throw an index out of bounds exception if it were used).\n\nAdding the subtract-mass field to your config, it should look like:\n\n     \tMODULE\n        {\n            name = SSTUVolumeContainer\n            volume = 24360\n            enableContainerEdit = true\n            enableFuelTypeChange = true\n            baseContainerIndex = 0\tsubtractMass = false\n            CONTAINER\n            {\n                name = Main Tank\n                percent = 100\n                tankageVolume = 0.15\n                tankageMass = 0.15\n                defaultModifier = standard\n                defaultFuelPreset = LFO\n                resource = LiquidFuel\n                resource = LqdHydrogen\n                resource = Oxidizer\n                resource = MonoPropellant\n                resource = XenonGas\n                resource = Aerozine50\n                resource = NTO\n                resource = ElectricCharge\n                resource = Lithium //custom stuff, works fine.\n                resource = XenonGas //custom stuff, works fine.\n                resource = ArgonGas //custom stuff, works fine.\n                resource = Food //custom stuff, works fine.\n                resource = Oxygen //custom stuff, works fine.\n                modifier = standard\n                modifier = lbo\n                modifier = zbo\n                modifier = light\n                modifier = structural\n                modifier = standard2 //custom stuff, works fine.\n                modifier = standard3 //custom stuff, works fine.\n                modifier = standard4 //custom stuff, works fine.\n            }\n    } \n\nLiterally the only thing that config setting does is to tell the module to zero out the config-specified mass or not:\n\n    \t\tpublic float GetModuleMass(float defaultMass, ModifierStagingSituation sit)\n            {            \n                return subtractMass ? -defaultMass \u002B modifiedMass : modifiedMass;\n            }\n\n(and wow, the tabs on those quotes/code blocks are horrible.... thanks forum software, always nice working with you...)\n\nHow exactly is it getting \u0027bugged out\u0027?"},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-13T00:34:03Z","Content":"Damn, sorry I posted this while I was trying to figure out what was wrong.

For instance, a 1.25m habitation only allows space for say 2 kerbals.  If you move it up to 2.5m it becomes 4 and 3.75 becomes 6.  With the IVAs they would be grabbed and used as appropriate according to which size is chosen for the part.

Realy, its cover everything related to space and Si-Fy in the best retro format possible.\n\u003E \n\nWhat you are describing would be an excellent solution if KSP\u0027s performance was not part count limited.  I would ideally do modular parts in such a fashion; a \u0027core\u0027 part that is mostly structural, and plug-in additional parts to add functionality and fill in the module slots in the core part.  This is the way KSP is designed to work, and I would absolutely love to be able to set things up like that.\n\nSadly, as every additional part you add to a vessel decreases performance in a non-linear fashion... I simply cannot endorse any such methods currently.  Would it be a cool mechanic?  Yes, it could/would be awesome.  Would it turn already poor-FPS on large stations into absolute slideshows? Yes again.\n\nI would rather have slightly fewer options and actually be able to play the game at reasonable frame rates than have super-cool features that play at a crawl.  \u003C60 fps bugs me; it is why I build my own computers and use fairly high-end components for them; it is the reason I started this mod in the first place.  With other graphics limited games it is often easy enough to lower a few of the graphics options to achieve smooth framerates.  This does not work in KSP as it is already graphically simple and all of the \u0027lag\u0027 comes from the physics/CPU end of things (where even my highly overclocked CPU can only go so far to alleviating the problem).  The situation has improved in 1.1 quite a bit compared to 0.90/1.0.x, but not nearly enough that I could endorse modularity at the part-level.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, rasta013 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe I\u0027m missing something as it\u0027s late, I\u0027m exhausted and only skimmed the last 2 pages of posts....\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Couldn\u0027t you hard code the crew capacity and have the IVAs appropriate to the chosen part?

With the IVAs they would be grabbed and used as appropriate according to which size is chosen for the part.  Basically the idea would be to restrict the sizing to fairly standard versions and allow nothing in between.

Would need to find a way to integrate the functionality into the boiloff plugin though, which may be difficult as they would be residing on separate parts.\n\nShipyard -- I kind of liked their long/linear shipyard concept.  No idea if it would work with EPL\u0027s model setup though (I believe it expects vessels to be constructed at one end of the part with lots of clearance on every side).\n\nWet workshop -- has been suggested a few times.  Mostly it runs afoul of KSPs module-swapping limitations; there is no way to have a part be distinctly a fuel tank for some of its life and distinctly a hab/lab part for the rest -- the modules would have to be always present and somehow hacked to be disabled/unusable while the part had fuel in it.  In short... would be a ton of code for not much return.  I also highly doubt that I would ever use them in my games, so the likelihood of me making them is minimal.  I would much rather have proper station parts even if they require a bit more rocket below them to get into orbit.\n\nIntegrating science experiments -- could be done, but cannot be done in a modular fashion (KSP module swapping limitations/inability to handle it).  So a part would always have the experiments on it.  Would also limit the availability of said station parts until the stock experiment part had been unlocked as well; which I\u0027m not fond of.  I\u0027ve even thought on how to make a multi-experiment science package that improves as you unlock the other experiments in the tech tree; but again, it runs into the limitation/inability to dynamically add modules to parts.

For the purely \u0027structural\u0027 bits though, I\u0027ll be relying heavily on Nertea\u0027s Near-Future Octo-Trusses, and they do not come with ladders.  Nothing (simple or easy) that I can do to solve that.\n\nIn other news, I did some investigation / poking around with PorkJet\u0027s Hab pack last night.  Apparently dynamic crew capacity can work, but has a few issues (such as not showing properly in the editor), and I\u0027ve not yet tested the IVAs to see if they can be swapped around successfully.\n\nIt -might- be possible to have a single modular part with multiple crew options and model switching.  However this still does not remove the problems associated with scaling a crewed part -- window and hatch sizes and IVA size/position in relation to the exterior model.  So modular, maybe.  Scalable, no.\n\nHave also started playing around with how to animate inflatables.  Have some tests tonight to do to see if I can get ShapeKeys/BlendShapes working in KSP, but I have my doubts (last I heard they work fine in Unity, but PartTools does not export them/import them properly into the game).  They do make some very nice looking inflation animations though, perfectly suited for inflatables.

I\u0027m moderately familiar with them from working on the KSPedia stuff, but have no clue how they relate to loading model and texture assets.  When they were initial \u0027advertised\u0027 as being supported it was stated that they would load any component that Unity recognized, but I\u0027m really unsure on how to access them from in-game to load the models, etc.  Will let you know if I find out more...\n\nProgress update:  \n\nHave figured out how to access/load AssetBundle data from in-game, but it is a bit weird.  It appears to load asynchronously, so I\u0027m going to need to somehow ensure that I can get the models loaded prior to them being needed on prefabs (or else have placeholder models for prefab icon display).  And have just verified that the BlendShape keys do import properly this way.  Have not yet managed to get the model to display or animate in-game, but that shouldn\u0027t be too difficult of a thing to accomplish now that I can get the models to load.\n\nSo... I\u0027ve got a few things to think over/investigate regarding how best to handle the model-loading for asset-bundle based models.  I -might- be able to start them loading at the point where ModuleManager finishes its database loading; hopefully this would give them time to load so that I could inject them into the GameDatabase loaded models list so that they can be used as any other model.  But as my head is pounding from digging through obscure KSP API stuff, that investigation will have to wait for another time / tomorrow.\n\nSounds like that\u0027s two major features needed for the station parts that I\u0027ve got sorted out now.  The next to investigate will be dynamic IVA swapping;  a brief look indicated that most of the fields/methods that look like they would be needed are all public and accessible, so there may yet be some hope for that as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-14T01:48:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2016 01:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T06:22:28Z","Content":"Unless you are really opting in for the inflatable habitat market, I would just start off with cylindrical habs, first.
