What you told me there isn\\\u0027t clear from your post above though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you are saying is that MechJeb orients the spacecraft perpendicular to its velocity vector throughout the burn. This causes the spacecraft to move in an approximately circular arc during the burn. (I say approximately because the ship\\\u0027s velocity is not constant along the undisturbed hyperbolic trajectory.) There is no effect on the magnitude of the ship\\\u0027s velocity (only the direction) as a result, and the specific orbital energy is unchanged. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, my point still stands. You are expending 80 m/s Delta-V to change the ship\\\u0027s direction of travel and including that 80 m/s in the results for the one case, but you are not including any Delta-V for mid-course corrections in the other case. Had the TMI burn for the two cases been executed slightly differently however, this 80 m/s Delta-V burn could have been eliminated. As I said in my post above, it is possible to achieve a Munar periapsis of 5 km through careful planning of the TMI burn. It is also possible to plan a Munar impact trajectory that starts from the same Kerbin orbit but that requires only very slightly different timing and/or Delta-V at the time of the TMI burn. As a result, I don\\\u0027t think it is an appropriate comparison to penalise one case with the Delta-V of a mid-course correction and not the other. The mid-course correction burn should either be ignored or averaged between the two cases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
