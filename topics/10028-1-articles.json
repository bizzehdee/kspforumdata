I made sure my velocity was a few hundred m/s by 10km, and kept the speed up to avoid gravity losses. I landed, expending a total of 984 delta-V. Fuel left was 275.9295.\n\nLow PE descent:\n\nBurned radially to raise PE to 5km (about a 17\u00C2\u00B0 difference equating to a 104m/s burn). Landed, expending a total of 980 delta-V (this includes the course change burn). Fuel left was 276.7127.\n\nConclusion:\n\nFor this combination of mass and thrust, a low PE landing is more efficient than direct descent. More thrust is required to make a direct descent more efficient than a low PE descent. I knew there is a value of thrust vs mass that would make one more efficient than the other. The craft used in this experiment comes pretty close to that value.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nI tested the two descent methods with mechjeb, with the mechjeb replacing the ASAS on the previous stated lander.\n\nStarting conditions were: 381m/s @ 2Mm altitude and -90\u00C2\u00B0 angle.\n\nDirect descent: 1018 delta-V\n\nLow PE descent: 1053 delta-V (this includes an 80 delta-V course change)\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt\\\u0027s a pretty close call for realistic scenarios. How often do you end up with near -90\u00C2\u00B0 angles when entering the Mun\\\u0027s SOI? It\\\u0027s safe to say that, for this craft, if you have a PE above ground level, go with the low PE landing."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-29T20:02:00Z","Content":"Am I wrong in thinking there is not enough in it to choose one landing over another?

Do you have enough thrust to make a direct descent more efficient than the alternative? You don\\\u0027t have to go straight down from 2Mm. A less elliptical path into the Mun will still bring you down at a nearly vertical angle towards the end. If you think have enough thrust, don\\\u0027t make any course changes, even if you\\\u0027re coming in at an awkward angle.\n\nFor myself, I won\\\u0027t be doing any direct descents in the future.

What you told me there isn\\\u0027t clear from your post above though. \n\nWhat you are saying is that MechJeb orients the spacecraft perpendicular to its velocity vector throughout the burn. This causes the spacecraft to move in an approximately circular arc during the burn. (I say approximately because the ship\\\u0027s velocity is not constant along the undisturbed hyperbolic trajectory.) There is no effect on the magnitude of the ship\\\u0027s velocity (only the direction) as a result, and the specific orbital energy is unchanged. \n\nThat being said, my point still stands. You are expending 80 m/s Delta-V to change the ship\\\u0027s direction of travel and including that 80 m/s in the results for the one case, but you are not including any Delta-V for mid-course corrections in the other case. Had the TMI burn for the two cases been executed slightly differently however, this 80 m/s Delta-V burn could have been eliminated. As I said in my post above, it is possible to achieve a Munar periapsis of 5 km through careful planning of the TMI burn. It is also possible to plan a Munar impact trajectory that starts from the same Kerbin orbit but that requires only very slightly different timing and/or Delta-V at the time of the TMI burn. As a result, I don\\\u0027t think it is an appropriate comparison to penalise one case with the Delta-V of a mid-course correction and not the other. The mid-course correction burn should either be ignored or averaged between the two cases."}]}
