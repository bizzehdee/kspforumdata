I tried mapping Wal first. The altimetry map is all right, but the biome map just displays green and everything is \u0022Chronister Valley\u0022. I haven\u0027t got the chance to map anything else yet.\u00A0Keep in mind that I play KSP\u00A01.2.2. I understand if no-one is able to help me, I do play an outdated version, but I want to know if this is a known bug, and has a fix. Thank you in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I used the stock Kerbnet, and found out that Kerbnet also displays \u0022Chronister Valley\u0022. It\u0027s apparently not a SCANsat problem, rather, it\u0027s an OPM problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-17T11:41:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2018 11:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Ho Lam Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"voicey99","CreatedById":166341,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-04T13:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis question is old, but answering for the record - Polta and Wal have\u00A0a bugged biome map in versions of OPM before 1.2.6.
