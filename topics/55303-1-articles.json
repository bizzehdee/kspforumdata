The relationship ended badly and we haven\u0027t spoken to each other in years. Before that I had purchased a large Toothless stuffed animal (you know from How to Train your Dragon). It was amazing. It was almost 50 inches long and had this amazing wingspan. It was also cuddly and wonderful. Since it was a gift to her from me obviously she kept it. I purchased it on Etsy and now the person who made it is no longer active and her store has disappeared into the Etsy nether. I know it\u0027s stupid to feel sad about this, but it\u0027s been really bothering me something fierce. I\u0027m not even sure why I\u0027m mentioning this, but I think I just needed to vent it because I\u0027m tired of bottling it up and quietly weeping about it before I go to sleep. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T16:48:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is but one hope: plushie Kerbals!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tanuki_chau","CreatedById":80701,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T17:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dunno.
