After some frantic searching through old file cabinets and the trash, they dug up blueprints for a discontinued (for good reason) rover stuck to the bottom of a bin. But at least now they also had some schemes for parts Jeb could use in other designs\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow to play/submit:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you installed everything correctly and start the Scenario you should find yourself at KSC. Your Job is to get to all three data centers and plug them back in or get the data (science) contained in them by other means. You can use all facilities of the KSC and are encouraged to use the Tracking center to switch to the various data centers and make yourself a picture of the situation before you start. Whenever you get the data from a datacenter and get it back to KSC (either in person or by transmission)you can use the research center to unlock new parts that will help you build a craft capable of reaching the next datacenter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo complete the challenge fly a lander of your choice containing one or more !visible! parts unlocked in the last backup to the first backup station. Then post a picture from the backup stations viewpoint showing the lander.
