When the electricity goes above zero (when the planet rotates and it is \u0022day\u0022, it has solar panels) the ship comes back to life but the SAS doesn\u0027t work.

SAS eats electricity and\u00A0for larger ships with more reaction wheels, drain may be significant. It makes sense to start in \u0022safe mode\u0022 after power loss in case you need power for control (ie.\u00A0deplying forgoten solar panels).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T17:11:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNah it\u0027s an old stock bug, quicksave then quickload should restore it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
