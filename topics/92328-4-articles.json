WW2 industrial capacity used pre-existing technology that had been worked on for a decade already (B-17 flew in the 1930\u0027s, B-29 was proposed in 1938 as a serious project for the USAF, not just some atomic researchers far-out fantasy); we only have four years. Orion hasn\u0027t been completed; the most we have are some \u003Cem\u003Etheoretical\u003C/em\u003E blueprints and some data from a tests of a half-finished prototype that wasn\u0027t even fully funded. And the Manhattan project was just that. A bomb, that would run off an atomic reaction. Now Orion on the other hand, is going to need a completely new life support system that \u003Cem\u003Eby itself\u003C/em\u003E,will take four years to design and test. It\u0027s going to need farms, it\u0027s going to need new advances in almost everything. Like Starman said, almost every required component of the Manhattan Project was in place except for the bomb itself, and we don\u0027t have that luxury with the proposed Orion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t have a regularly used space-to-orbit transit system that has been well tested (Although I wish we did). Heck, we can\u0027t even keep people alive in a oversized tin can outside of our atmosphere without sending in supplies every half-year or so. To expect us to develop a completely self-sufficent life support system and \u003Cem\u003Esend it to space\u003C/em\u003E all in the manner of four years would be like trying to go to space by strapping yourself to a bunch of leftover Fourth of July fireworks and expect to live.

The M4 Sherman was made of steel and mostly mechanical parts: the M1 Abrams is made of advanced composite armor, uses very specific electronics for fire control, and is in general a vastly more complicated beast. If we \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E to mass-produce a tank in the next decade, it would probably look a whole lot more like the M48 or early M60 than the M1.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027m not buying the arguments of either of you. Creating something new is always harder and takes more time than you expect, even after you adjust your expectations for this. On the other hand, cost-effectiveness has been so deeply ingrained in our society for decades, that it\u0027s very hard for us to consider any other approaches seriously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember some Soviet jokes about their dealings with the Chinese from my childhood. The Chinese were always building some huge project, and the Soviets were helping them. Soviet consultants told the Chinese that they would need heavy equipment and advanced techniques, and the construction would take four years. The Chinese answered that they would get the project done in four months, which the Soviets didn\u0027t believe. Next day, a million Chinese workers showed up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe jokes were obviously exaggerations, but they were based on what Soviet engineers actually experienced in China.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
