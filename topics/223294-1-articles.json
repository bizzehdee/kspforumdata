Primarily, I am upset with the limitations of the Flag Text Blocks.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI play this game because of the Management aspect and enjoy immersing myself in a world of my own design. Complete with lore developing for multiple competing agencies. I often find myself having to put more effort than i would like into reducing word count. I am overly verbose by nature and thought KSP1 text limits were a bit too restrictive at times. KSP2 sees to have cut the word count in half.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs there a significant number of you out there like myself?

I do not envision the writing of a novel to be upon the fabric of the standard itself. No.. this\u00A0 would be a nice historical / commemorative plaque beneath said agency iconography.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI cannot title my Flag\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding Site #1\u003Cbr\u003E\nSuper Secret Site #3\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy the great creator Kerbeclesse herself this should be Remedied at some point. Im sure the title part will never even reach the radar of excrements to do.. but having to take up so much of the precious text count with roman numerals VS arabic is insane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spicat","CreatedById":228085,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-27T12:24:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose have been reported!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6711834855\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/221990-numbersconsecutive-capital-letters-not-allowed-in-name-of-planted-flag/?do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:194px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7456986262\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/221765-planted-flags-not-showing-up-in-tracking-station/?do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:194px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpvote them, that will give a greater chance for them to be fixed quickly!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
