We should have a speed multipler in the IR window AND on the tweakable. In my mind the one in the window allows you to control the global speed of your action, so is pretty much the go-to one for all situations. A speed multiplier on each part would merely be used to compensate for the range of your part. For instance one of my new pivotrons rotates 90 degrees, and the hinges rotate 180. This multiplier would be used to half the speed of the first hinge so that they both get to their start and end positions at the same time. In the part I\u0027ve done this with two separate groups, which not only makes things conceptually more difficult to manage but means you can\u0027t perform both at the same time. Having both multipliers gives you this flexibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K3|Chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K3|Chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIdea for 2 new parts I think the community would enjoy:\u003Cp\u003EStack mounted part that folds out 2 engine mounts from near center to far enough out to make the rocket exhaust clear the stack, would allow slim mounting of radial engines for those of us using FAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea, what sirkut said \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENext part has a similar purpose, but instead of allowing engines to pop out it would allow you to attach components in a radial fashion without having to use radial docking ports.\u003Cp\u003EHow to describe it? Imagine a cylinder, it\u0027s sliced up into several discs that interlock into a solid enough cylinder, on the outside of the cylinder are symmetric vertical protruding lines, same number of lines as there are discs, say 4, each disc has a rotating pivot in one of the lines, from the top/bottom the action of the part deploying would look like one circle turning into 5, one in the middle and 4 around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously the discs wouldn\u0027t be completely solid, there would have to be come curves missing to allow for internal structure of the main cylinder without blocking the pivoting action if that makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 4 discs that fold out could either be docking ports or allow for mounting docking ports on a node, dock fuel tanks and engines to each circle to make an engine cluster in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nature of the mechanism would stagger each ring on the vertical axis a bit, not sure how big of an issue that would be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 1.25, 2.5 and 3.75 version would make sense I think, question is how many radial circles per part? could perhaps make it only 2 and have people use several to get the number they want, I think using 3 each one turned 120 degrees to get 6 total would work nicely etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI too have difficulty grasping this idea, could you perhaps draw a picture? Also, what you describe sounds like a single part with multiple robotics elements within it. This is not possible with IR, and goes against its construction style, since it\u0027s my job to give people the tools to make such devices rather than offer the complete things. For example, my phoenix implementation is many different parts that \u0027can\u0027 be assembled to have engines come out, but could have many other uses.
