However, Kopernicus doesn\u0027t support the Mun\u0027s procedural craters, Minmus\u0027s fractal terrain generator, or MapDecals.\n\nMapDecals are VERY VERY useful. The giant volcano on Krag from PlanetFactory was a MapDecal. The sagan face on Tylo is a MapDecal.\n\nThere is also no support for PQSCities, which is what the face on Duna, the Munoliths/Arches, and the Space Center is. You can just use KerbalKonstructs for this though.\n\nAlso, lots of the planets in NewKerbol used a custom PQS Mod I wrote that allows you to color based on curves, including tangents and other cool things, which lead to smoother colors. And Laythe\u0027s glowing oceans used another PQS Mod to make them glow.\n\nHowever, there is still hope for implementing things like that.I think I may have found out how to use a plugin to extend the range of PQS Mods supported by Kopernicus. I\u0027ll have to experiment with it some more to be sure.\n\nAlso, there is no way I know of to use Kopernicus to configure the ocean\u0027s PQS, which is actually completely seperate from the main terrain\u0027s PQS, so any kind of cool oceans are not really possible.\n\nI might write up some way more detailed documentation for all of this PQS stuff later after school is over (in 1 week ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ).\n\nEdit: And @Astrofox, when I say procedural, I don\u0027t mean random generation like in minecraft. I mean the planet is based off a seed, and since the seed stays constant, the planet never changes. Most of the stock planets are procedural in this way.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T01:21:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 01:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MrHappyFace**"}]}
