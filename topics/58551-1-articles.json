I certainly drop tanks, though im happy with low twr and carried just 1 nuke, so no engine drops there.

Its kerbin with a slightly lower aerobrake and easier climb out, i often sling off a jool intercept directly into laythe aerobrake (precisenode and conics mode 0).

It\u0027s the intercept that takes work, and that just means you need enough delta-V in total. You can get there with ions pretty easily, although that obviously limits the size of your vessel and you\u0027ll still need conventional rockets for the actual landing. Alternately, send a fuel depot to the outer regions of Eve\u0027s sphere of influence, i.e. Gilly, and and refuel on the way to and from Moho with whatever sort of design you use for Mun or Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe isn\u0027t hard to land on at all, as long as you\u0027re good enough at steering to aim for land. Taking off is easy with spaceplanes, a bit more painful with rockets, but any design that can take off from Kerbin can do the same on Laythe with ease. You just have to stop doing asparagus designs, and that probably means putting some sort of refueling depot in Laythe orbit. Personally, I use an SSTO spaceplane that can fly straight from Kerbin to Laythe using ion engines; if you don\u0027t have a plane like this then yes, you\u0027ll need a new design, but that sort of vessel is useful for many other bodies as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo and Eve are the painful ones, and unless you\u0027re VERY good you\u0027ll need custom designs for those two. Eve\u0027s incredibly easy to land on, it\u0027s just the takeoffs that are brutal. Tylo is the reverse; the combination of high gravity and no atmosphere means most designs will burn a lot of fuel on the way down, so unless you use the Kethane mod to refuel on the surface you\u0027ll have problems taking off again, but the actual takeoff isn\u0027t difficult at all since you can go max thrust the whole way up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlamedSteak","CreatedById":67223,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T02:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe good thing with Laythe (and Duna for that matter) on .23 is that you can tinker with \u0027chutes to deploy a bit higher up.
