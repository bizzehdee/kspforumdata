And by \u0022modern\u0022 they meant \u0022heat, air, and perhaps a bit of water.\u0022 The first Nitrogen mission (Nitrogen A-1) would help reach that goal by installing a large docking adapter and reconfiguring the station slightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNitrogen was the next step forward in spaceflight. Developed with modularity in mind, each Nitrogen craft would include a capsule or one or two kerbals, an \u0022orbital module\u0022 so they could safely snack in space without getting crumbs in the controls, and a \u0022service module\u0022 to get all the above into space in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo loft this new mass into orbit, Wernher and the interns developed a \u0022new\u0022 launch vehicle: The LV-04 Sonata. Not really a completely new vehicle, it discarded the four Gustave V-2 strap-on boosters for four copies\u00A0of the core stage from the LV-03. A bit of extra power on the upper stage and it was good enough to handle all three variants of the Nitrogen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151222_ksp0004_n-a1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151222_ksp0004_n-a1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151222_ksp0013_n-a1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151222_ksp0013_n-a1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor reasons of crew safety, the capsule and orbital module were attached to a \u0022launch escape system.\u0022 It was assumed this would pull the soft, mushy crew away from an exploding rocket without turning them into jelly. Just because kerbals are fungible doesn\u0027t mean they should be fungi.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne element of the Nitrogen vehicle enjoyed by all crews, both flight and ground, was the new onboard computer system. Unlike previous vehicles, the kOS module is now standard and included in the service module of the orbiter, allowing for all operations while in flight to be controlled by scripts. (Scripts which are being retooled to run from shared libraries.) In addition, all Nitrogen-class vehicles include onboard telemetry thanks to some overworked interns and an Engineer 7500 module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151222_ksp0026_n-a1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151222_ksp0026_n-a1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough it\u0027s likely more variations will appear in the future, today\u0027s Nitrogen mission was conducted using the A-type, A for Adapter. Engineer Sieta Kerman was sent up with the docking adapter to hopefully bring \u0022Thing B\u0022 back to a useable state. The docking adapter part of the craft would then be left behind at the station for future craft to use, allowing them to include the smaller, androgynous docking adapter developed by Tantares.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther variants include the C-type, which is identical to the A-type excluding the docking ports between the return and habitat modules, and the T-type, T for Twin, which can ferry two astronauts into orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151222_ksp0030_n-a1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151222_ksp0030_n-a1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuperior mission planning from the snack-and-coffee-fueled interns at the space center meant the Nitrogen A-1 rendezvoused with Thing B just as both craft exited into the morning sunlight after less than one orbit. The Boss was most pleased.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill uncertain as to the docking capabilities of the flight computer, Sieta took over and guided the small craft in. (That, and because the programmer kerbs hadn\u0027t actually written a docking program. When run the docking program just blinked a few lights and bleeped as though an error had occurred. The error of course being the rest of the code didn\u0027t exist.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151222_ksp0040_n-a1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151222_ksp0040_n-a1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd with that, they were successfully and safely docked to a decades-old space station. A quick inspection of the interior revealed a few micro-meteorite damaged sections that would need to be sealed off; A few sections where water had both frozen and sublimated, resulting in all manner of burst pipes; And a few sections that are best not described.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bulk of the ship was cold. Very cold. Even without radiators it wasn\u0027t near to overheating, with the internal part temperature averaging 152\u00A0Kelvin. No doubt it would heat up as the atmosphere was pumped back into it and crews started living in it once more, but for now it was too cold to touch. Radiators were high on the list of additions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151222_ksp0044_n-a1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151222_ksp0044_n-a1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe inspection also revealed that station\u0027s full name: \u0022Kelgee Station.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And I think it\u0027s haunted.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uuuuh, say again Nitrogen? Did you say, haunted?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. Haunted. I\u0027m hearing weird noises up here. Gives me the creeps.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher shook his head at the CapCom, who radioed back to politely tell Sieta to keep a lid on the crazy talk. \u0022These engineers and their crazy superstitions.\u0022 Meanwhile Wernher and the interns set about deciding how best to bring the station up to survivable levels. After some review they agreed to move the Laboratory Module from its current position near the \u0022ventral\u0022 (or top / solar-panel) side of the station to a position closer to the docking adapter installed by Sieta.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd they were in luck, as the ancient construction bot used to first assemble the station still worked, still had antennas, and had nearly a full tank of monoprop. It was no problem to have it wrangle the lab module and its connected science pod down to the dorsal node of the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151222_ksp0057_n-a1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151222_ksp0057_n-a1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s when the fun began. Sieta sealed off the rest of the station, pumped the atmosphere up in the lab and the hab connected to it, and went to disconnect the science pod. (With the intent of moving the pod somewhere else and using that docking port for another Nitrogen A-type adapter.) She pulled the release lever for the docked pod and instructed the bot to pull it away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe science pod was having nothing of the sort. Releasing it caused a loud shriek to echo through the station. A metal-rending, soul-grinding sound that shook even the kerbals on the ground. The science pod and the construction bot (Gerty. Its name was Gerty....) shot off into the kosmos, leaving behind the wasted ruin of everything everyone had ever known or loved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151222_ksp0065_n-a1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151222_ksp0065_n-a1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151222_ksp0067_n-a1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151222_ksp0067_n-a1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then Kerbin started to disappear, along with most of the station.

That this is what had happened the last half-dozen times she tried.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cursed, not haunted. Cursed. And I\u0027m leaving.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission control erupted into a cacophony of noise as everyone scrambled to put down their celebratory snacks and get back to their stations. \u0022Nitrogen, Flight. Did you say \u0027leaving\u0027?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, that\u0027s right, leaving. The station\u0027s already named after one dead kerbal. I\u0027m not sticking around to see if it\u0027s him or some other shade that\u0027s cursed the place, and I\u0027m certainly not waiting here long enough to have one named after me. My official\u00A0engineering evaluation of this place is that it\u0027s haunted and we should hurl it into deep space. With lava.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151222_ksp0069_n-a1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151222_ksp0069_n-a1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure enough, the station cameras and the shipboard sensors both showed Sieta had undocked from the station and was quickly backing away, only 2 days into a 5 day mission. Gene scrambled to find something else for her to do while still in orbit. Wasn\u0027t there a contract somewhere here? Something from that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E outfit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, there it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EThing C\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151222_ksp0071_n-a1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151222_ksp0071_n-a1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022N-A1, Flight. Since you\u0027re in such a hurry to leave we wondered if you might be willing to check out a second target for us. Something called \u0027Sky Home.\u0027 The toy rocket company we bought those early experiments from wants us to expand it, and I\u0027d like to know if it\u0027s worthwhile.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are there any ghosts? Or zombies? No, I can handle zombies. Just no ghosts, ok?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so Sieta set out for Baile Speir, one of the first true Sky Homes. \u0022Thing C\u0022 as it were, was in a lower orbit than Kelgee (100km vs 130km). Being slightly behind the two of them, the Nitrogen A-1 needed to kick itself into an even higher orbit and wait for the station to catch up. A little over an orbit later and she had a good view of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151222_ksp0078_n-a1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151222_ksp0078_n-a1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok flight, I\u0027ve got a nice picture of it now.

There are still two ships here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, you said you could handle space zombies....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where did all the crews go? Three seats in each of these big ships, only one in that weird bird-like thing back at the other. If they were all full, then we\u0027re missing ten kerbals. Wernher or any of the brain trust have an idea?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene looked over to the chief designer, who had visibly perked up at the mention of his name. \u0022Ja! There are the tales of the mighty kraken, who cracks open the ships of unsuspecting kerbals and eats them, slowly. Munch, a munch, a munch, like that. Their tormented souls can be heard screaming all the way from its lair in the...\u0022 The line went dead when Gene pulled the plug on Wernher\u0027s headset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, sorry about that N-A1. No, Wernher most certainly does NOT have an idea as to what\u0027s eating the missing crews. Please take a look inside and advise us on its condition.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151222_ksp0082_n-a1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151222_ksp0082_n-a1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe condition was remarkable\u00A0considering its age. A cursory check of the exterior showed a number of communications devices (Sieta suspected this was more of a comms relay than a space station), and no substantial damage. She forced a few of the antennas open, hoping at least one of them would connect to the network and start sending data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe poked her head inside and was surprised to see the sensors in the airlock reporting a full atmosphere. No signs of a crew, and no signs of some violent encounter with a giant space squid either.
