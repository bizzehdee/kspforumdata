Their main duty is to carry landers and space station modules to another planet, drop their cargo in designated orbit, then return home for another payload. Or stay in orbit serving as a temporary fuel depot until mission is over - then bring the crew back to Kerbin. For such kind of operations simple is better. Docking ports of at least two sizes for refuelling, plenty of RCS propellant, small lake of fuel, energy sources form the core of the ship.

My \u0022Mother Ships\u0022 always include a command section, with a decoupler/docking port and some extra fuel and engine so that it can be jettisoned in the event of catastrophic failure on mission. IT also usually includes an aerobraking heat shield for use either at the destination, or upon return to Kerbin (I play with DRE). A habitat section, featuring enough living space for twice the number of crew on mission, this section typically includes a lab/habitat module and a gravity ring. The third section I build is the Power Generation Section. This section features a nuclear reactor, electrical generator, and associated hardware. I also usually include some type of radiation shielding between this section and the living section, though this is usually just me putting a heatshield and decoupler between the two, so that the reactor and drive sections can be jettisoned should the need arise. The final section is the Drive section. This is where the fuel and engines are mounted. Typically this is a thermal rocket attached directly to the reactor, and using the fuel as the previously mentioned radiation shield, or, much more commonly, it is nuclear engines. In the absence of the reactor section, due to either technological or engine limitations, one set of ventral and one set of dorsal solar panels is added to the drive and habitat module. An emergency set is always included on the command section."},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T11:31:32Z","Content":"I prefer to start the design of such a ship with a heavily struted core construction. That center piece only contains a minimum of fuel, the engines and a vast number of docking ports to attach the required number of NASA-sized fuel tanks later on. Since everything heavy is directly connected to the super-struted core the whoble is at least manageable. I usually put the engines somewhere radially around the midle of the ship to decreases the whoble further. Depending on the required delta-v for a mission, I drop the fuel tanks along the way.

If it\u0027s for exploratory purposes (my designs usually are) then here\u0027s what I tend to inculde:\n\n- **kerbal storage capacity**: Motherships usually carry relatively high kerbal crews in my case (20 and up) for roleplay reasons as well as colony/base crew rotation reasons.\n\n- **landers crammed full of science equipment**: You want as many landers as you feel comfortable with in the mission plan. Either go with several specialised (possibly one-shot) landers or with only one or two broad purpose, re-usable landers. Both have their advantages: specialised one-shots are very often small, light and easily incorporated into the mothership design. Re-usable ones are, well, re-usable. Also, you\u0027ll only need one or two for several different mission targets. That being said, they won\u0027t be as efficient as dedicated landers and they will likely also be bigger and more difficult to incorporate into the design.\n\n- **science lab \u002B science equipment**: optional, but if you\u0027re going to be using multi-purpose landers, you\u0027ll want to be able to recycle the science experiments. It\u0027s also nice to have dedicated science equipment on the mothership itself, that way you don\u0027t have to always use those of the landers when you\u0027re just orbiting, aerobraking, etc.\n\n- **satellites**: on exploratory missions, leaving satellites in orbit is a nice way to be able to fulfil contract later down the line.\n\n- **(sacrificial) surface probes**: if landing isn\u0027t planned, undesirable (Eve, I\u0027m looking at you) or impossible (Jool, Kerbol), then sacrificial probes are a great way to get science anyways. Pack a couple and send em off with a wave and a tear to get blown up in the name of science.\n\n- **Escape pods/science delivery pods**: single man pods with limited fuel supply can have a two-fold purpose: either to evacuate Kerbals in case of emergency (for role-play purposes unless you run breakdown mods) or, more practically, as science carriers upon return to Kerbin. Large motherships are often incapable of landing on Kerbin in one piece, and rather than send up another mission to collect science, it can be easier to just cram all science into one pod and send it down.\n\n- **Supply and utility module**: usually includes but is not limited to electricity generation, SAS, batteries, monopropellant for use on both mothership and landers, possibly some xenon tanks if you want to refuel some ion-powered things during the mission\n\nOther than that, you obviously want some docking ports and lots of lights. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s about all I can think of."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T13:58:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Does anyone actually know how to reliably even do this?

If your ship looks like a ball, it\u0027s probably a good design. If it looks like a stick, it can be good or bad. If it\u0027s two balls at the opposing ends of a stick, it\u0027s probably bad.\n\nI usually start with the engine module. It should be a single rigid module with engines and fuel tanks. Ideally most of the mass of the ship should be in the engine module, but even if that\u0027s not true, the center of mass of the ship should always be within the module. Engines should be behind the center of mass, allowing you to use thrust vectoring to control the ship during maneuvers.\n\nOther heavy modules, such as large landers and fuel tanks, should be docked directly in front or behind the engine module. Their centers of mass should always be as close to the docking port as possible. Smaller modules can then be docked to the remaining ports.\n\nIt\u0027s important to not abuse the controls. Just as you don\u0027t burn the engines all the way to Jool, you don\u0027t want to actively rotate the ship all the time. When you\u0027re turning a large ship, you switch SAS off, start rotating the ship manually, and wait. Towards the end of the turn, you start slowing down manually, and try to stop the rotation as close to the correct heading as possible.

Trouble is, especially with physical timewarp running, little pertubations would get started in one section of the ship. The oscillations would be amplified by the docking port to the other piece. SAS tends to try to correct for this in a way that actually exacerbates the problem, making the ship oscillate even more wildly. Docking ports are treated like springs by the physics solver, so energy that never existed is being injected into the system, making it even worse. Mechjeb\u0027s autopilot is also more aggressive, making this problem worse - and in my playthrough, I consider it completely legit to use mechjeb to calculate a correct transfer trajectory and to execute planned burns.\n\nAnyways, I found that if I cut back the thrust and was willing to wait 2 hours or something to do a burn at 1x, sure, I could do an interplanetary burn. It was just not worth it to me to wait that long, I quit my campaign in the hopes that future patches would fix this.\n\nI feel the implementation of physics in this game is wrong. Pieces of ships should be tied together by rigid body transforms, and the game should only compute stress analytically and not attempt to apply it using springs using inaccurate integrations. At the force summing stage of each timestep, the game should compute all of the uncontrollable forces on a ship, check the ship\u0027s intent (basically there would be a number of possible flight modes that reflect what the ship is trying to do), and then cancel all unwanted forces using the ship\u0027s engines and control surfaces, limited of course by their maximum available torques and thrusts at this timestep. You simulate the fact that rocket engines can\u0027t increase in thrust instantly and control surfaces can\u0027t deflect instantly by making their maximums reflect the average availability over a delta T."},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T03:44:06Z","Content":"Check out the Milne, the craft I used for the Jool-5 Kethane challenge.
