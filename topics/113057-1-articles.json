You can see your rocket right in front of you and check for any mistakes you may have made but missed on your computer. You find something you don\u0027t like and decide to change it. Instead of having to go back to your computer, you can change it right there with Hololens. Hololens allows for manipulating your rocket in 3D. (Microsoft has demonstrated multiple times the benefits for engineers and designers) Then your ready for launch. But before liftoff, you want to check to make sure the planets are properly aligned. You could pull up the entire Kerbol System, in 3D, live, right in your living room. You find out that the planets are perfectly aligned. You liftoff, get into orbit and make the transfer maneuver. Fast forward to your Duna Rover on the surface. NASA actually has used the development version of Hololens to get a Panoramic 3D view of Mars here on earth, so you can Imagine you would be able to do the same thing only for Duna or any other body, right in your living room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I think this will radically change how people play KSP when Hololens is released and I hope Squad takes full advantage of this technology. I want to know what everyone thinks of this so please leave your opinion!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cino","CreatedById":145619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T20:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be another dimension in simulation!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T20:49:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHololens can\u0027t project black which to me is very important to playing KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gameslinx","CreatedById":144828,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T07:16:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWoo!
