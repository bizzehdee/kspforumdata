This will be a performance improvement release focused on reducing the run time of the script execution engine. I decided this was necessary Monday evening after discovering that trying to plan my trip to Eeloo was a royal pain in the neck with the optimizer taking so long to run. Not that I don\u0027t use KSP TOT regularly, but this mission was actually hard to execute because of the slow run times. I\u0027ve been working on it since and here\u0027s what I\u0027ve accomplished thus far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E10x decrease in run time on the Kepler solver.

(I\u0027ve also seen it do nothing, though, so it\u0027s very situation dependent.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last item on the TO DO list is what I\u0027m calling \u0022selective SoI search.\u0022 The idea here is that you may not want to consider every possible SoI transition while planning that mission to Eeloo. You may only want to consider Jool (for that flyby delta-v) and Eeloo, for example. In this case, you can eliminate all the calls to the SoI transition search code that would normally look for \u0022downwards\u0022 SoI transitions to other bodies. (A downward transition is one that takes your spacecraft \u0022down\u0022 the solar system hierarchy, so Sun -\u0026gt; Planet or Planet -\u0026gt; Moon.) Now, why does this help? The downwards SoI transition code accounts for about 50% of total mission script execution time due to the use of a bounded function optimizer that pinpoints the SoI transition time/place through the use of a \u0022distance to body\u0022 function. That function has been heavily optimized, which is why the whole thing only accounts for 50% of the run time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Therefore, in order to improve the situation, I need to try to eliminate calls to the function optimizer in general.
