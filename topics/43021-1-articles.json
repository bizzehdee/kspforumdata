It occured to me that it might be a good idea to attempt a launch directly into an interplanetary transfer orbit. I waited until the launch pad was pointing in the kerbin prograde direction, and the launch vertically and just keep going until I have reach escape velocity. Then I keep burning until the solar apoapsis / periapsis reaches the orbit of the planet I am aiming for. So there are a few critical factors:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Launch at the right time (for the interplanetary transfer window) Obviously this is always the case, but if you burn interplanetary from LKO you can time it down to the nearest orbin, but if you launch from the surface then it is the nearest kerbin day (6ish hours?) Does this matter much?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Launch at the right time in terms of getting your escape velocity directly along the kerbin prograde. Your resultant velocity when you leave the Kerbin SOI needs to be in the kerbin prograde. However when you launch you have about 200m/s perpendicular to the vertical launch velocity direction from the kerbin spin. Does this matter when you are trying to get up to 4000/5000m/s?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have a few questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Is anyone else doing this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Is there any point in doing this? I am hoping that is saves some DeltaV, but I am not sure if it really does. I suspect hat it is helpful because:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) I do not have to worry about raising my kerbin periapsis as I will never reach it (but you raise your periapsis by increasing your velocity and this is velocity can have its direction changed by gravity by simply orbiting to a certain point before the ejection burn, so perhaps the DeltaV is not wasted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E By not bothering with a gravity turn I an not trying to minimise drag lasses against gravity losses in the ascent - I simply go straight up which means I take the most direct route out of the atmosphere, which should minimise the potential for drag loses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Are there any tools to help? Navigation is hard. Is it possible to get the direction of the kerbin prograde on the nav-ball when you are in kerbin orbirt (or even on the kerbin atmosphere or surface?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T21:11:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour idea IS the best way to do an interplanetary transfer, for the reasons you expect. Also, you don\u0027t have to waste fuel flying sideways to get into Kerbin orbit when you\u0027re just going to leave it again anyway. That\u0027s a lot of delta V you really don\u0027t need to spend. Kerbin Escape is a certain velocity at each altitude and every ounce of fuel you spend NOT increasing the speed portion of that vector is wasted fuel.

Likewise the 200 or so m/s from being on the surface isn\u0027t enough (for me, at least) to worry about. The further you are from perfect, the further you have to correct but I always end up with more fuel than need anyway so don\u0027t worry about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way in Stock to get the correct aim on the nav ball is to make a maneuver node. Note: You don\u0027t have to set up the correct maneuver node, just set one up with a maneuver aimed in the right direction. You can do this by setting the node, then zooming out enough to see the setup of the solar system. Then click the already-created maneuver node and you can edit it You can also drag it around the orbit path to get the direction nodes to line up right. With any luck, you can aim ONE of them in the direction you want to go. Then aim your ship in that direction and fire the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T22:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E... you don\u0027t have to waste fuel flying sideways to get into Kerbin orbit when you\u0027re just going to leave it again anyway.

Scott Manley did a video on it. Basically, going straight up maximizes gravity losses, which are not insignificant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it this way. If you have a rocket with a WTR of 2.0 and thrust straight up, the first 1.0 of your TWR goes to cancelling out gravity. On the other hand, should you thrust at the correct angle, you\u0027ll split the thrust into 1.0 vertical thrust and 1.732 horizontal thrust. The 1.0 vertical cancels out gravity, leaving you with a TWR of 1.732 accelerating the craft, or 73% more than you\u0027d have going straight up. As you build up horizontal velocity, a portion of that horizontal velocity starts cancelling out part of gravity, allowing you to use more of your TWR for acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, you still have to take aerodynamic losses into effect, which is why traditionally KSP players have started their gravity turn at 10km height. At that point, they\u0027re past the thickest of the atmosphere, so it\u0027s time to start worrying more about gravity losses than aerodynamic losses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T00:12:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 12:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Eric S\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T00:37:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo do so directly, you would need to launch when the target planet offers the best opportunity for efficient capture.

Otherwise, orbit as circular as possible, set up a Mun escape slingshot prograde to Kerban\u0027s orbit for the outer planets, retrograde for the inner ones, You will have to wait for Mun to present itself in the correct position when you enter its SOI, try to get the escape orbit around the sun as circular as possible without using extra fuel to do so, and set up the transfer maneuver to get a retrograde capture.

That will create an elliptical orbit that extends to the outer planets. An escape burn on the noon side of Kerban will be retrograde to Kerban\u0027s orbit around the sun. That will create an elliptical orbit that dips closer to the sun. Those can be most efficient providing you leave Kerban when an intercept window to th target planet presents itself.
