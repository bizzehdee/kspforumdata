Is it low and wide? That helps prevent tipping. Also, which planet are you talking about?

On touchdown watch the navball and steer to counter any tipping tendency. Use cut throttle on touchdown to make your landing positive and more stable.

Once I am below 20,000m I try to keep my marker on the retrograde for slowing down, which usually leads to being vertical with no sideways movement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T08:03:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs others have said, sounds like either a design problem, or a problem with killing horizontal velocity. But you\u0027re not crashing, so probably just something that will come with practice. Or a revision of your lander design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T13:45:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThree possibilities are, as others have said 1) your lander needs to be shorter with a wider base, 2) you need to kill your horizontal velocity, and 3) you need to pick an area with a shallower grade (preferably someplace flat); you can land on hills, but it\u0027s tricky and if your center of balance is high, you\u0027ll be more likely to tip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do tip over, you can right your capsule again with RCS thrust if you have enough of it available; had to do that myself with my first three \u0022successful\u0022 Mun landings...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that\u0027s helpful when it comes to landing if you\u0027ve got a manned pod is to go IVA occasionally during your descent to check the radar altimeter. When it starts moving you can gauge how much further you\u0027ve got until you\u0027re at the surface.

This will bring the retrograde marker closer to center. The goal is to have it centered on the dot when touching down. Looking at the ground helps, but it\u0027s harder to control your lander visually, than using the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kevo","CreatedById":67975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T02:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethx for the replys guys like uve all mentioned i think my landing stage is to tall ill fix that and see if its any better . plus what you all say about the retrograde marker ive got to admit as i got closer to the ground i was having trouble staying on it so ill hve to work at that to . thx for the replys \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
