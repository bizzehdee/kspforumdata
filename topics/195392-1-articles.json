I fully understand that back in the day \u0026lt;before we needed fairings\u0026gt; it was a design choice to not enable the code \u0026lt;which from what I remember hearing is similar in scope to the smoke plumes, so double confused to be honest\u0026gt; was a performance based one.

It essentially goes: Launch a Ship \u0026gt; Get to Space \u0026gt; Get to Orbit \u0026gt; Do stuff around / on celestial bodies.\u00A0The latter of which repeats ad nauseam across the Kerbol system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI appreciate that career mode is more of a way of limiting funds and science, as opposed to a \u0027story\u0027 mode - but a\u00A0better synergy between contracts, technology and progression would be welcome in the stock game.

And for some reason the Propulsion Systems node has the Status-V Minified Monopropellant Tank in it (the one with 7.5 monoprop fuel) which TBH should be in the Advanced Flight Control node with the other \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank. And Propulsion Systems also has the Baguette external fuel tank, but the smaller Dumpling external fuel tank isn\u0027t found until a full tier later in the Precision Propulsion node. \u003Cem\u003ENone of this makes any sense!!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
