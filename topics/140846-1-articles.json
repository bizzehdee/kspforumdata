I press z and x to see if that will do the trick but the little pointer on the gauge did not go up or down. I also press shift and alt to hopefully fix the problem but end with the same result. Next I press r and t to turn on RCS and SAS but neither of the buttons light up. I then try to manually click the buttons on the screen but nothing happens. Do note that my ship is still floating through space and passing the point were I should normally be preparing to land on the moon. I decide that there is nothing I can to and return to the launch and try again. I am then distracted by matters in the real world and is afk for a few minutes. I return to find that my controls still work and begin to head back over to the moon. As I am leaving the atmosphere however, my controls once again lock up. The next time, I build another ship but I am still greeted by the same fate. I have mods installed and I am using a mac but these problems have only just started today and I have had the game and mods for weeks now without any trouble until now. Any suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T01:44:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA mod could be interfering\u00A0with the input control locks.
