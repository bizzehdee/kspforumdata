For instance, if the vessel is facing compass 90 pitch 0 with roll 90, and it targets compass 90 pitch 45, it will start by full yaw left, full roll left, and full pitch up. This causes it to get into a corkscrew type motion around the target. Depending on the vessel\u0027s mass distribution in w/h versus forward/back, it can be minor, annoying but hit the target eventually, or divergent shooting off into an uncontrolled spin. On some short and very wide vessels, mechjeb simply cannot be used; anytime it tries to turn to a marker, it spins out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen attempting to face a target, why does it roll at all?

I believe the rendezvous is ment more so with meeting with an object that is already in orbit and not for getting to planets though I am not 100% sure on that. Any advice? My next issue is with career mode. I have unlocked mech jeb2 in the tech tree and successfully used it 3 times.
