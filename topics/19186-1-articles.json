Specifically, build a bridge over any one of the many valleys on the Mun. This seems like a pretty challenging task in and of itself, so any and all mods are permitted. One or many launches, whatever it takes. The only actual requirement is that the bridge be traversable by a lone Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working on a craft to attempt this challenge myself, and I look forward to seeing everyone else\u0027s successes (and failures!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/2j9Bl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2j9Bl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222j9Bl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the most prominent valleys are on the rims of large craters.
