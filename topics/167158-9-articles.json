The main means of quantum communication (there are other ways to do it) consists in sending messages encrypted traditionally, decypherable using a traditional key that is passed through quantum means.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically, instead of sending the key \u0022classically\u0022 to your Bob, you use superimposed (or entangled) quantum states to transmit\u00A0it. If someone is eavesdropping (Eve), it \u003Cem\u003Ewill \u003C/em\u003Ecause the states to collapse to a single state, and depending on the value of the state Eve measures it \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E change the value received by Bob.\u00A0Because a part of it is random, Bob can freely communicate to you the values he measured (because Eve doesn\u0027t know what you measured, so she doesn\u0027t know if her measurements are identical to yours), and when comparing with\u00A0what you measured you can tell with certitude if someone is eavesdropping. If not, send your message; if yes, you know that someone is spying on you but you haven\u0027t sent any critical information so it\u0027s not that bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow this doesn\u0027t prevent someone from intercepting your message, and try to crack it the old-fashioned way, but it is a lot easier (and quicker) to try to intercept the key than to decypher the message on your side using your classical algorithms. Another part of quantum communication is creating keys using quantum algorithms which would be virtually impossible for a classical computer to crack. Because people are anticipating that cracking keys will become much quicker with quantum computers, so that\u00A0classical keys will not be secure once your enemy has access to quantum computers, it creates the need for quantum encryption that would take a quantum computer a long amount of time to crack. This field is called post-quantum cryptography.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to your question, quantum communication has nothing to do with sending undetectable messages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223221770\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167158\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221510952580\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180784\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DAL59\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, DAL59 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould a sufficiently powerful [something] do [something]?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually, the answer is yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-18T02:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223218168\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167158\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221510566048\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174016\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zeiss Ikon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/13/2017 at 4:40 AM, Zeiss Ikon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust when you thought black holes couldn\u0027t get any weirder...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeem to recall some physicist or another who thinks that black holes \u0022are\u0022 the other Universes in the multiverse or something like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nADDIT: Okay I\u0027ve got one that might flop given there are so few biological science types among you, but here goes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat would happen if human beings cells did not senesce past their prime age?

One interesting thing, the evolutionary biologist are fairly convinced that all of these processes are not merely a reflection of phylogenetic constraint or other inherent limits, but rather are (mostly) all specifically shaped by natural selection. Meaning: the processes by which each tissue type senesce are tuned to the range of life history parameters for the species.

Gravity curves the trajectory, and it ends up looking like a conic section. This allows us to describe an orbit\u0027s shape with eccentricity. An eccentricity of zero is a circle, an eccentricity between 0 and 1 is an ellipse, an eccentricity of 1 is a parabola, and an eccentricity greater than 1 is a hyperbola.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, rather, we can use Newton\u0027s laws.

Examples include particle accelerators, laser generators, ion engines, ect. They run below room temperature, down to 100K or less when superconductors are involved. And yet, kilowatts to megawatts of waste heat are generated by their operation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDealing with that waste heat passively means using a set of radiators at even cooler temperatures. Due to the low radiation per square meter, the radiators would have to be massive. Not something a spacecraft can afford!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn ideal option would be increase the radiator\u0027s operating temperature. For this to happen, you need heat pumps to move cool heat up a temperature gradient - you need heat pumps.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is, current heat pumps have poor efficiency and horrendous power density. The mass you save on radiators, you\u0027ll lose it with the pumps!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBrayton-cycle turbines can combine high power density and high efficiency. If they can be run in reverse as heat pumps, then you can solve some of the problems involved with running high-energy cold systems in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a 1MW example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn VASIMR engine needs to be kept at 273K temperature for its magnets to operate at peak efficiency. It is 60% efficient and has a power density of 1kW/kg. To handle 1MW, it needs to mass 1 ton.\u00A0This engine produces 400kW of waste heat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA passive heating solution would be use radiators that run at 273K. The Stefan-Boltzman equation says that even very black radiators (emissivity 0.9) would emit only 283W/m^2. You\u0027d need an area of at least 1413m^2. Even if\u00A0the radiators are radiators are relatively lightweight and double-sided, you\u0027d need to dedicate 3.5 to 7 tons just for radiators.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s introduce an existing heat pump. A stirling-cycle heat pump has an efficiency of up to 35% and a power density of 0.1kW/kg. We will use it to increase the temperature to 600K, so its thermal performance will be 83%. Combined with the pump\u0027s own efficiency, you need 3.4W of input to move heat up that temperature gradient. It would allows for the radiators to be 23.3 times smaller and mass only 150 to 300kg. However, to handle all of the waste heat, you need heat pumps that consume 1360kW of power and mass 13.6 tons! Not only are you losing all the gains from the smaller radiator, but you are also more than doubling your energy budget!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow does it go differently if we used a heat pump based on the Brayton cycle and\u00A0built like a modern turbine?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt could be up to 80% efficient and have a power density of 10kW/kg. It only needs 1.5W of input per 1W of heat moved, and it will mass only 60kg. Quite a difference!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is the solution that this \u0027reverse ramjet\u0027 is for.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-21T10:25:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223224312\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167158\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221511224117\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133334\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MatterBeam\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, MatterBeam said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow does it go differently if we used a heat pump based on the Brayton cycle and\u00A0built like a modern turbine?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could be up to 80% efficient and have a power density of 10kW/kg.
