Its an engine that is optimized for high altitude and spaceflight, not low altitude flight in the thick atmosphere. Even its airbreathing mode is optimized for very low atmospheric pressures.

So many engines are needed, whiplashes are far better (or panthers). You basically don\u0027t need rapiers for airbreathing mode either (they are heavy with low static thrust for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E portion, and whiplashes will get you very high and fast, adding a few rapiers won\u0027t get you much higher or faster in the small time they\u0027d operate before cutout if you only have a few of them), that it seems to be better to use an engine with better vacuum Isp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know... it seems simultaneously that the closed cycle mode is \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

Rald has a thin atmosphere (around 0.2 Atms), and relatively high gravity (just above 0.5). As jet thrust decreases with air pressure (or is it density? the graphs here show air pressure, but I\u0027m pretty sure its density in the files \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Jet_engine\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Jet_engine\u003C/a\u003E), and this decrease isn\u0027t the same for all the jets, the panthers are no longer the go-to engine.... producing less than 40% of the static thrust at 0.2 atms as they do on at 1 atm. Its worse at high altitudes on Rald, such as the Karsis plateau, or if I want to land on the top of the volcano corresponding to Olympus Mons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA turboramjet still produces over 50% of its normal static thrust at 0.2 atms, and is useful for reaching orbit. Thus it still gets around 7:1 static \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E on Rald... at tleast around the lowlands. The Rapier does even better than the Whiplash at lower atmospheric pressure (but the whiplash still does better in the 0.08-0.2 atm range). Still, jet \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E was lower than on Kerbin, and making a jet \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E was going to use a lot of engines. Meawhile, the low atmospheric pressure helps rocket engines, and the low gravity means that the rapier closed cycle gets a respectable 18:1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E on Rald. I thought maybe I could pakc on a few hundred extra \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E in closed cycle mode, and take off and land in closed cycle mode. Then I figured if I was packing so much closed cycle \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, and doing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E in closed cycle, maybe it would also work on 3x Duna (with some other tweaks) which I have orbit Rald. I could have a single craft for Rald-Duna-Ike, using just Rapiers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA problem on Rald was the transition from closed cycle to airbreathing, as the airbreathing mode needed time to spool up after the switch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was using 4 rotating engine pods of 2 rapiers each, so 8 rapiers, but then I figured... I don\u0027t really need 8 rapiers for horizontal airbreathing flight. The big limitation was \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E flight \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. I could ditch half the rapiers for aerospikes (same thrust as aerospike closed cycle), and save 4 tons, while gaining a lot of Isp. It would also enable me to maximize the last bit or airbreathing thrust by keeping the rapiers in airbreathing mode as I light the arospikes for orbital insertion. Rapier closed cycle would only be supplemental for vertical liftoff and landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I figured another option was a single vector on each side instead of 2 aerospikes: Far better lifting power, better thrust vectoring control in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E mode, and the rapier closed cycle mode was not needed at all. I could switch the rapiers for whiplashes, and I could have airbreathing supplementary thrust even in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E mode. This system would weigh less than the pure rapier model (0.8 tons save by switching 4 rapiers to 4 whiplashes), and have far more closed cycle thrust (enabling lifting more fuel by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E mode). The 2 vectors would supply 2000 kN compared to the 1,440 kN of 8 rapiers. On Rald (but not Duna, but Duna\u0027s gravity is lower), the 4 whiplashes would add about 200 kN.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027d have 2200 kN for vertical thrust vs 1440 kN (can lift 52% more mass vertically). I\u0027d have 315 vacuum Isp vs 305, I\u0027d have better thrust vector control, fewer parts, and 0.8 tons less mass. The cost would be a weaker airbreathing mode with a lower top speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aerospike variant would have the same vertical thrust, 340 Isp vs 305, and a significant 4 tons less mass, for a weaker air-breathing mode with a bit lower top speed (same engine limit, just less engines)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-17T08:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a spaceplane reaching low Kerbin orbit the rocket delta-V requirement is quite modest, about 1000 m/s I think.

Many times the weight savings are much less than what they may initially seem because you need to pack on more rapiers for the low altitude airbreathing part than other engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso when switching to closed cycle, its often done well before airbreathing thrust has completely disappeared.... so the result is stopping a 50 kN airbreathing engine and starting a 180kN closed cycle engine... only a 130kN increase in thrust. Adding vectors for the closed cycle thrust allows you to run the rapiers (or whiplashes, or a combination) until flameout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn stock, I find the drag not to be too bad (especially since by the time one is going fast, the climb rate is often quite high as apopasis starts increasing, and the air thins out pretty fast). When I play 3x and orbital velocity is over 4 km/sec, drag is much more important, but so is Isp and the tyranny of the rocket equation really hurts with the low Rapier Isp. I did a challenge of sorts once, and basically the way to increase payload fraction was to pack on as many LV-Ns and as much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E as the rapiers could carry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dunno, I think it should be the premier solution for a winged airbreathing spaceplane, but more often than not, the closed cycle mode is left behind and another engine is added.
