So games where you usually have multiple part-sets will have a large benefit, but in KSP it mostly means that docking to a space station won\u0027t be as much of a slideshow because the craft and the space station can have their physics handled in two separate threads. There\u0027s a 5-15% performance boost from optimizations between physx 2.X and 3.X, but the real wins in performance improvements of U5 probably won\u0027t apply to KSP as much as some people hope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, even the occasional use case that can justify this makes it worth doing in my opinion, just not prioritizing it like it\u0027s the only thing that matters.
