The in-situ verification of the presence of a breathable atmosphere in Laythe, coupled with the long experience of the program sending orbital laboratories missions and descent Gilly, Duna and Ike that had been developed in parallel by the pupil of Henry, Andrea. Now, after all this time, it has released the latest resupply mission to the second laboratory using Recover 1 spacecraft.\n\nFor this mission have not been reused old laboratories, Ike Lab and Eve Lab, which are in a very eccentric and out of fuel orbit of kerbin Kerbin, we have launched new laboratories, designed to maximize the scientific return Mission giving them the ability to land on airless bodies of Jool system.\n\nShips for the mission:\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Joolian Labs: Two new modern laboratories with nuclear propulsion designed specifically for this mission. Delta-v possess sufficient for transfer to Jool, braking on the system, transfer to another system and landing body.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Joolian fuel processors: Two twin spacecraft designed to land on the surface of one of the satellites and begin generating fuel. They will trnasportados by BUS 2.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 BUS 2: Automated transport ship equipped with the new experimental nuclear engine 1500 seconds. 7800 meters per second in LKO with two coupled processors.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Prometheus Requiem: An experimental ship 9.6 kilometers per second Delta-V. Up to 4 passengers.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Laythe Lander: A modification of the Duna Lander designed for high radiation environment Laythe. It will be carried by the BUS 1.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 BUS 1: A former nuclear transport designed to carry and return the lander Gilly. 4500 meters per second of delta-v. It will be used to boost Laythe Lander.\n\nAnd so Henry plans take shape."},{"CreatedByName":"stellarator","CreatedById":92423,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:37:15Z","Content":"The old labs:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0dDM2VE9jZG9DZHM\u0026authuser=0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0dDM2VE9jZG9DZHM\u0026authuser=0)\n\nLaunch of the BUS 1:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0cFA2Qy03aThfNGs\u0026authuser=0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0cFA2Qy03aThfNGs\u0026authuser=0)\n\nLaunch of BUS 2:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0dTE3Tk9FSXJrdlU\u0026authuser=0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0dTE3Tk9FSXJrdlU\u0026authuser=0)\n\nJSM aproaching Jool:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0VDY1RnJOb05rU3M\u0026authuser=0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0VDY1RnJOb05rU3M\u0026authuser=0)\n\nJSM splashed down:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0MlpIU2NodE5CRFU\u0026authuser=0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0MlpIU2NodE5CRFU\u0026authuser=0)\n\nBUS 2 with fuel processors on Kerbin Orbit:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0eHMzZEpvQ0NlQmc\u0026authuser=0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0eHMzZEpvQ0NlQmc\u0026authuser=0)\n\nBUS 1 refuelled and waiting for Laythe lander:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0T3ZtYmdia0Z1WEk\u0026authuser=0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0T3ZtYmdia0Z1WEk\u0026authuser=0)\n\nJoolian Lab 1 docked to its second sdtage waiting to departure window:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0U2FCdUtBellPSW8\u0026authuser=0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0U2FCdUtBellPSW8\u0026authuser=0)\n\nPrometheus R\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9quiem waiting to trasnfer burn:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0QnBQSzhja0J4X2M\u0026authuser=0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz5__uS_MPu0QnBQSzhja0J4X2M\u0026authuser=0)\n\nSorry nfor links, im not able to put google drive images as bb code."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:41:14Z","Content":"Nice-looking stuff.

At 14 kilometers high, expelled Gerbus from command module and ordered him to use all its fuel to try to stabilize its orbit, unfortunately, it didn\u0027t work and both crashed into the surface of Mun. \n\nOn the last minute, few seconds before crashing, Gerbus sent his last message to his mothership, that we recovered from the black box by the second processor mission. The message was \u0022I love you\u0022. Now, on their crashing site, a flag stills remembering future kerbonauts the importance of love... And check your engines.\n\nAboard the ships that will head to Jool, are 10 of our most courageous kerbonauts.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Jendi Kerman: Woman, pilot, level 3; famous for being the first kerbal to set foot Duna aboard the Spirit Duna Lander, his feat has not been repeated.
