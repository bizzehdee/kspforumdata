Since you can\u0027t scroll the camera view, only rotate it, it makes it so parts with a lot of info on them have their window go off screen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve recently started used several new mods and I\u0027m having the problem that several parts have so much info on their window that I can\u0027t see the full window including the current inventory or various functional buttons because they are off screen. This is very frustrating and I was wondering if there was a way to solve this? Or perhaps a mod this gets around this rather poor UI design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-28T07:49:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2014 07:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Spyre2000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T05:56:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClick with the scroll wheel.
