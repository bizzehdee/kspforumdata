I have been researching the topic of Ramrockets, and I had an idea for something resembling a cross between a NASA style RBCC as described here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19970017381.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19970017381.pdf\u003C/a\u003E and a more mundane ducted rocket. From what I have been able to research about ram jet physics, the greatest concern at supersonic velocities is the variable geometries of the diffuser assembly required to achieve a subsonic fuel air mixture. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis got me thinking about whether the boundary layer generated by traditional rocket exhaust inside of a ducted nozzle could be varied, by changing thrust, to create ideal conditions for additional combustion. If additional fuel injectors could be added to the duct assembly, could additional fuel be burnt at higher efficiency, being mixed with the incoming air? In the NASA case study, and related designs I have seen, the rocket motor has always been positioned in the aft section of the combustion chamber, where the flame trap is usually located, and variable intake geometry, via active motorized means, has been used. By relieving mechanical actuators and flaps from the responsibility of changing the geometry, could significant weight and complexity be saved? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been working up to putting some small scale hybrid rocket motors into practice, and understand most of the principles involved, but the fluid dynamics required to actually design a ramjet shroud, are a little beyond me at the moment. I would love to eventually upgrade a motor to incorporate such a system, but then again, I do not have a supersonic wind tunnel to test it.

A traditional rocket bell would function much better for this application, as altitude increases, the exhaust plume tends to expand a predictable rate. What I think that I am not communicating properly, is that with a properly shaped engine bell, the supersonic boundary between the surface of the exhaust plume, and the incoming air is of a sufficient pressure that the plume is essentially a solid mass in comparison. Air compressed in this manner does not actually mix wit the exhaust plume until it is clear of the shroud, so it\u0027s no really an afterburner, which injects fuel directly into an exhaust plume. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the design goal should be geometry that allows us to treat to rocket component and the ramjet component as two SEPARATE systems. Our shroud length should be less than the distance of the coherence of the exhausts supersonic boundary layer. This will ensure that the exhaust does NOT MIX until it is clear of the engine. For the following example, imagine a system where you have a conventional rocket, with several variable geometry ram jets around its axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us take a design that call for a final thrust of T(f). The rocket portion should be designed to produce up to .75 * T(f), the subsonic ramjet configuration shall be designed to reach at minimum .5 T(f), and in supersonic configuration, at minimum, .25 * T(f). The rocket shall be throttled at liftoff to maximum power, and remain there until enough velocity is achieved to ignite the subsonic ram jet configuration. The main engine is throttled such that it is producing equal thrust to the ramjet(s). Thus during this phase, the Isp of the system can be given by using the ratio of thrust that each engine is contributing to the system, to find the weighted average. So for our example, a rocket with several radial ram jets, we can take an average ram jet Isp of 2000s, and average that with a typical rocket Isp of 250s, for a total system Isp of 1125s during subsonic flight. When the rocket achieves supersonic flight, the ram jet geometry is changed such that the engine can operate at those speeds. Because this requires changing the ratio of inlet area, to diffuser area from greater than 1, to less than one, this generally causes the specific impulse of the supersonic mode to be lower in a variable geometry design. However, at this point the Isp of the rocket has usually increased. So when we take, for example, a slice of the Isp average at high altitude and speed, the ram jet would be operating at say, 1500s and the rocket at 300s. However, in our example, the trust ratio has changed in favor of the rocket. So recalculating, weighting the average by proportion of contributed thrust, we still arrive at an Isp of 600s for supersonic operation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut we don\u0027t simply have to strap variable geometry ram jets to a rocket to gain this kind of efficiency. What I think you fail to understand, is that air passing near a stream of supersonic exhaust gas on the same vector can not enter the stream. It might as well be a solid. It will eventually lose pressure and velocity and allow air to mix, however this does not occur close to the engine. Thus if we design a shroud that is less than the distance before the air starts mixing with the exhaust, we essentially have a variable size SOLID at our disposal. This is why the ram jet component and the rocket component can be treated just like our previous example of literally having to different kinds of engines on the same vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee the following diagram below, keeping this in mind. Also keep in mind that as altitude increases, the exhaust from any given engine bell geometry tends to increase in diameter. We use this effect to allow for a change in intake area, to combustion area, inside the ram jet shroud. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lIHxtyo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lIHxtyo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T19:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edon\u0027t forget you\u0027ll need at one point (if you\u0027re going with liquid fuels) to drive your turbopumps (for both cooling and engine feeding). the current way to drive turbopumps remains using a gas generator \u002B turbine, which will eat some of your ISP / and add a bit of weight to your system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T21:01:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh...
