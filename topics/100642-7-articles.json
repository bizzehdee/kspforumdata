The current system doesn\u0027t support them completely at the moment, but it doesn\u0027t preclude them either. They\u0027re just not accounted for yet, and we\u0027re probably going to have to do some playtesting to figure out how (and if) the fairings would work in between two chunks of spacecraft. We might be able to adapt the current module to do both, or we might require a separate module to handle those cases. The short answer is, we\u0027re not quite there yet. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E Cheers\n\nIf they are on the radar and planned then that\u0027s good. As long as they can do the same as the interstage fairings on the Saturn V then they can do pretty much anything anyone could want from an interstage.\n\nOne small question. Will we be able to surface attach items to fairings? Things like seperatrons, batteries, lights, radial engines and so forth?\n\nEDIT :\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Wait, atmospheric conditions or re-entry heat won\u0027t affect construction?

A couple of days ago I was trying to make a replica of the Boeing X37b and since it has some difficult shapes to recreate on the fuselage, I remembered [the craft Majorjim made back in the day](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101748-Boeing-X-37b-and-Atlas-V-replica). He did the main structure (image below) and then covered it up with solar panels.![I5XUdtg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/I5XUdtg.jpg) Though the shape was ok, the part count was still elevated (and thus the framerate dropped) so as soon as I read this week\u0027s devnotes I came up with an idea: what if, just like this new stock procedural fairings, the devs come up with a solution that let you make procedural fuselages that would count as a single part just like these? As far as I know no mod has attempted this before and could be a game changer.

It will retain the shape. This can allow for (effectively) procedural surface panels. It\u0027s not entirely robust, however, and in some cases the fairings can reset.

Procedural parts means less lego, connected to other lego, connected to more mechano, connected to some engines. The reduction in part count can have anything from a positive, to dramatic influence on performance. I don\u0027t believe KSP is in danger of losing the building block mechanic, though.
