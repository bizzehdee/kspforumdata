For example, let\u0027s say I have a crew capsule and I it\u0027s sitting on the launch pad. You\u0027d expect everything inside to be pressed to the bottom of the cylinder as you see now. What if I turn it on its side? Wouldn\u0027t it be funny if the Kerbals strapped into their seats had their massive kerbal heads tilted down the gravitational incline? Now, what if I launch it into space? It\u0027d be cool to have things floating around, and maybe the Kerbals are jiggling around in their seats as they move (indicating that the straps are the only things holding them down). Finally, what if I attach that module to the edge of an AG ring and spin it? It\u0027d be nice if it looked on the inside like the module was sitting down back on Kerbin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure the implementation of this would be trickier than I am making it sound, but stuff like that is what will really sell the fact that you\u0027re in space. It\u0027d also make the player more cognizant of how they are orienting these modules in the VAB, since now you can visibly tell the difference between placing a lander can upside down or not from the inside of the pod. You would clearly be able to see the discomfort in your Kerbals, but it would not prevent them from doing it anyway, if they were so cruelly inclined. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T19:24:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 07:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tntristan12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T19:26:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be interesting to find out how applicable Unity physics are to the IVAs.

Obviously a real life astronaut would be able to keep his cool during a space mission, yet most of the time Kerbals are seen screaming their little lungs out because the ride is just too scary for them. Another example: A while back NovaSilisko alluded to the fact that you\u0027d be able to take the helmets off of Kerbals anywhere in the solar system, including on airless worlds. Would a real life astronaut do that? I\u0027d certainly hope not, but you have to admit that the mental image of a Kerbal holding his breath on the Mun is pretty freaking hilarious.
