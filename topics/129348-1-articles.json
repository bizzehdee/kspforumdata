Would that validate the construction of a 2nd SLS pad north of LC-39B (LC-39C) designed in the same way as LC-39B, similar to how a pad explosion at LC-36A prompted NASA to complete LC-36B. Giving SLS a backup pad has been proposed for LC-39A (before it was leased out to SpaceX), and since SLS uses a clean pad infrastructure, NASA could lease it out to ULA for Atlas V/Vulcan\u0027s second/backup pad (as was proposed for both LC-39B and A).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T22:34:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center_Launch_Complex_39#Launch_Pad_39C\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThere\u0027s already a 39C?\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T22:40:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s already an\u00A0LC-39C .
