The ovum is very well evolved to prevent this. *IF* it did happen, then having 3 copies of every chromosome would either cause the embryo to self-abort immediately, or would lead to rampant, massive failure to develop properly and a very quick death, long before the pregnancy was detectable. There are several conditions where a chromosome is doubled up so instead of a pair, there are three, and they generally have serious effects on the individual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething sort of similar to double-sperm-fertilisation has been observed in IVF labs and in nature where the unfertilised ovum managed to divide before fertilisation, creating two \u0022clone\u0022 ova, each of which was then fertilised by a sperm. The two cell lines may separate and develop two individuals - twins - or the cells may mix together and create a single, hybrid individual. When the two cell lines have contradictory gender chromosomes (ie, one is XX and one XY) then the foetus has a very significant chance of going on to develop ambiguous genitalia - a hermaphrodite.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T22:59:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems that such cases occurs, but the embryo is generally not viable.

All it really means is that zygote was made up of cells with different genetic makeup at some point. It\u0027s quite common in some animals. Very rare in humans. You can end up with entire organs or particular tissues having different genotype than the rest of the organism, of course. But you can also end up with cells fairly thoroughly mixed. Something similar happens to mammal females, where only one of the two X chromosomes is actually necessary. The other one goes dormant, making up the Barr body in the nucleus. Selection of which X chromosome goes dormant happens early on at random and persists through further divisions. As a result, mammal females are chimera-like on any X-linked gene. A great example of that are calico cats. The color of their fur, black or brown, is set on the X chromosome. So a female with two different color genes on two different X chromosomes ends up having patches of black and brown fur. This reflects the fact that it\u0027s not different organs, bur rather different areas of the cat\u0027s skin that has differences in genetic expression. Chimera cats have similar fur patterns sometimes, but can be of either gender, naturally.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T23:35:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sgt_flyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sgt_flyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt seems that such cases occurs, but the embryo is generally not viable.
