I like the approach of not having the converter harvesting ore itself, and instead use vehicles (trucks, rover, vtols) with ore radar to find the best spots to excavate and then bring it back to the converter. \n\nFeels more plausible and realistic, somewhat. lol \n\nHowever part count is a pain in the butt with these type of multi ship base. \n\nGlad to hear that, and me too"}]}
