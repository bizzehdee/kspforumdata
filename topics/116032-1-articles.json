I can no longer hire kerbals. I have it upgraded to tier 3 but when I click the green check to hire a kerbal nothing happens. It also says that the next kerbal will cost 0 kerbal cash. I can still get new kerbals through missions but that is very tedious. Can anyone point me in the right direction?\n\nP.S. I have no idea what I am doing when it comes to editing save files or configs or anything of the sort.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T02:13:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 02:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T05:13:10Z","Content":"I don\u0027t recall hearing of this problem lately.

The kerbal looks like it was part of a rescue at some point, but now the information is orphaned in your save.\n\nOpen up your save file with a plain text editor, such as notepad.
