In such a situation, if the future version of Deadly Reentry is installed, will the refinery be even more heat congested because the skin as an additional \u0022layer\u0022 slows down the heat exchange of the craft with its surroundings?

Ok I can understand it for when you burn an engine for longer than it is designed to, but a NTR with its low TWR is, or should have been, designed for really long burn times. And I don\u0027t think it should transfer heat up the stack at all, any contact points could be cryogenically cooled by the fuel flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEh? It\u0027s not dead, it\u0027s still amazing and will be more so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, NTRs like the NERVA are cooled passively by transferring heat to the fuel, and they work properly because the core is hotter than the surroundings and the cooler is dumped to generate thrust\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll engines tend to have overheating limits, they are usually tailored to the mission profile and you can reach a steady state in which the heat sorce (the core) and the sink (the fuel flow and the radiation from the nozzle) are in equilibrium. This is not possible to emulate with KSP current system, since a part can have only one temperature and all those pieces are one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two solutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eletting the engine produce heat and give the player dissipators as a separate part, while maybe adding an inline heat breaker with low conductivity that shields upper part of the stack\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Esplitting the core and the engine nozzle into two parts to model them properly, but this causes problems on how to make the module engine work and will take an intermediate dummy resource, as I am pretty sure that engines can\u0027t run on LF\u002Bheat\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: disregard the above, actually radiation in stock is indeed proportional to the temperature, so by tweaking the heat conductivity and radiationconstant in the engine .cfg is it possible to make an engine that reaches a steady state at a temperature inside its max range\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T12:30:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMade some tests\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:04:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStarwaster, I slapped together something that works with the stock heating last night and released it, but I am not sure about a couple of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoLOffset and CoPOffset.
