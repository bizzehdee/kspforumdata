First off they aren\u0027t terrible but they definitely need to be tweaked and I think you already addressed that. I came in too steep on approach and I flared too much and the orbiter when straight up stall and then fell back down backwards and then went tail to the sky. The best way to describe the current aerodynamics would be feather. The shuttle basically floats when it gets too slow. However if you line up for a proper approach and you don\u0027t lose too much speed it is an excellent glider and flys pretty well. Still it def needs to be fixed."}]}
