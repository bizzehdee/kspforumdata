Second, where are those screenshots made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess i could use the print key and copy the screen content on an image file, but it\u0027s clunky. i made thousands of screenshots, i\u0027d rather have something more comfortable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, can someone explain me how to enable screenshots again from my copy game? thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-19T18:53:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould be F1 for the default screenshot key (and F2 to hide the UI).\u00A0 There is no sound or notification for the in-game screenshots (vs the Steam screenshots).\u00A0 The screenshots should be saved to the screenshot folder in the KSP directory of the copy you are playing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-19T18:57:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2021 06:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Cavscout74\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-31T13:43:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are using Microsoft OneDrive, it also has its own screen shot utility that uses the \u0026lt;PrintScreen\u0026gt; button on your keyboard.
