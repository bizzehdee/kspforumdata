The war has dragged on for over 6 years, and the United Kerbs of Kerica are making a weapon to force the Kerdonians into an unconditional surrender. The project is Project Kahnhatten, and the main goal is to create a bomb capable of decimating space centers with one hit. The code name for the bomb is the K-Bomb, and the Kerdonians don\u0027t understand it. The bomb is activated with fission where atoms get ripped apart and create huge energy. The scientists estimate just the shock wave will decimate a KSC and hopefully Kerdonia into surrendering. This is only a prototype and is still being tested and manufactured as of now. Here is a top-secret picture from[the government!\\[arrow-10x10.png\\](http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/#59272905).\n\n![KslQxGo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KslQxGo.jpg)\n\nWe are working on a full on bomb with a proper uranium bullet to set it off. This project is top-secret and must not be shared with any other country. Any revealing of the bomb is a capital punishment and you will be stranded in space. This is a WIP, so[expect!\\[arrow-10x10.png\\](http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/#86526397) more variants in the passing days if this thread is kept alive, and I have the motivation to improve upon them. \n\nAhh, the bomb itself, use it as you wish, modify it, and the such with this here link.\n\n [https://www.dropbox.com/s/jt5kgvr3etoqg8d/Project%20Kahnhatten.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jt5kgvr3etoqg8d/Project%20Kahnhatten.craft?dl=0)\n\nGo win some wars with this thing!\n\n**K-29 Fully Equipped with Little Kerb!**\n\nAfter a few weeks of intense engineering, the scientists have made a modified version of a K-29. It can carry a current model of the Little Kerb to almost anywhere on Kerbin, may it be a deserted island for testing, or a city full of military personal. The plane can fly as well as a normal K-29, but it is a major hazard. The best we could get is a at best mediocre plane. 1/3 takeoffs end in explosions and failures. 6 kerbals have sacrificed their lives for the greater good just from that. Another kerbal died from losing control using testing. I do not recommend this plane for people who hate dieing/killing many kebals. Everything else on this plane is great. Little Kerb separates like a stage on a rocket, great and with no hazards. Gliding is great. It can fly at 350 m/s top speed, with or without the bomb. It holds 4 kerbals to guarantee that every drop is successful. It controls amazingly and can almost point straight up. Ahh, the pictures. As last time, don\u0027t reveal it yada yada yada. \n\nPics for Clicks\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
