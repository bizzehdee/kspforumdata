I just can\u0027t decide what. My first thought was an observatory, but I can\u0027t think of any way to build a giant telescope that would look good. Another idea is a giant lookout tower, but I\u0027ve tried that before on minmus (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YYQexIJ.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/YYQexIJ.jpg\u003C/a\u003E) and found out that you can\u0027t go first person view from command seats. Maybe just a giant tower you could run up and look from the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raikoutrio","CreatedById":78489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T02:45:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re going to make a lookout tower, definitely use the cupola module or even the mk1 cockpit.
