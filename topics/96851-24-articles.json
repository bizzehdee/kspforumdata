Completely optional of course, leaving the current functionality untouched if the parameter specifying another texture to use as the mask is not supplied. Any thoughts? As I said above, I fully intend on taking a look at the code and seeing how it might be possible in my own time, but I thought I\u0027d run it by you in case this was already implemented and simply undocumented (not that I\u0027ve read any documentation anywhere, I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E too lazy at times for that.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, KSP doesn\u0027t use such texture masks (like most other engines do) but it abuses alpha channel for that purpose.
