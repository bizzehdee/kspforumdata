Thousands of Kerbals daily are flying to distant parts of the globe and fewer than a dozen a day at killed in accidents. This great advancement was not without cost however. Thousand of test pilots perished in the pursuit for higher and faster flight. Today we are left with one single surviving test pilot Jebediah Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9ulvrBX.png\u0022 alt=\u00229ulvrBX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah seen posing in front of the aftermath of escaping a nuclear powered airplane when its reactor lost containment. The test facility the explosion occurred over was lost but Jebediah survived to test a larger nuclear powered craft. The explosion also launched radios being produced into space, providing a global disco broadcast. This event inspired Jebediah to launch other things into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to the great wealth accumulated by Jebediah as the only surviving test pilot, and his vast repository of knowledge of building Lego spaceships, Jebediah has chosen to lead the Kerbal people to space. While Jebediah is providing the funding and skills, he has been named a global treasure. As such the Kerbal people have unanimously decided to protect Jerbediah, and his fellow Kerbalnauts, against themselves. Thus Project Icarus was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe story of Icarus tells us of how the first Kerbal to fly created wings out of feathers and ice cream sandwiches. With his wings Icarus traveled the lands meeting other Kerbals and helping us to learn the world was much larger than was once thought. However Icarus continued to fly after winter ended and in the warmth of summer his wings melted and he plummeted to Kerbin. Though many benefited from learning that a melted ice cream ale is a might tasty beverage. Project Icarus well see Kermanity reach the stars while reminding us not to fly when it might melt our ice cream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo this end, no Kerbal will be risked flying a rocket that has not already been fully tested in automated spaceflight, where possible. As no Kerbal rocket has flown to date there is not enough data to create an automated system so the first few flights will be braved by Jebediah. Though attempts are being made to limit the power of the rocket to do no more than lightly toast Jebediah should an accident occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe work has already begun on the ground. Jebediah has recruited pilot trainee Bill Kerman and stuntman Bob Kerman. They work tirelessly to discover the secrets of spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/l2lFwS6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022l2lFwS6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill Kerman learns to control a spaceship in a centrifuge simulator.

Unfortunately shortly after this picture was taken, Bob was rushed to the hospital with a broken collar bone and three broken ribs. Worst of all was the loss of the martini experiment in the crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon we hope to bring you news of the first flight of Jebediah\u0027s Artemis I rocket design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil next time, this was a Walter Kerman report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(BTW, how do I set the size of images rather than editing their size and uploading again. Yes I\u0027m borrowing some official artwork, I thought it fit to nicely.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drethon","CreatedById":100831,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T19:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is Walter Kerman returning with updates on Project Icarus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first Kerbal rocket has been built and is undergoing ground tests. As you can see it is a very simple design, simply meant to give Project Icarus a chance to see how rockets go up and to make sure they keep going that direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZuhoWQ4.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022ZuhoWQ4.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have little information on the ongoing progress as all communications have been hard wired with the rocket.

However our directional microphones picked up Gene Kerman muttering something about keeping Jebediah from saying something dumb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe did spot Jebediah performing some ground experiments outside of the rocket.

As of yet life support is untested so the rocket will remain in the atmosphere for its entire flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we arrive at the launch pad we are surprised to see the same rocket that was being used for ground tests setup on the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZuhoWQ4.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022ZuhoWQ4.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen asked about the lack of landing gear or larger parachutes we received the following quote from Gene Kerman. \u0022Additional parachutes and landing gear would increase the weight of the rocket which would require more fuel to reach the target altitude. Jebediah has assured us that the rocket engines have sufficient strength for landing.\u0022 It is most fortunate this project is being led by the greatest engineering minds of our time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the 10 minute countdown we began setting up out cameras to record the launch but at 5 minutes to launch the rocket left the pad with a tremendous roar. Our crew rushed to complete setting up the cameras but were only in time to record the aftermath of the launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yPObhq9.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022yPObhq9.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conversations with Jebediah afterward he revealed that the calculations used to determine the strength of the rocket engine used data from engine tests. In these tests the forces were spread across the entire bell of the nozzle. When the force of touchdown was concentrated on the bottom edge of the nozzle the engine collapsed and detonated the remaining fuel vapor in the fuel tank. Fortunately the command pod was strong enough to withstand the explosion. The goo container also survived, giving researchers interesting data about the goo\u0027s use as an explosion absorbing material.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur inside sources tell us that the next launch will be delayed for some time while Jebediah ponders landing gear and better parachutes. As this flight did not produce enough data for automated space flight the next launch will bring Jebediah to the edge of space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
