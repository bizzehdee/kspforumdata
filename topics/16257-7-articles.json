In testing the interplanetary class dish I went for a kerbol mission, taking my probe as far away from kerbin to give a delay of over 2 minutes. I found that it was actually possible to perform orbital maneuvers if you are very very patient, use low thrust and guesstimate at least 2 minutes in advance. The SAS fix i found and implemented all the way back in v0,30 turned out to be invaluable, as SAS actually functions as sort of an autopilot, only SAS activation/deactivation is delayed, but the attitude corrections applied by SAS aren\u0027t. I don\u0027t think it will be possible to actually land on any planets, but you could maybe get your probe in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do get your point about the RP value of having an override. So I guess I could add in a small PartModule in v0.4 (or at least before KSP 0.17). It could be added to any part config without interfering with anything else and I would probably make sure that it would only work if the vessel was in contact with the relay network and had a MechJeb module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm... while thinking about this I got a completely different idea; I might actually have come to a level of programming skills where I\u0027m able to make a very very simple autopilot myself. I\u0027m unsure whether I can figure out how to make it automatically turn the vessel in the different directions (Something akin to Smart A.S.S), but I could definetely give it thruster control. You\u0027d have to turn your vessel manually and with great care, taking into account the signal delay. But once you have your vessel oriented correctly (lets say retrograde) you could bring up the autopilot menu, tell it at what % you want your engines to burn and at what speed to stop the burn or how long you want the burn to last. If i wrote the autopilot myself it would be a lot more simple to integrate with signal delays (meaning that if the signal delay is 2 minutes it would take 2 minutes from the time you press \u0022go\u0022 to it actually doing anything).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking further, I could probably also add the option of telling the autopilot to maintain a certain speed (for powered landing). This would probably make only stop-n\u0027-drop landigs possible though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting all excited thinking about this possibility. I think a crude autopilot like this would fit well with RemoteTech; it\u0027s very low-tech, insanely challenging, but not at all the only option you have of doing interplanetary spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and BTW I just found an exploit that I should have forseen. Currently you have delayless control of your spacecraft until the signal delay has caught up. Giving my kerbol orbiting vessel two minutes of instant control each time i switch back and forward to it.
