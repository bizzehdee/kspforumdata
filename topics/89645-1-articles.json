It reaches 6-7km before it flips out, regardless of the profile of my gravity turn. OK, it should have plenty of thrust to counter the drag, the engine gimbals, so maybe the CoM is dropping too low? So I made several rockets along the lines of this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/x9xgJgD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/x9xgJgD\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich does look silly, but the CoM is now right at the top of the rocket. It still flips out at about the same altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther things I have tried include winglets, both with and without control surfaces, at various points along the rocket. A set in the middle, a set at the bottom, or both. Similar performance each time. I\u0027ve also tried adding more SAS units which, of course, does nothing. There\u0027s way too much torque on the rocket for those to counteract it. I\u0027ve tried various profiles for the gravity turn, I\u0027ve tried keeping the AoA as low as I can, no results. It will go straight upwards, though, for all the use that is. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the TWR is getting too high at too low an altitude as the fuel is burnt and that\u0027s making it flip, but how do I counteract that in a sensible way?

In the VAB, the airflow is coming from the top (in SPH, from the hangar doors).

A real gravity turn is to make a 2-5 degree pitch when you\u0027re moving 60-100 m/s (higher TWR means an earlier, sharper turn), and then to ride prograde all the way down until you\u0027re in upper atmosphere and can, for yourself, decide what the proper pitch is. If properly constructed*, you can actually turn SAS off and go \u0022Look Ma, no hands!\u0022, because aerodynamic stability will keep your rocket dead prograde. Technically speaking, if you ever touch the controls after the initial turn, it isn\u0027t a gravity turn, it is a pitch profile, though it should work if you always keep rocket orientation close to prograde. If it deviates too far from prograde, you go from aerodynamic stability to aerodynamic instability, and flip in all sorts of interesting, rocket-ending ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Has fins to keep CoP below CoM.

Well there is a simple fix for that, add winglets to the tail of the craft, this will help keep it stabile through the air at speed, there is a reason why lawn darts have them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue you are running into is your rocket is reaching nearly supersonic speeds quite low, this is causing the pressure on the nose of the rocket to be higher then that at the rear of the rocket, making it want to flip around if there is any change in vector. So you need something to force the center of pressure back a bit, this is what those winglets are for at the bottom of many rocket designs. Once you start getting bigger rockets you will not have to worry about this as much as they will not accelerate as fast and run into the same problems, instead you will have whole new problems.

I will also throttle back to keep from over speeding, or going faster than mach 1 untill I hit 20km altitude, at that point I will throttle back up to full and let it burn itself out of fuel till I reach orbit or second stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T17:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to try is disabling the forward fuel tank until after the turn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T18:11:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to second what most people have written, you have to be aware of terminal velocity.

It may need to be a bit more aggressive than starting lower, but you get that back in stability. Besides, FAR requires a lower deltaV to reach orbit so your losses are minimal as it is.
