I tried counter rotating props on a twin boom plane, and it didn\u0027t move once in the water *massive drag lines showed for the prop blades in the water, but no lift lines. Do hydroplanes not really work now? I could swear they did, but this think didn\u0027t move at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA single prop plane in the water just went sideways, like the paddlewheel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeeping it out of the water seems like a clever solution to let it spin up and use air where they can make forward lift... but... I have some modded worlds where the atmosphere is very thin, and the water is just as dense as normal (duna with seas, since 0.0667 atmospheres is plenty for liquid water after all). I also did a modification to laythe to scale it down to a smaller size (relatively, I\u0027m playing 3x rescale), with a lower surface gravity and a lower atmospheric pressure (the gravity was reduced by the same percent as the atmosphere was reduced, so flying speeds remain unchanged).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn these cases, there is very little air to push off of, so I\u0027d still be looking for a good option...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there are submersible boats... I really want to make a stock eve submersible, but I\u0027m at a loss as to how to propel it (rockets are not an option, I want the sub to be able to go more than a few meters!), and it seems screw-propellers don\u0027t work in water (why not though? hydroplanes seem to work, dynamic diving subamrines work.... doesn\u0027t make sense to me)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kernel Kraken","CreatedById":181383,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-10T12:15:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you guys do for normal boat propulsion?
