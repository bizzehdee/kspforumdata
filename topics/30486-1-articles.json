There are still some purely cosmetic parts, such as a comm dish and an antenna. Will you continue to add non-functional parts without waiting for their systems to be implemented?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EArtyom Zuev:\u003C/strong\u003E We try to keep all parts functional and impactful in the game, but sometimes aesthetics need to be taken in mind. People expect there to be radio antenna on space ships, even if the game itself provides those control and communication functionalities without the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s an essential part of how satellites and spaceships look, so having it makes sense even without any functionality. Part of the fun of the sandbox game is an element of roleplay, some stuff you are building isn\u0027t necessarily practical or functional, but it\u0027s fun to build and fly it anyway\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people have stargates, orbital hotels and observation towers in their saves, even though there is no FTL, space tourists or Mun monsters in sight currently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EL0ckAndL0ad:\u003C/strong\u003E We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve seen a major part redesign in 0.18 update.

Quality was lacking, and current new parts are up to a reasonable, well-looking standard, so there is no reason to change them in sight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not like 0.18 changes were made because someone disliked the tint or yellow stripes only!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs about some other stuff, I\u0027m not sure. Spaceplanes are planned to be revamped at some point in the future. Some parts like certain internals should be improved too. But again, it\u0027s not about style, but about bringing the quality to the level when it\u0027s reasonable to ask money for these models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EL0ckAndL0ad:\u003C/strong\u003E Before 0.20, KSP had some memory limits which prevented you from adding new \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cheavy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 content, such as planets and moons.

We don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have an in-game observatory yet to be able to find new celestial bodies, but can we expect this to happen with an early career mode implementations?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFelipe (Harvester) Falanghe:\u003C/strong\u003E That\u0027s something that needs to be always clear... we never do or not do something because of a technical limitation... our decisions are for gameplay/development progression reasons. If we wanted to add more planets right now, we\u0027d work through any tech issues we find along the way\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlunt answer, don\u0027t expect it in \u0027early\u0027 career implementations there\u0027s still a long way to go before we add more content like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EL0ckAndL0ad:\u003C/strong\u003E With the career mode on the horizon, you must be actively discussing what is it going to be like.

Except we want something with a more organic flow to it. BARiS was very rigid in that because it was based on a board game, so it had to have a rigid turn-based system to it. For KSP, we want to have a lot of the same mechanics though, but with less constraints on them. Think of it as a high speed crash between SimCity, RollerCoaster Tycoon and BARiS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EL0ckAndL0ad:\u003C/strong\u003E We know that you were thinking about making Kerbal Knowledge Base to be based on Milestones. The more advanced steps toward the objective you make, the more information you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll get. Will you get penalized in any way for skipping earlier steps? Like, going straight for a manned landing or rovers, instead of doing flybys and satellites/probes first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFelipe (Harvester) Falanghe:\u003C/strong\u003E You\u0027d get everything that you didn\u0027t get up to that new point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EL0ckAndL0ad:\u003C/strong\u003E Will any scientific instruments come into play for this?
