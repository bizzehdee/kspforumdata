A good rule of thumb is to make your attitude changes so that they touch the edge of the prograde ring but do not go outside it too much."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:08:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Turn much earlier and keep your attitude aligned much more closely with your prograde vector indicator.

Allow me to expand on your description a bit. There\u0027s a dot right in the middle of the nav ball which doesn\u0027t move, keep that dot inside the circle of the prograde vector at all times while ascending through thick atmosphere. When descending, to avoid the same flipping over problem in reverse, with a taller lander, keep the dot in the middle of the retrograde vector at all times. Avoid violent control inputs if at all possible (only use big inputs if you\u0027re trying to pull the dot back into the prograde/retrograde vector.\n\nGravity turns have never been \u0022vertical until 10km, then 45 degrees\u0022, NEVER! It just happens that old KSP was buggy and didn\u0027t cause you to crash and burn if you did that, but it should have. The bug has been fixed now, and you need to actually do something that\u0027s at least close to a proper gravity turn, a continuous curve of slow and gentle continuous adjustment from just after lift off until you\u0027re out of the atmosphere and horizontal. Rockets are most sensitive to flipping out at low altitude, in the thickest atmosphere, so it\u0027s ok to do \u0022vertical until 5km\u0022 (or similar), before starting the slow and gentle nose over towards the horizon, if that makes it easier for you."},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:10:15Z","Content":"Im sorry but i agree with OP - The game\u0027s ruined.

It\u0027s still possible to launch some crazy designs (I just did a science bomb). You just have to change your ascent profile so that you don\u0027t drift too far from your surface prograde till you\u0027re above 30km altitude. If you drift too far your rocket will flip.\n\nThe new progression has me doing new designs. Thankfully they made all of the early parts cheaper too (all the liquid fuel rockets are cheaper than .90 from the feel of it). I\u0027m using structural fuselages to make large engine clusters rather than using single engines for jobs, all with LV-t45 (\u0022swivel\u0022 now) so that I have attitude control to prevent flipping.\n\nScience bombs are back. There are two types that I brought back:\n\n- Low altitude EVA reports: I had Valentina go outside every so often to take a report over each biome on the Mun.\n\n- Probe bombs: I bought back the Artemis design from 2013... one main ship with several small probes each carrying small experiments.
