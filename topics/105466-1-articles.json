Allow me to expand on your description a bit. There\u0027s a dot right in the middle of the nav ball which doesn\u0027t move, keep that dot inside the circle of the prograde vector at all times while ascending through thick atmosphere. When descending, to avoid the same flipping over problem in reverse, with a taller lander, keep the dot in the middle of the retrograde vector at all times. Avoid violent control inputs if at all possible (only use big inputs if you\u0027re trying to pull the dot back into the prograde/retrograde vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity turns have never been \u0022vertical until 10km, then 45 degrees\u0022, NEVER! It just happens that old KSP was buggy and didn\u0027t cause you to crash and burn if you did that, but it should have. The bug has been fixed now, and you need to actually do something that\u0027s at least close to a proper gravity turn, a continuous curve of slow and gentle continuous adjustment from just after lift off until you\u0027re out of the atmosphere and horizontal. Rockets are most sensitive to flipping out at low altitude, in the thickest atmosphere, so it\u0027s ok to do \u0022vertical until 5km\u0022 (or similar), before starting the slow and gentle nose over towards the horizon, if that makes it easier for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:10:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm sorry but i agree with OP - The game\u0027s ruined.
