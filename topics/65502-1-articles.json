It\u0027s the avarage sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in KSP (I have no idea if we also do it in real life), we also use ASL for other planets, even though they have no sea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for some this makes abit of sense. ASL on minmus is exactly the height of the flats. But on the Mun, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever even seen a spot below ASL, so it\u0027s hardly the avarage height of anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how does this work?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T00:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually see the phrase \u0022datum\u0022 instead of Sea level used for other bodies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure how they deturmine \u0022datum\u0022 altitude, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lexif","CreatedById":65533,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T01:34:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe datum is where you want it to be, that\u0027s how it works. For planets with interconnected oceans, it\u0027s kind of obvious, but even then it\u0027s not so simple in the real world. The earth\u0027s sea levels are at different distances from the earth\u0027s center as the earth is not spherical and does not have a homogenous density profile... (Plus other effects, like tides, currents, etc...) Even on earth, different countries use different datums. For example, they built a bridge over the Rhine between Switzerland and Germany, and both countries use different datums for their altimetry data. A contractor made a mistake like confusing a sign when converting between the datums, and the bridge heads were off by a meter or so because of that...an expansive mistake. If I remember it right, the germans use a datum based on mean sea level at some north sea port, while the swiss use the exit of Lac Leman at Geneva, but which is in practise linked by measurements to mean sea levels in the adriatic sea or something like that...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
