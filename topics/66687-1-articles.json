Then I wondered if there has ever been an unedited video of the entire broadcast. I don\u0027t know exactly what it would have looked like when it originally aired. Were there commercials? Was it a non-stop feed? Was the signal lost between landing and when cameras were moved around? Basically what I want to see is exactly what would have been seen live on television, even if that means four DVD\u0027s amounting to 20 hours of dry footage. What I DON\u0027T want is a documentary film interspersed with more recent footage of folks explaining what is happening. Has such a thing ever been released?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearches mostly seem to point to a bunch of stuff about moon hoaxes and \u0022UFO\u0022 sightings on the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T02:39:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI vaguely recall that somewhere on the Internet someone uploaded the original Walter Cronkite-narrated CBS coverage of the mission from launch to recovery, but I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s still up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T02:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone manages to find this, I\u0027d also really want to have a source of NASA Apollo stock footage I can use for my documentary project.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T03:20:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I may have found that playlist I mentioned earlier:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLwxFr1zAEfokQUXPUyyss0qp1Unqax5AU\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E, combining coverage from all 3 of the major news outlets of the day into one massive playlist.
