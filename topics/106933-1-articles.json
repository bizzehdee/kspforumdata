I used the installer. I loaded it up (took about 8 seconds, amazing!). started a sandbox save, so far loving it, just need to relearn to adjust to the new mechanics. I encountered a bug with the airbrakes, I could not assign them to an action group ( Ill assemble the documentation .logs required, then report it. Great Update Squad!. Spaceplanes are completely possible, made suborbital spaceplane that can go to a 120 km apoggee and have plenty of fuel to land. should use the margin to preform a braking burn, lasts till 8 km before exploding."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:37:46Z","Content":"The air brake thing is a known issue. I don\u0027t think Squad has said anything on it but I\u0027m convinced it is a bug because it doesn\u0027t behave like everything else in the game, and to be honest tying it to the brakes doesn\u0027t make sense. I think planes land with air brakes deployed (those that have them) and wheel brakes disengaged (braking only after touchdown). Having both engaged may not matter from a game mechanic because KSP is forgiving on that, but it still bugs the hell out of me.\n\nI\u0027m not a pilot but I think if you landed with wheel brakes engaged you would either break something or go skidding out of control.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T18:44:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 06:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"}]}
