I also tried to have CKAN update all my previous mods, but it refused to do so because cryoengines is incompatible so every time I tried to update mods that were vaguely related it threw up an error and wouldn\u0027t let me. I deleted CKAN, my mods, and re-downloaded CKAN and compatible mods through it, as well as a couple that it didn\u0027t have or claimed where incompatible when they weren\u0027t (no fault of its own there really).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly reason I\u0027m saying all that is because it could possibly be somewhat related. Maybe. In any event, the problem I\u0027m having is that what appears to be an IVA interior is placing itself onto my command pod at launch, and is even visible in the VAB (below the actual vessel- at launch, the command pod is fine for a second or two, after which the IVA part clips into place). I even checked the SPH; same thing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImages will be near the bottom.
