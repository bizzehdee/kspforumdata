I have only 2 mods, mechjeb, and alarm. I kept the same processor and memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that processor speed is more important than graphics capabilities when dealing with large a large part count. As for memory, I have 6 GB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to know from you which item you consider most important in improving frame rate with high part count: graphics, memory, processor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also to know if, above a certain part count, there is simply no economically viable machine that can cope with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T14:13:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically, yes, the CPU is far more important than the graphics, any reasonable spec graphics is capable of running quite high part counts at decent frame rates though some older integrated chipsets do struggle unless you turn the settings down. There are lots of areas of the game that use a considerable amount of CPU: Unity\u0027s rigid body calculations, collision detection, heating mechanism, aerodynamics, resource production and consumption, docking port/claw handling etc. Several of these operations effectively scale with the square (or even worse) of the part count so as the part counts get larger, these calculations take up proportionately more time and start affecting the frame rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere seems to be a general consensus that the game has gotten slower in recent updates, the same large craft being substantially slower in 1.0\u002B than they were in 0.90. This isn\u0027t really surprising given the new heat mechanics and aero changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Unity 5 update coming in KSP 1.1 should improve the rigid body calculations and there is lots of scope for parts of KSP to be optimised also. Hopefully things should improve again in the coming months (and possibly get significantly better than they\u0027ve ever been).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 gig of memory should be fine unless you like running other memory hungry programs while you play (e.g. browsers, mod development software etc.). Any more than that is wasted really as the game simply can not use more than 3.5 gig (assuming running on 64 bit windows, if on 64 bit Linux then it can use more).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best CPU for KSP at present is the fastest clocked recent Intel CPU that you can get. Don\u0027t get less than 4 cores unless on a really tight budget (there is a very cheap Pentium branded chip that can be overclocked very well which isn\u0027t a bad option) but hyperthreading (2 logical cores per physical core as in most i7s) isn\u0027t particularly helpful (certainly not now and probably not for the foreseeable future unless you also do stuff like video transcoding).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T16:35:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your insight and advice, Padishar. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T17:19:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, 1200 parts will lag on any processor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wild Cobra","CreatedById":150214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T20:51:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Padishar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Padishar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best CPU for KSP at present is the fastest clocked recent Intel CPU that you can get.
