Unless your saying that you accomplished a super cruise of mach 2.\n\u003E So with super cruise that would be 10 points (mach 2), for top speed 46 points (mach 4.3), TWR would give you 1 point, and 9 g turns give you 5 points.\n\u003E \n\u003E So 62 points is your interim tally? Could you post your super cruise run? Also if you super cruise at mach 2.2 then that\u0027s 12 points not 10 because there is no limit which says that super cruise is only between mach 1 and 2, it needs to be sustainable on cruise power that\u0027s all the rules say\n\nAhh, top speed and supercruise are different things, lol I messed up on the counting.\n\nI guess I can supercruise at Mach 2.6 or something, will check tomorrow, thanks for fixing up my confusion, I did not figure out that it was two different tests.\n\nBtw, supercruise 1/3rd of thrust is on the top of the 50% max thrust of the TurboJets? And am I forced to use the fuel tanks anywhere? Or is it just how much extra fuel it can carry?\n\nWill tweak and test it again tomorrow, let\u0027s see what happens.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, 48 points for droptanks seems a bit too much, but if I did not read anything wrong again then yey.\n\n![NMFbSsX.png](http://i.imgur.com/NMFbSsX.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T22:03:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 10:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tetryds**"},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T23:12:40Z","Content":"\u003E Also, 48 points for droptanks seems a bit too much, but if I did not read anything wrong again then yey\n\nwell you have 1,200 litres per drop tank and 2 drop tanks so 1,200 x 2 = 2,400 divided by 50 = 48\n\nMaybe I should nerf that, can you super cruise with all that stuff?
