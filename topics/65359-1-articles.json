No. First it stopped responding when loading the files located in GameData\\JARFR_CRSS\\Parts\\Structural\\JARFR_CubeStrutSplitterTube. Now it stops responding when loading the file GameData\\FusTek\\Parts\\KuestLegacyAirlock\\model. These aren\u0027t even part of the B9 pack. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anybody shed light on what\u0027s going one here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"g0tchas","CreatedById":81760,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T10:21:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGrrrr - took out the B9 pack, and all is working again.
