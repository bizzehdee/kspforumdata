I finally decided to get it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was at my first destination, Bop, and had lowered my orbit nice and low--so low that it required 1x time warp (I believe this is significant). However, it was in a perfectly reasonable, stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to orbit just a half orbit more, and figured I\u0027d switch to the KSC and warp ahead. But when I looked in the planetarium, I couldn\u0027t find my beautiful spaceship. It had been eaten!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the relevant factor is the altitude. The orbit didn\u0027t intersect Bop (and the ship disappeared exactly when I loaded the KSC), but I had been switching around just fine at higher altitudes before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T17:02:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s always trouble with the Bopmuda triangle, unless you have a quicksave your craft has been eaten by the Kraken, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s best to keep your distance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
