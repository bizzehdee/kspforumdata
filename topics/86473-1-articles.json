The lander was packed with data. The last planned correction burn had been made, and Kerbin\u0027s SOI was approaching. Whoops, an unplanned Mun encounter?! With his last dregs of fuel, Wehrfield adjusted course to miss the Mun, but now there would be no reentry at Kerbin. Worse, the gravitational boost of Kerbin would fling him beyond any hope of rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Screw this,\u0022 thought Wehrfield. He gathered up his data and stepped from the hatch. Aiming as best he could, he activated his suit\u0027s thrusters. \u0022That should do it,\u0022 he thought. \u0022One way or the other, this mission will be over shortly.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cold of space was soon replaced by the toasty warmth of atmospheric friction. Wehrfield marvelled at the rosy orange glow as he bled off the kinetic energy of an interplanetary transfer. As he slowed to about 100 m/s, he considered his chance of a successful bounce. Perhaps with a last burst of the RCS thrusters...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaiting as long as he could stand it, Wehrfield fired his thrusters. Impact. Bounce! He kept firing. A little bounce.
