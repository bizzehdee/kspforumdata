I want to use it for \u0027nose first\u0027 landings and as a rearward facing docking claw. I tried to modify the part.cfg but there doesn\\\u0027t seem to be a way to invert the landing leg. Modifying the landing leg parameters was also not successful since the landing legs seems to have a fixed \u0027deployed\u0027 angle of 155 degrees and modifying the pivotingAngle only changes the angle of the legs when retracted.\n\nIs there an easy way to make laterally inverted stock parts?"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T05:31:11Z","Content":"Not \\*yet\\*. As of the next update (0.15), we\\\u0027ll be able to rotate all parts into any orientation, so you\\\u0027ll have to wait, I\\\u0027m afraid :/\n\nIf you\\\u0027re really desperate, the only other way is to actually edit the model of the part itself, and then the config to reflect the rotated orientation."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-15T00:48:30Z","Content":"Until 0.15, you can use Tosh\\\u0027s cart mod to rotate parts. It\\\u0027s hard to explain, but the cart can attach radially, then attach something else (i.e. a fuel tank) to the carts end and build on to that. Now when you detach the fuel tank and put it someplace else, the attached parts retain their attachment angle relative to the fuel tank, and so wind up at some crazy angle. Then throw away the cart.\n\nIf this made no sense, rotate your mind 90\u00C2\u00B0 and read it again.\n\nAnyway, by doing this with two carts in series, you could have the legs oriented upside-down (or whatever)."}]}
