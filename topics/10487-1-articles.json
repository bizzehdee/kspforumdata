Modifying the landing leg parameters was also not successful since the landing legs seems to have a fixed \u0027deployed\u0027 angle of 155 degrees and modifying the pivotingAngle only changes the angle of the legs when retracted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there an easy way to make laterally inverted stock parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T05:31:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot *yet*.

It\\\u0027s hard to explain, but the cart can attach radially, then attach something else (i.e. a fuel tank) to the carts end and build on to that. Now when you detach the fuel tank and put it someplace else, the attached parts retain their attachment angle relative to the fuel tank, and so wind up at some crazy angle. Then throw away the cart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this made no sense, rotate your mind 90\u00C2\u00B0 and read it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, by doing this with two carts in series, you could have the legs oriented upside-down (or whatever).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
