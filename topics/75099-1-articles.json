Same for crew reports and EVA. I saw that in one of Scott Manley videos[interstellar quest episode 38], he went EVA, did something to the sensor package, and voila all sensors were reseted, while still having all experiments stored. So how is that working? Can i reset those sensors for biomes only, or for fly low/high or orbit low/high? If that\u0027s true, then...jesus i wasted a lot of time and many opportunities, to earn science.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T05:41:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes to most of what you said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you take a measurement/report/whatever you can use that experiment again provided you collect it via EVA with a kerbal. Kerbals can store repeat experiments (i.e. from the same biome/conditions). However, if you try to store repeats into a pod, it will only let you keep one of each experiment/conditions. Pods can store an unlimited number of experiments, so long as they are from different circumstances (again, different biome, conditions, whatever).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you collect the science from an experiment, it is ready for immediate reuse. The only exception is the SciJr and the Goo. After their science has been collected, you have to clean it with a lab module before you can use it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, you can store multiple crew reports too. You need to send your kerbal EVA to collect it after making the report.

One trip is plenty, thank you very much! But... it\u0027s not my game, and perhaps I\u0027m not seeing the reason (strategy) for their decision to make science work this way. It certainly makes career mode take longer, which we obviously want - I don\u0027t want to complete career mode in a few days of gameplay! Career mode should last months if not years before complete IMO.

For people who are really obsessive compulsive (such as those people who are bothered by the fact that I started this line with a 4 instead of a 3) it can be satisfying to really want to squeeze out every bit, even if it\u0027s only 0.7 more science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for me, instead of taking two pods or just accepting 1 set of data and returning twice, I tend to double up on the experiments AND the flights. Which means I do visit each biome twice, but I\u0027m carrying multiple sets of equipment. Now I have two options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Send two missions on the same profile to the same locations. They each do 1 round of science in 2 biomes/conditions and can store all data in their respective pod. This gets me 4 missions worth of data, provides redundancy, and provides flexibility to change the mission if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Send one ship with multiple experiments to a single location. Do the experiments and store the data. Jettison the collected set of experiments (for weight) and keep the copies in the second set of experiment modules. Return it all to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m becoming a big fan of #1.
