It appears to occur when a claw is clipped into a probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my tests I built several rovers with slight differences.

In all cases the twitching stopped on arming and/or disarming the claw, though some twitching occurred while the claw was moving between states.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn loading another rover the original could then start twitching as if it had just been launched itself, even though it was not the active vessel, arming it\u0027s claw stopped the twitch as before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to replicate with a couple of very simple rockets, but did not notice the effect with those admittedly very limited tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can provide craft files for the rovers as well as a more detailed word document, if required and some videos (which are very slow due to my out dated PC).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this is of help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease advise if you want me to take any further action, or if this issue is covered elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T01:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy this point it is fairly safe to say that part clipping is causing this \u0022bug\u0022 behaviour - as such, not much really needs to be done, as that kind of behaviour is expected from part clipping.
