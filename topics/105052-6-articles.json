Randomize a candidate out of all entrants\n\n2.) Manually check the answer field\n\n3.) If answer correct ---\u003E this is the winner\n\n4.) If answer wrong ---\u003E go to 1.)\n\nThis ensures that you do not need any software or infrastructure beyond a simple SQL database that\u0027s queried by hand, and a free public website like random.org that supplies reliable random numbers on demand. It\u0027s the cheapest way to implement such a contest.\n\nAdditionally, it ensures that the answer field is read by a human, and evaluated in the spirit of the question, not matched against a predefined string. A human will easily identify any possibly variation in wording and spelling of the correct answer."},{"CreatedByName":"stanz25","CreatedById":125848,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T21:37:09Z","Content":"Hey!
