I know that I get diminished returns when I repeat an experiment, like \u0022Goo in space high above Kerbin\u0022. That\u0027s obviously great or many people might just run around KSC collecting samples repeatedly. We also have much reduced science gain from transmissions of anything that is not a crew report, which also makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the question: Will doing an experiment for the first time and transmitting the result (Goo or Science Jr., for example) take up the \u0022good slot\u0022 that gives 100%? When I then get a flight together that can return, will I get a much diminished return, basically about as useful as the first one that I transmitted? Or is transmitting a result treated differently than bringing it back, which would kind of make sense?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know by how much exactly the science gets diminished from the first to the second time, but I think I saw a 0.4 (instead of 1.0) as a multiplier somewhere, though it might be 0.7 or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say I\u0027m in high orbit around Kerbin, doing some Goo. I think it gives 10 Science, and in any case let\u0027s just assume it does. Transmitting it would be 40%, so I get 4 from transmitting that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Could be I don\u0027t have any parachutes to return the craft with the goo, but just the capsule or something, just stay with me...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I go again to \u0022High orbit around Kerbin\u0022 (with enough parachutes this time), open the goo and keep it. According to the guessed diminished returns multiplier from above (.4) I get 4 science again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I got a total of 8, even though I brought it back the second time. If I had brought it back the first time, I\u0027d gotten the full 10. If this really is the case it makes doing \u0022exploratory missions\u0022 (unmanned probes) first basically impossible (or at least not worth it) unless I also bring them back. Like having a probe that does a gravity assist at the Mun to fly by Minmus and goes on to visit Duna (or something). This would really be kind of sad, especially since the rather bulky/heavy \u0022Science Jr.\u0022 only give 20% when sent via radio, so \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone tried this yet?

[numbers in brackets indicate science from transmission]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you only transmit (four times), you get the following science: [4.0] \u002B [3.1] \u002B [2.4] \u002B [1.5] = 11\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, that\u0027s already more than a single recovery would get you (10).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you only do recoveries, you get: 10 \u002B 4.4 \u002B 2 \u002B 0.9 = 17.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is obviously more, so recovering IS worth it. Even the first two are already noticeably more than all four transmissions.

If you transmit once or twice that seems OK though, maybe even beneficial: It might make sense to transmit the first data point even when you know you\u0027re gonna recover the craft (and you have the power!) since those first two are a noticeable boost over only recovering.

Basically doing an unmanned fly-by with a satellite before you send a manned mission that will return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this we look at the data only up until the first recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecovery only: 10 (14.4 for two recoveries, just for reference)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x transmit \u002B recovery: 11.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2x transmit \u002B recovery: 13.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4x transmit \u002B recovery: 14,2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECONCLUSION TIME! Unfortunately I\u0027m missing a data point there, but it still seems to all be worth it as long as you \u003Cstrong\u003Edo return a sample in the end\u003C/strong\u003E. You will reduce your maximum (reasonably) possible science gain from a single experiment though, so if it is something that you\u0027re likely to do often (like flying high/low over Kerbin) you should not transmit, you\u0027ll bring it back eventually - unless you need that science now for a very specific unlock or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that the mission that finally returns will still have a lower science yield than a first-discovery mission would. The rest was just already transmitted.
