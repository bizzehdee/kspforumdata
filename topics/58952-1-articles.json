Unfortunately I am finding that the documentation out there for modding ksp either does not exist or is extremely out of date. I have been able to locate a few excellent how to guides and youtube videos, but they all seem to only deal with simple objects like nosecones and fueltanks. I\u0027m very eager to develop my skills; is there a \u0022master\u0022 resource for developing for KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny assistance would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESOLVED!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-05T17:17:56Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2014 05:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kokanee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miracmert","CreatedById":67128,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T15:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know good documentation but since KW engines are good at variability, I recommend examining their source code.
