I\u0027m really good at making planes and even Fly-by-wire planes, naturally unstable. Still I\u0027Ve been building flying wing for two months and still no results. The wing was very bad at first. Nowadays its pretty stable except turning. I\u0027m using drag rudders and spoilers and double side flaps for turning. I put spoilers of wing size and still it can\u0027t compensate the sideslip it sometimes get. Any ideas how to build it better?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is example of my last flying wing.

The angle of the cone depends on how fast you go, faster flight having a narrower cone. Anything that protruds from the cone (like wing tips) will creat a shock cone of its own. When those new cones intersect with the original cone, you get a lot of turbulence/drag and heat. So for very high speeds, short wings are needed to stay inside the cone. To keep the required surface area, that means wings that are wider front to back. A supersonic flying wing would probably look more like a long narrow arrow head rather than the broad triangles of current subsonic ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Toonu","CreatedById":18557,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-10T15:59:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for all replies!
