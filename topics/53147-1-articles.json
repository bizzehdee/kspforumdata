I think a really interestign thing to implement on this side of it would be RadBadges...like what the navy uses on Nuc subs. This is actually a prevention method, so if there is exposure to radiation at unsafe levels the crew member can be removed from that area and treated, if needed. The badges are passed out and then checked on boats every day or two from my understanding.

Magnetospheres present an interesting twist between a shield against death, and a buffer between you and a constant stream of free fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn example, the future planned fusion reactors need a fuel source, and the sun is just spraying it into space in thin amounts. Instead of constantly hauling fuel up to vessels, a station can be constructed with magnetic collector arrays similar to the Antimatter collectors. Only... less lethal if something goes wrong. But for these collectors to work, a player has to get them OUTSIDE a planetary magnetosphere that\u0027s blocking the particle stream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, while magnetospheres provide a good antimatter trap, they make collection of a more common fuel source a resource intensive endeavor.

Irregular fission reactor output. In space, well away from magnetic or other protections, how well does the reactor shielding work against cosmic radiation sources? Fast moving solar protons, gamma/cosmic rays, and whatever neutrons that happen to be flying through can throw additional nuclear energy into a reactor, increasing its flux, and speeding up the reaction. Of course, no SANE kerbal would stick one in orbit without a means to restore balance, but I could imagine that a sudden influx of radiation into a reactor could cause it to have irregular and unpredictable spikes in output of both waste heat and usable energy with corresponding rapid drops in functional fuel before inbuilt controls bring it back under control. (Though \u0027drops\u0027 in reactor fuel materials wouldn\u0027t be noticeable for a player unless they parked in a radiation \u0027hot spot\u0027 and compared reactor operational times.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T07:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELoving this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeas for how to have radiation affect Kerbals and/or probes/parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreen darkening or noise appearing (vision loss / signal issues)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart failues (perhaps using HoneyFox\u0027s RandomFailures mod?) i.e. a decoupler decouples early, or will not decouple on command.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart destruction (antennae, batteries...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom flybywire controller added, so craft does random attitude changes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConversely, control locks: throttle is locked, or pitch control is \u0022stuck\u0022 down or up, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, one axis is unavailable: to yaw, you have to roll and then pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf using KOS, corruption in the active program, or the volume.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T10:07:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm, so much fuel for imagination \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E For visual effects you could take a look at \u0022Micrometeorites\u0022 mod.

There would also be a fixed rate at which they recover from radiation, say 11\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5Sv/hour (100mSV/year). So, any time spent at a lower doseage than that would improve their longterm condition while higher doses would degrade it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would then be special effects for really high doses (say 100mSv/hour\u002B) causing accute symptoms immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also indeed imagine medical equipment that might help you recover from doses or accute symptoms more quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIdeas for how to have radiation affect Kerbals and/or probes/parts:\u003Cp\u003EScreen darkening or noise appearing (vision loss / signal issues)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart failues (perhaps using HoneyFox\u0027s RandomFailures mod?) i.e. a decoupler decouples early, or will not decouple on command.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart destruction (antennae, batteries...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom flybywire controller added, so craft does random attitude changes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConversely, control locks: throttle is locked, or pitch control is \u0022stuck\u0022 down or up, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, one axis is unavailable: to yaw, you have to roll and then pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf using KOS, corruption in the active program, or the volume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, there\u0027s a lot of scope for probe parts in this as well.
