I was not suggesting robotics as cited for the reason for locking it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see moving parts that you manually control how they move one part at a time. for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo end rotator, one end turns against the other to pivot parts. These can be rotated manually 360 degrees and can lock at certain points, ie half way, quarter way ect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this photo I made the blue the rotating parts with grey being docking ports, white a ship part and red being engines.
