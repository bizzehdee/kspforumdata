Since the weight is listed as the percentage of the vessel\u0027s mass composed of fuel, the slope along that axis may change dramatically for different weight profiles. For a very heavy vehicle, an extra ton\u0027s worth of engine won\u0027t change the fuel ratio much; however, for a very light vehicle the same tradeoff would decrease the percentage mass of fuel by much more. By itself, this graph just helps illustrate the relationships involved... to be of any real use you have to take your own situation into consideration.\n\n[![16860660911_10467605ba_c.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7625/16860660911_10467605ba_c.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/rFVi5c)\n\nEDIT: Here is another that I\u0027ve attempted to animate to show the effect of overall vehicle weight on this tradeoff. It loops through each frame, and it starts with the highest vehicle/fuel weight. Each frame reduces the vehicle and fuel weight linearly, and fuel/vehicle mass is a constant proportion (more true for heavier vehicles). As you should be able to see, as the mass of the rest of the vehicle goes down, the effect of the engine\u0027s weight becomes much more important (as it becomes a bigger contributor to the total mass ratio). The effect of the engine\u0027s weight drags down dV quickly once total vehicle weight gets below 5-8 tons, (changing the fuel/ship mass ratio can alleviate or exacerbate this effect depending on the direction of the change). You\u0027ll also notice that the ISP/dV curve doesn\u0027t move as much when the engine weight is very low (the corner that doesn\u0027t move much). Basically, making the other parts of the craft (including fuel) heavier stretches this graph out along the engine-weight axis, which has the consequence of all but eliminating the penalty paid for engine weight. At higher vehicle/fuel weights, the dV loss between an engine of 500kg and 2000kg has become pretty negligible (the highest vessel/fuel mass is about 70t in this series of frames) while ISP gains remain relatively in-tact.\n\n[http://postimg.org/image/onpa7tzud/](http://postimg.org/image/onpa7tzud/)\n\n![output_G8_Ju_R2.gif](http://s10.postimg.org/wt7c5zo3d/output_G8_Ju_R2.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T04:23:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 04:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by impyre**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rematog","CreatedById":134130,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T17:51:29Z","Content":"Graph does not go up to 800 for LV-N"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T21:16:16Z","Content":"Yep, but since the graph demonstrates the linear relationship that ISP has with dV, you can take a pretty good guess at what it would look like. At an ISP of 300, and a fuel mass percentage of about 70% of gross vehicle weight, you\u0027re looking at somewhere around 3600-3800 m/s dV. Since it\u0027s linear, just solve for slope. 3600/300 = 12, so an ISP of 800 would be around 12\\*800, or approx. 9600. Again, just an estimate. The actual calculation gives 9439.15 for the given ratio. Also, if you drop weight on the return trip this will change the ratio further. The fact that the nuclear engine\u0027s ISP is soo much higher than the others is what makes it\u0027s weight relatively inconsequential by comparison.\n\nAlso, I mistakenly posted this in the wrong forum.
