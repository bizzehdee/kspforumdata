Then climb, depending on speed. Also transfer as much fuel from the front pod to the tanks in the rear. At about 11-12 go into a slow climb and accelerate. You should have roughly 1050 m/s at 18km, preferably more speed and altitude. If your acceleration drops (KER helps with that, usually when acceleration drops below ~6-8 m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2) press the Lights button to turn off two jet engines and turn on the rockets. When your jets flame out press the Landing Gear button to close intakes. Climb steeper, e.g. 25 or 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 until the apoapsis is ~40-45 km, then follow prograde until your apo is at 75 km, then turn everything off and wait until 5-10 seconds before apoapsis, fire rockets, you\u0027re in orbit.
