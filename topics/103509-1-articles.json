This would have the following pros:\n\n- Let\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s you find your most popular parts faster, during construction\n\n- Gives modders an entry point to do something like discounts on often used parts, or somesuch\\*\n\n- Gives the devs (for those users who send info) an extra-idea of what parts might need a buff/nerf/move in the sci-tree (e.g.: why is nobody using engine X?!).\n\n\\*E.g. (pseudo-code): If part\\_used \u003C= 50, part\\_price = part\\_price - part\\_used%, else part\\_price=part\\_price - 50. To give a 1% discount on the part for each time the part had been used before, upto a cap of 50%.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T10:24:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 10:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T17:57:50Z","Content":"I love this idea ! ill \u002Brep you as soon as i can use my computer (on phone right now)"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T01:54:28Z","Content":"That would be useful info.
