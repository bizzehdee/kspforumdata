Geosynchronous orbits are in the wiki.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone the less, you asked for a formula, so here goes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a circular orbit at radius r, the velocity is v = sqrt(mu/r). The circumference of the orbit is C = 2 pi r.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus the period of the orbit is T = C / v = 2 pi r / sqrt(mu/r) = 2 pi sqrt(mu) r\u003Csup\u003E3/2\u003C/sup\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is Kepler\u0027s Third Law: The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. For a circular orbit, the semi-major axis equals the radius.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo find r such that your period T equals the planet\u0027s sidereal day: r = (T\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E / 4 pi\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E mu)\u003Csup\u003E1/3\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, KSP shows you altitude above the nominal radius of the body, r\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E. So you have to set your altitude to r - r\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
