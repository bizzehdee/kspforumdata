I\u0027m not very experienced at the game (my frustration from my badly running computer prevents me from doing as much practice as I\u0027d like) and I was wondering if there is some way to set the SAS to allow you to override it with a key press but only on that axis and keep the rest locked. Say you hold down W, it would unlock the S,W axis but keep Q,E and A,D still? If you can\u0027t do you think this should be added in, even if it\u0027s with a bigger, heavier SAS module?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T16:41:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse the avionics package \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can put it inside your cockpit by using part clipping.

For example you turn on SAS and you are held in place by gyros unless you move the ship via RCS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example when docking. If you turn on SAS it stop rotation so when you use translation control it doesn\u0027t turn your ship (which is hard because fuel usage shifts the CoM and there is no indicator unlike in the VAB). The number of times I have had Mechjeb turn on Parallel- and go to translate so I am in line only to have MechJeb and SAS push me back again because it is using the RCS to line up so it ends up a juggling act turning off MJ and SAS, turn on RCS, move into line slightly, turn off RCS, turn on MJ. It wouldn\u0027t be the case if we could rebalance the ship while in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can do it... but it is unnecessary frustration when there just needs a way to rebalance or an indicator that could let us rebalance manually. Limiting the SAS to only using gyros is the simpler method. That way you could align parallel to the docking port, turn SAS and RCS on and then use the RCS to translate while the SAS unit uses the gyros (but not the RCS) to keep the ship in line. JOB DONE! No need for MechJeb either and also NO WASTED RCS BURNS so you wouldn\u0027t need half as much RCS fuel either.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-04T21:01:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2013 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NeoMorph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T22:00:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELimiting the SAS to only using gyros is the simpler method. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThis IS how standard SAS works.
