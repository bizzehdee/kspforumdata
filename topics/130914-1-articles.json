I\u0027m having some electricity issues I need some help with. I\u0027m in 2 different situations where I\u0027m not able to transmit things due to charge rate not keeping up with usage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, I have a Mobile Lab orbiting the Mun. It has 1x6 solar panels(x6) and a total elec capacity of 770. When I have all panels lined up getting full sun exposure, It has a recharge rate of roughly 10.5. The issue is when I try to transmit the 499 science that is now in the lab, The electric storage runs out far too soon and then cancels the transmission even if I keep those panels in direct exposure the entire time, turn off sas, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a similar situation with a little rover I landed on Duna last night. It has 8 of the little single panels and a total of 520 elec capacity. At full charge and panels in direct light the entire time, it doesn\u0027t have enough charge to transmit data from one of the atmosphere analysis parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built both of these crafts following a couple of Scott Manley tutorials and even added 2 more solar panels on the Mun station than he did just to be safe. What am I doing wrong? :/\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: The pic of the rover was just after attempting to transmit the data and it cancelling after running out. That\u0027s why it\u0027s out of charge. Just didn\u0027t wanna give the impression that I\u0027m trying to transmit at no charge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot10.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v142/elway358/screenshot10.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v142/elway358/screenshot7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-28T14:13:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2016 02:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Elway358\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T14:17:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHacky solution - time warp.

For some unknown reason it generates an absolutely huge amount of data to transmit, which is in no relation to the science points gained from it.
