Designate one as the target ship. You may place this ship into any stable (non-atmospheric) orbit, but once you\\\u0027ve positioned it, you may not move it again. (Imagine it\\\u0027s out of fuel.) Your second ship is the capture vessel, which must rendezvous with the target, dock with it, and use its own engines to deorbit the target safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Challenge\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo it as fast as possible, using the mission time from launch to touchdown for the target ship. I\\\u0027ve done a few docking missions by now, but I only paid attention to the clock on one of them and achieved this in about 18 mission hours. I\\\u0027ll try again tonight with time in mind and take screenshots to have better evidence.
