Big flat surfaces on the front of things = \u003Cstrong\u003Ebad\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother alternative to using a fairing to reduce drag on the front would be to add a disposable nosecone so that the front end of your ship isn\u0027t so blunt/flat. Like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Put a 1.25m stack decoupler on the top of the ship, on top of that docking port. \u003Cstrong\u003EImportant:\u003C/strong\u003E Flip it upside down before attaching, otherwise it will remain stuck to the docking port after decoupling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Put a nosecone on top of the decoupler, the pointier the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Move the decoupler to the top of your staging order (i.e. so that it happens last). Go to \u0022Action Groups\u0022, pick some reasonable unused one (I like to use \u0022Abort\u0022 for this), and then choose that decoupler as the action for that action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you have a more aerodynamic rocket. When you get high enough in the atmosphere that drag\u0027s not an issue anymore (say, 30 km), you can ditch the nosecone by activating that decoupler (e.g. by hitting \u0022backspace\u0022 if you assigned it to the \u0022Abort\u0022 action group).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother suggestion: You\u0027re flipping because your center of mass is behind your center of drag. You can make the rocket more stable by moving the center of mass forward. You mentioned that the fuel tanks above the lander-can are empty. That\u0027s bad: they\u0027re big, draggy, and not very massive. Here\u0027s the suggestion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Fill up that 4-ton tank that\u0027s on top of the lander can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. To make up for the added mass, empty the tank that\u0027s at the bottom (i.e. the one that has those fins attached). This will make your rocket a lot more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. By the time you get to the point where you actually need the fuel in that tank you emptied, you should be above most of the atmosphere. So when you\u0027ve dropped your last radial boosters, transfer the fuel out of that tank in the front and into the tank down below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(This plan will only work once \u0022resource transfer\u0022 is enabled in your career, which happens when you upgrade your science facility the first time.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T03:08:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be tempted to lose the engines on the first asparagus stacks that you\u0027ll be dropping ... your launch TWR is entirely too high.
