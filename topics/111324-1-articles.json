With Unity 5, every single UI will be replaced as the current system uses like 3 different UI systems which bloats the game. With them all being replaced with 1, it\u0027ll hopefully optimise things, reduce scene change loading tines a bit etc. Overall, it should run slicker and get a bit of a visual revamp.

For spaceships with 12 wheels at odd places, it works perfectly up to 5m/s or so then wobbles to death.

Mu\u0027s been putting hours into it, he noticed even before 1.0 that balancing heating for command pods and cockpits is mutually exclusive, so they\u0027re introducing a new heating system called Skin Heating - basically, rather than seeing a part as a part, you see it as things surrounded by a shell of metal that heats up and cools down quicker - this basically makes things easier to balance overall. Same system as in Deadly Re-Entry actually - Squad talked to those devs and got permission to use some of their ideas. All their own code, but some of DREs ideas. 1.0.3 will not be released this week due to this new heating system needing balance, Squad wants to make it right first time. 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 were about 6 hours apart, Squad wants to avoid that again. Re-entries will be \u0022better\u0022, should exit and re-enter more stabley. Rockets will be more stable, aero will change a bit so \u0022just wing it\u0022. More engine tunings, fairings have been fixed (\u0022for the changes to the heating system\u0022 - NathanKell), Mk3 parts drag fixed, temperature gauge memory leak fixed (huge thanks to sarbian for helping with this).. big changelog, but not coming this week and probably not the next either. Regarding the editor aerodynamic stability overlay, it\u0027s still pencilled in, but it\u0027s one of those things that the more you add to it, the more you CAN add to it, which is a dangerous position to be in. Still, it\u0027s in the devs minds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBig news: Once U5 is done, Mu will take a more serious role regarding development: he\u0027ll take the wheel for 1.1\u002B.
