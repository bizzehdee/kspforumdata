A 1.25m reaction wheel is good for a stack of about 2x FLT-800 tanks, a 2.5m wheel is good for about 2 orange tanks, etc. (although you need a mod to get 3.5m and bigger wheels). This means that if your rocket has multiple stages of different diameters, you need the appropriately sized wheel for each stage. Now, if you\u0027ve got an asparagus lifter, you really only need 1 set of wheels for its central stack because the side stacks will go before you need to do much turning, and that will be in the air anyway so you can use tail fins for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use RCS or Vernor engines instead of RCS. I typically make huge SSTO rocket lifters just because, and these are so long that 1 wheel won\u0027t do them very well when they need to line up for the circularization burn. So I usually give them just enough RCS for that 1 maneuver, or use Vernors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T12:55:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMass alone is less important than moment of inertia.

For launchers I find the engine gimbals give plenty of control by themselves. Long skinny things are good candidates to use RCS or Vernors. Aeroplanes can and IMHO should use control surfaces.
