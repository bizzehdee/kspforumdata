But I\u0027m hoping for a little advice from the smart ones here. With OpenGL and not instlaling MKS/OKS and MCM yet, I can start out with 2.1gb...not horrible. However, I could get in about 20-40 minutes before I hit the ceiling and crashed. I knew that the infamous memory leak kicked in when changing scenes, especially in and out of the VAB, but upon reading more, I saw that it\u0027s also exacerbated by flying close to a planetary body. Pretty much my early game bread and butter is doing the atmospheric missions (Temp/Pressure scans, observation, etc.,) which pretty much means flying close to a planetary body. Does anyone have any advice on how to stave this off as much as possible, or techniques they use to mitigate it some? I\u0027d usually try to take a break on stream about once an hour and restart KSP, but seems like I have to take about double that right now.

Exception detector is a good place to start, and removing mods one at a time, although tedious, is sometimes the only way to fully isolate a problem. Alt-tab has a tendency to destabilize most fullscreen games in my experience, even games that can run for hours on end without issue can sometimes crash after a few alt-tabs.

This would also encourage long-term missions, right now you can touch down and grab all the science and plant a flag in under a minute and head straight back home with no benefit to staying longer.

If you want this to be a core mod, I would say to go ahead and integrate it, and I would be happy to help maintain the mod as basically a stand-alone version of the SETI science tweaks, the same way you separated the progression contracts out as a separate mod. This would actually be my preferred option, as those tweaks are really intended primarily for this mod anyways, although I would like to keep a standalone version as an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possible tweak I noticed that might help reduce the science overload later in the game is to remove biomes from the gravimeter when high in space since at those altitudes it makes more sense that you would be doing a much more general scan and reserve the biome specific stuff for lower orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: New version of the science tweaks is up, I adjusted the barometer mask so biomes should be respected while flying low now. Also added a few new situation reports for the telemetry experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T04:13:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 04:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
