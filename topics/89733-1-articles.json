To find the Higgs Boson you needed to find heavier particles as well(for supersymetry). The results of LHC are only consistent with Higgs if you engage in histrionics. The only reason I concede the signal that was found at LHC is the Higgs that that correctly or incorrectly, everyone is calling it Higgs. Never mind that all the qualifications for it to be Higgs were all failed. It is too light, there were no heavier particles found. Period. Full stop.

Again, you simply have no clue what a Higgs boson is, why it needs to exist, or what would have been ramifications of not finding it.

Hint, it is popular mythology that relativity has ~anything~ to do with it. That you do not know this makes me seriously doubt your claimed credentialing. LOL. The airforce calibrates the clocks and locations manually on all the satellites every day. Simple trigonometry is all the math that your little GPS device does. Things like Humidity have a far larger effect on drift than Relativity. LOL.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe clock rates on satellites are adjusted for time dilation due to both gravity and relative velocity. It\u0027s calibrated regularly to maintain precision, but without on-the-fly corrections, precision of GPS would be ~1km instead of the few meters that it is.
