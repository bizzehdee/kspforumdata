During launch you can either change the inclination to 90 degrees or change the heading to 0 for north, 180 for south, but beware that it requires a bit more delta-v to reach orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are already in orbit, you would have to do a plane change maneuver, which you could use MechJeb\u0027s Smart ASS feature to orient your craft to Normal or Anti-normal and then you would have to burn at the appropriate times to change planes. However, this is probably one of the most fuel intensive orbital maneuvers you can do. I would guess it takes between 3000-4000m/s of delta-v in a 75km orbit to change planes. It\u0027s honestly a lot easier to just orient the craft correctly at launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
