I\u0027m interested in sharing a persistent file(s) if a worthwhile mission is suggested, and also in players who are interested in using mods. I haven\u0027t had much time to install more than a few new parts, and I\u0027ve never used Damned Robotics, Electrical Energy, Kethane etc, so I\u0027d welcome a few people with prior experience so that our vehicles can begin exploiting the brilliant mod base available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I\u0027m keen to impress upon prospective applicants is my focus on aesthetics. I want our aircraft and rockets to look \u003Cem\u003Egood\u003C/em\u003E. I wouldn\u0027t go as far as completely sacrificing functionality, but style is important.

If you want to join, it would be good if you could provide an example of your own work as well. I\u0027m not necessarily looking for people with exactly the same tastes as me, just that you\u0027re interested in building craft that are more than a mere stack of tanks with a pair of wings slapped on.
