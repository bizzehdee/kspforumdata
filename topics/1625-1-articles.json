Now in this game the Kerbal Space Program has decided to embark on a colonisation mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame Rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo sustain and expand your colony, you need to extract resources from the environment. Resources are rated according to their Availability, which determines how much resource you get for a certain amount of harvesting capability. For example, if you had a Metal resource with availability 3, and had built a facility with a harvesting capability of 10, you would get 30 units of Metal per turn. I am planning on including at least the following resources at first:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Air[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Metal[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Silicon[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Water[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndustry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to harvesting resources, many of them can be converted into many useful products. I am still not entirely sure about how to do this, but want to have more complex products require more advanced production facilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can construct additional structures either inside or outside your colony. Structures are probably going to be made from industrial products, and large structures will require construction equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStorage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe various products and resources have different storage requirements (such that you can\u0027t put air in the same kind of container as metal). While each resource will occupy the same amount of space (i.e. 1 unit of water is the same volume as 1 unit of metal), products will have differing sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I am trying to think up something about research and coming up with numbers for the above sections. I am wondering however if anyone is interested in a game like this, and whether it should have multiple colonies or just one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"your mom","CreatedById":2028,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-10T02:53:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei would like to try it, it sounds fun\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
