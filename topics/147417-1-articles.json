It just orients the navball in a direction that is completely different from the probe core orientation (as apparent when I choose the probe core\u0027s \u0027control from here\u0027, the navball jumps!) and there are no other control authority devices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T11:52:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/148834-re-rooting-a-vessel-mid-flight-with-kiskas/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
