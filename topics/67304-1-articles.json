Talking about something vague, and not playable, makes this post hard to respond to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sort of get what you are trying to say. I also feel the Claw should just be a starting point of newer parts, namely pivoting and rotating parts. Forcing the Claw to be all of these at the same time creates balance and coding issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem with the claw is it doesn\u0027t seem like it can start open. So you can\u0027t start with the claw attached to something. So your monster truck would start with no wheels attached. You would have to go grab the wheels once the ships is on the pad. This is really limiting and will limit what the claw can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully the Dev\u0027s bring in moving parts, something as simple as a movable joint can create massive changes in the games dynamic.
