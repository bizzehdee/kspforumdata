You\u0027ve got a new fan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, and sorry if this immediately makes me sound like a bit of a tool, but is it at all possible to get Saturn V-like conical engine skirts for the E-4 cluster? I really like the black and blue ones on it now, so if some cone-shaped skirts kept that same colour scheme I think I\u0027d cry tears of joy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand perfectly if it\u0027s too difficult, or even if you don\u0027t want to. Once again, thank you so much for producing this pack of goodness! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll stay tuned to see how it progresses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAl.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PickledTripod","CreatedById":135197,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T23:59:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Bones, looking at the SpaceY Expanded stuff I noticed how much your modeling and texturing skills improved since you first released MRS and later SpaceY.
