Watching from afar, I notice how people contest over one particular hill left in the centre of a large wasteland. I grab a bone, load it into a bow and shoot up into the air. High speed winds carry the bone over to the hill, where it falls and starts rolling down the slope. A dog, who was the latest contender, runs after that bone, tumbling down the slope. Eventually, he catches it and buries it somewhere in the ruins before running off to attack another contender. I didn\u0027t get a good look at the dog, but he looked relatively small and chubby - something akin to a Corgi.\n\nWith nobody guarding the hill, I sit back in a deck chair on top of my mountain, grab some popcorn and invite any defeated contenders to join me in observing the hilarity that is sure to ensue now. I see several creatures approaching the hill already.\n\nNo mans hill - may the best man get defeated ^^"},{"CreatedByName":"11JRidding","CreatedById":57765,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T17:43:25Z","Content":"I kill off everyone in the contest after I undergo an aerial insertion\n\nMy hill, with a huge crater on 1 side"},{"CreatedByName":"Spearka","CreatedById":12271,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T18:14:17Z","Content":"![qo4Dw1W.gif](http://i.imgur.com/qo4Dw1W.gif)\n\nmy hill now"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T19:43:18Z","Content":"I quietly walk up behind you and slit your throat before filling in the holes on the hill.\n\nMy hill."},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T21:27:30Z","Content":"![death-star-o.gif](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view6/2501847/death-star-o.gif)\n\nI then use glue to put together the planet.\n\nmy hill."},{"CreatedByName":"OdinYggd","CreatedById":26917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T21:41:33Z","Content":"You guys are being over the top again. \n\nThe hill is mine effective immediately.
