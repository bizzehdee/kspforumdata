Watching from afar, I notice how people contest over one particular hill left in the centre of a large wasteland. I grab a bone, load it into a bow and shoot up into the air. High speed winds carry the bone over to the hill, where it falls and starts rolling down the slope. A dog, who was the latest contender, runs after that bone, tumbling down the slope. Eventually, he catches it and buries it somewhere in the ruins before running off to attack another contender. I didn\u0027t get a good look at the dog, but he looked relatively small and chubby - something akin to a Corgi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith nobody guarding the hill, I sit back in a deck chair on top of my mountain, grab some popcorn and invite any defeated contenders to join me in observing the hilarity that is sure to ensue now.
