Mobile device might do 1.5GFLOPS on the CPU side and that should be a pretty fast ARM or x86 based SOC. An old i5 2500K can do 90GFLOPS with all cores. 6 core i7 can do 135GLFOPS give or take and the new Haswell can be even faster in some cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EATOM processors are relatively slow but an old Atom N270 single core hits 0.5GFLOPS. Now there are more attributes to a processor then just crunching numbers but KSP is mainly physics limited so it makes sens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor KSP to run well on a mobile device you probably need 20GFLOPS or so spreed over all cores and all cores needs to be used. So unless unity gets multithreaded you can foget it on mobiles. Maybe in 5-6 years it could be doable with faster SoC\u0027s and a new unity version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne possibility for it to makes rapid progress where to use GPGPU in a mobile device. Even the raspberry pi I believe has somewhere in the region of 25GFLOPS in its GPU but still its not a proper GPGPU even if you probably could from what I read do some more general stuff trough OpenGL ES. But this assumes that there will be a SoC with a flexible GPGPU and a new version of unity to go with that. But thats fare fetched to say the least considering how little adaption there have been for GPGPU on the PC market for normal users.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T09:47:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell first, I agree with pa1983 assessment of KSP on a mobile device, natively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a Galaxy Tablet 10.1 running Android and have installed the 2X Client RDP app. At home, I have my Windows 7 machine I can RDP into.
