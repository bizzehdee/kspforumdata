It was a trusty but primitive plane, since I\u0027m still low in the tech tree, but I had flown a couple of missions on that bird with Jeb. When I tried to reach the last objective on a contract, which was doing a crew report above 19500 m altitude, I learned that my little plane could only reach around 13000 m. So I decided to reload a quicksave (so I wouldn\u0027t have to fly half the continent back to the KSC), and suddenly... flameout!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy engines were air deprived. My air intake wasn\u0027t getting anything, even though I was at that point only at 1000m high. I tried closing and opening the intake, shutting down and turning on the engines, and nothing. And so I decided to do an emergency landing. But the plane had too little electric charge - since the engines were off and I couldn\u0027t recharge the batteries, and I still had no access to solar panels. My power went out while I was still 100m above the surface, and the plane nosedived into the ground. A couple of meters before crashing, though, Valentina bailed out of the cockpit, and bounced maniacally across the grasslands. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a smile in her face.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CelticCossack51","CreatedById":127600,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EWait, if this update is called 0.9, then that means...
