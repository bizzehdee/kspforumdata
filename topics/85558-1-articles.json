If you crash your welded ship, there\u0027s just one teeny explosion, and not the ripping-apart, multiple-explodey goodness that makes KSP crashes so awesome. This is especially let-downish during space battles, as i really like to see missiles rip through the hull of a ship and leave it as nothing more than a twisted wreck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if, instead of having the part system where every single part is just glued to another one, the entire ship was just treated as one part. when the ship collided with something else at over 7m/s or something like that, the ship would become un-welded for a short period of time, and the individual parts would bend and break as they would normally. then, when the ship senses that it is not colliding with anything, it could re-weld itself in its current position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?
