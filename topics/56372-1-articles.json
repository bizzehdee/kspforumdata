I appreciate how people don\u0027t want MP due to its extensive development time, but if it was their then I\u0027m sure people wouldn\u0027t object to having it around - it dosent inflict any drawbacks to SP\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T18:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah yeah, I know \u0022if you don\u0027t want to play it, don\u0027t play it.\u0022 I\u0027ve countered with that plenty of times myself.
