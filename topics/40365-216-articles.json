It would be nice if they also worked by attaching to the thermal nozzle / turbo-jet / rapier engine instead of intakes. This would allow compatibility with radial intakes, give design flexibility, and still be realistic as the turbo machinery shouldn\u0027t care where the intake air is cooled, as long as its cooled before it enters. It would be consistent with the rest of KSP to assume all turbo machinery is contained in the engines / nozzles. The pre-coolers could have a rated amount of intake air they can handle to prevent blatant intake spamming a few nozzles. Make the rating tied both intake air and air speed, so cooling required = airspeed x intake air. Exceeding the cooling capacity provided by the pre-coolers on the vessel would cause nozzles to overheat and explode.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFractal, any thoughts on this suggested change?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T19:40:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AerospaceME\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AerospaceME\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFractal, any thoughts on this suggested change?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, originally I thought about setting it up that way but it doesn\u0027t really make as much sense. The precooler is basically the first thing in the chain of components after the inlet, so any active inlet (i.e. not a ram intake) would contain turbomachinery that would itself melt if the intake flow weren\u0027t precooled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dc/Sabre_cycle_m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Sabre_cycle_m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to find a way of distinguishing ram intakes from other intakes but active intakes aren\u0027t actually required in KSP because all the atmospheric engines have between about 7.5x-15x (depending on altitude) as much fuel efficiency as they should compared to real life (this is in contrast to rocket engines which are generally less efficient in KSP) and if I change that too, well, I\u0027m suddenly making a huge number of changes that make all aircraft massively harder to build - I\u0027ve tested some of these changes and I was still able to build an SSTO out of stock parts but it was a genuinely difficult task that took a long time to complete.
