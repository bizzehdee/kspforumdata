Since there are lots of you guys who make videos for Youtube I thought I would ask here and maybe someone could help me with my problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, I have started recording some clips of me playing, for now mostly racing games, but I am having problems when I try to edit and render them. My workflow for now is like this: I record with GeForce Experience in my screens native 1440p resolution and 60FPS. Then I import those clips into DaVinci Resolve 15 where I edit them a bit and then render in 1080p 60FPS for upload to Youtube. However, I have a problem with audio in that audio starts to get more and more choppy as my video progresses. I have even tried putting only one clip inside the project, and it had choppy audio in preview and after rendering, while source clip has audio working just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have \u0022borrowed\u0022 a copy of Vegas Pro just to see if it was software problem and videos rendered in Vegas PRO come out as they should without any stutter in the audio. But I don\u0027t want to use illegally obtained software and I don\u0027t want to pay those amounts of money for a software that I may not want to use in the future. Resolve 15 is free and that is why it is the best option for me at the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust as a note, I don\u0027t think that my PC is not good enough. I have Ryzen 5 1600, 16GB of RAM, GTX 1070 Ti and plenty of HDD space to work with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-07T19:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried playing with different formats and codecs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry rendering into something lossless and then pull it through HandBrake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cuky","CreatedById":111755,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-07T20:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried few different formats and codecs but results are always the same. I am also trying to get as small file as possible at the end because of my poor internet connection (10Mbps download/ 0.6-0.8Mbps upload). I have tried even some lossless formats but it was just the same. Only difference being that in rendered video stuttering in audio started about 2-3 seconds later (that is in a 2 minute clip) while file size was about 100 times larger. The thing is, I have a suspicion that it is not problem with final render but with how Resolve works with my source clips. Even when I just load one clip into the timeline and try to preview it inside Resolve it is all choppy. Video plays fine, but audio is just not working\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-07T20:41:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did a little search and came across this forum discussion.

Just as some background, in real life I work in a public library where we are doing video editing etc. workshops for adults and kids. We were looking for free editors for children to use rather than starting them out with Adobe Premiere, which is quite complex. So, I spent a whole bunch of time trying to find something that would work.\u00A0 Openshot ticked all the boxes: the interface was clever, it was simple to use etc. Unfortunately, it constantly froze and crashed my system. And as I mentioned above, I run Adobe Premiere on this computer with no problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be fair, I think it was originally developed for Linux and may work much better on that OS.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving said all that, give it a try anyway.\u00A0 It may work for you.
