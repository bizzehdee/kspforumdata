Now, there are asteroids large enough to collapse into spheres. The best example of this would probably be Ceres.\n\nIf a planet or moon, meanwhile, had \u0022time to cool and solidify\u0022, it would still collapse, because there is no known material capable of withstanding the stresses necessary to maintain such an irregular structure.
