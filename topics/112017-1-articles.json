Currently, the only way to really have any idea of what your inclination is to either guestimate or know off hand what your targets inclination is and go off of the ascending/descending node differences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it would be \u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u003C/em\u003E helpful to have it listed on your trajectory, alongside your apo/periapsis.
