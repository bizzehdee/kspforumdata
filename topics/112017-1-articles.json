Currently, the only way to really have any idea of what your inclination is to either guestimate or know off hand what your targets inclination is and go off of the ascending/descending node differences.\n\nAnd it would be *extremely* helpful to have it listed on your trajectory, alongside your apo/periapsis. That would make choosing the right trajectory a bit easier for those that want or need to enter into the SOI at a specific inclination."},{"CreatedByName":"Bug_","CreatedById":140851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T09:13:47Z","Content":"I agree, there could be more information like this on your craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T06:01:15Z","Content":"Using KER and MJ, yeah, that information is indispensable"},{"CreatedByName":"DSKY","CreatedById":115470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T16:50:32Z","Content":"Give a mouse inclination, and he will ask for longitude of the ascending node.
