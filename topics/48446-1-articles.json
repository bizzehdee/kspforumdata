There exists three elements that determine the orientation of the orbital plane - The first is \u003Cstrong\u003Einclination\u003C/strong\u003E (\u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E), the second is the \u003Cstrong\u003ERight Ascension of the Ascending Node [RAAN]\u003C/strong\u003E [in your diagram it is referred to as longitude of ascending node] (capital Omega), and the third is the \u003Cstrong\u003Eargument of the periapsis\u003C/strong\u003E (lower Omega or w). These parameters are all independent from one another and are used to essentially constrain each position in the orbit to a fixed position in space - alleviating the conundrum you were alluding to by stating that Kerbin spins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the \u003Cstrong\u003Eonly\u003C/strong\u003E element that requires the Reference Direction as a parameter in its calculation is the RAAN (longitude of ascending node). That\u0027s it. The back story of the Reference Direction is that it is an \u003Cstrong\u003Earbitrarily\u003C/strong\u003E chosen convention vector in space used as an external positional reference - like the 12 on a standard clock - Why start at 12? Why not zero? Convention. (Well there\u0027s more to it than that but we\u0027ll leave it there for another time.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe calculation of the inclination of the orbit is just as you had defined in that equation, which clearly you already know. What seems to be confusing you is the determination of the sign of the resultant of that equation - due to the mathematical behavior of the arccos function it will never be a negative value - which begs your question: \u0022Where do the (-) signs come from?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer: Convention and relative positioning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us say an object is traveling in an orbit around Kerbin. Since the object is in orbit around Kerbin we define our reference plane to be the equator of Kerbin. Any point above this plane is in the positive domain, and any point below this plane is in the negative domain. It is to this plane we will measure our inclination angles. Now let us observe the object again - this time we notice that it is traveling with \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe value of this inclination has a magnitude found from that equation (0\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E \u0026lt; \u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E \u0026lt; 180\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E), but ends up having \u003Cstrong\u003ETWO\u003C/strong\u003E signs - both positive \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E negative (Take a close look on either side of the orbit, one is positive and one is negative of the same number). The orbit is divided into two halves, the ascending plane, and the descending plane separated by two nodes, the Ascending Node and Descending Node - which can be seen from the diagram in your original post. One half lies above and one half dips below the reference plane (equator) into the southern hemisphere - it is on this lower side, after the Descending Node, that you receive the negative sign. All this sign means is that your orbit has descended into the southern hemisphere or below the reference plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you might think that adding a second object would bungle all of this math and such. This is not so; the angle of inclination between \u003Cstrong\u003Etwo\u003C/strong\u003E space craft is just the difference between each of their angles of inclinations with respect to the equatorial reference plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E\u003Csub\u003Eab\u003C/sub\u003E = \u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E - \u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E = arccos(V\u003Csub\u003EaZ\u003C/sub\u003E/mag(V\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E)) - arccos(V\u003Csub\u003EbZ\u003C/sub\u003E/mag(V\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWritten this way it is clear to see how this number can easily be negative now, but note - the same number appears at the opposite side of the orbit only as a positive number. Where each appears depends on the relative positioning of the two orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summation - the polarity of the inclination angle, when written, is typically referred only as positive (0\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E \u0026lt; \u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E \u0026lt; 180\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E) - because mathematically speaking it can only be positive (unless you \u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E an imaginary number). Convention and usefulness, however, dictate that there be a distinction between whether the object is in the ascending plane or descending plane, i.e. above or below the plane of reference. This distinction becomes readily apparent in what 5thHorseman stated - it is extremely useful for inclination changes, such as the question: Thrust in which direction is going to be needed to match another object\u0027s orbital plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you see a negative number for an inclination - that means you are looking at the Descending Node (DN in game) and if your ship is near that node it means you are about to pass below the plane of reference. In the case of a targeted second object you are about to pass below the intersection of the two object\u0027s orbital planes. It is all about defining what position you are currently at in the orbit, using relative positioning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this answers most of your question because this subject is notorious for causing confusion; It all ends up being relatively simple trig and vector algebra - mixed with some strange conventional usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Nef\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T17:52:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat is not true, because the reference direction does not rotate with the planet.

There exists three elements that determine the orientation of the orbital plane - The first is \u003Cstrong\u003Einclination\u003C/strong\u003E (\u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E), the second is the \u003Cstrong\u003ERight Ascension of the Ascending Node [RAAN]\u003C/strong\u003E [in your diagram it is referred to as longitude of ascending node] (capital Omega), and the third is the \u003Cstrong\u003Eargument of the periapsis\u003C/strong\u003E (lower Omega or w). These parameters are all independent from one another and are used to essentially constrain each position in the orbit to a fixed position in space - alleviating the conundrum you were alluding to by stating that Kerbin spins.\u003Cp\u003ENow, the \u003Cstrong\u003Eonly\u003C/strong\u003E element that requires the Reference Direction as a parameter in its calculation is the RAAN (longitude of ascending node). That\u0027s it. The back story of the Reference Direction is that it is an \u003Cstrong\u003Earbitrarily\u003C/strong\u003E chosen convention vector in space used as an external positional reference - like the 12 on a standard clock - Why start at 12? Why not zero? Convention. (Well there\u0027s more to it than that but we\u0027ll leave it there for another time.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe calculation of the inclination of the orbit is just as you had defined in that equation, which clearly you already know. What seems to be confusing you is the determination of the sign of the resultant of that equation - due to the mathematical behavior of the arccos function it will never be a negative value - which begs your question: \u0022Where do the (-) signs come from?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer: Convention and relative positioning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us say an object is traveling in an orbit around Kerbin. Since the object is in orbit around Kerbin we define our reference plane to be the equator of Kerbin. Any point above this plane is in the positive domain, and any point below this plane is in the negative domain. It is to this plane we will measure our inclination angles. Now let us observe the object again - this time we notice that it is traveling with \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe value of this inclination has a magnitude found from that equation (0\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E \u0026lt; \u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E \u0026lt; 180\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E), but ends up having \u003Cstrong\u003ETWO\u003C/strong\u003E signs - both positive \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E negative (Take a close look on either side of the orbit, one is positive and one is negative of the same number). The orbit is divided into two halves, the ascending plane, and the descending plane separated by two nodes, the Ascending Node and Descending Node - which can be seen from the diagram in your original post. One half lies above and one half dips below the reference plane (equator) into the southern hemisphere - it is on this lower side, after the Descending Node, that you receive the negative sign. All this sign means is that your orbit has descended into the southern hemisphere or below the reference plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you might think that adding a second object would bungle all of this math and such. This is not so; the angle of inclination between \u003Cstrong\u003Etwo\u003C/strong\u003E space craft is just the difference between each of their angles of inclinations with respect to the equatorial reference plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E\u003Csub\u003Eab\u003C/sub\u003E = \u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E - \u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E = arccos(V\u003Csub\u003EaZ\u003C/sub\u003E/mag(V\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E)) - arccos(V\u003Csub\u003EbZ\u003C/sub\u003E/mag(V\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWritten this way it is clear to see how this number can easily be negative now, but note - the same number appears at the opposite side of the orbit only as a positive number. Where each appears depends on the relative positioning of the two orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summation - the polarity of the inclination angle, when written, is typically referred only as positive (0\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E \u0026lt; \u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E \u0026lt; 180\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E) - because mathematically speaking it can only be positive (unless you \u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E an imaginary number). Convention and usefulness, however, dictate that there be a distinction between whether the object is in the ascending plane or descending plane, i.e. above or below the plane of reference. This distinction becomes readily apparent in what 5thHorseman stated - it is extremely useful for inclination changes, such as the question: Thrust in which direction is going to be needed to match another object\u0027s orbital plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you see a negative number for an inclination - that means you are looking at the Descending Node (DN in game) and if your ship is near that node it means you are about to pass below the plane of reference. In the case of a targeted second object you are about to pass below the intersection of the two object\u0027s orbital planes. It is all about defining what position you are currently at in the orbit, using relative positioning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this answers most of your question because this subject is notorious for causing confusion; It all ends up being relatively simple trig and vector algebra - mixed with some strange conventional usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Nef\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you claiming that the orbital inclination number KSP reports isn\u0027t globally the same sign for the entire orbit? That you get a different number if you look at the ascending node versus the descending node? If that\u0027s all you meant it could have been explained a lot faster that way instead of telling me what I already knew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was operating on the belief that KSP applies the sign universally to your entire orbit, which is why it didn\u0027t make any sense to me. If it gives you a different sign depending on which node you\u0027re highlighting then my confusion entirely goes away based on that one fact alone. If that\u0027s what it does then it makes a lot more sense. I\u0027ll have a chance to try and see if this is true later tonight (not near a computer with KSP on it at the moment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was already aware that actual astronomers only use degrees from 0 to 180 for this. But KSP used negative numbers and so knowing what actual astronomers do didn\u0027t help figure out what the negative numbers meant. If the sign flips depending on which node you\u0027re looking at at the time, then it would all make sense. All orbits with a nonzero inclination will BOTH cross northward of the reference plane at some point and cross southward of it at some point. If all the negative sign that KSP gives means is that it\u0027s an alternate way of saying \u0022this is the descending node\u0022 then it\u0027s simple. If it was giving a negative sign on both the ascending and descending node, which is what I thought it would do, that was what I didn\u0027t understand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-15T20:54:28Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2013 08:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T20:48:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Specialist290\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Specialist290\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETake another look at that diagram you posted.
