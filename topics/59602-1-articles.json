Something you can throw on the rocketside to shift the CoM. Or a mod that allows you to vector the thrust statically to counter the CoL (as opposed to vectored thrust built into the game for control.) Say a tweakable on the engine that angles the thrust just a few degrees to counter the roll issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you might have to play with your thrust settings. Are you using FAR? Remember as the atmo thins, and the same thrust that got you to 50K can suddenly flip your rocket in a second. If you do not need the thrust, and your speed is good, bring down the thrust just enough to maintain acceleration. Might get you the extra needed altitude. I had a few rockets like this, that where unbalanced or had to much thrust asymmetrically that I could not power through to space, I had to micro manage my thrust thrust once I got to around 40K or so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T09:53:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight I suggest a thematic compromise?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn-Shuttle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn-Shuttle\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust slap a big booster under it, and/or disable some engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sauron","CreatedById":69931,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T14:10:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHAHAHA!
