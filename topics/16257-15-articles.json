I launch the satellite no problem, command from the pod works fine. However, once I jettison the remote command pod, I cease to be able to execute the remaining stages of the rocket (namely, the parachutes). When I attempted this with a 1-man pod (not noticing the 3-man requirement), I wasn\u0027t able to maneuver the pod whatsoever.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently remote controlled vessels have to be one-stage.
