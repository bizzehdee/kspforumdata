That could help a lot in trying to target locations to hold a series of conventions, or simultaneous conventions (live feed video conference between them all - that would be fun). How about hitting up the educational angle of KSP and looking to schools or college campuses for event hosting?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChoosing a school or college campus would be a great angle to approach this at (and kenbobo\u0027s university suggestion is a good one). It may cost less money overall to just attend an existing convention, though. Does anyone know how much it would cost to rent out a few buildings at any given university for a weekend?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Robotengineer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Robotengineer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat about having regional conventions?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving multiple regional conventions wouldn\u0027t be a bad idea at all (in fact, it would be nice to organize some of these meetups in the future). That being said, it would definitely be quite cool if there was a single convention that was considerably larger than all of the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there was a larger convention, hundreds of KSP players from around the world could meet and greet in a single building. We could organize dedicated panels for craft construction and the like, recruiting only the best of KSP players. The chances of KSP celebrities dropping by to visit would increase exponentially. We could even get a little bit of media attention, if we coordinated our efforts well enough. So having one larger-scale \u0022Kerbal-Kon\u0022 would benefit pretty much everyone involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve updated the original post, by the way.

I had tentatively decided that the KSP population of such an event would be, at most, about 500. Five hundred extra people wouldn\u0027t be too much for a medium-sized convention to accomodate, as far as I know.
