I\u0027ve unlocked four in career mode and while I understand the principle (reactor, generator, engine, odd fuel) I can\u0027t figure out which engine suits which kind of craft and what kind of use. Yes, I\u0027ve read the wiki and I can see the engine stats... they just don\u0027t mean much to me.

Take off and landing vertically? You want/need high thrust. These are all the same KSP principles... where SPECIFICALLY are you confused? Don\u0027t be afraid to ask very specific questions on here.
