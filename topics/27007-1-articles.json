I\u0027ve not started venturing to any other bodies yet. Instead I\u0027ve been focusing on rocket building just to get to orbit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I am reasonably good at that right now so now I am building a small space station in orbit to brush up on my docking and orbital interception skills!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I have a \u0022core\u0022 with two habitat modules, RCS tanks, batteries, small solar panel, just to keep it alive.
