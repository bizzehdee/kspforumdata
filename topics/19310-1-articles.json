They are such:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Large numbers of fuel tanks/stages cause HEAVY lag on launch, and the beams to keep it stable are the main reason\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Beams cause lag and fail to keep the ship stable, and oftentimes it simply explodes on the launch pad under its own weight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Keeping the ship from exploding at stage separation or on the pad, similar to item 2.

Does anyone have any tips/ideas for the design? Both use an onion-like configuration where all rockets fire at launch, and fuel pumps drive to the inner tanks making them full once the outer stages run out. Any ideas are open, I just want to get to the Mun again today.

I suspect most of your other problems arise from the requrement to make the rest of your ship proportional to that mega-lander.

Where is the fun in exploiting bugs?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond and foremost, reduce weight whenever you can. Remember that in lower g environments, you don\u0027t need as much thrust plus engines work more efficiently. From experience I can tell you that using for of the 2m half tanks with the efficency engines is overkill. I usually use the small booster ones radially mounted around the large core tank much like you already have in your single man lander. Possibly your mid engine, switch to the half tank instead of full tank. That would reduce alot of weight and help the launch considerably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird looks like you are already making use of. Fuel crossfeed. Try to avoid nonpowering engines whenever possible on launches. The outer ring of engines and their tanks should also feed towards your core orbital engines. Remember your engines are burning so much fuel per second so the faster you get to orbit, the more efficient your rocket will be. So while those outer ones timewise will run out of fuel sooner, they should, depending on weight balance, run out of fuel at a higher altitude which is really what is important. The outer tertiary ring and the secondary ring of engines if all firing together should do alot for your launch, but again, already looks like you are doing that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly is SRBs. Use those SRB engines on the ground to get that initial hit of velocity and into thinner atmosphere. I think if you removed that tertiary ring of tank and engines, replaced those with SRB it would be a considerable gain. Depending on when you are running out of fuel however, it might just need that initial speed boost at launch only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the large tanks, there really is no way around the struts, atm, the connections for the 2m parts are weak, so liberal struts are required. Also on the pad, try to use the launch stabilizers. Put them in your engines ignition stage so they launch the same time as the rocket stabilizers release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T01:47:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaggyness is caused by too many parts so sometimes it\u0027s sensible to accept a little more weight/less efficiency if it means fewer parts (1x large rocket rather than 5x aerospikes for example).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T21:35:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would go for something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EVCY8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EVCY8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s capable of putting your \u0027lander\u0027 in a circular 75km kerbin orbit and runs pretty well.

That being said, however, I have found one very stable way to accomplish it with a minimum of parts. Go on youtube and check out Scott Manleys video showing a complete minmus mission using only 8 parts or so. As you can see, that wont work in 0.16, due to the CM rescale, but try building the same idea (Command Module/SPS fuel tank/SPS engine/decoupler/3 Fuel Tanks/1st stage engine) with the big parts. Then add 3 of the 1m fuel tanks radially around the 1st stage base, add 1m engines on them, \u0026amp; crossfeed both ways, to and from the big 1st stage tank. Lastly add 3 large SRBs radially in the spaces between the small engines. Believe it or not, this design will get a 3-person CSM stack into orbit with at least 75% SPS fuel almost every time. The design sorta follows the Rocket science problem where a designer wants high-thrust, low ISP at launch, but needs lower-thrust, high ISP most of the time after Pitchover. The space shuttle took advantage of this by jettisoning its SRBs (high thrust, low ISP) before using up all fuel for the Liquid fueled main engines (lower thrust, higher ISP), but the KSP SRBs arent heavy enough to warrant a decoupler after burnout\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-19T13:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have finally gotten off my ass and worked on a light weight Muner return vessel for 0.16...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI present Selena, named after the Greek Titaness of the moon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ksp.sjwt.org/2012-08-19/screenshot11.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot11.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload at.. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.sjwt.org/2012-08-19/Selene%20MkI.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESelena MkI\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a tutorial in how to fly to the mun and back on the cheep, check this video out.. a little out of date, but thats how I got this there and back again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022KSP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzEEcNnBxqM#ws\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtra instructions..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is rather close on the fuel, and my placement of the parachute did not help, when landing, you need to slowly burn the remaining of your fuel once you are bellow 1k and above 500 to get your speed down, or the parachute will be ripped off.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would consider adding boosters to relieve some of the fuel.!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
