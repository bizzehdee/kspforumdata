I am currently at\u00A0rescuing\u00A0kerbals from a low munar orbit and while I\u0027m messing around with maneuver nodes, I\u0027m\u00A0am not able to click\u00A0on anything. I try pressing B\u00A0to fix the nodes and its not activating.\u00A0The same with checking parts on the craft\u00A0with the\u00A0B button. After this point I closed the game and reloaded\u00A0it. It reverted to a save before I\u00A0built the craft and lost the save and the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what I think. I may be wrong. When the game doesn\u0027t allow you to activate a UI menu for the parts, gadgets, and maneuver nodes\u00A0in the game,\u00A0it is at a point of no return\u00A0and either crashes, or you are forced to quit the game. As far as I know, I am not able to eyeball orbit changes and not be able to do science. PLEASE fix this...it\u0027s beyond game breaking at this point\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: My situation with the save bug and what I think can help fix it...it\u0027s a stretch but it may help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S...where do I send a bug report? just made this account literally 10 minutes ago\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-25T12:15:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe official bugtracker is here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/projects/ksp/issues\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/projects/ksp/issues\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T22:20:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are reporting an issue it is absolutely vital that you provide as much information as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescribe the situation in detail and provide steps to reproduce the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReports that say \u0022This happened\u0022 do not help and likely cannot be fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
