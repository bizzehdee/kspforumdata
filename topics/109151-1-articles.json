This is not how it works in reality.\n\nSo they changed the model so that it accurately reflects how rockets work. In high pressure environments, thrust is decreased. At Eve, with 5 atmospheres of pressure at sea level this results in many engines being almost, or even completely, useless.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T14:00:55Z","Content":"So much for my dreams of ion-gliding from Eve sea level to orbit ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T14:02:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, I build a ship that should have a takeoff TWR from Eve of about 2.0 (about 4.0 on Kerbin).
