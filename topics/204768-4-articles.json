Anything that requires a Kerbal to do (or reset), or is sample based should be more science points. That way if you send a probe you can do lots of biomes/situations with transmissions, but in total that\u0027d only be about third of the total possible science somewhere (eg. Duna), so you have have a probe with return to get third more, and send a Kerbal to get the last third (roughly). That way the repetition is not tediously doing the same thing, but a different kind of mission/build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MoeKitsune","CreatedById":127670,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-25T07:11:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224058870\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204768\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221637770681\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CessnaSkyhawk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, CessnaSkyhawk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a question for people that will help me decide science balance.

Now that science balance is partially complete, the tree is at the point where the main focus switches from functionality and mod support to worrying about balance of tech levels, science experiments, and the like. There are certainly still plenty of bees, and a lot of things remain unfinished (Localization and UI in particularly still require quite a bit of work, and will likely produce some harmless errors in the log), but at this point, theoretically, one should be able to actually use the tree in real saves. I\u0027ve only corrected science modifiers for Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmus so far, as I\u0027m planning to use the response from this first beta to get an idea how things should be set over all. Things are definitely not fully balanced yet, and there\u0027s already a few big changes I know I need to make, but I figure it\u0027s about time to see how the rest of the KSP community thinks of it so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#24292f;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nAs of this point, the tech tree requires the following mods as hard dependencies:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#24292f;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nB9PartSwitch\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBluedog Design Bureau (and all of its dependencies)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCommunity Resource Pack\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nModule Manager\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nScience Param Editor\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStock KSP (kinda a given, but better safe than sorry \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#24292f;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nI also highly recommend Rational Resources in order to get the full functionality of tank switching, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, and some custom fuel cells. Aside from that, check out the Mod Support tab on the github Issues page to see the current list of mods supported - if it has a check, next to it, it should work. I wouldn\u0027t recommend going all in with every single one (trust me, I did, and while it works fine, it takes forever to load), but instead just to select a few. IMO some of the better options are all of Nertea\u0027s mods, Coatl Aerospace, AirplanePlus, Kerbal Planetary Base System, reDirect, and Tundra Exploration, but that\u0027s only a small selection of the available options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#24292f;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nIf you are testing the beta, and notice some errors, please feel free to open an issue on this repository to let me know what you\u0027ve found. For any balance issues or comments, I\u0027ll make one specific issue thread where we can discuss, or you are also welcome to just make a comment on the KSP forums as well - either way is fine by me!

One of my big concerns about KTT was\u00A0that at least for me, it seemed like there were too many moving parts because of all the upgrades and that led to a bunch of funky interactions and bugs that were hard to work around. Aside from that, I just felt like a decent portion of the upgrades really didn\u2019t generate the interesting decisions that they seemed like they were suppose to, as the new ones were always typically better in nearly every way. \u00A0It also just got a little overwhelming at times IMO. That\u2019s\u00A0why with SSS I focus more on things like the hypergolic fuels instead. I feel like it\u2019s more interesting to have to make a decision between fuel types, but at the same time I try to keep it very simple by only having one (technically two for cyro with H2 and CH4, but I digress) fuel type for each class, as it keeps things straightforward while still adding an interesting and realistic\u00A0dynamic to your rocket designs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224064957\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204768\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221639432242\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127670\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MoeKitsune\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, MoeKitsune said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 more things I found out that might need some tweaking: The communications satellite science experiment uses a lot of power to transmit, and for at least one BDB probe it can\u0027t fully transmit the data without extra batteries or maybe another antenna.

I\u2019m trying my best tho - Ik you all are excited, so I don\u2019t want to keep y\u2019all waiting too long\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-12-14T06:21:53Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2021 06:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by CessnaSkyhawk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kwebib","CreatedById":187180,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-14T17:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I never felt like the engine upgrades added much because I didn\u0027t use OhScrap.

You\u0027d start by getting all the engines for a given radial size, along with the smallest fuel tank for it first, and then get progressively larger tanks as you increased tech tiers. While it makes sense from some gameplay balance perspectives,\u00A0 I feel that from a realism point of view it doesn\u0027t make much sense in encouraging realistic rocketry. In the real world, it seems like rocket diameters tended to grow first on larger lower stages, and then the upper stages would follow as the lower stages get more capable (eg Atlas went from Atlas-Agena to Atlas-Centaur). Plus, in most cases, as the mass and fuel ratios are constant, one large tank is the same as multiple small tanks, except that the one large tank is less resource intensive PC-wise than the many small ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigyihsuan","CreatedById":29291,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-15T19:27:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just spent like an hour writing Python code to parse and convert the tech tree nodes file into Mermaid code for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the code:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://gist.github.com/bigyihsuan/03d2a2b6a930dbf91198f66fee96d836\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://gist.github.com/bigyihsuan/03d2a2b6a930dbf91198f66fee96d836\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this is\u00A0 for trying to figure where these upgrades would go, but that would mean needing to\u00A0spin up a new KSP install with nothing but this, its dependencies, and PF/PP \u002B dependencies and examining the tree in-game and noting where these upgrades should go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFun.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I\u0027ve made a pull request for Procedural Parts/Fairings support.
