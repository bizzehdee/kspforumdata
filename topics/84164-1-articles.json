Something like 50 m/s would be plenty. Downside to this of course is no more EVA-only landings on small moons. On the bright side, it would provide more reason to construct tiny adorable single-crew rocket hopper vehicles for long-distance travel.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELife support\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssential, I feel. Long-duration survival in space is a challenge that space agencies even today are still having a bit of trouble with. I don\u0027t think KSP should be an exception - it adds a lot of depth to the game,and makes manned interplanetary travel much more of an achievement. It also inherently gives unmanned missions more of a purpose, as robots are much quieter than the annoying Kerbals demanding snacks/water/personal space all the time. I feel this would work as a difficulty option for when you start a new game though - I understand the opinion of simply not wanting to deal with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReentry damage\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar points to life support. Adds a greater challenge to maneuvers such as aerocapture, right now it\u0027s almost trivially easy to enter orbit around a planet with atmosphere since only with absurd trajectories do you risk damage to your ship (usually from twirling around as the atmosphere hits your ship). Having to bring along heat shields and backshells and the like also has the bonus of making EDL sequences a hundred times cooler as you jettison away all of the used equipment. However, I think this should also be a new game option, like life support, for the same reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-09T01:24:33Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2014 01:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NovaSilisko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T01:09:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp is pretty realistic, weights and TWR is not, again I don\u0027t really see the problem, see previous point, same with 0.1-100% throttle this can be solved with better modeling so we can add extra engines who is used for low trust, this is not uncommon on boats \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell the issue with \u0022Isp\u0022 re: realism isn\u0027t the values (although I would dearly like to see them buffed on the MK55/24-77 radial engines, but that\u0027s a discussion for another thread), but rather that when you\u0027re using atmospheric Isp, fuel consumption goes up and thrust remains the same, instead of having constant consumption with less thrust (as is the case in reality for rocket engines).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lincourtl","CreatedById":72218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T01:21:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stealth2668\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stealth2668\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m against total realism, since it will complicate things too much.
