For example, the Apollo crews were trained extensively in the operation of the guidance computer. They loaded specific programs and parameters during flight to control the attitude, transfer and orbital parameters. If they (and more importantly Mission Control) agreed with what the computer indicated, the pushed the PROCEED button not a control stick. If necessary, they could have flown the mission autonomously (however Mission Control would not have been pleased). The experience to achieve this was not solely based on a specific individual but rather on the collective intelligence and capability of the entire extended Space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, nearly ALL space missions are flown autonomously with few exceptions.

If the KGNU (Kerbal Guidance and Navigation Unit) failed (and the backup KGNU failed also) then a well trained Kerbal could control the attitude and orbit to complete the mission.

Isp, Thrust, Torque, etc, should only be affected by how well you build the part, not who you crew it with. I\u0027m totally on board with ideas like better collection/transmission of science, lab work, reputation gains/losses, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not quite sure how I feel about the version number jumping all the way to 0.90.0 given that it implies relatively few beta releases before the big 1.0. While I realize that it is always possible to go 0.10x.x, the perception is that 0.99.x is the penultimate release. If you were to go to 0.75 or similar, it would still be a big jump, but leave much more room before that perception hits.

I\u0027d be pumped if FAR-like structural failures were added as an option. I share others thoughts that re-entry heat (and heatshields), Isp affecting thrust instead of fuel consumption, and some form of life support would be good candidates for addition to stock.
