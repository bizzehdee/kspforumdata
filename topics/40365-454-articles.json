So as of now, KSPI is incompatible with MKS, Karbonite, or any of the USI mods that use resources and ORS. IMO the ideal end-game would be to have ORS stand on it\u0027s own with no dependencies, have the ORS resources stand on their own (we already do this with CRP), and then just have everyone share the same dependency and the same resource structure, This is a pretty important thing to me as I am already looking at extending interop to other mods, but need a really strong foundation that embraces the idea of a common resource pool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T23:17:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has probably been a feature of WaveFunctionP\u0027s version for some time but this is part of a larger change that hopefully demonstrates the better Reactor system I\u0027m putting in place for the new version.

Since I haven\u0027t really played 0.24 very much, I don\u0027t really have much understanding of how well this is going to work yet so my effort to derive them so far is based around very estimated real world costs of each resource converted into Kerbal money (I\u0027ve vaguely assumed that 1 unit of Kerbal money = 1000 Euros, mainly because it was easiest to find some of the material costs in Euros).
