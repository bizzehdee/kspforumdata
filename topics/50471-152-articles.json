Assuming you are using the realism-enhancing mods and aim to simply get into LEO, then the answer is: you shouldn\u0027t have a \u0022circularization burn\u0022, because generally there should be only a few seconds of \u0022coasting\u0022 between first stage burnout and second stage ignition on a properly designed and piloted rocket. There are exceptions, such as getting into GEO, or using mismatched hardware for cost-cutting purposes (like the ICBM-derived rockets of the 1950s) but generally the rocket should be under near-constant thrust from liftoff until target orbit is achieved. TWR 1.4 on takeoff is high, if you mean sea-level TWR; personally I usually aim for a TWR of 1.2 on takeoff, that provides just about perfect amount of acceleration to avoid exceeding terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-08T09:06:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2014 09:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hattivat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Einserting quote for clarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T09:09:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mecki\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mecki\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you!
