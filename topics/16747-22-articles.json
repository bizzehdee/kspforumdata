It still looks wonderful, it flys like a dream, its very well balanced, and again its just very well done. I can\u0027t say good enough things about it. The rocket is of quality rarely seen and it is a shame nothing else has come out of Horizon Aeronautics. Still I would rather have just this one amazing thing than nothing at all.
