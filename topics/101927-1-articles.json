Now you can...\n\n**Main features**\n\n- KAS inventory system overhaul.\n- Visual and user friendly inventory interface using drag and drop system.\n- Unique EVA usable items as Screwdriver, Explosive charges or extra EVA fuel tank...\n- Inventories for Kerbals.\n- Stock alike containers and parts.\n- Containers Mounts for easy container detachment and reattachment.\n- Item stacking.\n- Sounds effects.\n- Clear code and .cfg modules to help other modders items creation.\n- Standalone (KAS and ModuleManager is not needed).\n\n![JQWNx75.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JQWNx75.jpg)\n\n**[REMOVED]** \n\n**Notes to KAS users**\n\nAs KIS is a standalone mod, it is fully compatible with KAS. \n\nHowever, to avoid conflict with the grab key (G), We recommend to change this key in the settings.cfg of KAS (or KIS) to something else.\n\nWe also recommend users to start moving parts from their KAS containers to the new KIS containers, as for the next version of KAS, we will remove the old containers system of KAS and use KIS instead.\n\nThis can be done without any file editing : \n\n- Send ship with the new KIS containers at your different KAS container(s) location(s)\n- Take all parts from the KAS container, drop them on the ground\n- Drag and drop all part on the ground in the new KIS containers\n- Detach all KAS containers and mounts from ships (use the wrench or the screwdriver for the mounts)\n- Let them alone on the ground or in orbit (to avoid vessel removal after KAS update because of a missing part)\n- (Optional) Remove the folder container1, container2 and containerBay1 from KAS directory to remove this parts from the game\n- (Optional) Destroy all the KAS containers and mount with new KIS explosives ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Items pack**\n\nYou can download an extra items pack for KIS. This item pack is for fun and to show the capabilities of KIS.\n\nDon\u0027t hesitate to take a look on the wiki to see what you can do with KIS. KIS is pretty moddable and you can create your own items easly !\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/Py7Y3Tx.png](%5D%5Bimg)\n\n**Planned** \n\n- 2.5m and 3.75m containers \u002B mounts for bigger parts.\n- Inline containers for IVA containers content transfer.\n- Stack attach with snap\n- Container renaming\n- Items improvements\n- New items\n- And more...\n\n**Useful Links**\n\n[Wiki](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/wiki) (See the wiki for more information on KIS : how to, version history, modding guide, etc...)\n\n**[REMOVED]**\n\n**Authors**\n\nKospy : Plugin design and development, C# coding.\n\nWinn75 : Graphic design, 3D Models and textures.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T19:54:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 07:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"GabrielG.A.B.Fonseca","CreatedById":13436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T19:07:18Z","Content":"This is the most interesting mod to appear in quite some time.
