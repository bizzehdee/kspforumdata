Was very happy once i got the cargo doors working but that surprisingly was the easy part. The take off style i wanted to do took the most work. It can be fiddly but worth it once you get it working its worth it. It has a medium docking port as that\u0027s the main universal port for ship docking with stations and has enough fuel to either drop off cargo in orbit and return or do a meet up but it will need fuel to return after a meet up unless your really good with RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5Lgb-iuYpw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShuttle with probe ship zip file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71077397/Shuttle%20-%20with%20probe.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71077397/Shuttle%20-%20with%20probe.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShuttle with probe ship rar file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71077397/Shuttle%20-%20with%20probe.rar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71077397/Shuttle%20-%20with%20probe.rar\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas for improvements are welcome\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch instructions: (These are in the ship description but i added them here just in-case)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines are set to correct thrust for take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore take off lock in SAS, Activate RCS and press command group 3 twice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen down to main fule tank and shuttle RAPIER thrustes will need to be increased as the center of waight moves and the Skipper and LV-T30 furthest from shuttle will need to be lowered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAPIER: 80%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkipper/LV-T30: eventually 0%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMPORTANT: Once in orbit do not forget to fill the liquid fule tank from the left overs of the main tank for re-entry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-Entry:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should be enough fule left over to lower orbit so you re-enter.
