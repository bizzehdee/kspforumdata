Had this problem myself yesterday but with the medium wheels. Just had a look and on medium wheels you can turn off auto steering adjust that sorted it. Can\u0027t find that option on the XL3. Probably worth filling out a bug report. Maybe they will add the auto steering adjust setting to these too.The medium wheels can take a fair bit of weight. I made a 600 \u002B part bus ( in the craft exchange) on four of them and manually adjusted the suspension settings. That came in at 360\u002B tons if that\u0027s any help. Sorry I can\u0027t be of any more help\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-10T14:36:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2023 02:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 10\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Madishmike\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
