In my latest career mode game I decided to go with a mission style that is fairly similar to an \u0022Apollo Style Mission\u0022 (Munar Orbital Rendezvous). I have a separate Munar lander and Trans-Munar command/service module, except I took it a step further and built a separately launched re-entry vehicle for returning the crew from LKO, such that the CSM and lander stay in LKO and can be reused for future missions after orbital refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you build a direct-ascent style mission whereby your actual Mun lander comes all the way back to Kerbin, you get science point for \u0022recovering a ship from Mun\u0027s surface\u0022 and from \u0022recovering a ship from low Mun orbit.\u0022 But in my case where I use this separate ferry craft to re-enter Kerbin (transferring the science experiments and surface samples via EVA), that ferry craft never went to the Mun, and so I only get points for \u0022recovering a craft from low Kerbin orbit\u0022 or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis unfortunately encourages you to build direct-ascent rockets. I don\u0027t want these unrealistic all-in-one designs where my Mun lander has parachutes for Kerbin re-entry, and uses the black MK-1 Command Pod (with its poor cockpit visibility) because the Landing Can says it is unable to survive atmospheric re-entry. Although I know re-entry destruction is not implemented yet, role playing is part of the fun. Could I suggest giving points for \u0022safely returning a Kerbal from xxx\u0027s surface/orbit\u0022 instead of tying it to the craft that did the orbiting and/or landing? For unmanned probes you could award points for returning the guidance unit since these obviously don\u0027t swap from lander to CSM, etc. like Kerbalnauts do. What do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T02:28:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree.
