So many shots have been ruined by the fact that I have to wait for it to disappear on it\u0027s own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s not that important, and it may not be possible, but it would be of great use to me, and I think it would also make more sense than if it stayed there. I hope I\u0027m not the only one who this annoys, and in all honesty it doesn\u0027t really affect the game much, but I probably speak for everyone who makes cinematics (not very many people) when I say that it\u0027s quite annoying at times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlazingAngel665","CreatedById":30182,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T19:39:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a person who has tried to make a cinematic in KSP, I fully support this idea!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
