If you try this out, please do let me know how it works for you. Changes made:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Streamlined spacedock identification and vessel mass calculation. Spacedock identification is now automatic--no more \u0022scan for docks\u0022 button to click. Spacedocks that don\u0027t have enough RocketParts to build the dry mass (hull) of the vessel are not listed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Updated the method for checking RocketParts availability. Previously, two docked vessels with warehouses (only one of which has a spacedock) could not both contribute their RocketParts during a construction event. Only the parts in the warehouse originally attached to the spacedock\u0027s vessel were detected and available. This limitation is now gone--multiple docked warehouses can act as one giant warehouse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The assembly is now named OrbitalConstruction.dll instead of KerbalTestOne.dll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Kerbals are automatically removed from a vessel before it is built at the spacedock. It just doesn\u0027t make sense to have Kerbals being built along with their craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Swiped the GUI (with a few tweaks) from Extraplanetary Launchpads, including the logic to require specific resources for building a vessel. The days of building fuel, monopropellant, etc out of RocketParts are gone. If you don\u0027t have the resources at your dock, don\u0027t worry! You can always build with empty tanks and send up some fuel (or whatever you\u0027re missing) later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone who wants to test this is welcome to try: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/yxu2kirmdmeyedf/OrbitalConstruction.dll\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edownload the dll here\u003C/a\u003E.

Also, in 0.22 it sometimes didn\u0027t come back with any results, even though I had two spacedocks floating around out there. As best I can tell, this behavior occurred because the scan function actually loaded each vessel in the FlightGlobals structure, checked over the parts, and then allowed them to unload automatically due to the large distance from the active vessel. The debug log seemed to indicate that my KAS-enabled ships on the Mun didn\u0027t like loading up, having the physics start, and unloading again in such rapid succession, and somehow the scan for spacedocks aborted when it got to these vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fixed the problem by doing the scan using the ProtoPartSnapshot class, which allows me to scan all vessels without loading a single one.

My thoughts on the simplest way to get going is to create two classes of manufacturing plant: a starter part that can be launched (with effort, of course, it should still be enormous, say 5m dia x 12m long in its launch configuration) into orbit and which will only be capable of constructing parts for the large modular manufacturing center. No general-purpose construction will be allowed with the smaller dock. I also had an idea for the longer-term, and I\u0027m not really sure if it can be done, but it\u0027s fun to think about: a procedural orbital dock. DYJ\u0027s code for the procedural wings is not too complex (could use more comments, but then so could mine). For this system, we could add a \u0022Grow Dock\u0022 button to the context menu, and provided enough resources are available the dock would expand itself to the next size up. Come to think of it, procedural parts aren\u0027t even needed here: just a set of different sized dock parts, only the smallest of which is launch-able. Click \u0022grow,\u0022 and the dock will replace itself with the next available size. The largest size, of course, can still be expanded using additional pieces a la your ideas, above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy starting point will be to take ExLaunchpad\u0027s interface and rework the build/launch code to incorporate the appropriate transform to build a set distance from the dock (say, 5m) in the correct orientation (VAB craft are easy, SPH not so simple). I\u0027ll then tackle the trigger collider, and finally work on logic for a modular system. Before any of this, I want to get my current OC update polished off (another day or two, depending on free time). I\u0027ll set up a repository for the project and send you a link.

Let\u0027s say there is a modestly sized core module, but it checks whether it has certain auxiliary parts connected to it if you want it to work. Component parts of the dock piece can have the docking port modules with a certain unique designation, and can be shaped in a way which prevents them from being docked from an unintended angle (kinda like ports on the PC), so it will be hard to assemble the whole thing in a wrong or cheaty way too (like slapping the parts randomly around some station).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, you can assemble it in the editor and launch it together, if you can manage to build a vehicle capable of lifting the ridiculous full weight in one go (and if you don\u0027t play with FAR where lifting something shaped like that is not the brightest idea), but it would be fun to make preparations an interesting exercise in docking and delivery of various payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;img snip!\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother, implementation of this would be to have core parts of a different radius which have some initial space they are certified to build within, and which you can expand in length by docking the additional modular pieces to the front of them. That\u0027s more simple to implement too, I guess. Attach a piece, get \u002B20m to allowed length on the bounding box check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;img snip!\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile excellent suggestions, the second idea constrains you to size limitations. What if I want to build something outside of three meters wide or five meters in height? Then neither of those structures would work. Or I want to fabricate a station in-situ? Then this becomes an issue. Why not something along the lines of starting with a functional core, but to build larger ships you need to shuttle Spare Parts to orbital dry dock to expand it? That way, you have to build that and man it and maintain it before you can build monstrosities, and it falls inline with how the mod has worked in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022attosecond\u0022 data-cite=\u0022attosecond\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe trouble with SPH craft (and some stranger VAB craft I\u0027ve built) is that \u0022up\u0022 is not necessarily the same as the pointy end, if there even is a pointy end.

There already isn\u0027t much to do in the game, so reducing space dock management to delivering completely identical part containers countless times, just like with ship components, is not a very interesting solution. It\u0027s best when a system in the game delivers some varied and interesting challenges, which, in this case, would be do design, launch and dock the payloads with the space station components of varied shape and size, - that will occupy the players nicely, making a large operational orbital dock a very satisfying achievement in itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of which, I don\u0027t think spacecraft construction should be necessarily done with just one resource. Artificially inflating the micromanagement by introducing several faceless types of resources like metal and ceramics is unnecessary, but there are several logical improvements that can be done there: for example, all crafts assembled in the orbit should start with no fuel (and should remove appropriate amount of fuel from the dock to fill them, if the dock has fuel tanks attached) and no crew, which will serve as another interesting opportunity to build service ships like crew delivery vehicles (like efficient spaceplanes) and fuel tankers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, orbital construction is the opportunity to give players lots of interesting activities and reasons to design cool crafts - it shouldn\u0027t be HyperEdit in a disguise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-30T17:22:38Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2013 05:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by bac9\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"attosecond","CreatedById":79130,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T17:23:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bac9\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bac9\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESpeaking of which, I don\u0027t think spacecraft construction can be necessarily done with just one resource.
