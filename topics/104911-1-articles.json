My mods are only part packs basically, but they are expecting a module from Nyrath\u0027s mod, and I fully expect that to be horribly broken. Plus, for parts, there\u0027s going to be some rejuggling for the aero and heat systems that 0.90 parts won\u0027t know anything about. Currently parts subject to heat (Engines) have an animation of emissive material values to show heat that\u0027s intrinsically ties to the part model, which suggests the question; do all parts now need that, or do none?\n\nI heard via a distant grapevine that texture formats will be changing as well.\n\nIt\u0027d be nice to know. Or, of course, I could drink some beer, read that book by Dyson, and relax until 1.0 arrives. mmm.... beer...."},{"CreatedByName":"touzenesmy","CreatedById":119464,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T06:49:09Z","Content":"It would be very helpful if squard give some communication about changes to help the modders preparing their mods updates"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T09:20:28Z","Content":"DDS textures will be officially supported, so basically like using DDS loader now. I hear directx11 is working much, much better as well.\n\nYes, re-balance to parts and that heat tolerance number becomes very important. There may be other changes and values that were nothing that take on importance now (kind of like cost didn\u0027t matter until funds happened). Pretty sure that will all be handled by config.\n\nIt seems from the preview videos that a lot of the heat effects are being handled by shaders (look at the post from the squad cast this week showing off the new heat shields and using a shader to darken them as they lose ablation material)."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T19:09:55Z","Content":"I have heard no such thing regarding DX11.
