Anyway I had a textbook mission so far to Jool and Laythe landing, and now I attempted Tylo. Since playing this game religiously since May of this year, I\u0027ve crashed every ship sent to Tylo until today! I built a craft using the ALCOR lander (although the rast prop monitors bugged out for some reason this made it difficult to tell my radar altitude) but everything else went fine. I created the ship using five poodle engines with ejectable fuel tanks to lower mass for the landing on this gravitational monster of a moon. I did a test flight on the Mun just to see how the ship maneuvered. It\u0027s a little slugish maneuvering at first but with the fuel tanks ejected one by one the ship runs great. There is about 1/3 of fuel left in the outer tanks right now and the ship is now landed on Tylo! The ship is also going to be reused on Vall, Bop, and Pol using the central poodle engine.

Next will be Bop and Pol, and hopefully I will have enough fuel to return home afterwards! I still probably have at least 15,000 tons of fuel on board, but most of my expendable fuel tanks on my main carrier are gone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as Tylo goes, I built a ship capable of roughly 7,000 m/s capability of Delta V. This was based off the numbers Scott Manley\u0027s lander had. Now, let\u0027s talk engines. Duban, you were mentioning the Rockomax 48-7. That is a great design you came up with. That is personally one of my favorite engines in the game and I built my mun lander out of that as well as a few others. With that being said, I had many concerns over using that particular engine for Tylo. I\u0027m not a math guru, but I did some calculations. Descent on a curve starting from 24k kilometers above the surface starting at a speed of roughly 2,200 m/s in orbit, I was afraid that those tiny rockomax engines would not slow down enough by the time I needed to land at an altitude of at least 2,000 meters above sea level. I went with the next tier in terms of ISP efficient engines, the Poodle engines. I built and tested my lander on Kerbin. I figured because the gravitational force is very similar, if Kerbin worked out then Tylo should, and the Poodle engines seemed most efficient. Not to mention, a long time ago I built a skycrane that dropped a manned rover on Moho similar to the curiosity rover out of four poodle engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rockomax is an interesting idea, perhaps I will try that for the next design. As part of the challenge however, I wanted to bring as much science with me including a goo container and science module, so that might make it more difficult with a rockomax engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cmdr.
