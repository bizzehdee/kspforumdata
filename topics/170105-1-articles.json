I have a stock a like Falcon 9 that I am really proud of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever... I can\u0027t seem to determin the best and most effecient way to burn back to the launch pad. I find that I have to sacrifice so much Stage 1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E that it makes the 1st stage less useful to orbit, it leaves too much work to the second stage. I wonder what the most effecient was of burning back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is in your opinions? In order to get an efficient enough flight I have to burn at a shallow angle, but that means loads more horizontal velocity to burn back on to reverse my course to the space centre. I have a landing site on the island to the North West of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E which is perfectly placed for this type of launch, though its still pretty close and I would love to hear your thoughts.
