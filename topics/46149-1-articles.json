For the first couple of stages, there can be enough oscillation to make it hard to complete the gravity turn accurately, or even cause the ship to rip itself apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to use EAS-4 Strut Connectors in my design to add rigidity to the structure. But I have run into problems where the very pieces I\u0027m trying to tie together, will refuse to tie together. When I place the end of the strut connector (the second click), the endpoint snaps back to a spot very near the start point. It\u0027s as if the construction system doesn\u0027t allow me to tie pieces that are separated by two seams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, maybe I want to use a strut connector to tie two stacked stages together to make them more rigid. I try to tie the fuel tank on top to the fuel tank below it. It won\u0027t let me, possibly because there\u0027s an engine and a stack separator between them. I can tie the stack separator to the fuel tank below it, but my rocket still bends and wobbles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I doing wrong?

Anything much over that is overkill and is more parts than you need. However, look at how you\u0027re placing the start point. If you place it in some places, where it is clearly above the surface of the part, it, for some reason, will not connect. For another, equally weird reason, putting the initial anchor \u003Cem\u003Ebelow\u003C/em\u003E the surface of the tank, decoupler, part, whatever you\u0027re connecting it from will often get it to work just fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have to rotate them about the central axis a ways, as some positions simply aren\u0027t friendly. I believe this may have something to do with the \u0022collider\u0022 meshes not lining up perfectly (read: having lower polygon counts) with the actual visual models you see, so some points are slightly below and some are directly on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere..

Never thought of that.

For some reason even tough it preserved the struts (even after loading and going back to hangar) they acted as there were no strut at all. Every time i used the subassembly i then removed all the struts and placed the struts on the same place all over again and such oscillations on the boosters stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETough indeed in this case you exemplified putting struts directly between boosters would reduce their wobbliness, just putting a couple of regular struts connecting directly to the main tank would have the same effect and be even more firmer still, so in this case wouldn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t help much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point was about that struts is about optimal placement, quantity doesn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t help.
