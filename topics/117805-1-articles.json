I\u0027ll point you to two different posts from the same thread regarding early science strategies: one from [Streetwind](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130202-What-are-some-good-strategies-to-most-quickly-get-through-the-grindy-part-of-career-mode?p=2110403\u0026viewfull=1#post2110403) and the other by [Geshosskopf](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130202-What-are-some-good-strategies-to-most-quickly-get-through-the-grindy-part-of-career-mode?p=2110616\u0026viewfull=1#post2110616). In your case, pay particular attention to Geschosskopf\u0027s advice; he\u0027s been kicking butt on the science-gathering front since 0.22 (i.e. the beginning). That low-tech run? I\u0027m following their advice and I can tell you right now their strategies work (I\u0027d only add that you should level up Mission Control prior to step #7 of Streetwind\u0027s strategy, and that only because it\u0027s necessary to do what he suggests doing...).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T20:11:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 08:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T18:37:12Z","Content":"How about this ?\n\n![1438463830-2015-08-01-00014.jpg](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2015/31/1438463830-2015-08-01-00014.jpg)\n\nThe boosters are equipped with LV-T30, the main stage with LV-T45 and the lander with an LV-909."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T20:58:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How about this ?\n\nSlight design change - on the lander itself (S2 in the pic above), I\u0027d recommend replacing one of the FL-T400 tanks with a quad of radially attached FL-T100 tanks, and I\u0027d recommend two or three of the little mini lander legs attached to each FL-T100; this will shorten and widen out the lander\u0027s base. If you try to land that design on the Mun as is, it\u0027s almost certainly going to tip. You\u0027ll have to manually pump fuel from the outer tanks when the center runs out of fuel; that\u0027s the main problem with the radial tank idea (and it\u0027d be particularly bad if the center tank ran out of gas during......say, landing).

Grab science opportunistically while your there, but the most effective target for a dedicated science grabbing mission is Minmus as its much easier to land on due to gravity and the flats biomes freeing up fuel for more payload and more biome hopping.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Any help appreciated.

Thnx for all the help guys.\n\nYeah, you can do a lot in a low orbit over an airless body. Is your astronaut facility upgraded to the point that you can do EVAs? If so, that opens up a wealth of science options. Send a capsule to orbit the Mun or Minmus, make sure its orbit is low but not enough to crash into anything, then just wait to drift over distinct biomes. Have your crew go EVA, take an EVA report, get back inside. If you have electricity generation and an antenna, you can send the results back right away with no loss, otherwise you can get it back when you return. Make a few incremental inclination adjustments and drift over a whole new set of biomes. That will rack up a ton of science without ever actually having to land. \n\nIncidentally, I find Minmus easier to reach, land on, and escape from, than I do the Mun. The lower gravity makes landings much more forgiving than the Mun and getting back to Kerbin is much easier. If you are not confident in your lander (lack of fuel transferring or safe landing gear,) that might be a better place to start."}]}
