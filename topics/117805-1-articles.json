Is your astronaut facility upgraded to the point that you can do EVAs? If so, that opens up a wealth of science options. Send a capsule to orbit the Mun or Minmus, make sure its orbit is low but not enough to crash into anything, then just wait to drift over distinct biomes. Have your crew go EVA, take an EVA report, get back inside. If you have electricity generation and an antenna, you can send the results back right away with no loss, otherwise you can get it back when you return. Make a few incremental inclination adjustments and drift over a whole new set of biomes. That will rack up a ton of science without ever actually having to land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, I find Minmus easier to reach, land on, and escape from, than I do the Mun. The lower gravity makes landings much more forgiving than the Mun and getting back to Kerbin is much easier. If you are not confident in your lander (lack of fuel transferring or safe landing gear,) that might be a better place to start.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
