I\u0027m the Synthetic Flying Machine and I\u0027m new.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently got back into Kerbal Space Program and just rocket science in general. I used to play it around a year ago just for fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t do anything but build random stuff and crash. I doubt I even got into space more than twice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now that I\u0027ve started playing it and actually gotten interested I\u0027ve been trying to find good places to learn stuff about the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve learned how to get into orbit using maneuvers from Scott Manley\u0027s tutorials but his tutorials don\u0027t seem to really go in depth about things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like he just expects you to know a lot of what he\u0027s talking about and me being the ultra beginner I am, don\u0027t \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI literally just before making this forum account started reading The Missing Manual Volume 1. I can\u0027t say much about it because I\u0027ve read about 1 sentence but hopefully it explains things little farther.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone knows any other good tutorials that could help out someone that can barely make a good orbit, please reply with them. That would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell thanks for reading \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volcanix","CreatedById":117245,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T18:43:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey there and welcome to the KSP Forum!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a tutorial that might help you (it also helped me learning the game) to learn the game, basic maneuvers, rocket construction etc. Look in my signature, it\u0027s called \u0022Exploring the System - a design tutorial campaign\u0022 written by Pecan.
