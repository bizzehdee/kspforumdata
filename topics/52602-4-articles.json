If build time were implemented in career mode, without the option to turn it off, it could prove to be cumbersome enough to some players to avoid career mode altogether at the least, or the entire game at the worst, which would be an absolute shame after seeing what kind of incredible following it has been generating so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: I think there\u0027s an angle here for NOT including it that hasn\u0027t been called out.

Once it\u0027s built, that added time is removed or lowered exponentially, so subsequent rockets with those parts (NOT just the first rocket you used with those parts) can be constructed more quickly. I believe this will make balancing the new rocket vs old rocket timing problem a lot easier, so it\u0027ll be as simple as only adding a small (maybe just a couple of days) delay to brand new or modified rockets (adding a few struts or a new science part to an old rocket shouldn\u0027t add a lot of time). It will also make it pretty easy for the player to guesstimate the time needed to build a new rocket, so they won\u0027t be surprised by the construction time after their Duna window passes them by. It will be something any player can easily learn to expect and plan for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for time passing in the VAB, I might add it as an option in my mod (just a simple checkbox, can be toggled on and off at any time). I feel like it will add to the game in situations where you know you couldn\u0027t have had any engineers working on something, like in emergency situations, or even a completely new idea you only just realized you wanted to make. Sure it won\u0027t add a lot of time in relation to your construction time, but planning and development both take their own time in the real world. Some people argue that development can take place before planning is completed (those who don\u0027t want VAB time added to the construction time), but some also argue that last minute changes to the planning can also throw away any completed development work (decided to change from your old booster to a new one with more dV?

Of course, it\u0027d still be possible to use grant money on a rescue mission (which would then award your failed mission with some level of completion), but you\u0027d have to make some cutbacks from other missions in order to finish the requirements for the grant, or complete several other missions in order to save up money to complete it. It\u0027s getting more into the management genre of games, but what else is there to expect from a space program game? It\u0027d only be a small part of KSP\u0027s campaign anyways (the fun stuff is always going to be in flying rockets, something Sandbox will always be about), and I can see it being simple, intuitive, and not very management-like unless the player wants to play it that way.
