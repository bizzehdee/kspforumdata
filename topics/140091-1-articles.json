Not very useful).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a problem that has more variables than just pressure and velocity though, as pressure and velocity themselves in a rocket flight are directly dependent on the rocket\u0027s TWR, atmospheric drag coefficient and flight profile. For instance, if you take a rocket straight up on a suborbital trajectory, you will exit the thicker portion of the atmosphere at a relatively low velocity. This will inevitably result in a lower Max Q on that flight than if you take the same rocket and fly it on an orbital trajectory using a gravity turn, where you\u0027ll see significantly more velocity at the same altitudes throughout the flight, resulting in a higher Max Q at some point during that flight than the highest Q you saw during the suborbital flight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have the time right now to try and figure out the math behind that calculation. The simplest way I can imagine it happening is that you\u0027d have to determine the overall flight profile you want to fly in advance, then discretely integrate the TWR (determined by\u00A0engines, staging and time), drag component\u00A0(determined by drag coefficient, current speed and altitude)\u00A0and gravity loss (based on angle of thrust versus ground, determined by current altitude and flight profile) over time to determine the speed of the rocket throughout the flight, creating a speed vs altitude graph in the process. Then you would\u00A0apply the dynamic pressure calculation on the speed vs altitude graph\u00A0to create a dynamic pressure versus altitude graph, and finally search for the peak value of dynamic pressure on said graph. And you would have to do this for every flight profile of every rocket design if you wanted to know them all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Archgeek","CreatedById":116048,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T14:28:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOi, what\u0027s with these fish eggs in the atmosphere? \u00A0I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s supposed to be Q = .5 rho v\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, that is the greek lowercase letter Rho, which looks kinda like a lower-case \u0027p\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"suicidejunkie","CreatedById":155878,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T14:30:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMultiply Speed squared and pressure.\u00A0 The exact units don\u0027t matter, its just a question of higher or lower \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn excel chart won\u0027t be of much use:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0- At any particular speed, max Q will be where the air pressure is maximum (0 altitude).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0- At any particular altitude/pressure, max Q will be at the highest speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trick is that both speed and pressure are varying at the same time, in a different way for every launch and rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you were to pause frequently and jot down your altitude (to calculate pressure) and velocity during your launch, you could then make a plot of your Q, and later on figure out where your max Q was.\u00A0 Perhaps adjust your launch profile and thrust for next time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr if you\u0027ve got FAR installed, open the details window and watch for when the live readout starts decreasing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T14:44:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real launches, max-Q is usually around 10-15km and some\u00A0rockets throttle down at that moment to reduce stress on the structure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince joints and parts are made of (molten)\u00A0diamond in KSP you don\u0027t really need to care about max-Q unless your rocket has had issues with flipping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-19T14:45:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2016 02:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Gaarst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T14:48:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222590736\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140091\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463669045\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022126740\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaarst\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, Gaarst said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nunless your rocket has had issues with flipping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JonathanPerregaux","CreatedById":152561,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T14:59:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have MechJeb, there is a very useful flight recorder that can graph various things, including Max Q.
