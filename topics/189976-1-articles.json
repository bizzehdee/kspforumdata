I\u0027ve been playing KSP 1 since.. forever.. Well into the beta years before it came to steam, or 1.0 release.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI however, quit playing for the past year, and came back.. Some things have changed. Like landing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wasn\u0027t like this before, before it was fluid and flawless, but now landing is a nightmare, (Especially for planes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s happening at least for me, is when I touch down my back wheels, it bounces like it just hit a powerful spring, and slams the nose down. I can no longer get any type of smooth landing like I used to be able too..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any mods that deal with this? Or what am I doing wrong? It seems options were taken out too like \u0022locking\u0022 the landing gears and such to stop bouncing, or the springy bouncing like you\u0027re sitting on a bouncy bed or something.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t a problem of me landing too hard, too fast, or my plane being too heavy either. (unless they changed drastically how much weight the landing gears can handle).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy latest plane I land between 70-100m/s, (it\u0027s a spaceplane, so it has to have a little speed). Even then though, my downward angle is only a few degree\u0027s, it should be a smooth landing, yet the back wheels bounce up like it hit something, or bounced on a spring as I mentioned before, slamming the nose wheels down, then the back wheels will bounce multiple times more as well as the front. Despite these violent bounces the wheels dont break, so I doubt it\u0027s due to being too heavy of a plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-24T13:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, wheels are a mess. Your plane might be \u003Cem\u003Etoo light\u003C/em\u003E for its gear, actually, try fiddling with your spring settings. However, wheels in general have gotten worse since they had to rework them due to a Unity
