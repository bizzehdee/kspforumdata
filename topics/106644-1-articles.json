In build mode, (both in the VAB and the SPH) when you attempt to use the offset tool on any part directly connected to an inner attachment node of a cargo bay, the part you\u0027re attempting to offset is instantly displaced along the X and Y axes. This makes it basically impossible to accurately offset parts inside a cargo bay.\n\n\\* Screenshots:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Here\u0027s the [DxDiag](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_c00jg-QkU_MHdEdDlyQ2JEd00/view) file from the lower end computer. I can post the DxDiag from my home computer later today, but neither are likely to be relevant; I experience the bug on both systems and expect it will be easy to reproduce.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T14:08:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 02:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CocoDaPuf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:06:46Z","Content":"Yeah, this one has been around since Gizmos showed up.

This is definitely a bug worth addressing, if only because otherwise the gizmos are such a fantastic feature."}]}
