I don\u0027t even really have much of a need for Trajectories itself, MechJeb\u0027s landing predictions on their own do a good enough job for me. Then again I stay away from bodies that have a significant atmosphere, mostly because to get BACK into orbit of them they all seem to require a similar amount of delta-V as getting to orbit at Kerbin (or for eve, much more than that), and that clashes with the way I like to explore a planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I explore planets is to send exactly ONE lander craft, with ONE stage, and my intent is to land it in every single biome of that body, and leave behind not just a flag, but an entire surface experiment package with a full complement of instruments, only swapping out one instrument (ionographer or atmosphere analyzer) based on if the place has an atmosphere or not.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot only can this lander take a single trip down to the surface and back to orbit on a single stage, I like it if it can do a few suborbital hops to nearby biomes as well. I don\u0027t have the patience for rover piloting, and I don\u0027t have the computer that can handle the high part counts that would happen if I sent a bunch of lander probes to send back science data from all the biomes, and I also like using science labs so I need to deliver this data back to the orbital lab (which also lets me refuel the lander), so this is the route I have taken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the high delta-v to get to orbit of Laythe, Kerbin, or Eve just basically destroys any chance I have of that approach working, so I just haven\u0027t gone there with big landers yet. Probes only so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: All that being said, I do believe that being able to set a landing pad (or runway, can\u0027t forget the players that use mostly aircraft and SSTOs) as a target is a very nice feature that should be in the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo incentivize use of partially and fully reusable rockets and spaceplanes (be they \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E or not), it should be possible to launch such a rocket or spaceplane to orbit, deploy the payload, switch back to the rocket or spaceplane and somehow tell the game \u0022The vehicle just delivered a payload to orbit, in the future it should be able to do this automatically (even if that requires pilots to accomplish)\u0022. Then, to get the \u0022reusable\u0022 part ALSO automated, you\u0027d somehow tell the game \u0022Now I\u0027m going to attempt to land this thing\u0022, followed by you (manually \u002B whatever assistance like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E modes or autopilots the game gives you normally) piloting the thing to a safe landing on the surface of the planet (or splashing down in the ocean, if the planet has those), and then telling the game you finished landing it. Then the game would be able to \u0022take care of itself\u0022 as far as launching and landing that particular rocket with any payload within (aka lower than) the mass and size bounds of the payload you deployed way back at the start of this paragraph.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s how I think the game should handle \u0022automating launches and landings\u0022. You should only need to fly them manually once with any new vessel, unless you\u0027re trying to get more performance out of it than you did the first try.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn second thought, there should likely be some extremely simple but completely customizable \u0022pitch/heading program plus auto-staging\u0022 type ascent autopilot that can, with the right parameters, get a vertically launched rocket into a stable orbit. That\u0027s the kind of autopilot all the early rockets used (yes even Mercury wasn\u0027t flown by hand!). It wasn\u0027t until the Shuttle that we had proper \u0022powered explicit guidance\u0022 programs that would make efficient use of all the rocket\u0027s performance capacity to get to a specified orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe point is not to make it \u0022trivial\u0022 to get something to orbit, instead the point is to make it a whole lot easier to get the 2nd, 10th, or 100th rocket to orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith the pitch program type autopilot, you\u0027re still flying the rocket to orbit yourself, you\u0027re just piloting it \u0022before\u0022 you launch it, in a way.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(end edit)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of \u0022if it has an atmosphere or not\u0022, I just thought of an interesting idea for a planet. A high gravity planet, with both extremely large plains that are relatively \u0022flat\u0022 (as flat as Kerbin\u0027s grasslands, so not \u0022minmus flats\u0022 flat but still plenty safe enough to land most landers on), as well as mountain ranges that tower significantly ABOVE the level of the planet\u0027s (notably abnormal) atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh and if it is a gameplay factor, the surface would also be relatively MORE radioactive than outer space, despite having no significant magnetic field, due to high presence of radioactive elements (good place to mine for stuff used to make RTGs). This helps explain why the atmosphere is the way it is, I\u0027ll explain that a little bit later in the post.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe atmosphere density at the level of the plains would be somewhere between Duna\u0027s and Kerbin\u0027s low altitude atmosphere (perhaps as dense as at 5-7.5 km ASL on Kerbin), dense enough for aircraft to fly at reasonable speeds, but lacking oxygen, and the atmospheric analyzer instrument would tell you that the atmosphere is almost entirely composed of heavy noble gases, which as anyone who knows how radioactive decay works, is the product of radioactive decay of heavy elements undergoing spontaneous fission (a point that would make it the ideal location to harvest xenon and other electric rocket engine propellants from the atmosphere, you might also find He3 in the regolith at significantly elevated levels because of Tritium decay, which itself is the product of heavy radionuclide elements decaying or undergoing fission chain reactions). Due to this abnormal atmospheric composition, you wouldn\u0027t need 75km high mountains to get above the atmosphere, perhaps only 15-25km high mountains. Alternatively, you could have a much higher atmosphere, but have the planet\u0027s surface gravity level be much lower, say maybe it\u0027s the core of a Kerbin-like planet that had the rest of the crust and mantle blown off by a catastrophic impact event (that would also be a good way to get such high mountain ranges).\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically, the atmosphere would be a weird hybrid of Eve\u0027s (abnormally dense atmosphere at sea level) and Duna\u0027s (atmosphere \u0022cuts off\u0022 at a lower altitude than Kerbin), but at the same time not landing on the same box that Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere did.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd before any of you say it, I don\u0027t particularly care if this planet is \u0022possible\u0022 according to the laws of physics or not, I did give it a first-pass approximation at trying to make sense as far as what elements it\u0027s made out of, but I paid no mind to the realities of structural stability or tidal forces ripping the mountains down.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy point is that I was trying to come up with something interesting to explore, not something that completely adheres to the laws of physics 100%.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t feel like that\u0027s even a requirement, after all you need only look at the configuration of the Kerbol solar system itself, which according to N-body orbital dynamics as we know them should fling itself apart within the time frame of a few thousand years or less, so little violations of reality that make interesting things to explore are probably just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-04T22:31:49Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2021 10:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
