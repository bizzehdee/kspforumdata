Kerbal spacecraft engineers can get very salty at Moho because of the high delta-v that it requires to get there.\n\u003E \n\u003E Eve - A so called \u0022super-kerbin\u0022 under planetary conditions made by Kerbals, but sadly, as much Kerbals think that \u0022super-kerbins\u0022 are lush, green paradises, Eve is the complete opposite. With an thick, oppressive and crushing iodine, sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide atmosphere and oceans of liquid mercury. No landers have survived the intense conditions on Eve\u0027s surface. And Eve has two moons, the beautiful, crystal-covered Faz, and the small asteroid Gilly.\n\u003E \n\u003E *Kerbin* - Kerbin is the home planet of the Kerbal race. Many nations, cultures, and tribes have been prospering on Kerbin\u0027s surface for years, and many nations have been making efforts to reach space after the United Plutonic Federation put the first satellite in orbit around Kerbin in 1957. Just recently has the Kerbal race have made first contact with an extraterrestrial race, via a signal that came from the binary star system Mina. Shortly after that, various signals from other stars, such as Demmy and the star discovered by the Dynton Space Telescope, Dynton-489. Two moons orbit Kerbin, the Mun, and the icy Minmus.\n\u003E \n\u003E Duna - Once a target for various classic cheesy sci-fi flicks that you\u0027d see in a drive-in, Duna is a desert planet with a unbreathable carbon dioxide and methane atmosphere. Duna was once like Kerbin, but due to Duna\u0027s core rapidly cooling down, that didn\u0027t last long. There has also been various consparicy theories about Duna, such as the ever-infamous \u0022face\u0022 on Duna and the strange pyramid that was found by Belet\u0027s \u0022Bogoti\u0022 Duna rover. Three moons orbit Duna, the asteroids Pheeber and Deemer, and the uneven, malevolent Ike.\n\u003E \n\u003E Dres - A minor planet in The Harvester belt, Dres is a gray world with large sheets of water-ice that cover it\u0027s surface. Dres is also known to have a very deep canyon that scars it\u0027s surface, and a dusty ring system. Sadly, much of the Kerbal populace forgets that Dres is, in fact a celestial body that exists. The Kerbal scientific community thinks that Dres does have two, large asteroid moons that keep it\u0027s ring system in place, but we just don\u0027t know.\n\u003E \n\u003E Goliath - Another so-called \u0022Super-Kerbin\u0022, Goliath is a very large terrestrial planet with frequent volcanic activity, and it\u0027s surface is obscured by a thick carpet of sulfur-hydrogen clouds. Goliath is responsible for herding up various protoplanets and somewhat large celestial bodies. Due to it\u0027s sheer amount of large moons that have enough gravity and mass to hold thick atmospheres, such as the ocean moon Vianess, Goliath is a rich location for scientific exploration. We don\u0027t know how many moons that Goliath has, beside\u0027s it\u0027s major moons, but boy, that\u0027s alot of asteroids.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jool - A jolly green Gas Giant with a atmosphere of chlorine and some other trace gases, and a faint, dusty ring system, Jool is responsible for protecting Kerbin from asteroids. Jool is a interesting location, and various probes, (mainly South Returian) have proven it. Jool have been looked at by the ancient Kerbal astronomer Falileo Falilei, and found out that Jool has four large moons that orbit it. Jool has 7 major moons and a fistful of asteroids that orbit it, such as the watery moon Laythe, the icy moon Vall, the formidable Tylo, the icy Kallipo, and the asteroids Bop and Pol.\n\u003E \n\u003E Eeloo - A so called \u0022Centaur\u0022, Eeloo is an icy world dotted with cracks and ridges, and has also been dotted with controversy. Eeloo is forever locked in a 3:2 resonance with Jool. Not much is known about this dirty snowball, however, but the true question, greater than \u0022is Eeloo a planet or not\u0022, is \u0022what even is a \u0027Centaur\u0027\u0022, and the Google results are neigh disturbing...\n\u003E \n\u003E Wexx - The furthermost planet known to ancient astronomers. Wexx is a blue Gas Giant with a vivid system of white, bright rings! Wexx has dazzled various Kerbals with it\u0027s vast system of rings. Many moons orbit Wexx, such as Belenus, with it\u0027s trailing atmosphere, active volcanism and retrograde orbit, Hyugens, with it\u0027s thick methane and nitrogen atmosphere, and oceans of ethanol, Torkulus, with it\u0027s muddy soil in certain reigons, and it\u0027s thin atmosphere, Cyrion with it\u0027s cyrovolcanism and Skrii, with it\u0027s oblate appearance and subsurface ocean. There are also more moons, that are named, along with asteroids, but we\u0027re too lazy to put them in and we\u0027re running out of sp-\n\u003E \n\u003E Orbornio - Orbornio is the first Ice Giant of the Kerbol System, with it\u0027s extreme axial tilt and name that has been turned into a joke, Orbornio is a interesting planet. Orbornio seems dull, that it\u0027s just a plain, cyan marble, but there\u0027s clouds on Orbornio, trust me, i\u0027m a planetary scientist and a interstellar weatherman! The planet is orbited by five major moons, the beaten Fortuna, the reasonably large Uriel, the snowy Cynthia, the interesting Yuna, and the mysterious Hamlet.\n\u003E \n\u003E Pippitus - Pippitus is the last Ice Giant of the Kerbol System, Pippitus boasts a royal purple, and lavender atmosphere and a great purple spot, which totally isn\u0027t a Yaenglandic knock-off of Jool\u0027s great green spot. The planet, which shocked various scientists, has very high wind speeds. Pippitus boasts four, interesting moons, which are the frozen Iglu, the icy Desolat, the cyrovolcanic Tritus and the dusty Snobal.\n\u003E \n\u003E Ploouto - Ploouto is a brownish planet, and the last planet in the Kerbol system that\u0027s in a 3:2 resonance with Pippitus, much like Eeloo is in a 3:2 resonance with Jool. Ploouto is the second largest planet in the Silliskus belt, besides Hale. Ploouto has an interesting surface feature that has a uncanny resemblance to a heart. Various Kerbal consparicy theorists think that it is because Ploouto is having a warm welcome to the only spacecraft to ever visit it so far, which is South Returia\u0027s Unseen Frontiers spacecraft. Ploouto has only one moon, if you don\u0027t count the other four asteroids that orbit it, which is Karion. In fact, Ploouto and Karion are binary planets. Cool!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Coming soon!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Coming soon!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E **Dynton-489** is a recently-discovered star that is orbited by 9 planets. **Dynton-489** is the home star system of the Arecribians.\n\u003E \n\u003E B - Dynton-489-B is a small, grey world similar in size to Moho, only a bit larger. Nobody knows much about this strange world, but it\u0027s in a eerily similar orbit to Moho. Or maybe it is Moho, and it\u0027s all just a government conspiracy that Dynton-489 B, is in fact Moho, and that there is only 8 planets in the Dynton-489 system. But who knows. Maybe the government is controlled by snake people, and nobody knows.\n\u003E \n\u003E C - Dynton-489-C is a world similar in size of Kerbin, but in fact, it is far from Kerbin in terms of scientific data. Because it is more like Eve than Kerbin. Literally, Dynton-489-C is Eve, but only a little bit smaller and without the iodine in the atmosphere and no mercury oceans. Which sucks.\n\u003E \n\u003E *D* - *Dynton-489-C*  is the home planet of the Arecribians. A few days ago, Kerbalkind has gotten a message from this planet that looked similar to the Kerbal\u0027s Yelnats message. The Arecribians are far from Kerbals, and more like the \u0022tall pink men\u0022 from classic sci-fi. The Arecribians have technology eerily similar to Kerbals, except that they haven\u0027t landed on their Duna yet, or have they? Nobody knows. Dynthon\u0027s hunt for Exomoons have ruled that *Dynton-489-C* most likely has 1 moon. Which sucks, because Kerbals want the Arecribians to have their own Minmus--and Duna landing. Fair is only fair!\n\u003E \n\u003E E - Dynton-489-E is basically the Arecribian\u0027s equivalent of Duna, except alot less dusty and dune-y, and alot more orange-y and rocky. Much like Duna, Dynton-489-E most likely suffered from the same core-cooling that Duna had. Hopefully Dynton-489-E isn\u0027t way too similar to Duna and have it\u0027s own face. Or pyramid. Or snake people! Dynton\u0027s hunt for Exomoons have ruled that Dynton-489-E most likely doesn\u0027t have any moons.\n\u003E \n\u003E F - Dynton-489-F is a gas giant. Nobody knows much about it, except that it has a hydrogen and helium atmosphere, and has four large moons. Two of which has cyrovolcanism. Which is interesting. But hopefully Kerbal-kind doesn\u0027t land on the one that could possibly have life, because we don\u0027t need a deep space Kraken that begs to be released. Dynton\u0027s hunt for Exomoons have ruled that Dynton-489-E has four, large, rocky moons.\n\u003E \n\u003E G - Dynton-489-G is a gas giant similar to Dynton-489-F, except that it has rings similar to Wexx. Dynton\u0027s hunt for exomoons has also encountered something peculiar orbiting Dynton-489-G, which occasionally lenses the planet. As much as we\u0027d like it to be a wormhole, it probably isn\u0027t. We, in fact would probably need a wormhole to prove that the anomaly around Dynton-489-G is a wormhole, but no wormhole has opened in the Kerbol system that leads to Dynton-489. Dynton\u0027s hunt for Exomoons has ruled out that Dynton-489-G has a few moons, including the peculiar thing that most likely isn\u0027t a wormhole.\n\u003E \n\u003E H - Dynton-489-H is a ice giant similar to Orbornio, and we suspect that the Acreibians most likely joke about the name that they gave Dynton-489-H, much as we Kerbals like to joke about Orbornio\u0027s name. Dynton\u0027s hunt for Exomoons has sadly revealed, that Dynton-489-H most likely has one large moon.\n\u003E \n\u003E I - Dynton-489-I is a ice giant similar to Dynton-489-H, except with a reasonable axial tilt and alot more blue. A team of very advanced primates, and some interns that we found are working on a cloud map for Dynton-489-I, to find out if it\u0027s like Pippitus. Dynton\u0027s hunt for Exomoons have ruled out that there is probably one moon orbiting Dynton-489-I.\n\u003E \n\u003E J - Dynton-489-J is the last planet in the Dynton-489 system. We don\u0027t know much about it, except that it kinda looks like Ploouto. Or maybe it is Ploouto. We\u0027re too bored to continue on with this, so we\u0027re gonna take the day off and watch the film Intergalactic, and proceed to bawl our eyes out. I\u0027m coming home, Madxy.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T07:52:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 07:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sylandro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T22:51:51Z","Content":"Neato, the Dynton-489 system reminds me of[something I wrote](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128330-A-Kerbal-s-Guide-to-the-Earth-Sol-System) not too long ago."},{"CreatedByName":"Sylandro","CreatedById":80729,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T23:37:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Neato, the Dynton-489 system reminds me of[something I wrote](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128330-A-Kerbal-s-Guide-to-the-Earth-Sol-System) not too long ago.\n\nThank you!"},{"CreatedByName":"Interplanet Janet","CreatedById":146268,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T21:50:20Z","Content":"I feel like maybe I could make this into a planet pack.
