It\u0027s powered by eight LV-T30 and four LV-T45 for a total of 2520kN of thrust, compared to the 1500kN of each of the rocket\u0027s mainsail boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically when it comes to working out TWR for an asparagus, we have to balance a number of factors. Let\u0027s see how we go about designing a well balanced and efficient asparagus staging rocket to illustrate what I\u0027m talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.\u003C/strong\u003E First is payload fraction. An exceptionally well engineered asparagus staging rocket can manage over 16% payload fraction, far higher than any other type of staging and thus making it unquestionably the most efficient type of staging. When efficiency is the goal you should aim for at least a payload fraction of 15%. And so given a known payload - say 44 tons. You already know how big that rocket is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E44 * 100/15 = 293 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for a payload of 44 tons, you should be able to lift that into orbit with a rocket weighing 249 tons for a total stack of 293 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2.\u003C/strong\u003E Second, now that we know how big of a rocket we are designing we can figure out how to engine this rocket. The number that\u0027s important here is TWR at lift off. Given that the ideal ascent profile calls for a TWR of 2 before Max Q, you want lift off TWR to be below 2 so that by the time of first staging event your rocket\u0027s TWR goes above 2 and the two ends balance each other out. I find that the ideal TWR at lift off for an asparagus is between 1.6 - 1.7. The Nova rocket above as we can see have a lift off TWR of 1.67\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, given 293 tons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E293 * 1.6 * 9.81 = 4599 kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E293 * 1.7 * 9.81 = 4886 kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, we know that our rocket that can lift 44 tons need to have enough engines at the bottom for a lift off thrust of 4599kN - 4886kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3.\u003C/strong\u003E Last, we need to figure out exactly how we can engine this rocket to give us 4599kN - 4886kN and using an asparagus design. As we discussed above for a more consistent thrust we need the centre stage to be more powerful than the boosters. But exactly what ratio of core stage thrust vs total thrust should we use? There is no clear answer here but my own experience tells me the ideal ratio is somewhere around 22%. That is 22% of the rocket\u0027s thrust should come from its final stage while 78% comes from the asparagus staged boosters around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo given our 4599kN - 4886kN thrust what engines should that be? well 22% of that thrust is 1012kN - 1075kN. This number clearly shows us what engine we should use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 x LV-T30 = 860kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 x LV-T45 = 200kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a total of 1060kN which falls in our range. Thus we know for our 44 ton payload rocket, we should use a core stage powered by a five engine cluster of four LV-T30 and a centre LV-T45, which also gives us a good steering authority via vectored thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now that we know our core stage, that leaves 3539kN - 3826kN of thrust that must come from the asparagus boosters around it. Exactly how many boosters is up to personal choice - the more you have the smoother your TWR curve and the closer you approach the \u0022ideal staging rocket\u0022 that never carries any dead weight in terms of empty tanks or excess engine. On the other hand the more boosters you have the more complex the rocket becomes to engineer. I find that the ideal number for 2.5m core stage with 2.5m boosters is six. Six is the maximum number of 2.5m boosters you can cluster around a 2.5m core using standard long decouples, if you want more you have to resort to much more complex engineering for diminishing return which I find is not worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo say we settle on 6 boosters around our 1060kN core. This gives us 590kn - 638kN per booster. Again the choice is clear:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 x LV-T30 = 430kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 x LV-T45 = 200kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a total of 630kN per booster. Thus we now know the engine configuration of our 44ton payload rocket:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ea core stage of 4 LV-T30 and 1 LV-T45 for a 1060kN\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Esix boosters of 2 LV-T30 and 1 LV-T45 to give 630kN per booster\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe total thrust at lift off is thus 4840kN. These engines weigh a total of 30.5 tons. Our payload is 44 tons, so according to the 293 ton number we worked out in section 2 this leaves us with 218.5 tons for mostly fuel \u002B other hardware for the rocket. Your job then as a designer is then simply work out how to distribute that 218.5 tons of mostly fuel so that each stage has reasonable TWR. The end result will look something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/352g2zp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022352g2zp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it turned out asparagus staging is so good we didn\u0027t actually need 218.5 tons of fuel to lift 44 tons of payload into orbit.

Did Burran \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerodynamic drag: Nope, not talking about delta-V used to counteract drag, that\u0027s a very minor factor at most. If you\u0027ve launched rockets using FAR which has more accurate aerodynamics than stock, you know that rockets with a center of drag higher than their center of mass are inherently unstable. This isn\u0027t necessarily the case with all asparagus staged vehicles, but I ran into it more than once while testing. Also, since real earth launch gravity turns tend to more closely follow the prograde, this is less of a factor in reality since the instability is easily correctable if you\u0027re close to prograde, it just becomes bad if you turn as far from prograde as you do following the informal standard of \u0022turn to 45 degrees at 10K altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard someone on these forums mention the rotational energy of transferring the fuel would cause a problem.

If you\u0027re seeing different results, you may be overbuilding your asparagus rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore parts: This is also true. Having a fuel pump go out in the innermost asparagus stage could mean that none of the stacks on that leg would transfer fuel correctly, throwing the entire ship out of balance.

My atomic powered Duna lander sometimes takes an extra fuel tank mounted under the rover, which it of course has to ditch before it lands, just to make sure I have plenty of delta-V left over for stupidity on my part. I generally find that it doesn\u0027t gain much over traditional asparagus staging because you either keep the engines, trading delta-V for a high TWR ratio that doesn\u0027t necessarily help your efficiency, or you\u0027re dropping them about as fast as you would a properly balanced traditional asparagus staged rocket. Oh, and leaving tanks on the launch pad can be a serious problem with this design concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Anglave\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Anglave\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI built a stack like this in 0.17 but it was unstable because the game didn\u0027t account for the vectored thrust being ahead of the center of mass (so the vectoring was reversed).
