I propose multiplayer trading - here\u0027s how it works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the upcoming career mode, you will need both resources and money to keep your space program running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if, for example, you have an excess supply of materials but not enough money to build new rockets? Or if you have a shortage of materials and plenty of money, but you\u0027re too lazy to mine resources? You would, of course, sell things to other players or buy something they have put up for sale. You could sell your hard-earned materials on an online marketplace of sorts, in exchange for money. For those who like to manufacture things, there would be the option of refining the raw materials into various spaceship parts which could also be sold to other players. Finally, for players who prefer building, there would be the possibility of putting entire spacecraft up for sale. And of course, this would work the other way round as well - you could buy materials, parts and spacecraft instead of doing the hard work by yourself. Sure, such a system would have it\u0027s downsides, but the advantages would far outweigh them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is gaining more and more recognition among people, and that in turn motivates the developers to keep working on the game. I think it\u0027s safe to say that at this rate, we will be getting regular updates for a loooooong time after the release of KSP 1.0. Now, the materials/parts/ships trading system might not sound like much, but it would certainly be a beginning. Also, keep in mind that it could theoretically be implemented while the game is still in Alpha or Beta phase! Just imagine how much more potential such a system would have a few years from now when KSP and its userbase have grown much, much bigger and better \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts, ideas and criticism are welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAndrewTaco","CreatedById":51739,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T02:01:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like this would be an MMO-style exchange/market.

Hire other players\u0027 better trained kerbals for your own missions, in exchange for an amount of money. The original owner of said kerbal would get a small slice of the money you earn by actually using the kerbal. It\u0027s a win-win situation - both would benefit from such a thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Resource maps? Seeing as there will be mining, there must certainly be a way to locate the things you\u0027re looking for. Also, since the planets are being improved and new ones are added, there\u0027s plenty of exploring to do - one could also trade maps of interesting locations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original idea and these suggestions are based on the planned features, but of course, as KSP is developed, more and more potentially tradeable things are added into the game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T08:11:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMajor features\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Multiplayer* [1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Weaponry* [2] [3]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etrying to sneak in multiplayer through a backdoor is still multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T08:24:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe OP should rename the thread to \u0022trading system\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh - and stock vs mod would also play a part.
