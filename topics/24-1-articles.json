This is great!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have a tool we made to debug part loading. It\u0027s called PartLab. It\u0027s going to be released very soon now, along with a few other tools and examples in an SDK package. The PartLab tool has a console that let\u0027s you know exactly where the importing halted, I\u0027ll see if I can release it as early as tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try to help you out now anyway. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe model for a part needs a couple of special nodes to work. Mainly, you need a convex solid mesh called node_collider, to be your collision mesh, this is a mesh that\u0027s supposed to go over the main model, and it\u0027s what the game uses to simulate physics. The other nodes are just dummies used to mark the position of the attachment nodes and effects. These aren\u0027t even imported. They\u0027re just used to get the XYZ position and orientation of the things they represent (there is another tool for that as well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also need to structure the new part\u0027s folder in the same way the others are. It needs a texture map in the \u0027texture\u0027 folder, a COLLADA (.dae) or .obj mesh in the part\u0027s root folder, and the part.cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cfg file is the entry point for a part. The game looks for those first, and parses it to get information about how the part is supposed to work. In there, you have to set an unique name for the part, indicate where the mesh and texture are, and define the attachment points. Your best option is to copy an existing part.cfg from somewhere else, and just change the values you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll be releasing an official part-making guide in the KSP wiki as well. It should cover all of these points in much more depth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the game is halting on the loading screen, my best guess is that either there is a problem with the collision mesh, or you have a problem with the cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry using a copied cfg file from the original solidBooster. Just change the \u0027name\u0027 field to something else, and make sure the \u0027mesh\u0027 and \u0027texture\u0027 fields are pointing to the right files. If the game is still halting, it might very well be the collision mesh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you already have a collision mesh in, and the game is still halting, the next step is to make sure the collision mesh has a material applied to it. It won\u0027t use this material in game... the collision mesh is invisible... but the importer will complain if it finds a mesh without a material. This only happens with .dae models though. If you need to give it a material, you can give it a standard grey material, and just for modelling convenience, give it 50% transparency. (I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re using 3Ds Max... although other modelling packages should work quite as well)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, We\u0027ll try to release the SDK as soon as possible. In the meantime, I hope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woo482","CreatedById":18,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-06-26T16:32:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seem to be able to get my models into the game now!
