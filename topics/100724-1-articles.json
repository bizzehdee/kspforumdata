The savegames i had in the \u0022Saves\u0022 folder, did not match the ones i had in-game.\n\nI must say at this point in time i had about 6 mods, which all worked fine. So when i am in-game, i can load my save and stuff, but when i go to my saves folder it only shows up to quicksave #7, and i have to about 17\n\nAny idea what is wrong?"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T23:24:08Z","Content":"Huh. Weird. All I can think is use the Windows file search tool to look for one of the quicksaves you\u0027re missing in the file system but can still see in-game.\n\nThey\u0027ve got to be somewhere!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T23:34:21Z","Content":"If playing a game from a protected Windows folder, you\u0027ll often find save files and configuration files in a hidden applications folder instead of where you\u0027d expect.\n\nUsually it\u0027s something like C:\\users\\username\\application\\_data(this is hidden)\\Kerbal Space Program...\n\nDon\u0027t forget to enable viewing of hidden files and folders ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
