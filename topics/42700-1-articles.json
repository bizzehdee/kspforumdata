I\u0027ve seen challenges to make an SSTO. I\u0027ve even seen challenges to fly to another planet/moon and return. Now that you have those skills, it\u0027s time to put them to use and do something very different. The Eve Circumnavigation Challenge is one that that will require flying skill, rocketry skill, planning and a good deal of patience if you are to succeed. And a good deal of luck if you\u0027re not to explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Arial Black\u0027;\u0022\u003EGoal. Circumnavigate EVE with an aircraft. More specifically, a Kethane powered aircraft.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Arial Black\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe Challenge\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve is a fantastic planet for flying. It\u0027s atmosphere is as thick as soup and reaches up into the heavens. But it\u0027s gravity well is something akin to a black hole. Your goal is to explore Eve in all of it\u0027s vastness from the comfortable seat of a pit. This challenge will be loaded with exactly that, challenges. From the skill of learning how to fly a Kethane powered engine to planning and managing fuel stops there will be plenty to do. Carrying enough Kethane to complete a non-stop, though possible, is (I\u0027m thinking unless someone proves me wrong) rather impractical. You\u0027ll probably need to make several fuel stops along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDetermining how you\u0027ll refuel is another set of challenges. Do you mount drills on your aircraft and suffer through their added weight, electrical and fuel consumption or do you pre-position drilling station fuel stops along your planned route?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhichever solution you choose, this challenge, reminiscent of the days of barnstormers, will provide you with amazing views of the new Eve, challenge both your flying and landing skills as well as your abilities to both think ahead and think quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis challenge is not about speed, it\u0027s all about efficiency, planning and being prepared for the worst.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Arial Black\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe problems:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJet engines don\u0027t work on Eve. It\u0027s atmosphere is totally void of oxygen. But, Kethane burns and Eve has vast stores of the viscous liquid spread over it\u0027s surface. Fortunately, there is a jet engine that specifically burns Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane jet engines love Kethane. A lot. Their efficiency is nothing to brag about. I recently flew twice around Kerbin on 800 jet fuel. 1,000 Kethane only got me 500km (at full throttle). You\u0027ll need to be able to pack on a good bit of Kethane to get from one fuel stop to the next and it\u0027s not light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane jet engines do not work with air intakes, they only work with their own internal KIntakeAir sytems. These are beastly devices as they generate air based on not just air speed and altitude, but engine RPM as well. Meaning, the faster you fly, the faster the intake spins, the more air you take in. But, the faster you fly, the less air it\u0027s able to take in and the higher you fly, the less air there is for it to take in. Flying a Kethane jet is a delicate balancing act of managing altitude, speed and engine RPM. Doing it efficiently enough to get from one Kethane deposit to the next is a challenge to say the least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane jets love to flame-out without warning. By the time you hear the whine of the engine start to dwindle, it\u0027s usually too late. Furthermore, Kethane engines can\u0027t simply be restarted by throttling back. They can ONLY be restarted when your airspeed reaches 80 m/s or less. And, if you try to reduce your speed and throttle your engines all the way back in flight, they will flame out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying a Kethane jet requires skill and attention. They are not speed machines nor are they high-altitude blast furnaces. On Kerbin, you\u0027re lucky if they can reach 10km without flaming out and 450m/s going down hill. They can however, be relatively efficient cruising engines if you manage them well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve has large quantities of Kethane buried just under the surface. Drilling it won\u0027t be a problem. However, there are often very large distances between deposits and the safest route to fly, may not always be the shortest. While some deposits are in vast mountain ranges and difficult to reach, others are located on tiny islands in Eve\u0027s vast oceans. Deciding where to fuel and hoping you have enough to get you there will not only challenge your planning and navigation skills, but your efficient flying skills as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have done this myself and it\u0027s very gratifying. And, with all the skills involved, it is a challenge. The good news is, you don\u0027t have to complete it all in one sitting and saving your game along the way is a pretty good idea. This is not going to be a 30 minute challenge and then done with nor is it going to be hours of ship building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, a Duna challenge is on the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Arial Black\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ERules:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. There are 3 categories for completion. Stock, Assisted Stock and Full Mods. Stock: Your aircraft must be completely stock with the exception of the Kethane mod. No infi-gliding, no part clipping. Assisted Stock: Only MechJeb or other autopilots will be allowed on fully stock aircraft. Full Modified: \u0027Reasonably\u0027 balanced mods and plugins (like FAR) will be allowed but in a separate category. If flying with mods or plugins, you must indicate which you used when you complete the challenge. Plugins or mods cannot be modified from their original distribution. The purpose here is not to limit creativity but to create a level playing field and to give others a fair \u0027gauge\u0027 of what it took to complete the challenge. You must provide a screenshot of this craft so that it\u0027s plainly visible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Your aircraft must be piloted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. No rocket, srb or jet engines on the aircraft once landed on Eve. Only the Kethane jet engine. You may use rockets or any other stock/non-stock engine to fly your craft to Eve but they must be jettisoned before your initial landing. You may use any \u0027reasonable\u0027 number of Kethane engines. (sucking an entire deposit dry probably isn\u0027t a good idea and Kethane jets aren\u0027t light either)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You may either fly your aircraft to Eve (SSTO) or deliver it via a rocket. You can use non-stock parts and/or autopilots to deliver the aircraft to Eve if needed. The challenge is not getting to Eve but you must use \u0027conventional\u0027 methods to get there. No editing or other means of making your aircraft instantly appear on Eve or in orbit above it. Once your aircraft lands on Eve, it must contain only stock and Kethane parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Upon landing on Eve you will declare you starting point by taking a Kerbal EVA and planting a flag. This Kerbal can come either from your aircraft or from a base already established there but your aircraft must be at that location. You must provide a screenshot of the flag planting. Flag, flight stats, aircraft resources and plane must be visible to some degree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. You must land on Eve with 0 Kethane in your tanks. You may stop en-route for other fuel but you may not take on Kethane until you land on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Your circumnavigation not need take the shortest path and most likely won\u0027t. Once you choose your general direction you must continue in that direction. If you choose to fly east to west, you can only reverse direction in order to make fuel stops (should you realize you have to reverse course because you can\u0027t make it to the next one) and once fueled, you must continue back on the east to west path. You can of course fly north or south in this example in order to reach fuel stops. The goal is to circumnavigate. That means around. No flying east, then north over the pole then south and then back east. You can do a polar circumnavigation if you choose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Fueling en-route may be either the aircraft fueling itself or from a base. To clarify, you can either pack your own drills or have a vehicle meet you and fuel your aircraft. No unlimited fuel or other such nonsense which defeats the spirit of this challenge. Use of drop tanks, even on a stock plane, will be considered as being in the \u0027modified\u0027 category. It\u0027s been proven that this challenge can be done without drop tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Your aircraft must land back at your starting point with all the parts it left with. Losing parts anywhere along the way is a disqualification. You must provide a screenshot of the end of flight stats and the starting point flag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Warping. This challenge is about enjoying the view and the flight. I don\u0027t encourage it but do it if you must. The only time warping is encouraged is if you are drilling (Depending on your electrical generation, that could take some time. This challenge isn\u0027t about watching drill animations.) Be aware that Eve is mostly desert. Warping while landed has been known to have detrimental effects on tires (they get buried in the sand).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly safe and enjoy the view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECame to realize that not everyone is comfortable modding parts.
