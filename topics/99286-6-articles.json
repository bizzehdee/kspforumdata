It is important to note that none of these channels will reach everyone in the community, and therefore we take great care to ensure that important information is posted everywhere, or at the very least in places where one could expect to find it. That does not mean however that all information gets posted in full in every channel, since they don\u0027t compare very well:\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith respect though, when I first heard of KSP, I went to look for the KSP website, bought it, saw there was a forum, and joined it, expecting that it would be the place to be kept well informed about KSP. Not unreasonable, I feel. Now, as for other channels of communication, like Twitter etc (a) I have no interst in them, and (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E they\u0027re not the KSP forum on the KSP website so why should I be expecting to find the latest KSP news in those other places rather than here? I hadn\u0027t even heard of Reddit until recently! (no interest in \u0027social media\u0027 sites, don\u0027t forget)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, first of all, I am not one of those upset with Squad. But then, I had no idea that there might be somethig to be upset about until earlier today. Still not worried because I\u0027m mature (well past my sell-by date!) and so far as I can tell I\u0027ve still been adequately informed by Squad about what\u0027s happening with the game here. But I do question the logic of your reasoning, Kaspervid. Yes, given there are these other channels out there, it seems perfectly reasonable to me to spread the word and stoke the interest out there. I can even accept that different channels of communication might suit different situations better (right tool for the job, horses for courses, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut still - this is THE channel of communication that one first learns about when visiting the KSP website. I\u0027m astonished that anyone wouldn\u0027t think this to be the appropriate place to first publish news relating to the future of the game - bearing in mind that publishing it here first doesnt preclude publishing it anywhere else afterwards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ve said my piece,I\u0027ll say no more on it, I\u0027m not upset, just startled, and once again, thank you SQUAD more than I can say for such great work on the best computer game I have played to date (and I started playing games on computers about 40 years ago). :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T22:36:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDear god, this again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast I checked Twitter (a loooong time ago to be honest), they had embeddable HTML gadgets.

The form and depth of information often lead us to certain channels we can use: Maxmaps\u0027 dV announcement for example was a very short \u0022snippet\u0022 of information, by which I don\u0027t want to downplay its importance, but it was a very short update with no further detailed information.
