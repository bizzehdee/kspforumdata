It ain\u0027t wonderful: The Kerbals repeat themselves again... and again... and again. (I cut all of the audio off of a thirty-second clip from a long time ago.) Note that the entire video was done in stock KSP, with no camera mods.

The kerbal voices weren\u0027t great as you say but the camera-work was good, it was well put together and I liked the camera effects (glitches during launch, extra information popping up around the edges of the screen etc.) very much. It had a real \u0027live from space\u0027 feeling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
