However, to get back into the groove of things today, I decided to examine a couple of issues at the top of the list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The stock Mobile Processing Lab MPL-LG-2 appears to have two EVA hatches where Kerbals can come out of, in contrast to most pre-0.23 crewed parts which can only have one hatch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I still get complaints about why models for the large 3.6875m-long FusTek modules have the seemingly redundant combination of an non-centroid part origin and CoMOffset\u003Cem\u003E.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, I quickly tossed together an experimental crew cabin part, with exterior dimensions of 4 x 4 x 4 metres, as well as six EVA hatches / ladder combos defined on all sides. I then exported this dummy part into the game, and tested hatch obstruction by putting B9 decouplers over the EVA hatches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/060/f/c/ksp_fustek_test_module_2_mar_2014_by_sumghai-d78jpmd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp_fustek_test_module_2_mar_2014_by_sumghai-d78jpmd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFig 45\u003C/strong\u003E - [DEV] Multiple Airlocks \u002B Hatch Obstruction Testing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe results, as clearly depicted in \u003Cstrong\u003EFig 45\u003C/strong\u003E, prove that it is indeed possible to have multiple working airlocks on a crew modules, which would be particularly useful for the 6-way Mk III Node and the 2-way Habitat / Science / Logistics / Utility modules - at the moment, however, the airlock behaviour isn\u0027t really consistent - sometimes one may select one hatch, only for the Kerbal to appear on the opposite side (possibly a mismatch between where the EVA dialog thinks it\u0027s referring to and where the Kerbal will actually spawn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the hatch obstruction test, unfortunately our old friend \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/1313\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EBug #1313\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E once again rears its ugly head; because the hatches are more than 1 metre away from the origin of the part, the airlock obstruction colliders fail to detect the presence of the B9 decouplers that should otherwise be blocking the hatches, causing Kerbals to still spawn and clip into said decoupler. For those of you who prefer words to pictures, have a bone:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://th03.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2014/060/3/b/ksp_fustek_karmony_node_mkiii_origin_and_obstr_by_sumghai-d78k1fi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp_fustek_karmony_node_mkiii_origin_and_obstr_by_sumghai-d78k1fi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFig 46\u003C/strong\u003E - FusTek Karmony Node Mk III - Part Origins and Hatch Obstruction Issue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as you can see, unless SQUAD fixes Bug #1313, you\u0027ll never get properly-balanced FusTek parts - even the hamfisted part origin/CoMOffset workaround I\u0027m currently using will mean that only the top hatch will have proper obstruction checking, while the other hatches will keep spawning Kerbals, smashing into docking port colliders or other modules and blowing your stations to kingdom come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn conclusion\u003C/strong\u003E, for the time being I won\u0027t be able to do multiple airlocks per module or fix the hokey part balance issue. My efforts are best concentrated on stuff I can fix (like redoing UV maps to allow nothke-style non-repeating texture atlases)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
