Joenie\u0027s tongue poked out of the corner of her mouth as she discarded the green pencil and picked up a brown one instead. The kerbal rapidly acquired a thick shock of hair and a pair of eyebrows, that in another era, would have been the height of fashion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle watched her daughter proudly. \u003Cem\u003EAlmost all in between the lines now, especially around the eyes.

Gerselle ruffled her hair. \u201CDon\u0027t be silly, sweetheart - you know Ferry.\u0022\u00A0She looked apologetically at her visitor. \u201CSorry, Ferry - she was expecting somebody else.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry chuckled. \u201CWas it Adbas you were looking for then, Joenie?\u0022\u00A0He reached into his pack, and produced a large glass bottle full of pale golden liquid. \u201CI\u0027m a bit big to be Adbas, but I did bring some juice for your daddy. Would you like some too?\u0022\u00A0He grinned at Gerselle\u0027s raised eyebrow. \u201CFresh prickleberry juice - nothing stronger than that. First pressing was a mite late this year, but we still laid down a good cellar-full.

Jonton made sure of that.\u0022There was an odd catch in her voice. \u201CIt took a lot out of him. Please, Ferry - we\u0027ll explain later - just don\u0027t say anything in front of Joenie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry looked at her. \u003Cem\u003EI don\u0027t like the sound of this.\u003C/em\u003E \u201COf course I won\u0027t\u0022\u00A0\u00A0he said carefully. \u201CNo sense in getting her all het up too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle turned away, took three plain glasses out of a cupboard and arranged them on a tray.

Look at me, Ferry!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry looked at him muzzily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStay with us, Ferry. Stay for dinner, and we can talk about this later, once Joenie\u0027s gone to bed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe leaves snapped back into place, just before Joenie dashed in waving a cup. Ferry took a deep breath, pasted a smile onto his face, and retrieved the bottle of prickleberry juice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, thought Ferry, it had been a very pleasant evening. Gerselle\u0027s cooking was still as good as ever, and Joenie had been happily chattering away to everybody, and wanting to taste everything that the adult kerbals were eating. He smiled to himself; even the spicier dips hadn\u0027t fazed her, although the greenleaf and chicory puree had turned out to be a strictly one-taste dish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJudging by the giggles and splashing from next door, bath time was going well too; perhaps a little too well if Gerselle\u0027s suddenly raised voice was anything to go by.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir conversation was studiously light hearted, flitting from village news, to the current progress of the space programme, to the latest sporting events. Privately, Ferry thought that Jonton\u0027s talk of a M\u00FCn landing was rather far-fetched, although they both agreed that the M\u00FCn would be a fine place to host the Net-Ball Cup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAndbo Kerman had best look out,\u0022\u00A0chuckled Ferry. \u201CThat kerbal can get some serious speed off the nets - he\u0027d probably launch himself straight back into space if he was trying for a four-point-hang on the M\u00FCn!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton snorted laughter into his coffee cup. \u201CYou\u0027d need a net over the nets to catch him,\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh yeh!,\u0022\u00A0said Ferry, \u201CCall it a six-point-hang if you manage to score from there!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe door swung open, and a fluffy-haired, pyjama-clad Joenie scampered in, followed by a decidedly damp looking Gerselle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNight, night, Daddy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmiling, Jonton leaned forward, \u201CNight, night, sweetheart. Does Daddy get a kiss?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie stretched up on her tiptoes. \u201CMummy, help?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle scooped up her daughter and held her out for Jonton to kiss goodnight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNight, night, Joenie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the door closed, Ferry could just make out Gerselle\u0027s resigned voice. \u201CWouldn\u0027t you like another book, sweetheart? We read Treebie\u0027s Tricycle\u00A0last night.\u0022\u00A0He glanced at Jonton out of the corner of his eye and wasn\u0027t at all surprised by the wistful look on his Keeper\u0027s face. \u003Cem\u003EBet he doesn\u0027t get to read many bedtime stories from here.\u003C/em\u003E After a tactful minute or two, he cleared his throat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo...what happened, Jonton?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s a long story,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton sombrely. Donman\u0027s voice echoed in his memory: \u003Cem\u003EYou may consider your unreserved cooperation to be a mandate from the Council\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u201CI\u0027m not too sure where to start to be honest.\u0022\u00A0He straightened up. \u201CDo you remember the sunfruit field, Ferry?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry shuddered. \u201CNot ever going to forget it,\u0022\u00A0he replied, \u201CNever saw anything like it in me life, and I hope I never do again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CI\u0027d never seen anything like it either,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CBut as soon as I did, I knew that that\u0027s what the matter was.\u0022\u00A0He paused.\u00A0\u201CSorry, Ferry - that wouldn\u0027t make much sense. In the weeks before the sunfruit harvest, the Kerm seemed be getting worried about something, but I didn\u0027t know what. I spent long nights Communing, but it wouldn\u0027t - or couldn\u0027t - tell me what was wrong.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CToo many nights I\u0027d\u00A0say,\u0022\u00A0said Ferry. He finished his coffee. \u201CI remember that part too - you looked like you hadn\u0027t slept for a month when I came to get you that morning.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CI \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003Efelt\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E like I hadn\u0027t slept for a month,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton. His leaves rustled agitatedly. \u201CThe Kerm was \u003Cem\u003Escared\u003C/em\u003E, Ferry. I tried asking it about the sunfruit, but even thinking about them just sent it into a blind panic. No matter what I tried, I just couldn\u0027t get it to understand what I was asking.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe bowed his head. \u201CThirty-seven Kerm couldn\u0027t understand - but I thought that thirty-eight might be able to.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry choked. \u201CYou thought \u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E?\u0022\u00A0he spluttered. \u201CTell me you didn\u0027t do it, Jonton, Please tell me you didn\u0027t!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowly, Jonton shook his head, \u201CI wish I could,\u0022\u00A0he whispered. \u201CI planted one more tree, Ferry. Just one more - but that was enough.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry listened in revulsion, and then a mounting horror, to Jonton\u0027s description of the black-spotted leaves, the shattered Kerm, and his desperate attempt to save it. The horror grudgingly gave way to a feigned, and then a genuine pity, as Jonton recounted the struggle to hold onto his sanity, and the realisation that surrender was the only way to ensure the survival of Kerm and village alike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell that part worked at any rate,\u0022\u00A0said Ferry lamely. \u201CThe village I mean.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s getting better,\u0022\u00A0agreed Jonton, \u201Cbut it\u0027s going to take an awful long time yet before I have everything worked out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBefore \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E have everything worked out?\u0022\u00A0said Ferry, \u201CI thought the Kerm looked after the fields, not the Keeper?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut that\u0027s what I was trying to tell you,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton patiently, \u201CThere\u0027s no difference any more - it\u0027s just me.\u0022\u00A0He pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201CIf it helps, think of me as a Kerm of thirty eight trees\u00A0and one kerbal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry stared at him. \u201CHow does that feel?\u0022\u00A0he said at last. \u003Cem\u003EKerm, but you\u0027re coming out with the cliches here, Ferry.\u003C/em\u003E he thought sardonically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COld,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton. \u201CLike a lily pad floating on a deep pond. Like an ancient kerbal on a raft, in the middle of a stormy sea. Like one of those pictures of Kerbin drifting in space.\u0022\u00A0He rubbed his eyes. \u201CI\u0027m not explaining this very well am I?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot really,\u0022\u00A0admitted Ferry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton sighed. \u201CI\u0027m old, Ferry. Or, if you like, the Kerm \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E old and now I \u003Cem\u003Eam\u003C/em\u003E old. Vast wells of memories, the experience of hundreds and hundreds of years spent tending the land, not to mention shared memories from all the Keepers before me. The memories are all mine, or they will be once I can make some sense of them. The experience...well I\u0027m trying to absorb that as quickly as I can for the sake of this year\u0027s harvest!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked at his friend thoughtfully. \u201CI think I can give you some idea of what it\u0027s like. How do you walk, Ferry?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry paced up and down. \u201CLike this,\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton smiled. \u201CYes, but what makes you walk. \u003Cem\u003EHow\u003C/em\u003E do you walk?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry frowned. \u201CLeg muscles pulling on tendons, pulling on bones, making my legs move,\u0022\u00A0he said at last. \u201CIf you\u0027re being picky, my brain passes nerve impulses to my muscles to make them move.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd how does \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E work? Where do those nerve impulses start. How do \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E decide to start them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry\u0027s mouth opened and closed as he grappled with the question. \u201CI don\u0027t know,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CI just do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExactly.\u0022\u00A0said Jonton, \u201CYou just do. Now imagine that instead of just getting up and walking, you have to consciously control every single step - if you\u0027ll excuse the pun - of moving one muscle of one leg. Now think about moving the whole leg, then both legs together in harmony. Not to mention the hundreds of other tiny posture changes and shifts of weight that keep you balanced while you\u0027re doing all this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked at his friend wryly. \u201CThat just \u003Cem\u003Ebegins\u003C/em\u003E to describe what it feels like to look after the fields. Thousands of little tweaks and balances that were instinctive for the Kerm - and that I\u0027m learning from scratch. Some of it\u0027s starting to get a bit easier, but I don\u0027t really have much of a muscle memory for it all yet - so to speak.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe door creaked open and Gerselle padded into the room. She caught Jonton\u0027s eye and raised a finger to her lips. Jonton smiled. \u201CHow many Treebies did it take tonight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle laughed softly. \u201COnly three tonight. It was the extra drink of water, the second moss room stop and all the toys wanting to say goodnight to Mummy that took all the time. Sorry, Ferry - kerblet talk.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry shook his head. \u201CNot a problem, Gerselle - I was kilometres away anyway.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle nodded in understanding. \u201CJonton explained everything then?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe certainly tried to,\u0022\u00A0said Ferry. \u201CI still haven\u0027t made up my mind whether he\u0027s a hero, an idiot, or just plain criminally reckless.\u0022\u00A0He looked at them both. \u201CI\u0027m not the only one wondering where he\u0027s been for the last few weeks either.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton glanced at Gerselle. \u201CI know,\u0022\u00A0he said quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey\u0027re going to ask me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know that too - and I don\u0027t want you to cover for me, Ferry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe early morning sun shone through the Kerm leaves outside, dappling the kitchen wall with shifting blotches of light. Fragrant djeng steam mingled with the smell of wildflowers from the garden and the sweetly aromatic scent of stewed fruit cooling on the stove, lulling Gerselle into a half doze. She smiled at the distant clatter of blocks from the sleep room that heralded the collapse of another masterpiece of kerblet architecture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAll this, and an evening off too. A whole evening free from kerblet and Kerm.\u003C/em\u003E Her eyes crinkled.\u003Cem\u003EFree from my little Kerm anyway.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe quiet was broken by a sudden knock at the door and almost immediately afterwards by the patter of kerblet feet and the all too familiar cry of \u201CAdbas! Adbas!\u0022\u00A0Gerselle groaned, put her book down, and went to investigate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, sweetheart. you\u0027re going to see Adbas \u003Cem\u003Etonight\u003C/em\u003E. Please let Mummy through.\u0022\u00A0She picked Joenie up, and opened the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMorning, Gerselle. We\u0027re here to see Jonton.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle stared at the crowd of kerbals on her doorstep. All of them seemed to be carrying something, including Fredlorf, who was holding a large and efficient looking saw. Her eyes widened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo! You can\u0027t. Whatever you do to him, you can\u0027t cut him loose!\u0022\u00A0Frantically, she searched for Ferry in the sea of faces. \u201CTell them, Ferry! If you cut him loose, he\u0027ll die!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFredlorf stared at her, dumbfounded. \u201CWhat in the world are you babblin\u0027\u00A0about, girl? We aint about to do any cuttin\u0027\u00A0on Jonton.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle gaped at him. \u201CB...but the saw?\u0022\u00A0She gestured feebly over his shoulder. \u201CAnd everything else?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFiggered we\u0027d help him with a little building work is all,\u0022\u00A0said Fredlorf, \u201CLeast we could do for the kerbal - world needs more Keepers like that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh,\u0022\u00A0said Gerselle faintly, cheeks flushing dark green.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAye,\u0022\u00A0said Fredlorf, \u201CTold us everything, Ferry did. Yer Jonton\u0027s a damn hero, if you\u0027re askin\u0027\u00A0me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a general murmur of agreement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle blinked. \u201CUm, you\u0027d all better come in then. I shall let Jonton know you\u0027re here to see him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the morning whirled past in a blur of kerbals, sawdust and noise. Under the watchful eye of the village joiner, two serious looking young kerbals measured up Jonton and Gerselle\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s sleep room, before setting up a pair of workbenches outside and setting to work with saws and planes. After a brief consultation with Gerselle, Fredlorf led another pair of kerbals outside, all three equipped with spades, pry bars and other tools. Meanwhile, a steady stream of volunteers trudged up their garden path, carrying pieces of timber, rolls of fabric, tins, sections of pipe and much else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle spent most of the morning chasing Joenie from room to room, trying to keep the over-excited kerblet out from under everyone\u0027s feet. Eventually, she gave up, and after a hasty conference with Jonton, went to fetch Joenie\u0027s coat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCome on, sweetheart. Let\u0027s go for a walk and leave these nice kerbals to their work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe younger of the two joiner\u0027s apprentices looked a little disappointed at that. Joenie glanced at her mother, and then carried on playing with the long curly wood shavings piling up around her. Gerselle counted to five under her breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJoenie - if you put your coat on like a good girl, we can have honey crackers from the shop.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment she was roundly ignored, but then Joenie looked up inquisitively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCrackers?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s right,\u0022\u00A0said Gerselle, \u201CHoney crackers from the shop. And then, if you\u0027re a really good girl, we can go find your favourite place by the river before we go to Adbas\u0027s house for tea.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie\u0027s face brightened at the mention of her friend. \u201CSticks, Mummy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course we can play stick races - but only if you\u0027re a good girl.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie grabbed a handful of shavings and bounced to her feet, holding her arms out. Deftly, Gerselle slipped her daughter\u0027s coat on and buttoned it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why don\u0027t you let Mummy carry the shavings?\u0022\u00A0she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie shook her head firmly. \u201CMine!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFine,\u0022\u00A0sighed Gerselle, \u201CCome on then, sweetheart. Let\u0027s go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time Gerselle came home later that afternoon, most of the volunteers had left. She found Fredlorf, Ferry and the older crafts-kerbals sitting around Jonton, sipping mugs of djeng and looking quietly pleased with themselves. Gerselle stared around in delight. The afternoon sun shone through a pair of sturdy looking sliding doors, which opened onto a spacious verandah. Inside, a slender pedestal supported a shallow stone bowl within convenient reach of Jonton.

Gerselle politely showed them to the door, thanking them again for all their work. As Ferry left, Gerselle caught his eye and flashed him a brief, wordless look of gratitude. Ferry glanced around and then quickly dipped his head in acknowledgement. As the last of her unexpected guests disappeared around the bend in the path, Gerselle closed the door and went back to her new sleep room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton watched her examine the new doors, run a finger around the edge of his water bowl and then stare out at the new verandah, rocking back and forth on her heels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey even motorised the doors for me,\u0022\u00A0he offered quietly.

She walked over to the bed, lay down and braced herself. She heard the doors rumble closed and then sensed the faint rustling of leaves behind her.

Tiny trains of electrical impulses raced along them, triggering elaborate biochemical cascades deep within. At their tips, microvesicles burst open, spilling out complex molecular keys to unlock the way through skin and membranes. Glycoprotein chains twisted about each other, tightening, contracting, steering the leaf hairs through microchannels in bone and brain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHair after hair slipped into place.

Ultimately of course, they\u0027re obliged to respect the Right of their citizens, but simply being listened to and taken seriously by government is enough to pacify most kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-24T08:08:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2014 08:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-24T20:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JakeGrey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JakeGrey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGreat stuff as ever.

Dusk lent a false perspective to the landscape, hiding the rocky beach and the scrubland behind it, and masking the woodlands in the shadows. Instead, the jagged peaks seemed to enfold the cove on all three sides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn deck, willing hands unrolled nets, rigged block and tackle, and readied the winches. Below decks, their shipmates heaved barrels and other, much larger containers up from the hold. Some of them were painted a bright phosphorescent green and knocked hollowly against bulkheads and gangways alike. Once on deck, the containers were carefully laid out on the nets, before being strung together into a loose raft. Finally, a gang of sweating kerbals deposited the spare anchor onto the net and made the end of its chain fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first mate inspected the couplings. Satisfied, he called out an order. The winches whined, pulling cables taut over pulleys, gathering the net into a mighty sling and swinging it out over the rail. Another terse order and the sling descended rapidly towards the water, slowed as it broke the surface and then stopped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe winch operator released a cable. The sling sagged, spilling its contents into the sea in a great splashing rumble. The anchor sank without trace, swiftly dragging the containers beneath the surface. The mate peered over the side, nodded and held up one finger. The winch thrummed, pulling the dripping net back on deck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that could be seen of the raft were the green barrels, soaking up the rays from the setting sun, and bobbing gently on the evening tide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan gazed around the grassy hollow. The control tower was still visible over the hedge, but that was the only sign of the busy airfield nearby. Birds chirped and whistled in the stillness and thin streaks of cloud were the only thing to mar the perfect blue sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the bottom of the dip stood a row of tall wooden poles. Some of them were wrapped in a dense profusion of neatly trimmed sweetblossom vines. On others, the vines had only started to take hold and the underlying trellises could be seen, winding their way upwards. The one nearest to him was bare - dark brown latticework standing stark against the stripped white pole. A loose semicircle of benches had been arranged around it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere and there, small knots of soberly dressed kerbals stood talking amongst themselves, their murmured words barely audible even in the hush. Others sat on the benches, staring at the ground, lost in their thoughts. Lodan sat down on an empty bench, well away from everyone else. A few of the bystanders looked at him curiously, but mercifully, none of them showed any signs of recognising the KSA director.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne by one, a steady trickle of other kerbals made their way down into the hollow and took their places on the benches. Lodan looked up at a sudden clinking noise, and saw two of them carrying a small casket, followed by a third dressed in formal robes and carrying a pair of spades, crossed in front of her chest. Lodan sat up straight, eyes fixed on the small procession as they made their way to the pole. Silently, the last few groups dispersed and took their seats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe robed officiant cleared her throat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood kerbals. We are gathered here today to celebrate the life and mourn the passing of Enley Kerman.

Solemnly, they began to dig out a small trench at the foot of the trellised pole. Slowly, the officiant got to her feet. She withdrew a carved wooden figurine from inside her robes and held it up to the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike us all, Enley was a child of the Kerm. And though his body was not returned to us, this poor marker shall stand in its stead. For it too is of the Kerm, and also of Enley\u0027s Grove.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two casket bearers put down their spades. The officiant stepped forward, knelt, and gently placed the figurine into the trench. The two bearers opened the casket lid and tipped out its contents. A cascade of rich, red soil tumbled out, a splash of colour against the darker earth of the hollow. All three kerbals stepped back and bowed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone on the benches, Lodan included, lowered their eyes. The rhythmic thudding of spade against earth punctuated the silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEnley meant many things to each of us. He was a dear colleague, an inspirational instructor, a beloved friend. If anyone here today wishes to speak, to share their memories of him, we would be honoured to hear your words.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA tall, sandy haired kerbal stepped forward. The officiant smiled at him, and handed him a round, waxy seed. Silently, the kerbal planted the seed beneath the trellised pole, then turned to face everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood kerbals. My name is Lars, and I am Enley\u0027s brother.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEver since he was a kerblet, Enley was fascinated by making things fly. Paper darts, kites, model airplanes, anything he could get his hands on. His sleep room always used to smell of glue, wood shavings and something else that I could never identify. I just remember that it tickled my throat and made me cough.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe all knew that Enley would go kerman, and we were enormously proud - and not at all surprised - when he won his place at the Institute and went on to earn his first pilot\u0027s license. I still remember that day - and the first time he took me flying...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan watched as family members, fellow pilots and the occasional manager or other colleague from C7, all stepped up to plant a sweetblossom seed and share their recollections of Enley. There was a final minute of silence, and then, one by one, everyone filed out of the graveyard, leaving him alone on the bench.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe jumped at the tap on his shoulder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDirector?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan peered up at a stern faced, grey haired kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAl Kerman, head of C7 Special Projects division.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan stood up and offered his hand. The two kerbals studied each other for a moment. Involuntarily, Lodan\u0027s eyes dropped to the lapel pin on Al\u0027s jacket. Al followed his gaze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAye, Director,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CI\u0027m too slow for modern aircraft but I tested my share back in the day.

Lodan glanced at Al\u0027s set expression and felt uncharacteristically nervous. \u003Cem\u003EBetter say something Lodan.

Enley knew exactly what he was getting into - as far as he was concerned, the risks were worth it too. He competed \u003Cem\u003Ehard\u003C/em\u003E for that assignment, and believe me, the C7 test pilots ain\u0027t easy competitors. \u003Cem\u003EEspecially\u003C/em\u003E the Skyhawk pilots.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two kerbals crested the rise and set out across the airfield towards the main hanger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEnley had ambitions far beyond the Skyhawk programme,\u0022\u00A0Al continued. Sub-orbital is one thing, but everyone here knows that being the first kerbal to fly into \u003Cem\u003Eorbit\u003C/em\u003E is the real prize.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan blinked. \u201CBut kerbals have already flown into orbit,\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u0022\u00A0said Al, \u201CThey haven\u0027t.\u0022\u00A0He held up a hand. \u201CNot disparaging the kerbonauts, Director. They do good work once they\u0027re up there, and there ain\u0027t a one of them that wouldn\u0027t be welcome on this airfield. But being fired into space on top of a stack of fuel tanks is not flying.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI presume,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan carefully, \u201Cthat piloting the Steadler Lifting Body wouldn\u0027t be flying either?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAl snorted, \u201CNot even if they get it to work,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CThat...vehicle, is a long string of accidents waiting to happen, and it still needs a rocket to get it off the ground. No, Director. Runway to orbit and back - \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E is the only proper way to fly into space.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA tall order,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt is,\u0022\u00A0agreed Al, \u201Cbut possible.\u0022He unclipped his name card from his jacket and pushed it into a slot in the hanger door. Lodan heard the distinctive clunk of heavy locking bolts withdrawing and the door swung open a centimetre. Al led the way inside, pulling it closed behind him, with an equally solid clunk. A pair of red lights on the door frame winked out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside was a bare, concrete block corridor, harshly lit by fluorescent strip lights. The far end was blocked by another security door, which opened to Al\u0027s name card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo Lodan\u0027s surprise, the door led out into an enclosed yard, which was largely occupied by an extremely heavy looking test stand. An jet engine was mounted on it, it\u0027s nozzle shrouded by a long, tapered steel drum. Heavily insulated pipes connected the drum to a nearby cryogenic stand. An equally heavy duty fuel lines emerged from a concrete wall near the stand and connected to an opening in the engine casing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAl was watching him. \u0022So what do you think, Director?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m not entirely sure,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan slowly. \u201CIt looks like a jet engine - which I suppose makes sense - but why are you injecting cryogens into the exhaust?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027re not,\u0022\u00A0said Al.\u00A0\u201CThe jet is just a convenient way of producing a lot of very fast, very hot gas. The cryogens are for cooling the heat exchanger. Tell me, Director - have you heard of the Wernher cycle?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan shook his head. \u201CI recognise the name of course,\u0022he said, \u201Cbut I suspect I\u0027m thinking of a different kerbal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the first time that afternoon, Al allowed himself a faint smile. \u201CActually, I don\u0027t think you are,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CBefore he turned his attention to rockets, your Wernher was an Institute expert in high altitude, hypersonic propulsion. The Wernher cycle was his proposed design for an extremely high performance, dual mode hydrogen engine. At low to medium altitudes it was a normal air breather, but at high altitudes it would switch to an onboard liquid oxygen supply. Wernher designed it for extreme range, extreme altitude flight - effectively the same sub-orbital regime that we\u0027re pursuing with \u003Cem\u003ESkyhawk\u003C/em\u003E - but theoretically it was capable of orbital velocities.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTheoretically?\u0022\u00A0said Lodan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAl nodded. \u201CIt was an elegant design, but the practicalities of building it...were substantial. The main problem was that to make the engine light - and efficient - enough, the intake air had to be cooled. And nobody could ever figure out a way of doing \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E without making the engine unworkably complex or impracticably heavy. So the Wernher Engine joined the long and dusty list of Institute designs that only worked on paper.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan knew a prompt when he heard one. \u201CUntil now I presume,\u0022\u00A0he said dryly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUntil now,\u0022\u00A0agreed Al. \u201CWe\u0027ve got a long way to go, but the hard part - the intake cooler - works! We can fire that jet engine directly into our heat exchanger - and what we get out is cold enough to freeze your hand solid.\u0022\u00A0He motioned Lodan over to an inspection hatch in the side of the drum.

The heavily modified vessel in the dry dock was only marginally less ugly; a fishing boat with pretensions to being a warship. The newly armoured hull squatted sullenly on its supporting blocks, whilst kerbal work crews swarmed over it, loading supplies, painting the outboard weapon tubes and working on the newly installed fore and aft mounted deck guns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeilbin shook his head. \u003Cem\u003EDoesn\u0027t matter how much sauce you add - you\u0027ll never turn herring into bluefish.

And just like the fish they\u0027re named after, they can swim off and defend their slow, lumbering old mother.\u0022\u00A0He shook his head. \u201CShort of building something new from scratch, it\u0027s the best we can do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeilbin grimaced. \u201CCoastal cutters and re-jigged fishing boats,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CIt\u0027s not much of a defence if Doren decides it does want Humilisia.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027ll have to do,\u0022\u00A0said Gusden grimly. \u201CWe do have one advantage, Envoy - we got there first. There aren\u0027t too many places to land on those blasted islands, and a fingrillin or two should handle any landing craft nicely.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLet\u0027s hope it doesn\u0027t come to that,\u0022\u00A0said Neilbin sadly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAgreed,\u0022\u00A0said Gusden, \u201CWe\u0027re stepping up the supply runs though, just in case. Luckily for us, the albacore are shoaling at the moment, so the Doreni shouldn\u0027t notice a couple of extra fishing boats around Humilisia. Using that cove as a harbour shouldn\u0027t raise any eyebrows either, although the skippers still keep both eyes on the horizon when dropping off the goods.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeilbin shuddered. \u201CAnd then the colonists retrieve them after dark.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat they do,\u0022\u00A0said Gusden heavily, \u201CCold, wet, hard work, but there\u0027s no other way I can think of doing it without getting the Doreni all curious.\u0022\u00A0He grinned savagely. \u201CIf it\u0027s any comfort, I\u0027ve issued a standing order to hang a couple of barrels of something suitably warming on the supply rafts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKilometre after kilometre of fields rolled steadily past, and Gusemy began to wonder just how large the Berelgan really was. Most of the fields were carefully laid out grids, tiled with hundreds of variations of a single crop. As far as Gusemy could see, there were fields devoted to every food plant he knew - and a good few that he had never seen in his life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the tiles were obviously different to their neighbours, even seen from a speeding car. Others were apparently identical, although Gusemy presumed that the differences would be more obvious from up close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHmph - or maybe not,\u003C/em\u003E he thought. \u003Cem\u003EHard to tell what a tuber looks like unless you go digging. Even harder to tell what it tastes like.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterspersed between the grids were other, more normal looking fields. Others had seemingly been left to fallow, if the proliferation of weeds and wildflowers were anything to go by. Still others had obviously been deliberately planted, but not with any sort of rhyme or reason that Gusemy could see. Small copses of trees and the occasional low roofed building broke the monotony, and hedgerows large and small festooned the landscape, marking out roads and separating one field from the next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENot many Kerm though for somewhere this size.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe glint of sun on glass caught his eye. \u003Cem\u003EAbout time! Hmmm, next right, then first left.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe turning to the left was marked by a large brick archway, turreted and crenelated, although Gusemy suspected that they were intended for decoration rather than defence. The old fashioned wrought iron gates were open and the gatehouse was empty. Gusemy drove through unchallenged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe road twisted and turned through a patch of woodland, before emerging into open pasture. Long horned creva stared placidly at him as he passed by, the soft purr of his car not loud enough to startle them. Ahead of him was a cluster of grand old buildings, built in the same style as the gate and surrounded by elaborate formal gardens and incongruously modern glasshouses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHuh - no Kerm at all here.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA drystone marker post pointed the way to the car park. Gusemy shrugged inwardly, pulled up in the nearest space and got out of the car. His nose wrinkled at the earthy smell of creva dung, and other less identifiable rural smells. \u003Cem\u003EI guess you get used to it in time. \u003C/em\u003EChecking his map, he locked the car door and set off towards the largest of the brick buildings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin was waiting for him on the steps. \u201CAmbassador Gusemy - welcome to the Berelgan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy grinned. \u201CDon\u0027t you Ambassador\u00A0me, Erlin - or should I say Professor Erlin! Congratulations on the new post.\u0022\u00A0He flicked his fingers at the glasshouses and surrounding gardens. \u201CQuite a place you\u0027ve wound up in. I had no idea it was so \u003Cem\u003Ebig\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin chuckled. \u201CMost of it is agricultural research, crop development, that sort of thing. Different world entirely. Us poor lab scientists are mostly confined to the house and gardens.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI feel for your suffering,\u0022\u00A0laughed Gusemy, \u201CBut what\u0027s a botanist doing stuck up here? I thought agricultural research was your department?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh it is,\u0022\u00A0said Erlin, \u201Cbut there\u0027s a limit to what you can do in the field. Most of my work is in Kerm micro-ecology these days, trying to unpick exactly how they direct and control their soil environment.\u0022\u00A0He grinned. \u201CI\u0027m more a chemist than a botanist these days - and you remember how good I was at chemistry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy stared around in mock horror. \u201CI\u0027m surprised to see everything still in one piece,\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin laughed good-naturedly. \u201CCan\u0027t do too much damage with LC preps or a gas chromatograph,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CMaking coffee is about the closest I get to wet chemistry. Speaking of which, you look like a kerbal in need of coffee, especially after that drive. Come on in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs he followed Erlin through the maze of corridors, Gusemy reflected that the old fashioned manor house buildings were concealing very modern - and extremely well equipped - laboratories. \u003Cem\u003EFor all Erlin\u0027s talk of chemistry, I\u0027m not seeing many glassware-and-bottle labs either.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI was wondering about that on the way up,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CThe Kerm I mean. There didn\u0027t seem to be very many around for a place this size?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin looked at him. \u201CThere aren\u0027t,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CThis \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E the Berelgan after all.\u0022\u00A0He raised his eyebrows at Gusemy\u0027s puzzled look. \u201CThe original Institute was intended as a place to study botany away from the Kerm. Started in the Age of Sail, I believe, although there\u0027s nothing left from that era. Fortunately - from a scientific point of view - it\u0027s remained largely Kerm free ever since, making it one of the few places on Kerbin where we can study them properly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy\u0027s expression cleared. \u201CI suppose that makes sense,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CNegative controls and all that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin pushed open his office door. \u201CPrecisely,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CNow - on to more important matters. Black or white?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin put down his empty cup with a happy sigh. \u201CThat\u0027s better,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CNothing like a little caffeine to get the brain moving.\u0022\u00A0He eyed Gusemy thoughtfully. \u201CAnd that little conundrum you sent me, took a whole lot of coffee to work through.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy sat bolt upright. \u201CYou found an answer?!\u0022\u00A0he exclaimed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf sorts,\u0022\u00A0said Erlin, \u201CThe last Seeding was several hundred years ago after all, and even the Berelgan archives get rather patchy when you go that far back. But, as far as I can work out - thirty to forty\u00A0years.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy\u0027s mouth dropped open. \u201CFrom beginning to end?\u0022\u00A0he asked faintly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin nodded. \u201CI\u0027d expect a normal distribution,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CSlow ramp up, exponential growth, hitting a peak about 20 years in, then tailing off. Probably some outliers still seeding after forty years but not many.\u0022\u00A0He studied Gusemy\u0027s suddenly bloodless face curiously, and then comprehension dawned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u0027ve found one haven\u0027t you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy couldn\u0027t speak for a moment. \u201CMore than one,\u0022he muttered hoarsely. \u201CThat is, definitely one, and - we think - proof of more.\u0022\u00A0His voice shook. \u201CHave you been following news of the Blight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe have,\u0022\u00A0said Erlin, \u201Cand \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E is a whole other conundrum.

The archives are \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E definite about keeping Kerm apart, but I couldn\u0027t find out why.
