The stages all show nothing and 0 m/s, and the burn time is in red but shows no timer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would paste a screenshot into this but I can only insert URL\u0027s and I have no idea how to go about doing that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the resources tab I can still guess how much fuel I have left (bit hard since it counts both the tug and the lander together) but it\u0027s seriously annoying and not knowing the burn time reduces my efficiency by a lot.
