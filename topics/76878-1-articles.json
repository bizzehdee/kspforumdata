When a satellite nears the end of its useful life, it must be moved out of the most heavily populated orbits so as not to pose a threat to other satellites. Since equatorial GEO is the most coveted space but old satellites don\u0027t have enough dV to deorbit or escape completely, they are put in a nearby graveyard orbit (about 200km farther out, typically).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe satellites in these graveyard orbits suffer natural perturbations, which cause their inclination to oscillate since active stationkeeping no longer takes place. Each individual satellite has its inclination vary between 0 and 15 degrees over a period of about 55 years*.
