One thing I haven\u0027t seen any mod do is calculate what throttle position is needed at each altitude to remain under terminal velocity. With and without FAR. Then show a graph of it or such.

In stock you have to power through the soup-o-sphere as quickly as possible. FAR users seldom launch at terminal velocity because it would be incredibly difficult to control at those speeds in low atmosphere and at high atmosphere, it\u0027s pretty much irrelevant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
