Is your save a Career, or Science mode game, or are you in Sandbox mode?  If you are in a Career or Science game mode then the parts may not show up  if you haven\u0027t unlocked the necessary tech nodes.  If you are in Sandbox mode, however, they would be showing up barring an installation or other issue.  Also, do you have any other mods besides Modular Rocket Systems installed?\n\nMake sure that the folder you put into \u0022KSP\\_osx/GameData\u0022 is the \u0022ShadowWorks\u0022 folder from the download located at \u0022ShadowWorks\\_Stockalike\\_SLS\\_1\\_3\\_1/GameData/ShadowWorks\u0022.  If you did that correctly then your KSP GameData folder should have a folder called \u0022ShadowWorks\u0022 in their with the \u0022Squad\u0022 folder and any other mod folders you have installed.  Inside that ShadowWorks folder should be four (4) folders and two (2) ModuleManager configs that won\u0027t be used if you don\u0027t have ModuleManager, or the mods they reference.  So it should look something like this:\n\nKSP\\_osx  \n\n     GameData  \n\n          ShadowWorks  \n\n                \\_ShadowWorks\\_RealChutes.cfg  \n\n                \\_ShadowWorks\\_RealPlume.cfg  \n\n                Flags  \n\n                Parts  \n\n                Props  \n\n                Spaces  \n\n          Squad\n\nIf you want to post pictures, the best way is to sign up for an Imgur account or some other image hosting service and upload them there.  Then to put them in a post, copy the URL of the image and click the \u0022Insert other media\u0022 button in the bottom left of the post editor and select \u0022insert image from URL\u0022, then just paste the URL of the image and click the button.\n\nI\u0027m sorry that you\u0027re still having trouble getting the mod installed and working."},{"CreatedByName":"Dr.K Kerbal","CreatedById":156864,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T06:50:22Z","Content":"Thanks for trying though. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"RoketMan","CreatedById":148731,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-23T17:54:41Z","Content":"Either my internet is slow today, or Kerbal Stuff is down. . . ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif \u0022:confused:\u0022) OK, CKAN said error, Kerbal stuff is down!

The grid marks are ladders, so you shouldn\u0027t need to attach ladders of your own.\n\nI had a look at the Odyssey Airlock and realized to my horror that I had not given it any crew capacity, so it could never perform the task it was meant to fulfill.  I also realized that it has an engine staging icon (that\u0027s what I get for editing other cfgs to make new ones).  To fix the airlock, open the config located in \u0022ShadowWorks/Parts/StationParts/OdysseyAirlock/OdysseyAirlock.cfg\u0022 and change \u0022stagingIcon = LIQUID\\_ENGINE\u0022 to \u0022CrewCapacity = 2\u0022.  You should then be able to right-click the science module (Destiny) and select \u0022Transfer Crew\u0022 to transfer one or two kerbals to the Odyssey airlock and EVA from there.\n\nWith SpaceDock up and running I\u0027ll get the mod on there and include the change to this and a slight change to the RealChutes config (it could cause problems in its current state if you don\u0027t have RealChutes, thanks to Moarmau5 for catching this issue.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos Rast","CreatedById":157420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T02:45:53Z","Content":"Rock on, thought it was just me.
