Whenever I open and play Kerbal in full screen mode, the screen glitches and gets covered in red lines. Attempting to screen shot it clears the problem, but as soon as I click something again, the screen glitches again. I\u0027ve posted a link to a google drive file of a short video of it occurring. I deleted all my Kerbal files some time ago, mods and all, so to my knowledge this is a fresh install of Kerbal. Whenever it is not in full screen mode, I do not have this problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1cjeP85_IcKf1xYhwud3Qj6_ESqT35OES/view?usp=sharing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ksweetie","CreatedById":201858,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-16T23:26:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same thing is happening to me, also on a late 2019 MacBook Pro.
