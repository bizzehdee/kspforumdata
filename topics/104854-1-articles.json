I\u0027m reporting my own post for this one-time request for staff help... please change my username to Wolfwood. If that\u0027s not available, I\u0027ll accept DestyNova, NickDWolfwood, or Kagame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, now that\u0027s out of the way...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a recent transplant from the Minecraft community, so it\u0027s quite refreshing to see proper English once again. Other than KSP, I play FreeFallTournament (think Mario Universe meets Unreal Tournament), various Flash games, and the occasional RPG. I\u0027m into anime, movies, sci-fi, whatever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of what I do in KSP is Sandbox mode lately, because I am decidedly crap at running a kerbal space program. However, I seem to have developed an affinity for making KSP models of German \u003Cem\u003EWunderwaffe\u003C/em\u003E, or wonder weapons. Think V-1 and V-2. Except I\u0027ve never produced a flyable V-1 (though I haven\u0027t tried with FAR), and can\u0027t be bothered to make a V-2 because it\u0027s just... a rocket. Kind of boring, honestly. Instead, I focus on the more obscure things. I\u0027ve produced a (barely) flyable \u003Cem\u003ESilbervogel\u003C/em\u003E (albeit only flyable without FAR) and am in the midst of producing a flyable Horten H.XVIII bomber... that I accidentally labeled as a Gotha Go229, a much smaller fighter. *shakes head at own idiocy* The most successful Wunderwaffen I\u0027ve built yet is a stock copy of the AMW A-10, which went halfway around Kerbin on one stage, even when flown by a butterfingered pilot such as me. All I can say is von Braun most definitely knew what he was doing. However, I\u0027ll save the details for a really big forum post later, as you probably don\u0027t want to hear the gory details of my current obsession right now. =P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Career Mode, the best I\u0027ve done is crash into the moon once. I also achieved solar orbit, twice, but the second one went all Icarus on me, so... yeah. Even with MechJeb, I am a horrid pilot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, that\u0027s all for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*peace*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T16:24:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Squad forums \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through\u0022\u003EWofwood\u003C/span\u003E Kagame, I\u0027ll change your name but do be aware it\u0027ll change your login name too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEh it seems \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/122969-Wolfwood\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esomeone beat you to the name\u003C/a\u003E, sorry :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich of the others do you like most?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T16:31:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 04:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T16:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll go ahead and list them in order of priority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
