But im not sure...\n\nOk, today i tried doing a survey scan (with the stock scanner). I placed it in a polar orbit and fine tuned this orbit using mechjeb. And my probe exploded over the south pole due to overheating.\n\nI tried it a second time, and it exploded over the north pole\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/R14FL)\n\nMy mods are: mechjeb, hyperedit, AntennaRange, NavHud. I guess it would happen in stock aswell, but its hard to get such accurate orbits in stock\n\nEdit: forget about north pole anomaly. its not happening above the north pole. \n\nI tested this in a stock install with just HyperEdit installed. It still happens.\n\nWhat i found so far:\n\nOnly happens to active vessel\n\nOnly happens if not timewarping (may happen in physwarp)\n\nHappens at any altitude (as long as you stay inside the SOI)\n\nHappens on bodies with or without atmosphere\n\nHappens to all vessels in active vessel\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s physics bubble when active vessel goes boom\n\nEdit2: checked \u0027Ignore Max Temp\u0027 in debug menu, this happened after passing over the south pole:\n\n![1aqh939.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1aqh939.jpg)\n\nthe temperature gets insanely high almost instant\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T07:57:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 07:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rudi1291**\n  \nadditional info"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T17:41:33Z","Content":"I have also experienced this bug."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T22:49:31Z","Content":"I am currently haveing a nearly identical issue.

I keep seeing the octagonal strut coming up in posts. And go figure the core of my satellite is made of two of them. The heat starts from there and spreads out. The instant explosion effect is just from reloading saves with the craft\u0027s heat maxed out. \n\nSo something is wrong with these struts. And im sure there are other parts that have this \u0022runaway heating\u0022 effect by attaching parts to those with high surface area. Why an octagonal strut is considered high surface area compared to other parts I dont know..\n\nYeah all that and i just realized i had heating set to zero. Bah...\n\nWait, wait, wait that scale is the reentry heating. Which iirc is different from just radiation. And now that i think about it my \u0022simple\u0022 comms prope was had the largest dish from RT on it. Not activated though. Only once for testing. But it doe have some lesser dishes activated. So OP, rudi1291 how long is that craft in the sun before it explodes? Im wondering if the temperatures are slwoly rising as the craft cooks in the sun to some sort of tipping point and... boom.\n\nOh, hello.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126664-MAJOR-Heating-Bug/page4](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126664-MAJOR-Heating-Bug/page4)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T19:24:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 07:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T13:18:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I am currently haveing a nearly identical issue.
