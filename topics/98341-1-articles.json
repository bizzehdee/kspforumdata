But that\u0027s off-topic for this thread and something that\u0027s been discussed time and again in other threads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMir was de-orbited by atmospheric drag. The real life atmosphere doesn\u0027t have a nice neat cut-off as it does in KSP so, unless they\u0027re high enough, vehicles in LEO will tend to deorbit over time. Which is handy for getting rid of space debris. Magnetic drag is a thing but it\u0027s a tiny effect compared to atmospheric drag, and so ignored in most real-life calculations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess you could sort of simulate atmospheric drag, the need to reboost orbital vehicles etc. in KSP right now by placing a space station so it\u0027s periapsis dips just inside the 70km atmosphere cut-off limit. It would be pretty tedious though, not least because as soon as you switch to another vehicle, the simulation would go \u0027on-rails\u0027 for your space station, meaning that it would no longer be affected by drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETethers etc. - very cool, not going to happen in KSP because of the 2.5 km limit to the physics simulation. I\u0027m guessing that rewriting such a basic part of the game would be quite a bit of work and probably not worth it this late in development. I know I could think of many more uses for developer time that would have a bigger impact on the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Slight correction, Mir was de-orbited deliberately, presumably so it could be dropped safely into a nice deep ocean rather than somebody\u0027s back yard. However, from Wikipedia: \u0022Mir\u0027s deorbit was carried out in three stages. The first stage involved waiting for atmospheric drag to reduce the station\u0027s orbit to an average of 220 kilometres \u0022. So atmospheric drag alone would have de-orbited it given enough time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-02T12:26:15Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2015 12:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T14:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DiamondExcavater\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DiamondExcavater\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe magnetic field might have a small amount of force but the closer to earth you are the stronger the pull, however there is still a deorbiting force that actually pulled down mir (a soviet space station) and is constantly pulling other stuff that\u0027s flying around up there in space. i thought the force was the magnetic field, but even so, everything in orbit will eventually fall towards the mass. even our moon, even though it may be in the perfect orbit and not too close eventually it will! this will make game play harder and also mean you need to resupply satellites and stations with fuel every now and then, how about having this kind of stuff available? \u003Ca href=\u0022http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast09jun_1/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast09jun_1/\u003C/a\u003E also en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_exchange_tether\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for comments BTW\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually the moon is slowly moving AWAY from the earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat force slowing down things in orbit you confuse with magnetics?

Newtonian physics - gravitational force follows an inverse square law with distance. Therefore different parts of a spacecraft will experience slightly different gravitational forces, giving rise to a net force on it. That net force will cause the spacecraft to orient such that its lowest moment of inertia will be about an axis pointing towards the centre of the body which the spacecraft is orbiting, i.e. along the gravity gradient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this falls out naturally from that initial inverse square law. I find it hard to believe that KSP isn\u0027t using that, since otherwise nothing about it\u0027s physics model makes sense. And within the patched conics approximation, KSP physics does make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, KSP also has two other features which make effects such as GGS very difficult to see in-game. Time-warping a vessel puts that vessel \u0027on-rails\u0027 - it follows a fixed path in a fixed attitude and external forces acting on it, such as atmospheric drag and gravity gradients are ignored. Similarly, vessels which the player aren\u0027t currently controlling are also put on-rails. I\u0027m guessing this is done for optimization reasons, so that the player can have several spacecraft in play at the same time, without slowing the game down by subjecting all of them to the physics model. It also means that spacecraft which the player isn\u0027t currently flying will follow a completely predictable path, so that the player doesn\u0027t have to worry about them going off course. Both of which seem like entirely acceptable reasons to compromise realism in favour of gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf external forces aren\u0027t applied, then a spacecraft will maintain a fixed attitude relative to the sky, which is exactly what we see in-game for time-warping vessels. If you were patient enough, in principle I think you could set up a suitable spacecraft in orbit around Kerbin, not use any time acceleration, switch off SAS and watch as GGS pushes it into a physically correct attitude. In practice, stock KSP controls aren\u0027t precise enough.
