But the actual depot is in orbit. At the moon\u0027s surface I only place the actual plant. But it is inevitable that it becomes a \u0022home\u0022 of sorts to at leats an engineer kerbal, because the fuel ferry between the surface and the depot can very well dock with the depot, but not with the surface station: there, some kerbal has to attach them (again, this only makes sense with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E in mind).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, if you consider that it is easier to leave this kerbal in orbit 99% of the time, it is still necessary (or cooler at least!) to mantain a proper outpost because there you can have a self-suficient food/water/oxygen plant (in use TAC-LS, but the logic is similar with other LS mods).
