They are kind of billed as fragile, ultra-lightweight landers, but they aren\u0026#39;t particularly fragile and the Mk2 seems to be massively overweight (it is 4.33 times heavier than the Mk1, and is ~0.6 tons heavier than both the MK2 spaceplane cockpits).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis has been bothering me for a while, so today I threw together a simple mod that uses module manager to tweak the defaults a bit. For the Mk2, I reduced the weight from 2.6t to 1.6t, and for both the Mk1 and Mk2 I reduced the impact resistance from 8m/s to 6m/s (which I believe was their values in 0.90) and reduced their max skin temperatures from 2000k down to 1600k (I originally thought of taking it down to 1200k, but I\u0026#39;m hesitant to go that far...)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo my questions to the community are:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Is there any interest in this and/or does something like this already exist? (I tried searching but couldn\u0026#39;t find anything)\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Do you think this strikes the right balance?\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) If no, how do you think they should be changed?\n"}]}
