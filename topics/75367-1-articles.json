This is gonna be a long post so I included a TLDR at the end \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most important thing I am not seeing on the spaceplane you show in the pictures is canards. Why do heavy planes almost always need canards and light planes don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t? Because of the way pitch control works in relation to your center of mass. Think of it this way: there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s two ways of pitching up (and down, but up is what you need to get off the runway). You either push down the back of the plane or pull up the nose. Canards will pull up the nose, ailerons will push down the back. Now also remember that a plane will ALWAYS try to rotate around its center of mass. If you look at your pictures, you can already tell that the center of mass lies more to the back of the plane. This is very typical for heavy planes and only increases the heavier the plane gets because you need more engines, which often need at least one fuel tank to attach to, which makes the plane very back-heavy (at least that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the case if you use the standard all-engines-in-the-back triangular shape configuration).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a LOT harder to pitch up when you have to push down so close to the center of mass. This is due to leverage: the longer the lever distance, the easier lifting (or lowering) something is. The shorter the lever distance, the harder it gets. By the same principle, the further back the CoM lies, the more effective canards become. So add canards to your heavy planes to help with pitch control. Note that this will shift the center of lift forward by quite a lot though. Keeping the center of mass in front of or on the center of lift is one of the biggest challenges in building heavy planes. On a side note, pitching up on the runway gets easier the closer your rear landing gear is to the CoM. But putting them too far inward means you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll smash the engines into the runway. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s also a balance you need to find with experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short: Having pitch controlling surfaces only on the back of the wings works well for light planes because their center of mass lies pretty central of the entire plane. For heavy planes which have a center of mass that lies much more to the back, canards or other pitch control near the front of the plane are very often if not always a requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther improvements I would suggest: smaller wings. You have a huge wing there, you really don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need THAT much wing surface, even in stock. Wings provide lift, but also drag and mass. Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t go overboard on them. Secondly: more engines. Heavy spaceplanes need a lot more than 2 engines. My latest creation - which is an SSTDuna - has 4 rapiers, 4 turbojets and 3 nuclear engines. Obviously you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need nuclear engines until you want to go interplanetary, but you do need quite a bit of thrust to get to orbit efficiently in order to counteract aerodynamic and (perhaps more importantly) gravity losses. Easiest way to add engines without losing symmetry or smashing them into the runway on take-off/landing is to add a 1,25m tank on either side of the main tank in the same plane as the engines you already have (get it? Same plane? As in mathematical plane versus aircraft? \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I need more friends\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6) and put more engines and air intakes on those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, TLDR: add canards, add more engines, don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t go with such a long wing, keep an eye on your CoM and CoL. Keep all that in mind and you should be able to upscale quite well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-18T12:26:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2014 12:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cirocco\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T12:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOverfloater shared some of his large spaceplane building secrets in a great video \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=1200361\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1200361\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Overfloater","CreatedById":94031,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T15:13:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you DON\u0027T use FAR... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor good atmospheric flight:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.\u003C/strong\u003E keep making wings, until the center of lift is where it needs to be*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2.\u003C/strong\u003E only NOW you add flaps.

You need to set aerodynamics so that the plane will have a tendency to pull up. How much it will have to pull up depends upon how many pitching control surfaces you put(or hide) on the front of the airframe. The more control you put on the front the less it has to pitch up. A good heavy lifter will take off the runway without SAS on by just tapping back on the stick once or twice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour tail assembly is important for this. The way you visualise this is to think of a see-saw. the CoT is the fulcrum and the tail assembly control surfaces are lifting the CoM.
