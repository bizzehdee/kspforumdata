If you add the surfacefx module to a part that also has a command module on it, it does this. There is no fix other than to remove one of those modules from the part."},{"CreatedByName":"noonespecial","CreatedById":81942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T15:03:32Z","Content":"That definately seems to be the problem. I had it setup as a command module for testing purposes, but when I removed that, the issue resolved itself. Thanks!"}]}
