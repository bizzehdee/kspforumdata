My turbojet is shrunk.\n\nI\u0027ve known about this issue, just never had it happen ... until now. A quick game restart did not fix it, so the question being asked is *what will?*\n\nWent through my modulemanager cache, gamedata, and a few other places to verify no mods were messing with it. Nothing messes with that part (and my physics is pretty much unchanged).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T23:17:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 11:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T18:44:26Z","Content":"You could see if this still works.\n\n[**Slumpie\u0027s stock scaling bug fix.**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96339-0-25-StockScal%3Cbr%20/%3E\u002B%20ingBugFix-V2-MM-Update-fixed-some-mishaps)"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T18:47:24Z","Content":"Thx.

Turns out I had RP installed incorrectly (so, with no effects, i didnt even realize I had it installed) and a quick removal later, my turbojet is back to normal.\n\nI\u0027d even gone to Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp because I thought overwriting the model would fix it.
