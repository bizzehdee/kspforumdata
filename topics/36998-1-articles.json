Not much of this is stuff I actually figured out, but I can\u0027t say I was paying all that much attention when looking for it to be able to properly credit those who I got the info from. Suffice to say, I owe many thanks to several members of this forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho, here is what I cobbled together:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Half the written tutorials on the internet will have you doing far more work than needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Get Unity. Don\u0027t groan. Just do it. Your stuff is not going to work right without it, and no, there is no way to convince Blender to do it. Import the KSP Part Tools package from the Assets -\u0026gt; Import Package -\u0026gt; Custom Package dialogue. Open Part Tools from the Tools menu and tell it where your KSP GameData folder is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Use the \u0022Assets\u0022 folder made by Unity as your storage place for developing parts. You may find it useful to add other folders inside there. For example I have \u0022Textures\u0022, \u0022Materials\u0022, \u0022KSP Prefabs\u0022, and \u0022UV layouts\u0022. Unity will detect changes to these files and folders automatically. Unity will export .mu and material files to the folder you set for each part when you give them a Part Tools component.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. In KSP; Alt\u002BF12 -\u0026gt; Database -\u0026gt; Reload All is your friend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. It\u0027s not a terrible idea to have a stock KSP install reserved for development. This will load faster and avoid the need to troubleshoot unforeseen conflicts with other mods until you\u0027re sure yours actually works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ETo make the simplest of models\u003C/span\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen up Blender, delete the default camera and light. Select the default cube and switch to edit mode. Select all the faces of the cube and UV map it. Split the viewport and put the new window into UV mode. Create a new image that\u0027s 512x512. A black image should appear in the UV window, and the cube should go dark too. Now you can switch the main viewport to Texture Paint and add some color to the cube. More often than not though you will want to export the UV layout from the window showing the UV map, and then use something like GIMP to make your textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave both the .blend and your texture into the Unity Assets folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen Unity. If you don\u0027t see your resources in the bottom center of the window, click on the \u0022Assets\u0022 folder in the bottom left-ish of the window. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrag and drop the .blend file into the Unity scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the model is missing its texture look in your Assets folders for the material and drag and drop that onto the model. If the material was not generated, right click in the Asset preview area and select Material. Click on the new material, give it a KSP shader, and then click on the \u0022Select\u0022 button in the box down and a little to the right from where you pick the shader. From there select your texture file, and then drop the material onto the model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the only thing in the hierarchy for this should be the cube, click on that, then click \u0022Add Component\u0022. Pick Physics -\u0026gt; Box Collider. Tick \u0022Concave\u0022. Now add a KSP -\u0026gt; Part Tools component. Change the name (default: \u0022NewModel\u0022) to \u0022model\u0022. Set the directory to the directory you made to store the part (more on that in a sec). Click \u0022Write\u0022. All the part should need now is a part.cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you made your own collision mesh in Blender then your model will have an arrow next to it in the Unity hierarchy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Add the KSP Part Tools component to the very top level, or \u0022parent\u0022, then add the colliders the appropriate child mesh. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Remove the \u0022MeshRenderer\u0022 component from any mesh you don\u0027t want to show up in game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Make sure you click Concave when using a Mesh Collider. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - If doing so causes your collider to warp way out of the shape you want then you need to break it down into several simpler meshes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Your collision mesh/es can have any name, you do not need to call them \u0022node_collider\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere can also be other static meshes in the scene, like say, an antennae, which are rendered but play no role in collisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to add a hatch; Make sure the origin of your main mesh in Blender is inside one of its collision meshes. Make a cube about 50cm high, 50cm wide and 5cm thick and place it where you want the hatch. In Unity the Y (green) goes up, and Z (blue) faces in the direction Kerbals are ejected. Name the cube something easy to remember. Repeat the same procedure for ladders, except make the cube however tall you want the ladder to be, and point the Z axis in the direction Kerbals should face while climbing. Place the face of the box closest to the model approximately where the hands and feet should go. Do not put it inside your other collision meshes. It may be possible to overlap hatches and ladders though. After doing that, select your boxes in Unity and give them Physics colliders, as well as remove the Mesh Renderer. I also tick the \u0022Is Trigger\u0022 box, but I am not sure its needed. In the top right of Unity you should see Tags and Layers. Click Tags and go to Add Tag. Off to the right of \u0022Element0\u0022 click, it\u0027s hard to tell, but there is a place to type there. Add a tag called \u0022Ladder\u0022 for ladders and/or \u0022Airlock\u0022 for airlocks. Name Layer 21 \u0022Part Triggers\u0022. Apply the appropriate tag to the boxes you made, and add them to the Part Triggers layer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately this is as far as I have gotten. I know nothing about animations, or how to get engines working properly. If this doesn\u0027t turn out to be an entirely useless wall of text I will try and update it with those things as I get to them. If someone wants to add in an explanation to help me along, that would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and in the part.cfg file. Note in Blender where you want attachment points to be. Apparently you can define them with empty Game Objects from Unity, but as far as I can tell that\u0027s not entirely functional yet, so it seems best to use the old way. I have however been using MODEL {} nodes to deal with rotation and scaling. (Shown in Part Tools 0.20 thread)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDirectory structure is also more simple than implied by many internet guides. Take a look in the Squad folder for an idea of how to organize things. You choose the menu in which parts appear in the game from the config file for each part, so directory structure is more about logical organization than anything else. You will likely want a top level folder next to Squad, with Parts and other folders similar to theirs, but from there it\u0027s really up to you. No need for a texture and mesh folder for each part folder though, all the game uses now is part.cfg, model.mu, and any materials that go with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if someone knows how I can more easily use the same material across multiple parts, and possibly even the same model at different scales, without having to duplicate the materials and mu files for each, that would be great, I haven\u0027t been able to get that working 100% yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T03:23:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s sort of what Hoojiwanas thread is for..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-0-20-Last-updated-30-06-13\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-0-20-Last-updated-30-06-13\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheebsta","CreatedById":74167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T03:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did get a lot of info from hoojis thread, but also noticed there were about 12 Blender related threads on the first page of this forum.

It is convex by default since Unity generates the geometry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA MESH collider is used to convert a 3d mesh imported from your modeling program into a collider. So you create a cube mesh in Blender or whatever and resize it so it provides the bounds for your model (can be a cylinder, sphere, or whatever, but it should be less than 256 polygons)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past before PartTools, it would have been named node_collder and the part loader would ignore its material and render it invisible and then calculate a convex mesh collider for it as it loads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor part tools, you can import said mesh into Unity, then add Component -\u0026gt; Physics -\u0026gt; Mesh Collider - this will have a CONVEX check-box- which will generate a green wire-mesh to show its bounds. You can then remove the Mesh Renderer inspector element to make it invisible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t have to be a separate mesh either, you can generate a mesh collider for your main part - just keep in mind if you have concave areas the convex solver will fill over the gaps so the collision will be \u0027above\u0027 your part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite what someone said, if you do not check the convex box, Unity/KSP will not make your collider convex anyway. You can add a mesh collider to any part and leave it unchecked and it will work for surface-attachment functions like struts, fuel lines, decouplers, and should even collide with parts from other vessels - they WILL NOT collide with the ground at all though unless set convex - if anyone has used my shuttle wings in Tiberdyne, the wings themselves are not convex but you can attach things to them - they don\u0027t collide with the ground. I had to specifically add primitive wing-shaped meshes inside the wings and set those to convex to enable ground-collision - you can notice the wing edges will dip into the ground a bit before crashing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlammo!","CreatedById":63139,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T01:58:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tiberion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tiberion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou added a BOX collider.
