Is it possible to get into a west going orbit? If it is, I\u0027m sure you would need a big rocket. Mine just exploded.

And you the rockets only needs to have about 400 m/s more delta-V.

You can still get into orbit launching westward, you just don\u0027t get any additional benefit from the planet\u0027s rotation (in fact you lose a small amount by going that way, just not enough to make all that big of a difference).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t really require that big of a rocket either - my dinky little 0.18-demo-built Fireball 7 can launch to a westward orbit and still make a round-trip Mun landing mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheIncredibleDalek","CreatedById":73129,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T19:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want to get going up, then do a gravity turn at around 10,000m-12,000m up, only to the west. this will place you in a clockwise orbit (as viewed from above the north pole), or a \u0022western\u0022 orbit.
