I tend to play at 20% science return (partly because I use mods like yours to give me more \u0027periments to do), so the idea that a Duna soil sample is worth a higher value would be a powerful incentive to take an early-game shot for it! ^^\n\n\\*edit\\* I\u0027ll answer myself about the indexes; my Kerbin is at index 1, Mun is at index 2, which is normal.

The old editor was placed in GameData/ScienceParamLoader, while the new version is in GameData/ScienceParamModifier. It shouldn\u0027t cause a problem to use both at the same time, the new version will simply override any values set using the old version.\n\nI spent a few hours ripping out the guts of the Contract Reward Modifier and replacing it with a much simpler system for editing the science multipliers for each body.\n\nYou simply select a body from the drop down menu, input the desired multipliers into the text boxes and hit Apply. The values will then be updated for that body and stored for that save-file. If you want to use those values as the default settings for all new games (and as the values to be applied when reverting to default; you can also revert to stock values at any time), go into the settings window and push the Save To Config button.\n\nYou can deactivate the toolbar button when you are done setting values if you want. Simply change the \u0022disableToolbar\u0022 field in the config file to False if you want to reactivate the toolbar.\n\nThe recovered craft data value is used by the contract system for generating rewards and other parameters, as such you have to force the option to edit this value using the settings window."},{"CreatedByName":"jlcarneiro","CreatedById":79196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T01:31:27Z","Content":"Hey, DMagic, these Portrait Stats never cease to amaze me!
