That station has seen a lot of ships come and go. Until I developed the Brutus booster, I had trouble getting 40 tonnes into space, so everything going to the Mun had to stop there and refuel, and sometimes meet up with a fuel tender for the trip to the Mun. These days most flights to the Mun bypass the station. I\u0027m thinking of replacing it with something made with fewer parts; the lag around the station is kinda nasty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T04:30:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JayKay\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JayKay\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, I found a way of stiffening the central stack by using struts and small box girders to make kingpost trusses between the upper and lower stages.
