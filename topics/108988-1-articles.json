I rarely play games except for KSP, and a couple others that aren\u0027t on steam, so I\u0027d rather just do away with it. Will I have to re-buy the game, or is there an option to download it directly from SQUAD after purchasing on steam? Can I just transfer the whole KSP directory over? Will that work cross-platform?

There also might be technical reasons that would hinder moving you off of Steam, as I seem to recall something about that not being a simple thing.
