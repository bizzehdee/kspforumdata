This is a problem for folks who use RemoteTech (or AntennaRange with certain options enabled). The main payload probe going to Laythe, Eve, or wherever can be safely protected in a fairing that remains intact until after the aerocapture, but the ship as a whole still needs a long-range dish exposed on the outside for the trip out there, getting into orbit, and finally detaching the main probe. But if you lose that antenna during aerocapture, you\u0027re pretty much hosed. So, what\u0027s the best way to protect the \u0022en-route\u0022 antenna?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve considered several options, none of which I like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Stay Out of Atmospheres\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100% effective but requires carrying way more fuel and engine to capture via thrust alone, which increases mission costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Set for Less Reentry Heat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn across-the-board change made at the start of the game via the difficulty slider. Kerbin\u0027s heat already isn\u0027t a major issue anyway so you lose nothing there, and its easier to do other planets. Feels a bit shady but OTOH the issue is the rather bogus way 1.x handles heat and atmospheric density, so can be considered a necessary fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Cheats\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse ModuleManager to increase the heat tolerance of antenna, or use the debug window to ignore maxTemp. Definitely shady but again, the underlying system is inherently flawed so.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Robotic Antenna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERig up a cargo bay or service bay with some Infernal Robotics parts that enable you to pull the antenna inside and close the door behind it. Adds ship complexity and part count, the necessity for another large mod, and makes the rocket heavier and more expensive. Also requires kOS to deploy the antenna again after aerocapture and kOS seems to have difficulty with working IR parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Sacrificial Antennae\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou let the original exposed antenna burn off and have a 2nd (and maybe 3rd and 4th) \u0022en route\u0022 antenna under a small interstage fairing that you deploy after an aerocapture pass. Still need kOS to pop the interstage fairing(s) but at least there\u0027s no need for IR. Also, more mass, complexity, and part count, especially if you\u0027re going to bounce off Jool to hit Laythe or use multiple aerobraking passes after the 1st aerocapture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody got a better idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T13:34:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStock payload bays?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone could invent a non-stock part, an antenna in a case.

It does, however, have to overcome one of the problems with the heat system, which is that during a reentry, the parts at the trailing end of the craft get hotter than those at the leading end. You can demonstrate this by taking an orange tank and sticking a Sr. docking port on 1 end and others radially attached on the sides. The port on the end, exposed to the full brunt of reentry, will survive a pass that burns off the identical radial ports. So the shield has to be wide enough to account for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s complicated by the aerodynamic effects of any fairing over the main payload probe. If this has any length to it, it will (thanks to how body lift is figured) make the ship hold a bothersome angle of attack (like 10-15^) instead of weathervaning pure retrograde. Thus, the benefits of the shield are lost except within a short distance of where the shield is attached, perhaps too close to allow the dish to open without clipping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycix","CreatedById":76916,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T14:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of remotetech, retracting the antenna makes sure it can be used in atmospheric flight.
