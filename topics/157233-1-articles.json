While your coasting, removing parts from the rocket doesn\u0027t change the vehicles trajectory (except for slight bumps from the decouplers and the like). So if your coasting to an apoapsis of, lets say, 150 km, then you\u0027ll get to 150 km whether you keep that empty stage on or not. Similarly, if you detach from the empty stage (in vacuum), then you\u0027ll notice it will follow you up to the apoapsis.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re still in the atmosphere, then it can make a difference.

My rockets tend to have a Titan/Delta-like design with a central core that (after ditching the side-boosters fairly early in flight) doesn\u0027t change that much in diameter, hence it doesn\u0027t reduce resistance that much when I drop the bottom stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut... it does reduce\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emass\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0by a significant amount.
