Depending on your settings (and the design of your ships) several things can be causing it, but it\u0027s likely that they are getting homesick or running out of habitation.  To avoid you need to make sure you have enough habitation (and supplies, and EC, the other main LS variables) for your mission.  To turn the Kerbal back to his former profession, you need to return them to Kerbin.  (Or - if it\u0027s not habitation - get them supplies/EC.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-28T05:52:04Z","Content":"So, I\u0027m new to the whole \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E LS thing. Doing my first missions outside of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, headed to Duna.. and may have found some bugs. Not sure. Went a little overkill and spent the whole day building a Karibou rover/MKS Duna series mashup for a main base, several additional Karibou rovers for fuel production and ground exploration, and a relay satellite network. Sent the whole thing out unmanned in about five pieces, landed what needed to be and got it set up. The manned exploration rover had ~60 days supplies/hab time, which was massively overkill. The main base had something like 4-5 years hab time, and an unknown amount of supplies.. they were to be farming (mining water/substrate and using cultivation). Even without that they had enough supplies for several years, and a backup nom-o-matic system that\u0027d alternatively use the fertilizer and mulch to extend supplies in case water/substrate was unavailable (which ended up being the case). Several issues here, but ended up getting it to work. The Duna Series MKS nuclear reactor kept turning off every time I swapped to a new ship, so that ship would be out of power when I would return to it.. which was frustrating. Had to Hyperedit in some electric charge to get things running again. No idea why it kept turning off, even had radiators attached and running.  \n\nNext, I put together a transfer vehicle that was composed of a nuclear powered space hotel (2.5m tundra Kerbitat, science lab, numerous luxuries) and a lander that was designed to refuel on the ground and return to orbit and dock for a Kerbin return. The whole setup had something like 2-3 years of hab time and supplies and the lander portion a good month\u0027s time for my 4 kerbals. Sent it out.. and ran into, well.. problems. Lots of them. Got my ship into orbit around Duna and found that I only had about 30 days worth of supplies remaining. I should have had the better part of year or two remaining, more than enough for a return to Kerbin. Turns out the Kerbitat, even though it was set up for \u0022Recycler\u0022 (the 81% one that only uses EC), wasn\u0027t doing anything. It was turned on, but it hadn\u0027t actually functioned at all. The science lab\u0027s 50% recycler had helped a bit, but left me with a nearly empty mothership. Bug maybe? Figure.. oh well, I can drop my crew on the surface and they out to be able to last until resupply from Kerbin. Load them up into the lander portion, decouple the docking port, swap back to the main mothership and start shutting down systems since it\u0027s empty now.. and all my guys decide to call it quits. Turns out the lander was sharing hab time with the nearby mothership, and for some reason the crew now thinks I\u0027m shoving them into a tin can or something. The \u0022lander\u0022 apparently doesn\u0027t register as a \u0022new vehicle\u0022, so the hab time isn\u0027t being reset. As soon as the lander leaves the \u0022shared\u0022 zone around the mothership, even if I leave its systems online.. the crew quits. I can still land remotely, but they won\u0027t EVA to set up my base and move in. Luckily I was able to think of a solution.. decoupling, redocking, then undocking caused it to reset properly.. then my lander stopped being controllable briefly when it lost signal, despite having 4 kerbals (pilot included) on board.. pilot in a command pod even.

These seem to be the only three parts that are affected this way. I tried starting with a fresh install of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS and its bundled dependencies and CTT.

Not sure if the timing is relevant."},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-28T15:50:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, bounty123 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I experienced a similar lander separates, crew quits problem. I\u0027m still in early stage of my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E career, it happened me on a return trip from Minmus. Arrived to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E with about 7 days hab time remaining, and after separating the return stage, during descent, the crew decided they\u0027ve had enough torture and quit, not the best timing. Is this intended so? I would imagine there should be some hab time remaining for them to land. In this case the 25km Kerbin limit saved them, but I bet that on Duna it would be messier.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: maybe the lander pod(s) shouldn\u0027t be occupied during the mission, and only be used during the landing and then it would have habitation remaining in the end? I\u0027ll test it at home.\n\u003E \n\nNear as I can tell decoupling doesn\u0027t reset the hab time. The Kerbals are still in the \u0022same ship\u0022 as before, so the hab time isn\u0027t reset. Redocking, then undocking resets it because it\u0027s undocking that the mod recognizes.\n\nThe solution is to do an Apollo style mission. Get to orbit, decouple your command pod (taking a huge hab time hit, but you just got up there so it won\u0027t matter), turn around and dock to your LEM. Hab time will reset and go back to normal. Go to moon, undock the lander.. do your stuff. For the ascent to orbit you can\u0027t leave any hab pieces behind as decoupling from them won\u0027t work. Long term landers could have trouble here, but short missions should be okay. Anywho, go back up.. redock, transfer crew, undock (or keep the LEM for extra hab), and head to Kerbin. Undock from the LEM before decoupling your pod if you kept it, simply decoupling will cause issues.\n\nIf you try to do the mission with just one vessel (say a command pod with hitchhiker can, with a decoupler in between to detach the pod for reentry), you\u0027ll be fine for the entire mission up until reentry. At that point you\u0027ll decouple your pod and the crew will more or less give up and quit because the mod thinks you\u0027ve effectively turned off the life support systems, not detached from them and created a new vessel your Kerbals should be happy to take for a short jaunt."},{"CreatedByName":"bounty123","CreatedById":142602,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-28T16:21:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 25 minutes ago, Enorats said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Near as I can tell decoupling doesn\u0027t reset the hab time.
