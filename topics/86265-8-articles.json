Well, the concept comes from the souposphere itself. It behaves like a dense fluid so why not exploiting it with a \u0022boat\u0022? A sailing ship is the best example of unbiased asimmetry I can recall. So here I have a kind of \u0022keel\u0022 (the reentry module - that I CAN redesign if you can not really stand that lonely clipped nuke) that needs a ballast on the other side. A slightly lighter and longer one (leverage ftw). So here you are with your beautiful command bridge. You just need to remember you must keep your ship with the correct attitude. It behaves like a kind of foil ship during aerobrakes. The lift provided by the crew cabin on the tail, even if really small compared to the total overall mass, keeps it en route w/o tailspinning. Moreover you can always count on the 200\u002B available torque force. Obviously it does not work properly if you snap on it really unbalanced loads, but I managed affordable configs with differences in the order of \u002B/- 5t. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I was thinking that it was merely looking good -- which it does, by the way. I\u0027m way too utilitaristic and concerned with part count, I\u0027d never consider topping off the nacelles with radial tanks for example. And even if I did, it would probably look silly. I have no words for it, but you\u0027re doing something right. Also, the gentle sweep of your landing gear.

That circle is a docking port, I presume.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat clipped engine is a real problem, though. I don\u0027t want to fault an otherwise excellent mission for a technicality, but I\u0027m also wary of setting a precedent.

It is exactly on top of the CoM so it can be used with skycranes or with some other \u0022modules\u0022 I designed to fit in a big cargo bay (extra tanks, science jr. and goo, chutes and whatever you may need). It serves also the \u0022control from here\u0022 purpose during powered VTOL. It is on top of a FLT800 tank that serves as the main body of the rover and that is connected to the rear wheels. Then you have the batteries and RTGs you thought about, a couple of small SAS and the room for the scientific stuff. The bay can hold 50 m/s hits, so it serves as the \u0022armor\u0022 too. And, usually it does not happen so often, but if you find yourself down under you can just open the bay and flip back on your wheels.

The aerodynamics are mega-strange, you need several vertical stabilizers in order for a gr8-working aircraft on Kerbin to be stable on Eve. To my dismay, I suck at building spaceplanes. Thankfully, I already know the rule #1 for this challenge: the smaller, the better. You actually can get into orbit with a spaceplane, too. But you need a crap load of fuel in order to do so. I\u0027ll think of something, but it will definitely be complicated. Maybe put an extra pair of fuel tanks on the sides? I don\u0027t know. Since Eve does not contain oxygen, you can\u0027t use air intakes and in stock there are no alternative methods of fuels besides ion, which is as useless as a Mk.3 fuselage.

If you do other things besides the core mission (like landing on Gilly), that\u0027s outside of the challenge and not subject to any rules. Actually, there is no rule about what you may or may not do on the surface of Eve. That is not an oversight. You may use kethane jets, balloons, dirigibles, infinigliders, walking robots, whatever you want -- none of that is a problem as long as it doesn\u0027t help you in getting to Eve or returning from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"2001kraft","CreatedById":120475,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T16:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDirigibles on Eve is complete cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kulebron","CreatedById":80231,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T21:17:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^^ Should they be stock, they\u0027d make all sense, just as it makes sense to launch rockets from a boat rather than from ocean bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kulebron","CreatedById":80231,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T00:56:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Laie: please tell me if this clipping is ok?
