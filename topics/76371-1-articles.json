Or both. Also, depending on the number of parts you may incur lots of lag. I also highly reccomend both RCS build aid and Navyfish\u0027s Docking Alignment Indicator, both will help with making things flyable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T23:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not quite sure if the OP is referring to rendezvous, where you match orbit and speed with your target, or docking, where you actually connect the two docking ports.

Two mark 1 capsules with clamp-o-trons/RCS/RCS-fuel/solar panels.. and staging to get me to 80,000 m with enough fuel to de-orbit. Do this a number of times and the rest becomes fairly easy. You\u0027ll learn about how docking goes.. Hohmann transfers... and properly locating RCS thrusters on your spacecraft so that docking is easy, even if your spacecraft stabilization is turned off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you know anything about the US space program.. I essentially followed the framework of that.. I learned how to put stuff in orbit and de-orbit reliably (Mercury), then how to rendezvous in orbit (Gemini), then dock while in orbit (Gemini), then did all the necessary steps to form a mission plan for getting to Mun.. first to orbit, then land and takeoff and get back (Apollo). Doing an Apollo style moon lander is really good practice .. since you must use all you know from all previous missions to make it work.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing that mission plan is really the \u0027KSP Tutorial\u0027 as far as I am concerned.. at least on how to use the tools at your disposal to make missions that work.. and building a skillset for flying those suckers. The big hurdles as far as flying missions are landings on airless bodies and rendezvous/docking. Those skills are truly essential to everything you do in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-01T00:18:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2014 12:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by weezl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T01:37:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou will need special tools for the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, put up a small part count tug to shuttle whatever you need to move around. I use SSTOs on most of my projects and a tug helps me bridge the 2.5km gap I need to leave. However it is extremely useful for retrieving parts which are parked in the same orbit but have drifted a long way away from your construction site. The tug should have a nuke and some RCS, that\u0027s the basic concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is your orbital spanner. A craft for attaching your bits to the project. This is particularly useful for when you are dealing with cumbersome components like heavy fuel tanks or long booms. Your spanner needs heaps or reaction wheels to provide translationless rotation and I have found it best propelled only by a big tank of RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth these tools need plenty of attachment points of all sizes with balance and centering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you figure out the tools you will need for the job, the rest is just practice, practice and more practice until you can almost dock anything in your sleep. Note, I\u0027ve always found long booms to be the hardest given you will have to make your docking without SAS due to self-reinforcing wobble. So, when easy docking maneuvers get boring flick SAS off for the practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T02:30:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhy18eKcvys\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhy18eKcvys\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor your reference.
