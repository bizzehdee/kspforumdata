Also do not operate at full throttle for long periods when empty, because that is too fast.\n\u003E \n\u003E A couple of bombs may get stuck when dropping, if that happens, looking from below start closing the bomb bay, and as soon as they move a bit open it again. This should solve the issue. Just don\u0027t close it completely, that will end badly.\n\nAnd here come the mission photos:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
