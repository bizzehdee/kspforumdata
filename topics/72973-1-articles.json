I spent about a month setting up my network of orbital stations and my moon base, well the save file ended up corrupted and unusable. Instead of doing that all again i want to assemble the moon base on Kerbin and modify the save file to put it on the moon, is this possible and how do i do it? thanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T15:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible, but would be difficult. Editing things into orbit isn\u0027t too hard, but if you get the altitude wrong, then your base will just explode. I suggest downloading hyperedit, even as a temporary measure, and using that instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse the orbit editor to put your things in orbit around the right body, then the lander to land them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, next time, scroll down a bit, and you\u0027ll find the questions sub-forum.
