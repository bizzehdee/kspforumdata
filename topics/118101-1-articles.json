E class asteroids are big and unwieldy, sure, but I\u0027d like to have F, G, H, etc sizes that follow the same size progression. If I\u0027ve done the math right, a Z class \u0027roid might be about 2/3 the size of Gilly, meaning you have approximately ZERO chance of changing its orbit in any meaningful way. But still, it seems like these things would be out there, and would make for a worthwhile challenge. Is there such a mod? My Google-fu has not uncovered one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fisk02","CreatedById":137236,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T08:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry looking into the cfg files and adjust the rarity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speadge","CreatedById":145302,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T08:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewould be funny - but i think there might be Problems since the asteroids have no gravity-well yet.... and 2/3 size gilly should at least have a tiny bit of grav.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...
