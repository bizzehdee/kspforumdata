You can do so by either telling me what mods you have installed (with high number of mods to awesomeness ratio) or what mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should remove to help get my thing to work. If all else fails someone could torrent or smth me his amazing version, but that would be a last resort (large file sizes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, the base game is amazing but I just like the variety and choice modspamming gives you.
