I forgot to edit the thrust limiter for the \u0022Flea\u0022 booster, so I took off with a higher rate of acceleration than I usually like to do. I did set the chute to deploy at 800m, because I never like waiting for an hour for the capsules to descend and land safely in the ocean- calculated risks, let\u0027s say.

For the A2 rocket, I decided to go with a two-staged solid booster design for simplicity. In keeping with tradition, I\u0027ve assigned Valentina Kerman for the second launch, as she\u0027s the only other Pilot kosmonaut I have.

There was a scare, like there always is on my second mission of a game, that maybe I overdid it, maybe I put too much boost on, or the capsule is going to re-enter at too steep an angle, or a bunch of other things like that. However, once the warning temperature gauge on the command pod went away, I knew I was in the clear. Valentina managed to get to about 81km up, and recorded some Mystery Goo observations, plus the temperature log and a crew report.

I always like to overestimate the delta-v I\u0027d need for any given scenario, especially with my math-free approach to rocket science. Better to have it and not need it and the rest of the analogy, right? I\u0027ve put Jeb back on the mission, as per rotation. I\u0027ve also added the obligatory heat shield- even though, through my launches, I found that, with the right angle of re-entry, a heat shield for the Mk-1 Command Pod plus a few accessories isn\u0027t actually neccesary.

I made it to orbit by the skin of my teeth. I had two FL-T200 tanks for my last rocket stage, giving 180 units of fuel and whatever oxidizer it had. When I got to a periapse of just 72km, I had 4.78 units of liquid fuel and 3.91 units of oxidizer left. I was trying to eke it out so I could have some to actually do a retrofire, and it looks like Jeb has just enough to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPost-Launch:\u003C/strong\u003E The mission went well, nothing notable about the re-entry, other than my addition of\u00A0drogue chutes for further playing-it-safe-ness.

It had a strange list to it, which shouldn\u0027t have been there, as the wheels were aligned well enough. However, I did notice it wasn\u0027t producing the lift it needed to actually take off. I\u0027m going to angle the wings upward just a hair and try again.

Runway, anyway. It\u0027s still not getting enough lift, so I\u0027m going to the big guns and adding winglets on the front of the aircraft to help get the darn nose up. Flight 3 is going to be the winner- only time will tell if it can be set back down again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFlight 3:\u003C/strong\u003E I gotta tell you, having no respawns helps keep things..... interesting. I want to keep Jeb alive, as any mission controller would, so I called off another flight. It still won\u0027t go nose up, so what I\u0027m going to do this time is slide the rear landing gear forward to reduce the angle it needs to take off. Generally I try to avoid doing so because, as we all know, the starter landing gear is ridiculously low to the ground, and therefore offers not much room in the way of ground clearance. The engines will be more at risk, but it\u0027s worth it in the long run. If this next run doesn\u0027t go as planned, I\u0027ll redesign the plane a bit from, say, square 2 or 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFlight 4:\u003C/strong\u003E \u00A0About 44 or 45 seconds into the flight, I think I may have narrowed down the root cause of the plane\u0027s lack of flying-ness as being too heavy.

The newly redesigned plane, the A5, as pictured above, worked surprisingly well- It was just a shortened and less heavy version of the A4, and was actually able to take off without winglets towards the front of the plane. HOWEVER, I made a judgement call when there was a tail strike, resulting in a very strange looking damaged vessel that I was unfortunately unable to get a picture of, because, as I was attempting to set the plane down again, the nose of the craft tipped forwards and impacted the ground, resulting in another death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I\u0027ll go back to rockets for a little bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA5\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPre-Launch: \u003C/strong\u003EFor the A5, I decided to take a half step backwards.

The mission went well enough, even though it took literally a month of game time to get an encounter with the stupid thing (Because yours truly has gotten a little rusty in guesstimating encounter locations along orbital trajectories), and I had to use some aerobraking in order to come to a safe stop. The short of it is, I had to do two passes through the atmosphere to slow down because I was being cautious about the rate with which I let Dessen descend, because, as we all know, friction plus metal equals slimy metal, and dead pilots.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EOn the second pass, I was wanting to make sure that he was actually going to slow down enough to actually make it to the surface, so I spent my time in the map view, watching the apoapse falling in height.
