As a player who pretty much exclusively buys games on Steam, I was not aware of KSP\u0027s existence before it arrived on Steam Early Access in March, 2013. All of you who bought the game directly from the KSP store before me got to play it for almost two years before me.

I\u0027m not running any serious missions (in case I DO run into a fatal crash), I don\u0027t expect my preview save to translate to release, and I\u0027m planning on starting over at release, but I seriously feel privileged to be able to test it early.

First, of all is the reasoning for bug fixing. I do a bit of for-fun programming and I made a couple of mods for KSP, and to be fair, most bug reports I get are most likely useless. They usually consist of: \u0022I was doing this and this, and then this happens, please help.\u0022 Sometimes I\u0027ll get a bit more information, but usually it\u0027s only that - and all honesty, that doesn\u0027t really help with anything. Proper bug testing require accurate reproduction, and an in-depth explanation to be able to solve anything. This does not seem to be the case as \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/107061-duodex/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022107061\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/107061-duodex/\u0022\u003E@DuoDex\u003C/a\u003E said in a previous post. It is inconceivable that Squad doesn\u0027t know this, which leads me to assume this pre-release is not really intended for bug fixing (at least not as the main reason for publishing a pre-release which may end up costing additional bandwidth and lots and lots of extra management work for their staff. I.e. it cost more money than it\u0027s worth).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich conveniently takes me to the second issue, of Steam-only release and bandwidth. KSP already has its own update tool, thus their servers are suppose to already be able to handle a lot of load. Obviously the initial impact may be quite large as everyone wants to get their hands on the pre-release. However, I sincerely doubt every single user is going to continuously update every day for the latest of the latest release, especially when the game is at its current state. I consider myself a typical casual gamer. I tried the pre-release twice now. Both times it almost immediately unexpectedly crashed to desktop, and I am not going to sit there and update it everyday in hopes of it getting better. I\u0027ll happily be playing 1.0.5, while waiting for the proper release. Thus, I have a hard time believing that bandwidth is the primary issue for a Steam only release. However, I do not rule out the possibility. (companies like EA for example, knows that server load is only going to be horrible at launch, thus never bother to do anything about it as it will eventually stable out soon after)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy conclusion is therefore that this \u0022pre-release\u0022 is nothing but a marketing tactic. It\u0027s hardly playable, despite the impressions you get on youtube, as youtubers will not risk low view-rating and thumbs-downs by including all the (game)crashes. However, since that\u0027s the case, a pre-release will fuel the hype-fire since it looks better on video than actually playing it. It also helps with Steam sales and will probably help smooth out the relationship with them, as they are the main publisher. Thus people are probably way better off without the pre-release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd lastly, even though it may just be a simple marketing gig, I don\u0027t think people should be upset about that either. That\u0027s just how the video-gaming industry works today, and \u003Cstrong\u003Ewe (you) as consumer(s) are the one accepting this by fuelling the hype of upcoming/untested/unfinished products\u003C/strong\u003E.
