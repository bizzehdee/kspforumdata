Those who have been using the FAR mod before 1.0 was released have already been baptized into this kind of aerodynamics and are not that affected by the change. And there are some (like myself) who are NOT FAR users, yet I totally understand and appreciate the changes and have quickly adapted to the new system and have absolutely no problems modifying my existing designs and making new ones, and they all fly well.\n\nThen of course, on the negative side of things, tons of threads have cropped up about how this new aerodynamics have \u0022ruined\u0022 fun for them. Then later, some of these people got confused at why Squad kept changing the rules on aerodynamics and heating after releasing the 1.0.1 patch. This definition of ruined fun seems to come mainly from people who had existing aircraft or SSTO-spaceplane designs, and found that their designs no longer work in the new system, or that new designs they create don\u0027t seem to fly well in the new methodology in modelling Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\n\nLet\u0027s see this from the perspective of SQUAD aiming for more \u0022realism\u0022, which I know is a touchy subject, but I believe we all agree that the basic premise of a game like KSP is that, while there really are no Kerbals and there is really no such planetary system as Kerbol\u0027s, the laws of Physics SHOULD work in ANY part of the universe (well hopefully Kerbol System doesn\u0027t reside in some other universe with it\u0027s own set of physics laws). This means, even if Kerbin is not Earth, proportionally, what SHOULD work on Earth\u0027s atmosphere should be mimicked by Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, albeit on a smaller scale.\n\nSo this is what I have observed in most of the rant threads expressing disappointment and even disgust at the new aerodynamics. Although not many share screenshots of their creations, I\u0027ve noticed this pattern--the more their crafts deviate from proven, real-world designs (I.e. outrageous craft with tons of stuff that would induce drag etc.), the more it is not going to work well in the new Kerbin atmosphere. I kept saying that my previous edited/tweaked craft works well now in 1.x.x, and the new creations I\u0027ve made also work well. And I can see the difference why. In the case of my new creations, what I\u0027ve been designing/making so far, are close approximations of high speed, high altitude real-world aircraft, such as the XB-70, or the X-15, or the SR-71. Which means, chances are, in a simulated atmosphere trying to replicate reality, these designs would indeed work as expected, and they will perform predictably. Now, as to my pre-1.0 designs, esp. my SSTO-spaceplanes, I have to admit that they didn\u0027t work when I tried them immediately after the 1.0 update, and thus had to modify them, and these modifcations involved removing every part on the craft that defied realism (i.e. lots of protruding items like batteries, RCS blocks, antennae, etc. and unbalanced fuel tanks). These changes basically forced me to see my craft more as something that would mimic a real-world design. So after my changes, they too flew well and could finally reach LKO.\n\nNow, after establishing this rule, that it seems, if you copy a working, tried and true real-world design (with all parts logically assembled), chances are, your aircraft or SSTO-spaceplane will work in 1.0, the big question now is, did it just kill creativity and fun in designing? Perhaps in a way yes, **but only if your mind is inflexible to the changes**. Real world aircraft designers are also creative people, and perhaps they initially designed their aircraft with some creative biases in mind, but later found out (after wind tunnel tests or simulations) that their designs don\u0027t work well given the rules of real-world aerodynamics. Thus this didn\u0027t take away from their creativity--they simply had to adapt and use that creativity to modify their designs and eventually come up with the design that DOES work. In other words, *there is really no such thing as pure unbridled creativity when it comes to designing real world stuff--you have to bow down to the rules of physics*, but take note that it doesn\u0027t kill creativity, it just makes you work harder at coming up with a good design.\n\nI believe that if these disgruntled individuals take a step back and see the whole design process in this light, they will appreciate the new aerodynamic system (yes, it\u0027s not perfect, but I have faith that SQUAD will keep hammering it until we are satisfied with the definition of a \u0022realistic\u0022 atmosphere) more and bring back the \u0022fun\u0022 that they supposedly lost when 1.x.x was introduced. And this is also why the fun never left my KSP--I accepted the change and wrapped my own creativity around the new rules. That\u0027s how you adapt.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T15:22:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 03:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rodion\\_herrera**"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:16:14Z","Content":"I am only upset about 1.0.1/2... 1.0.1 is less realistic (EX: fighter jet in max thrust dive slows down, **regardless of out streamlined it is**, and rockets **need to fly straight up for many kilometers before starting a gravity turn**), and it is less fun, for those same reasons I just mentioned."},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:19:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I am only upset about 1.0.1/2... 1.0.1 is less realistic (EX: fighter jet in max thrust dive slows down, **regardless of out streamlined it is**, and rockets **need to fly straight up for many kilometers before starting a gravity turn**), and it is less fun, for those same reasons I just mentioned.\n\nThey will keep hammering it, I\u0027m confident about it."},{"CreatedByName":"BDelacroix","CreatedById":121050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:21:13Z","Content":"Never played with FAR.

I still feel KSP should be more about fun (at least stock), but thats my opinion.\n\nFinally, one minor thing ive found kinda limiting, is that the turbojet is completely worthless for every possible use. If you are trying to make a conventional plane, the regular jet is better (20000 isp FTW), and its still going to push you way faster then it would in the past, and as for SSTO/spaceplane, your far better off with the rapiers as they dont cut out as quickly and let you pull higher escape speeds before your forced to switch over to rocket mode/other engines. Is there a reason to use turbojets anymore, i think not, ok slightly better ISP then rapiers, but they have roughly equal weight, wont get you up to 1600m/s before you need rockets, and are only a little bit better at lower speeds. The aircraft choise (at least for me) is a pick between whether i want atmospheric only aircraft using regular jet, or a space capable craft that forces the use of rapiers (which happen to not be all that bad ISP wise in rocket mode compared to alternatives).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T16:30:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 04:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b**"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:42:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there a reason to use turbojets anymore, i think not\n\nAgain, this tone is speaking towards a bias of \u0022seasoned\u0022 KSP players who just want to get the \u0022oomph\u0022 or the most bang for the buck out of every part.
