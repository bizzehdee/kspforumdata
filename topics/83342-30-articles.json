Refurbishing a ship and storing it in the hangar would fit right in with the theme of his mod and honestly, that\u0027s how I\u0027d want to see it done - it sounds weird, but I get attached to my vessels and want to look after them! After much simulating, I\u0027ve refined my jet design down to one that can get anywhere on Kerbin within twenty minutes or so. I call it the Labbit (After a moustachioed rabbit... don\u0027t ask) and Jeb appears to have taken a liking to it, too. I don\u0027t have the heart to break his jet down! Maybe even a minor editing - direct editing of the model to allow you to swap out experiments, alter KAS container contents, that kind of thing. I guess that could be limited by limiting the number of BP you can alter - most experiments are really small in terms of BP. Gods above, I imagine the scripting would be something of a nightmare.
