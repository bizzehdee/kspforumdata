Many people know that. But if you copy the hash including the starting image number such as [ imgur ]blah#0[ /imgur ], it displays the album incorrectly - at least in my browser, the album is displayed bigger than is the space for it and it has a horizontal and vertical slider. Viewing images in albums posted that way is very uncomfortable. So if it could be done, I\u0027d suggest for the forum code to strip the picture number from the tag before preparing the embed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample what I see when the imgur page is created including image number:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ish4s7B.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ish4s7B.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T19:28:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that\u0027s an annoying bug, but I\u0027m not sure if we could tell the tag to ignore this piece of text.
