I think this thread should be used by the mod developers to announce when they have released a mod, or updated it. And that is all it should be used for. What it shouldn\u0027t be is the place where people ask questions or look for support - shouldn\u0027t that be done in the Addon on Requests and support forum?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I bring this up is that I play with 40-50 mods typically, and in an ideal world, I would go into the forum every couple of days and do a quick check of this thread and the Addon development thread to see if there have been updates to the mods I\u0027m using. But right now what happens is I see an a new entry in the thread for modX, I then go into it and have to parse through the last posting, and generally several more (or even several pages) to discover that the recent postings are all complaints, questions or \u0022I love this mod\u0022 messages, and that there has been no actual update of the mod itself. And yes, many mod developers do keep update logs on their OP, but not all do, or do it really clearly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, much of the time I enjoy and participate in these discussions in the existing thread. I would just like to see them elsewhere, or perhaps just see an actual Addon releases / updates announcements dedicated to that sole purpose. I\u0027m thinking that doing this would make checking your mods quicker and more convenient, and make it a lot easier, especially for people who are newer to the modding scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-28T20:53:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2014 08:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by EatVacuum\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T20:50:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why most mods have their version numbers and release dates in the thread title.
