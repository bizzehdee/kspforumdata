The whole idea of warp and teleporting mods. We\u0027ve all gone down the same train of thought by now and obviously the terms \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 and \u0022cheat\u0022 have shown up in there, so I\u0027m not gonna pretend I\u0027m not wading through that territory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT! This isn\u0027t a complete game-breaking hack, nor was it ever meant to be. As I\u0027ve played KSP, I\u0027ve found that setting up colonies is a tedious job. Not only do I have to launch the base (and if it\u0027s on another planet, do the whole transfer window dance and wait 6 months while my poor Kerbals twiddle their thumbs), I have to expand and maintain it, which means running a series of missions, every single one of which will have to do the aforementioned transfer window dance. In summary, the stock game doesn\u0027t provide much incentive for setting up permanent outposts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could of course download a bunch of mods and mine for resources and build stuff, etc. etc. on the base, but in general I don\u0027t like changing the game mechanics too much via mods. I don\u0027t use a lot of mods myself, and the ones I do have are relatively minor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMan this introduction is getting long. ANYWAY. I made a jump drive, but the unique feature of this thing is that to jump anywhere you have to have \u003Cem\u003Ealready been there\u003C/em\u003E and left something for the drive to target. With this plugin, there should be an incentive to set up outposts and a way to semi-easily get stuff out to them, e.g. more Kerbals, fuel, replacement rovers for the ones you crashed, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/kesy62znoqxpt9d/JumpDrive0.6.zip?dl=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#006600;\u0022\u003EDOWNLOAD (WITH SOURCE)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E (I haven\u0027t set up Curse yet)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstallation should be the same as with any other mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EInstructions:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, make sure there is a jump beacon somewhere in space:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Launch a ship that includes a jump beacon part, e.g. the G-02 Cynotsosural Field Generator.

In that you had to have a receiver already in orbit, and to use the jump drive you had to be in flight, and i think you had to be between 25,000 and 75,000 metres to the target, or something similar; along with the high electricity requirement. I would def be interested in seeing a new one for the current versions, but feel it would be better if it could only target a specific custom part, rather then any craft; as well as a min/max range, and maybe some other pre-requisites (be in orbit, or at least out of atmo?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T00:04:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the plan, I just have to slog through scripting all of that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pleborian","CreatedById":27820,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T19:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejump drives eh? im slowly but surely creating a mod that will utilize this technology nicely \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hMtQrVH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hMtQrVH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor those unaware, this is a WIP of the machine from the film contact. using this jumpdrive it could actually make the thing work like it does in the movie\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TJBombard","CreatedById":100333,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T22:07:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what you changed with this release but I\u0027m happy to report a 100% jump success rate thus far.
