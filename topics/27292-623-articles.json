Both were sent to Duna, with contracts to run seismis scans on both Duna and Ike. \u003Cem\u003EEdford\u003C/em\u003E did a landing on Ike and completed the contract as planned with a rover, then returned to Duna\u0027s orbit and transferred some fuel (and Sidbal, and the rover) to \u003Cem\u003ELulo\u003C/em\u003E, which then landed ... about two hundred kilometers short of the south pole, where it was supposed to touch down. Worse, the ship then did a belly flow and I couldn\u0027t stand it up to take off again. So three Kerbals were stranded on the surface, on the other side of the planet from where they were supposed to be. And neither ship had enough life support to last until a rescue mission could arrive from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI eventually decided to make their sacrifice count for something, and sent Burbles off in the rover to make the trip to the south pole.

They managed to land very close to \u003Cem\u003ELulo\u003C/em\u003E, and brought Chadwig and Sidbal aboard with a load of life support supplies. They then took off and managed to crawl back into orbit, completely out of fuel but with just enough life support to await rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got a bit ambitious at this point, and decided to attempt to rescue \u003Cem\u003ELulo\u003C/em\u003E herself from Duna\u0027s surface. In addition to a big tank of life support, the rescue craft (\u003Cem\u003EBurbles\u003C/em\u003E, of course) was designed to land on Duna and allow Haddas to strap some 24/77s onto \u003Cem\u003ELulo\u003C/em\u003E and lift her back into the correct orientation. From there Haddas took the battered cruiser back into orbit and docked with \u003Cem\u003EEdford\u003C/em\u003E again. The five Kerbals now had plenty of life support and the resources of two cruisers, as well as just enough fuel to get home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey made the transfer as planned, but I unfortunately aimed too shallow for the aerocapture and I didn\u0027t get the ships into the planned LKO.

And I had 24m/s to counter it and save the ships (still docked together).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith no other alternative, I launched a tanker to rendezvous and deliver fuel.

Once in orbit, it consisted of four parts (all 1.25m parts) from the rear forward:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- nuclear powered \u0027interplanetary bus\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-probe with Scansat radar, materials bay and two goo experiments, with monoprop manouvre jets and a small tank of fuel for a couple of small radial-attachment engines. The intent was that this one would do the bulk of the work of getting the other 2 probes into position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- similar to above minus the fuel \u002B radial engines (so monoprop only)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- unpowered probe with materials bay, 2x goo, intended to land onLaythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - my interplanetary bus exceeded expectations by not only getting everything to Jool,but also carrying out lot of manouvering to get the probes into the same plane as Laythe. Unfortunately, it was a retrograde orbit, but I wasn;t too concerned about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving ditched the interplanetary bus as it had run out of fuel, I now set about working out the Laythe encounter. I carefully amended the trajectory so that it\u0027d just scrape the surface of Laythe, expecting that, due to the geometry of the encounter, the velocity imparted by decoupling the lander would place the periapsis at somewhere between 10 and 30km. Unfortunately, as it turned out, the probe ended up missing Laythe altogether, at least on this orbit, so i can only hope that it might hit the target on a later orbit. It did take a goo reading near Laythe and radio\u0027d teh results back home though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe othe rtwo probes now had problems. Whilst manouvering to try to miss Laythe by about 200km, something odd happened to fire the engines unexpectedly. At first I was baffled, then realised that the keyboard, which was in my lap, had probably come into contact with the underside of the left arm of the armchair I was in. This happened twice before i realised what was going on, leaving me with barely enough fuel to get the two main probes somewhere nearer their planned approach distance. Unfortunately, about 1,000km was the best I could manage, and a very quick test with the monomprop jets showed it was pointless at this point trying to use them to adjust my orbit further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill five days out from perilaythe, I tried to work out what I could do to try to get the best out of what is left of things. I decided on making sure that the lighter of the two probes had full monoprop tanks, leaving the heavier one with just about 20 units. I then separated the two. The heavier one will simply have to take pot luck with whatever comes near as it will only be able to make relatively minor orbital changes, whilst the other - now redesignated the main probe - has some chance of actually getting into orbit around Laythe or Tylo, or at least doing flybys close enough to do radar scans,with a bit of judicious and very careful tinkering with its trajectory. But it now means that the scientific side of my Jool mission, which was expected to be all done and dusted within a couple of weeks of arrival at Jool, will now take months.
