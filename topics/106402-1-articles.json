Then, according to them, devs are only devs: everything they do should be around their game/mods and they should constantly work to improve their creation.\n\nFor game updates, everyone that complained assumed that 1.0 would perfect, according to their individual standards and actually no one but the devs knew exactly what was in the update.\n\nTherefore, after the release, people realised that it did not fit their dreams of perfect KSP, and emphasized every single issue in the update. This happened sometimes in positive ways: posts made to share issues encountered with the community and to find a solution for these. But sometimes, the feedback from the update was more rude: either literally, with people just complaining about the update; or in a more insidious way, by constantly bringing up the issues with 1.0 in a way that made these issues look like they could have been solved by anyone and that the devs just did their jobs badly (that may also be unconscious, thinking you\u0027re just reporting an issue but actually sounding harsh)\n\nNow about mods; currently, mods are in a huge majority existing solely thanks to volunteer work by fans rewarded by nothing but by satisfaction of enhancing the game or seeing positive feedback from the community (this has been proved recently by the Valve/Bethesda debate on paid mods, which ended up by removal of these paid mods).\n\nFrom there, one has to appreciate mods for what they are in their current state, bearing in mind that the mod devs are also fans of the game, doing mods in their free time and that one cannot expect from them to spend days and nights on their work.\n\nAgain, the issue is there are some people (a minority) that expect the devs work to fit their personal expectations for the game. If one of these people find an issue with the game, they will first complain about the game to the game devs; and then even more to mod devs about mods not fixing their exact issue, with often few work on their side to find a cause.\n\nThis category of people do not like change: change always disappoints because you don\u0027t always get what you want.\n\nThing is, things shouldn\u0027t always stay the same, constant evolution, for a game or anything else, is the source of constantly renewed experiences.\n\nI want to conclude by precising that the people about which I\u0027m talking are a very small minority, but as for everything else in the world, in a community you unfortunately hear only the annoying, noisy minority over the peaceful rest of the group.\n\nOn our side, I think best we can do is ignore these kind of people, just letting them grunt on their own and not giving them the attention they seek. And on the other hand, watch for what we say, try to be supportive towards the work devs do and greet every update with a big smile thinking about the enhanced content of the game.\n\n[Feww, that\u0027s quite a long post, but it\u0027s over ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)]"},{"CreatedByName":"Voidryder","CreatedById":57308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T00:29:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think many of us who\u0027ve been here a while kinda expected a shift in the community when 1.0 came out.
