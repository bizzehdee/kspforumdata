It looks like that :\n\n[![8eoMsoF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8eoMsoF.jpg)](http://imgur.com/8eoMsoF,dYlw7MD#0)\n\nI have got those values :\n\nPhase anfle 117.10\u0027\n\nEjection angle 18 to prograde\n\nEjection Dv 3261 ms\n\n[![dYlw7MD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dYlw7MD.jpg)](http://imgur.com/8eoMsoF,dYlw7MD#1)\n\nAs I understand it Phase angle is angle between Kerbin and duna, and when I looka at the ingame map it loks like this angle is 117\u0027\n\nEjection angle is angle between Kerbin prograde and point where I\u0027m supposed to perform ejection burn.\n\nCalculator says it\u0027s supposed to be 18\u0027, so if we assume that kerbin prograde would be 12 o clock, then I should burn at around 13, right ?\n\nSo I place maneuver node at 13 o clock and ad 3261 dv prograde burn, and that should do the trick. However no matter how much dv I put, I won\u0027t get encounter. I tried to put maneuver node in different places, I tried to add a lot more prograde dv (10k and more), tried to tweak normal/abnormal. No matter what I do, I won\u0027t get encounter. All I have is Kerbin escape marker, but no Duna encounter. What am I doing wrong ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T10:17:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 10:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Khazar**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T22:11:52Z","Content":"You have the worst phase angle ever.

Only fiddle if you happen to notice an encounter \u0022pop\u0022 up and then disappear... then you can just turn around 180 degrees and backtrack a bit at a time until you find it again. Adjust thrust limiters by right-clicking engine(s) to help reduce excess thrust for fine-tuning. If you cannot get an encounter during your ejection burn, that\u0027s fine. The reason we do ejection burns at low altitude is so that we get the most juice out of the fuel. That being said, burning 99% of it at low altitude, and 1% outside kerbin\u0027s SoI is almost the same thing (close enough that it won\u0027t make a big difference). So this means that you can perform course correction burns partway there (aim for about a third of the way up [distance between kerbin\u0027s and duna\u0027s orbits]... it\u0027s not exact, but very good). Once higher up, it may be easier to get an intercept... especially since you can once again play with maneuver nodes to get it precise. Setting duna as a target while setting nodes will also help you find an encounter, just keep an eye on the point of closest approach... you can mess with the node until you decrease the distance enough for an encounter. A final correction burn just before encountering duna can also help set up aerocapture... which can save a lot of fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"Khazar","CreatedById":138578,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T06:30:10Z","Content":"*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9*![koPI37s.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/koPI37s.jpg)\n\nThe white line marks Kerbin prograde. \n\nAs I zoom in, the prograde line would be roughly where blue dot is :\n\n![u0wsJaM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/u0wsJaM.jpg)\n\nSo, would my ejection burn point would be somewhere near the red dot or green dot ? \n\n![UKDcfvw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UKDcfvw.jpg)\n\nPlacing maneuvere node at red point with 3300 dv prograde gives me an orbit as seen at last picture.\n\nI have Kerbin escape marker, but my new orbit doesn\u0027t change much no matter what how I tweak maneuver node.

I\u0027ve never launched to one, and I can\u0027t see a need to. \n\nThe important part is that you always have to know prograde/retrograde in relation to what. If you\u0027re in a \u0022normal\u0022 0 inclination equatorial orbit around kerbin, burning prograde on the dayside is in effect burning retrograde relative to kerbol. So to travel inwards in the kerbol system, you should burn prograde between kerbin sunrise and mid-day, depending on your TWR.
