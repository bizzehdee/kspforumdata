A small final stage with a single fuel tank and engine will be the easiest thing to put in orbit, you can go lighter but you might not make it back (I hope you plan on saving those kerbals) - keep it simple and you\u0027ll have a lot more success early on.

You may not like the idea of mods right now, but once you\u0027ve seen most of everything in the game the mods are there to give you more to do like remote communication satellite control, launching controllable probes from a mother ship, adding solar panels and battery storage, there\u0027s much more to do with these tools than is currently implemented in the vanilla game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing a few weeks and all I\u0027ve added has been mechjeb, carts\u002BOA lights (mostly to get flood lights for my landers) and camera pack.

Mind that navigation compass, try to keep your vessel totally vertical for at least the first 10,000 meters of ascent and gradually lower the nose of your ship to the horizon.
