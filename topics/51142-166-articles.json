In some cases it seems your shaders actually perform \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C/em\u003E than the stock ones, though the averages are literally the exact same. My test was not strenuous, so if someone else wants to try another test, go ahead. Settings were default terrain, scatters set to 100%, anti-aliasing 2x, vsync every frame, limit 60 fps, pixel light 12, cascades 8, render fantastic, texture quality full, aerodynamic normal. I think you\u0027ll notice the pattern pretty quickly.
