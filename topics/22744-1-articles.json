I think this was acceptable in prior KSP versions, but post 0.18.4, it\u0027s been really hard-hitting on memory usage. On my system (Win7-64, 4GB of RAM), I commonly see KSP using 1.4GB or more. If it was competing with the OS for memory, I am sure things would get crashy soon enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently, from what I hear, the switch to Unity 4 traded speed-ups in the game for more memory usage.
