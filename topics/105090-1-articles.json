It served a couple of purposes - first, Dres was one sad and lonely place, so it needed some love. Also, I liked the idea of having a static asteroid ring where players could do some pretty epic asteroid mining operations. Side note - looks like you folks absolutely destroyed my two month bet on how soon you would discover Dres had a procedural asteroid ring\n\nI\u0027ll say we destroyed it- it was found the day before release, not two months after!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T23:47:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 11:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DuoDex**\n  \nfixed your quote cause OCD :)"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T23:38:30Z","Content":"That\u0027s hilarious!
