However another body was also forming the Dwarf Planet known as the Mun. However this was no ordinary dwarf planet for early in its developement the Mun formed a thick atmosphere with lakes,oceans,rivers,and possibly inteligent life(Hint: Munoliths). One day the Mun passed very close to the young kerbin within 6,000 kilometers of its surface during this capture it is believed that the Mun may have had a smaller Mun thrown off during this capture. Eventually the Mun settled into its 11,400 kilometer orbit and all was well until 5.2 MYA it is believed Kerbol suffered a massive Solar Flare that caused mass extinctions on Kerbin and Wiping the Mun clean of its atmosphere. Now the Mun is a dead rock with reminders of what it once was these include: Arches, Canyons, and River deltas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T21:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot to rain on your parade and all, but I\u0027m afraid it won\u0027t work. Extensive cratering like the Moon and Mun have took place before and up to 600MYA. If Mun had an atmosphere then, most of those impactors would have burned up before hitting the surface and making craters, and the craters the others formed would have been eroded away by wind and water (which is why earth has so few craters).
