For upgraded reactors, this is a must. However for unupgraded reactors it has the unfortunate effect of being able to get near the same temp for the reactor thus killing off efficiency.

The only difference that upgrading makes is that the radiator can reach a higher temperature before shutting down. An unupgraded radiator will overheat and shut down, while an upgraded one will stabilize at higher temperatures.

You could also connect a generator to one of those microwave thermal receivers. if you really don\u0027t want a generator, you could also get away with a microwave power receiver.
