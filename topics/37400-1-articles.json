You will blow stuff up a LOT! Don\u0027t let that discourage you. After ending flight, look back and try to find out what broke first. Remember, SPACE TAPE FIXES EVERYTHING. Struts are your friend. People like me, who have gone for more ambitious stuff, call it space tape because it\u0027s about as good as duct tape. It can fix ANYTHING. Don\u0027t be afraid to use it liberally.
