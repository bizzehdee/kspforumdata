This engine would start out as a typical turbojet for takeoff and landing. This engine would have \u0022hinged\u0022 compressor and turbine blades that will be spun out using centrifugal (I think that is how you spell it) force. One set of turbine blades will be magnetized and held \u0022up\u0022 using similar polarity provided by electromagnets. The starter motor will then begin moving to crankshaft, causing the compressor blades and other turbine blades to spin out. From here it starts like any other jet engine; fuel is injected, the starter spools up the turbine and compressors until the engine can keep itself running. After takeoff, the engine will engage the afterburner located aft of the SCRAMjet portion of the engine. As the spacecraft reaches the limit of the turbojet portion, it will shut of fuel to the turbojet section of the compressor and reroute it to the SCRAMjet combustion chamber. A clutch is then applied to the crankshaft of the turbojet portion, causing the blades to spin down. This, combined with the onrush of air, would blow them flat against the crankshaft. The air then flows through what is, in essence, a tube and reaches the intake portion of the SCRAMjet. The SCRAMjet then continues to accelerate the vehicle. Obviously, you would still need a rocket engine to \u0022kick\u0022 the spacecraft into orbit, since my whole idea of a \u0022staged\u0022 engine is air breathing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just typing this as it comes to me head.

With a turbofan, the bypass air is taken after the first stage fan blades. The turbojet\u0027s bypass is all about cooling, controlling the speed and pressure of combustion air for the turbojet itself, and providing combustion air for the afterburner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe high-bypass turbofan\u0027s bypass air provides additional cold-air thrust (i.e. the bypass air is accelerated mechanically by the fan). The bypass air also provides a noise reduction benefit, with the cylinder of cold air absorbing some of the sound from the jet combustion, something which often is of little to no concern with an afterburning turbojet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s the low-bypass turbofans with afterburners, just to blur the line down the middle. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T18:33:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Trueborn\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Trueborn\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlas, the X-43A reached a top speed of 10,461 \u003Cstrong\u003Ekm/h\u003C/strong\u003E, which is 2,906 m/s.

Also the SABRE engines in KSP are not realistic. First the ISP is wrong. Second the precooler is only an extra part in ksp that MUST be on it to work. Now it\u0027s been a few months since I looked into the SABRE but if I remember the basics it uses a variable intake to reduce drag, uses raw air for low altitude then starts compressing it and super cooling it in the upper altitude range and then cuts of completely and uses internal oxidizer in the end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso to be fair... an SSTO SHouldnt be using multiple thrust sources.
