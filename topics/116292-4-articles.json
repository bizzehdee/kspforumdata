But, especially with Effect nodes, texture definitions etc some of the scripts have paths defined relative to the gamedata folder, like nearly every mod does, even squad. You had to adjust all of these in all the scripts. And if a new version gets released, repeat the whole process. Its just not worth the effort. It will be a mess, if not at the beginning, then after the first few new released versions, or if you add other mods that want to make use of another one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides this, the directory structure is quite logical, IMHO. You have smokescreen as the base mod, realplume making use of it, and realplume-stock adjusting realplume for stock. If you also have hotrockets, and/or coolrockets, they also use smokescreen. So all those mods residing in their own subdirectory of gamedata is rather logical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last: CKAN is one of the best things that happened to ksp. Its not only the \u0022burden\u0022 of the installation process that it takes from you (dumping some files into gamedata isnt that hard), but keeping everything updated and managed even with many mods that have different (inter)dependencies.

It all seemed pretty easy to install to me (hence making CKAN rather needless and a bit overkill, at least in my mind).\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just not a big fan of CKAN, and I only use it on a limited basis (unless a mod author specifically instructs the user to do so on the OP). If you want people to install via CKAN, and you become \u0022extra grumpy\u0022 if they do not, then I kindly recommend that you should tell them that in the OP.
