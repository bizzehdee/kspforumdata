Also, this tank seems a bit light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming my math is right, the LS-19A appears to be able to support something like 245\u002B kerbals. If I read this right it takes up to 2.4 CO2/sec and converts it into 1.2 O2/sec. 2.4/sec = 8640 CO2/hour divided by 17.5 means it can take the CO2 generated by 493.71 Kerbals/hour and converts that into enough O2 for 246.86 Kerbals/hour. That seems excessive. I like the 50% conversion rate for this small recycler, but I think it should support far fewer kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame issue with the LS-32C. It appears that it can take the CO2 generated by 1440 Kerbals /hour (7/sec * 60 * 60 / 17.5) and creates enough O2 for 864 Kerbals /hour (4.2/sec * 60 * 60 / 17.5). Seems a bit high. Also, this larger recycler only has a 60% effeciency which doesn\u0027t seem like much of a bonus for it\u0027s large size. Although maybe being able to support nearly 3.5 times as many Kerbals is supposed to be it\u0027s advantage. Of course, I can\u0027t image the lag I\u0027d generate building a ship/station that could support 246 kerbals, let alone 864. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027d like to suggest adjusting the values so the LS-19A used up to 1.75 CO2/min and created up to 0.875 O2/min. That would support up to 6 Kerbals worth of CO2 at 50% effeciency. And set the LS-32C at 3.5 CO2/min and 2.625 O2/min. That would let it support up to 12 Kerbals worth of CO2 at 75% effeciency. In both cases, I\u0027d leave the EC/s value as is (or even increase it, but definitely don\u0027t lower it). The only issue I see is if you try to have more kerbals then the module can support, you\u0027ll have to be careful which CO2 scrubbers you turn off. I don\u0027t suppose you can have the recycler convert up to it\u0027s rating per hour and then scrub the rest? For instance, if you had 7 Kerbals (that\u0027s 122.5 CO2/hour) on a ship fitted with an LS-19A, it would convert 105 CO2/hour into 52.5 O2/hour and scrub out the remaining 17.5 CO2/hour that the kerbals are generating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t suppose there is a way to give a warning when CO2 levels get high?

It\u0027s just an issue with how another mod is interacting with ioncross and I\u0027m hoping you might have a suggestion. Back in my 0.25 game, I ended up using \u0022UbioWeldingLtd\u0022 mod to \u0022weld\u0022 a large chunk of my InterPlanetary Vehicle into a single part. Mostly this included fuel tanks and RCS thrusters, but I also included the Large Recycler. I had thought everything was working fine, though since the ship is on a voyage from Moho to Eve, I\u0027d not really been paying much attention to it. Now I\u0027ve upgraded to 0.90 but I wanted to keep my old .25 game going so I could use it as a test platform. Again, everything seems to be working except I\u0027ve basically caught up on all my flights and I have 4 days until my IPV reaches it\u0027s next burn. I figured I\u0027d just load up the ship and advance time by four days but I started to watch my Kerbals all disappear. So after reloading, I paid more attention and while my \u0022welded\u0022 part says it\u0027s got the recycler and it appears to be working, when I advance time you can tell that it really isn\u0027t. O2 gets quickly used up and CO2 level increase to toxic levels so that by the end of the day, all 10 of my kerbals are dead. Anyway, I\u0027m wondering if you might have any idea why the recycler might not be working and how I might go about fixing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chrisl","CreatedById":114320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T22:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I just noticed two issues with EVA O2.
