Repeat until a \u0022weld\u0022 has occurred, and the docking ports have been deleted.\n\nThat completely bypasses the handwaving needed for the superdense docking ports, which IMO, is kinda lame.\n\nSo the psuedo code would look something like:\n\n    if((docking port node has other docking port) \u0026\u0026 (both docking ports are connecting to things)){    foreach docking port:    {      pull one end of the stack through the docking port      adjust stack so that the docking port is no longer there      remove docking port once it\u0027s no longer     }}\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T18:11:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 06:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by almagnus1**"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T16:53:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The way I currently solve this is by applying KAS struts via EVA to strut-attachment points.\n\nKerbal Attachment System is a great way of making \u0022wobbly\u0022 docking ports into solid connections.

These are the giant strut vehicles, btw, not the EVA/VTOL ships. Go find another mod which can give you docking ports for that size of a ship. The problem comes with the masses involved, as the docking ports are so fragile that you can rip the ship apart by SAS torque alone. I can look into KAS again, but AFAIK, it didn\u0027t help solve the problem. I imagine QuantumStruts (which is a great mod IMO) also falls into this category, as I really like quantum struts for keeping things stationary inside of an SSTO cargo bay."}]}
