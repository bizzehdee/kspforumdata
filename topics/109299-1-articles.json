These are the giant strut vehicles, btw, not the EVA/VTOL ships. Go find another mod which can give you docking ports for that size of a ship. The problem comes with the masses involved, as the docking ports are so fragile that you can rip the ship apart by SAS torque alone. I can look into KAS again, but AFAIK, it didn\u0027t help solve the problem. I imagine QuantumStruts (which is a great mod IMO) also falls into this category, as I really like quantum struts for keeping things stationary inside of an SSTO cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
