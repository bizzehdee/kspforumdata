Given that parts of RoverDude\u0027s Karbonite mod were more or less directly integrated into 1.0, I\u0027ve been looking over [RoverDude\u0027s other mods](http://bobpalmer.github.io/UmbraSpaceIndustries/):\n\nUSI Kolonization Systems? Probably not; it certainly isn\u0027t \u0022a smaller feature.\u0022\n\nKarbonite? No, the basic idea is already bundled into 1.0\u0027s ISRU system.\n\nKarbonite Plus? Maybe; the notion of rarer but more valuable resources that can be harvested (and brought back at a profit?) would be neat.\n\nFreight Transport Technologies? More of a parts pack than \u0022a smaller feature.\u0022\n\nAsteroid Recycling Technologies? Probably not; the new ISRU system already allows mining asteroids.\n\nUSI Exploration Pack? Also more of a parts pack, but if I remember correctly it includes external seating that can be crewed at launch, which is a feature that\u0027s been requested for a long time. That\u0027d be mighty convenient. Of course with the new aero, sitting outside a rocket at launch is asking for trouble!\n\nUSI Survivability Pack? It has tiny all-in-one escape pods that are pretty cool.\n\nAlcubierre Warp Drive? Cool idea, but not really thematically appropriate for stock.\n\nSounding Rockets? Small low-tech uncrewed rockets that flesh out the early game. Could be useful.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n(And RoverDude, if you\u0027re reading this--want to pour any kerosene on the fire? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Also, seriously, thanks for everything you do; your contributions significantly improve something that is already amazing.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rithsom","CreatedById":114646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T02:49:12Z","Content":"I think it might be pipes for transferring resources between crafts and bases.
