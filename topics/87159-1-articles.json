I\u0027m looking for stock-alike aerodynamic separatrons in a variety of configurations.

I\u0027ve tried different decoupling forces and anything over 10% will make them flip inward with enough force to kill whatever they impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of the problem stems from the dry mass of SRBs being too low and how they work in KSP. In real life, SRB won\u0027t stop burning at once but their thrust will start declining instead. The point where the TWR of the boosters reach 1 is when they are ejected. They usually just drift slowly outward and away from the main vehicle thanks to slight aerodynamic asymmetry. It would work wonders if someone could make realistic SRBs but in the meantime you have to play with some work around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whovian","CreatedById":101923,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T16:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI rather like this idea.
