Though, FTL can allow you to traverse some paths that you could not otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything sub-light preserves the causality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warhorse","CreatedById":83495,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T23:48:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime passes more slowly at high speeds and in strong gravity, so you could certainly travel forward in time.
