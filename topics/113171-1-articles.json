To my great happiness, I have landed one Kerbal on both Minmus and the Mun! However, I am still not sure what to do next. I have made some of these threads before, but this was in the past, and I love hearing suggestions! I have unlocked a lot of parts, and am wondering if I should go to Duna, or make more missions to Minmus and Mun with three Kerbals and more. Or should I upgrade my Tracking Station, so I can see unknown objects?
