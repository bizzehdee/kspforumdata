I think it only happens on the last tank too, and it\u0027s more pronounced with clusters of engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat on earth is causing this?

It doesn\u0027t always happen, but basically what\u0027s happening is the engine is flaming out for a split second. As to the change in the sound after that, it could be atmospherics, in that being at a higher altitude causes a change in sound, but that\u0027s just a guess. COuld also easily be an sound generation artifact.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grizzlol","CreatedById":40170,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T02:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne reason for a change in sound of clustered engines is due to their synchronization. If you have a multiple of the exact same sound playing at the same time then the slightest change in their sync makes an audible difference. Think of dropping two golf balls on a rock floor at the same time. Even though they are only two balls, they produce an acoustic frequency (pitch) when they hit the floor, which may sound very different with the slightest mistiming.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-11T02:15:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2013 02:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Grizzlol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
