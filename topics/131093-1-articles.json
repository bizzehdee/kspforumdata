I was in the process of pulling out Remote Tech from my save, and loaded up my save, and about half of my vessels (including a space station) were eaten by the kraken on load, as the game failed to load most of them due to missing parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, these were all crewed vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo after closing down the game, restoring Remote Tech, and loading it up again, I saw that all the missing vessels were truly gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis leads me to my question: Is it possible to engineer in better safeguards with crafts that are missing parts so when the above happens (or CKAN derps after a mod\u0027s folder structure changes), we don\u0027t irrecoverably lose craft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"genericeventhandler","CreatedById":149557,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T11:22:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t play anymore without the

aren\u0027t loaded to begin with. \u00A0Instead, the game should leave the craft there so players have an opportunity to fix the error, rather than risk losing craft when something with mods go
