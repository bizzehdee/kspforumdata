No, they aren\u0027t finished, and unfortunately I don\u0027t know if I can finish them. I would be more than happy to unwrap/texture them, but I\u0027m not sure what the game requires in terms of IVAs. Which is probably why I\u0027ll do those last, if at all. I would like to do them though, but with the redesign of the CM, the IVA itself needs to be redone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
