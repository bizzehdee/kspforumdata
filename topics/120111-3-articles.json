I want to try it out on kerbin myself. I want to have a large system size, but hate how when using color maps results in flat terrain and attempt to increase reult in mesas more than mountain. Other than that I have played a bit with Kittopia in the past, but have no idea how to set up kerbin to play with procedural generation. I don\u0027t expect you to go out of your way to detail things as you\u0027re still working on it yourself, but if you have footage of Eve or kerbin I would love to see it when you have time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T06:36:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell I can have a look at it, but I can\u0027t promise when it\u0027ll be ready. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, how about I give you some blooper shots...from times when procedural generation broke everything!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AbVoxok.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AbVoxok.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YEVb40W.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YEVb40W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/seIGqEZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022seIGqEZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T18:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KillAshley\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KillAshley\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewell I can have a look at it, but I can\u0027t promise when it\u0027ll be ready. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, how about I give you some blooper shots...from times when procedural generation broke everything!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AbVoxok.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/AbVoxok.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YEVb40W.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/YEVb40W.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/seIGqEZ.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/seIGqEZ.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
