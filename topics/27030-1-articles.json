Are you playing the store version or the Steam version (though there really shouldn\u0027t be a difference.) The other question is, where is your KSP_Win folder located if you are playing the store version? The preferred location for a Windows machine is in something like \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC:\\Games\\KSP_win\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you keep it on your desktop, or even in Program Files, you will have trouble with it sooner or later due to system permissions. The game should have created a saves folder the very first time you made a save though, even if you\u0027re on the demo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re launching the game from a shortcut, you might try the following just to make sure that you don\u0027t have two KSP folders going:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Right click on the shortcut that you use to start the game (wherever that shortcut is) and choose Properties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Click the button that says \u0022Open File Location.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Check the path at the top of the window against where you believe your KSP folder is located. Addtionally, this should be the folder that contains the correct saves and screenshots and all the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the game retain any information from flight to flight? That is, if you launch a vessel into orbit, or even put one on the launchpad, then hit escape and choose Space Center, can you then go to the tracking station and choose to switch to the flight you just left? If you get out of the game and come back, is the flight still there?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T01:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are playing the steam version you can also use F12 to take screenshots.
