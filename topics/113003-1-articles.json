I have had a large and complex station in orbit at one point but there was no way to dock with it as my frame rate dropped into the seconds per frame range when attempting to dock with even the most meager craft.\n\nI would love to see the capacity to build very large and complex structure but as I have no real programming knowledge, writing the code myself is beyond my ability."},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T17:56:15Z","Content":"\\*facepalms\\* we have a mod swimming somewhere....\n\nHere is da link [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107273-0-90-UbioZur-Welding-Ltd-Continued-2-1-1-(2015-01-14)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107273-0-90-UbioZur-Welding-Ltd-Continued-2-1-1-%282015-01-14%29)\n\nGithub version has 1.0"},{"CreatedByName":"Lesipher","CreatedById":146288,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T20:15:14Z","Content":"Thank you for the response.
