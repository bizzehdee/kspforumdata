First difference I noticed was that initialRotation seems to be ignored. Like stock the 10x setup has the KSC start out in day light but now it starts at night time which was the behavior when initialRotation was set to 100.1833 like you have for Earth but I set the initialRotation = 0. Next I noticed strange behavior for the positions of the planets. The values returned by TransferWindowPlanner are correct with the earlier RSS version but the latest is giving me crazy values like the next transfer window is 7 years in the future for eve. In this case I set the Epoch = 0 but something is going on with the epoch code that planets are in the wrong places.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T02:57:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChangelog\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev8.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Finally fixed (I trust) all remaining issues from the loader rewrite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Borrowed some PQSMod values from 6.4x Kerbin (kudos to Raptor831 et al)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejsimmons: per the last few posts there was a loader error, which I have now corrected.
