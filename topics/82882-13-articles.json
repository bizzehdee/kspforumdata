I can\u0027t find any links to back it up, but I believe this is one of the reasons why FractalUK started using the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/FractalUK/KSPInterstellar/wiki/Megajoules\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMegaJoules\u003C/a\u003E resource in the first place, in order to allow expensive systems to draw huge power directly from the generator without requiring it to be stored in batteries first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe fix for this, as is implied above, is to have enough batteries that you can store enough energy that the microwave transmitter sees a constant supply from the batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe plug-in fix might be to replace (ModuleManager) the stock EC solar module with an improved version that operates holistically across all of the panels on a ship in the same way as the generators do, i.e. creates MJs directly if the total solar input is GTE 1kec/s\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-01T08:11:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2014 08:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AetherGoddess\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarification and additional options\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T09:08:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso, I had this nice save with some stuff I don\u0027t want to lose...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently using KSPi without any (I believed) problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I noticed a problem with the solarpanels, in short:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen I put a solar panel on a ship it starts to heat up (temperature gradually raises to really hot... like 500\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see the temperature on the right click men\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B9 since I have Deadly reentry (I think it\u0027s that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem is that the energy produced by the panels doesn\u0027t scale appropriately with distance from the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI discovered this because I put a satellite around duna and I was getting 17.5 EC/sec from the XL gigantron or whatever is called (should be 18 around kerbin, and a lot less around duna)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have some questions and I\u0027ll put those out there in case someone is kind enough to help me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- I know this is striclty a KSPi problem, I deleted all mods except of KSPi and I still had the same problem\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- This problem affects just one panel, no matter how many I put on a ship, the first one gets the problem (\u0027the first\u0027 as in the first one listed on the save file)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- other panels behave just fine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy questions are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA- would I be able to modify my save in order to use Interstellar lite instead of KSPi?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (I know it is not supposed to be compatible, but I\u0027ve had some success in the past moving parts around or manually changing the savefile to \u0022save\u0022 it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB- is there another way to get the job done?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC- how can it be that just one panel has this problem? understanding the issue may help me solve it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone for your help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boribori","CreatedById":116708,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T10:49:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it has been mentioned here earlier that you have to have only the ORS dll v 1.2, but maybe it would be good to also add that to the installation instructions.
