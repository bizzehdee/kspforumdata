I quickly threw one together with Spaceplane\u002B parts (also landing gear, RAPIERs, and a MechJeb unit) and took it to orbit with ease. When I had it land, I wanted to end up on the runway like you just about always see happen in videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set MechJeb to autoland at the KSC runway (or at least, that\u0027s what I thought the thing was supposed to do) and started timewarping. After some minutes, it crashed down in the desert with no apparent attempt to save any of the pieces. It was about a third of the planet away from KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I tried flying it level towards KSC for a while, aware that I was slowly losing fuel. I made it there, finally, then decided to see if MechJeb\u0027s autoland was any better if you started deep in the atmosphere instead of 50-odd kilometers up. Well, it was closer to the Kerbal Space Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, I quicksaved! I tried to land it manually, and...well...most of the parts survived, even if they weren\u0027t attached to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a couple of interrelated questions.
