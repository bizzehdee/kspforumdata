To add science to the second lab you have to undock it and have it as a separate ship. Then you can add the science and redock it to the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 2 labs present when you click the \u0022process in lab\u0022 flask icon it just fills one lab (in this case the first lab added to the station). When that lab is full it doesn\u0027t start filling the other lab, it just gives you the error message that there is not enough data storage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis pic shows a completely empty lab and the error message being shown (the lab on the right is full).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/aVF3QrQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aVF3QrQh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aVF3QrQh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the current solution is to undock the second lab (with the craft that has the new science data) and then add the science data. Once full you can re-dock it and everything else works as expected. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/dnMuGyw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dnMuGywh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dnMuGywh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(research works as expected and both labs can transmit their data at the same time and that works fine too.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried moving the science into the 2nd lab via EVA and then trying to add it. I\u0027ve tried changing what part on the craft it is controlled from. I\u0027ve tried having the craft with the science data docked from different sides of the station.
