Now rocket engines are very diverse and I need to have instrument for fast and pinpoint selection of optimal engine, especially when rocket will be firing in atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After several days thinking, remembering mathematic \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E and fighting with google docs system, special spreadsheet was born and I decided to share my tools for all KSP community. This spreadsheet can answer for next question: If I have payload of certain mass and my ship should have certain \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv, what is engine (engines) and how many I need to use for make this ship with minimal mass. And what is the next engine in this competition for certain task? This decision is not as so simply as it was before, especially if you want to return something from Eve surface back to orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And stop talking, here is this spreadsheet:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13_dYf7KHG7SMvhH4AlCdh4sf7Sv74RFX1-4igcfXjRM/edit#gid=1558315838\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOptimal engine selector 1.0.2 v1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETable has 3 sheets (and several hidden sheets in Russian language): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COptimal engine\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/strong\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 calculation for selection of optimal engine (engines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCraft dV\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/strong\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 calculation of craft dV based on liquid fuel and oxidizer quantities on board and total ship mass (all these data you can easily extract from stock game without any mods).

Results are not sorted, but masses marked with color scale from green to red thought white color (from min to max resulted mass).
