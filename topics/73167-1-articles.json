My current styling, as you can see here, is an extra piece of geometry with two halves, one of which glows more than the other (indicating the primary direction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://www.cubby.com/pl/AllSmallRoboticsParts-Glow.jpg/_91178de75909425f800c9c5478cb10e8\u0022 alt=\u0022_91178de75909425f800c9c5478cb10e8\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately this doesn\u0027t account for the fact that players can invert the direction of rotation of these parts. Presuming I can get code support from Sirkut, what I would like to do is have the lights switch based on whether the invert flag is set or not. I was thinking perhaps having an emissive for each light, representing full brightness, with an animation each that fades from a dull glow to a full glow. The dull glow is so that the \u0022inactive\u0022 light is still visible in dark environments. By controlling both animations the effect of turning one light off and the other on could be achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould this be the best way to go about having separately controlled lights on a part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Zodius\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T14:40:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never managed to get two actual emissive anims working together in any version of unity, the only way i can get physics anims to work in multiple is to cut the model and animate seperately then assemble in unity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But I also have a need for multicolored emissives and I opt for the cheat route, generally most emissives textures are white but I color mine the color i want then set the emissive slider on the material to a white value from the default black, of course the downside is that they glow all the time but if all you need is a right side and a wrong side this\u0027d be the easy way out I reckon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eworks well for most things i find pic below using colored emis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vbaVmZ6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vbaVmZ6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPs really liking the models BTW \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T01:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpannerMonkey(smce)\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpannerMonkey(smce)\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve never managed to get two actual emissive anims working together in any version of unity, the only way i can get physics anims to work in multiple is to cut the model and animate seperately then assemble in unity.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for this.
