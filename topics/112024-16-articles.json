It\u0027s really cool that you find the launch vehicles useful and practical. It won\u0027t be too long before an update, but I want to get a lot of things right and not just ship it out the door half baked.\u003Cp\u003ESee, that\u0027s why I like you guys so much. You put the hard work in to make it a good product and you have excellent support. I use these rocket builds for almost everything I do. After I mess around building something from scratch, then fine tune it, trouble shoot etc., there\u0027s just not enough time. I can just take one of your builds and tweak it a bit for the mission and I\u0027m off to the races! Great stuff...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, it took a few days of messing around. The biggest piece of the puzzle was adding specific scale values for the larger fairing, so that the original part is stretched left to right but not up and down. Then we had to tweak and trim things just the right way for all the edges to line up the way we want. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re welcome to test it out with this beta zip of the CMES/Aero folder \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/goq872gds6jo7xn/Aero.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/goq872gds6jo7xn/Aero.zip?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, I will give it a shot. I appreciate you letting me test this out. I\u0027ll let you know my results. I knew there had to be something to make it work. I could get the fairing to stop at a given height but it would still wrap around on the upper part of it so when I went to jettison it, it would either hang up or hang up really bad and cause all kinds of things to go wrong. The only way I could get it to not cause problems was by making it too large but that was really ugly. It got very frustrating by the end of my night, tonight\u0027s! So, your response was a big welcome to my frustration level. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again and and ill let you know what I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T04:16:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Budgie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Budgie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYanfret, what kind of mission profile are you using for these flights with the USA and secondary payloads? I was playing around myself, and was curious to see what you\u0027re running.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m struggling with that because it really doesn\u0027t make any sense to combine Orion with the payload unless its a small habitat module with a toilet.

I\u0027m either not understanding how to use this or I\u0027m not explaining it right or both. I cant seem to get the fairing to work. I see the new parts and I\u0027m selecting them but they behave the same way as the old ones did. I took a screenshot of what is happening without messing with the start stop settings and one with messing with them. Im only right clicking on the part, not going into the cfg file. I took a couple of screenshots in the hanger but I can\u0027t seem to post them. Basically, Im trying to use a fairing towards the middle of the orion or a few stages down from the top. If I od this and use the fairing it shoots all the way to the top of the orion or clips and curves into the stage that im trying to cover. Kind of trying to make it look like those big decouplers on the XLS ships. What am I doing wrong?

On a white SLS with Shuttle-derived boosters, and the EUS (TALUS), with a payload of a procedural fairings interstage for the USA, an Orion and Orion fairing above and the Altair from some other CMES craft file, I was able to reach the Mun, land and return to Kerbin. No second upper stage for Orion. I used the following mission profile:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSC \u0026gt; 400km orbit \u0026gt; Orion separation and redock to now-exposed Altair \u0026gt; TLI burn with EUS \u0026gt; Course Correction to set Pe at 150 km with EUS \u0026gt; Circularisation at Mun Pe with EUS \u0026gt; Separation from EUS \u0026gt; Land Altair (I\u0027ll see about adding latitude limits to this mission profile later) \u0026gt; Reorbit, dock and return to Kerbin without establishing orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet it be known, however, that this was pushing the upper limits of the configuration. I had 100-200 m/s dV left in the EUS after circularising into a 0-inclination orbit around the Mun. The limiting factor, though, was the Altair. From 150km 0-inclination orbit, I was able to land in the centre of the polar crater, but just about not quite reach the original orbit with the NOS ascent module. I was about 40 m/s short, I think. I was using Mechjeb throughout, so there may be a way of doing it manually to make it more dV efficient (doglegging the ascent?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA note about the USA. I don\u0027t think I\u0027d use the procedural version. I\u0027d be happiest with something that just fits the Altair inside, as anything else would likely be smaller than that (the Extended Mission Module, which I use without the Orbital Orb). I can\u0027t really think of other payloads in there, though. What would you suggest to ride along with Orion?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
