The above image has a background of the production sketches which Steve Burg sent over \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and are already on the site \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 along with a foreground showing the original 3D Thunderbolt model made in Lightwave, with a bit of the wireframe showing through. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have been following the site, the current update is dated 26th October, 2014\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6. And includes a new section that looks at the N\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2Grath character and an interview with Jim McPherson who largely designed the big guy. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s even some previously unreleased behind the scenes video from the co-founder of Optic Nerve, Everett Burrell, along with the artwork and photos.

Since I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m still deciding which of the original Lightwave 3D models to add in the next update (the orthos should be very handy for anyone wanting to do an accurate scratch build of them), let me know if anyone has any preferences. Dropping a note here or better yet on the Facebook page would be handy \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 as the addition of the model images is a one time deal and will be limited to a half dozen or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always, all the new content from the guys who worked on the show will be included in the download of the website. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB5Scrolls Facebook Page\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.facebook.com/B5Scrolls\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.facebook.com/B5Scrolls\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB5Scrolls Website (free to download)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.b5scrolls.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.b5scrolls.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
