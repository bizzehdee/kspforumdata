(or more importantly, is there another better way to know when to launch for rendezvous)\n\nNote: *I want to be more efficient with my time and launch without having to do many orbits to rendezvous with orbiting crafts. I will also be sending this as a PM to voneiden*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T04:35:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 04:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zhollett**"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T05:48:29Z","Content":"The difference between \u0022time to apoapsis\u0022 and \u0022angle to apoapsis\u0022 is specifically down to the amount of effort it takes the rocket to accelerate UP to apoapsis. Loosely speaking, KSC will not remain centered under your rocket while it accelerates to apoapsis (which would mean time = angle).\n\nSo, to measure \u0022angle to apoapsis\u0022, you\u0027d fly a test rocket along your intended trajectory, and when it reaches apoapsis, you\u0027d check its longitude versus that of KSC.\n\nAssuming you can fly the same trajectory every time (or have MechJeb do it), then you\u0027d launch when \u0022angle between target and launchpad\u0022 = \u0022angular distance travelled by target during launch time\u0022 minus \u0022angular distance travelled by rocket during launch\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T05:53:26Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think so - that depends on your ascent profile and could vary even on identical rockets.\n\nInstead of looking at angle (in which case you may not have a precise number), I always set target right before launch, and then I launch when the distance is about 300km~400km."},{"CreatedByName":"Mighty1","CreatedById":95750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T07:46:02Z","Content":"I do the same as **FancyMouse**.

If you launch to a 80\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153100km orbit, you will have a much shorter orbit period than the target at 400km. That means it\u0027s not going to take long for a window to appear for the burn from 100km to 400km, and you can use the game\u0027s own tools to find that reliably.\n\nLaunching to rendezvous only really has a benefit if the target is very low (i.e. 70\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153100km). Variations in your ascent will always throw the rendezvous off a little, but a transfer from 100 to 400 has far less scope for error.\n\nEdit: Oh, hang on, I\u0027ve just realised you mean 400km range, not 400km orbit. The above stands, but is less relevant unless you actually are trying to rendezvous with something in a higher orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T07:59:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 07:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murph**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T08:21:47Z","Content":"Very rough rule of thumb - I launch when the target vehicle is a little off the west coast of the landmass on which KSC is on east coast.
