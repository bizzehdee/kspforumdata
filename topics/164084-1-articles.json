The rocketplane stages and completes the climb into orbit, unburdened with air-breathing jet engines.

Instead, simple turboramjets bring the booster plane up to supersonic speeds. Rocket engines take over at high altitude and add about 2km/s until the booster stage runs out of propellants. The second stage is a pure rocketplane that can deliver 6km/s of deltaV. Payload is about 450kg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022e4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://exospace.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/e4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe-entry is made easier with the massive airbrakes the rocketplanes has on the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://exospace.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/a14.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://exospace.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/a14.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion is that we slightly modify the propellant choices and the ascent profile for a massive boost in performance.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDue to the propellant choices, air cannot be cooled and liquefied like in a SABRE engine. There needs to be a reserve of liquid hydrogen to provide the heatsink for this to happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there is a way to liquefy air without using liquid hydrogen. Heat pumps can be used to cool a metal heat sink down to cryogenic temperatures, using evaporation and compression cycles. When air is run through the heat sink, which acts as a heat exchanger, oxygen condenses on it and can be collected. This costs power to run... power which can be derived from the turbo-ramjet\u0027s turbines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, equipping heat pumps large enough to fill the entire booster and rocketplane with liquid oxygen as it flies up through the atmosphere instead of simply using liquid hydrogen as a heat sink is a massive mass and power penalty. This penalty can become minor if we only equip pumps capable enough to fill up only the rocketplane with liquid oxygen. About 5 times less liquid oxygen would be needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy collected liquid oxygen this way, you can launch the upper stage with RP-1 tanks full and liquid oxygen tanks empty. The liquid oxygen tanks would be larger than peroxide tanks by about 22% in volume and be slightly heavier due to insulation. The benefit is a 30 to 50 second jump in Isp and about a 50% drop in rocketplane mass on liftoff. This means smaller booster plane engines and wings, larger payload and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-05T09:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe original concept looks cool, no doubt about it.

The booster plane here is supposed to reach Mach 3 on turbo-ramjet power while collecting LOX for the second-stage rocketplane. The booster plane then switches to rocket mode and adds another 2.5km/s to its velocity, adding up to around 3.5km/s. Orbital velocity is 3km/s.\u00A0Upon separation, the second stage needs to deliver another 4.8 to 5km/s to circularize. With a 320s Isp engine, this requires a mass ratio of 4.9, with an RP-1/LOX alternative, the mass ratio required drops to 4.2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCenter of mass/center of lift is not a big problem. Flight controls can correct imbalances in the lower atmosphere while it is quite neutral. As Mach 1 is passed, the center of lift is dragged backwards due to mach tuck while the center of mass moves forwards as the second stage rocketplane\u0027s LOX tanks are filled.
