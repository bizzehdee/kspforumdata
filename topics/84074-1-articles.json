This is making things extremely difficult to say the least. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m simply suggesting a version of the KS-25 engine which has the \u002B/- 10 degree gimbal of the SSME while sacrificing some thrust and efficiency and having greater weight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked through the already suggested list and was very surprised it wasn\u0027t on there!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T22:15:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find the LV-T45s to be pretty great as a SSME-like engine, though the gimbal does need increasing in the cfg. I think in the past I found about 7 - 12 degrees to be around the sweet spot of gimballing for most purposes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly enough, it would be pretty great to have a high gimbal engine in the game but the main reason it hasn\u0027t been there in the past is that high gimbal engines would rip themselves, or the tanks they\u0027re attached to, off due to the unreliability of pre-0.23.5 part joints. I can\u0027t really comment on the possibility of any in the future, but continuing to test and play around with modified versions of the stock engines can only lead to good places!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T08:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Ted. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI forgot how fragile the earlier joints were especially combined with the old ASAS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T11:23:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be great \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (to have high gimbal engines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027d actually be able to properly re-create space shuttle in KSP without resolving to some obscure \u0026amp; unreliable hacks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T08:17:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre u sure about th joint thing? I have build a sdashuttle using a cluster of 8 v-tol rocket engines from b9. I set em up to do the gimbaling, there is a display for that with precise options to tweak angles and gimbal behaviour.
