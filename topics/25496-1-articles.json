It has been designed to be attached to practically anything by any Kerbal taking an EVA (that is, if he took enough screws). We must note that it fits particulary well around girders. The rack is an open-source standardized system, meaning it\u0027s completely customizable and could be used for just about anything that you can make fit inside. The racks are specially designed to fit into 1.25, 2.5 and 3.75 cargo bays without much space loss and where they could be easility accessed for performing experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction: The rack is basically a perforated steel frame to which the predesigned shielding panels can be attached. While the entire front face can instead be used for example for experiment interfaces or payload access hatches, which are again, screwed to the frame. Smartly enough, the perforations also allow the signature attach-to-anything phylosophy of FLEXracks, as you can use the same screws for attachment to other surfaces or even other FLEXracks. The shielding panels provide holes with intuitive \u0022SCREW HERE\u0022 signs to provide exactly this capability without the need to detach the panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EMIX drawer\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe MIcro eXperiment drawers are designed in such a way that exactly 6 of them can fit inside a single FLEXrack.
