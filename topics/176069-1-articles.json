All kinds of this happen but what ever the reasob im tired of sending kerbels to there \u0022 death\u0022 so i was wondering will someone tell me part by part how to build an interplanetary rocket i dont care wherr it can get to and i dont want the perfect rocket i just need to build a basic concept so i can see how its done plz plz help im on ps4 if that matters\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-21T10:37:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2018 10:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Thecandym0n131\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding what im playing on\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-21T15:43:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn this thread, another guy was asking something very similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI posted a rocket, and the detailed trip to Duna\u00A0and back, with maneuvers and everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsEmbed_finishedLoading\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed500166410\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/174479-ksp-console-version-proof-pls\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022overflow: hidden; height: 223px; max-width: 502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-21T15:43:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2018 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmoredLipid","CreatedById":189824,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-22T05:46:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA large number of interplanetary launch window calculators exist; just search up \u0022KSP planetary launch window calculator\u0022. Your rocket should have a lot of delta-v; consider building a small refueling station in low Kerbin orbit to resupply after leaving the atmosphere. Use LV-N \u0022Nerv\u0022 atomic rocket motors for your second stage; while the ion engine has much better IsP, it has much crappier thrust - 1/30 that of the Nerv - and still manages to have a lower thrust-to-weight ratio, despite the fact that the Nerv weighs literal\u00A0tons. Your lower stage should have anything with a thrust-to-weight ratio\u00A0of over 1 attached to it - the more, the better. Kickback boosters around a Mammoth central core do wonders.
