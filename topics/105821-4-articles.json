If I need to convert from Kelvin to Celsius, I will. I don\u0027t think Kelvin is a useful scale for day-to-day use.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 1) How does one make a camera from a part?\n\nAt least some of that question is answered by the [Wiki page here](https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/wiki/Setting-up-cameras).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 1.1) What kind of module should I add in the config to connect it to RPM?\n\nAdd JSIExternalCameraSelector - for instance, the Module Manager overrides in JSI/RasterPropMonitor/ThirdPartySupport/hullcam-models-as-external-cameras.cfg add those modules to HullCam parts.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) B9 Aerospace had its own PFD screen with several camera views which didn\u0027t require an external part. How does one do that?\n\nAlexustas likewise did it with the ALCOR lander. I believe it\u0027s simply a case of pointing a JSIExternalCameraSelector to a specific transform on the model.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2.1) Is it possible to view your vessel from above using this technique?\n\nI suppose it is, provided a part places the transform up there, or if you use a large enough offset to move the camera up there.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) Is it possible to connect to cameras on other vessels? For example I\u0027d like to see my launch from the launchpad view on the PFD screen. This would require a camera slapped on a launch clamp pointing upwards. But as soon as I release the clamp I lose the connection, is it possible to make the connection persistent until it unloads physically?\n\nNo - that gets to be really messy, and Mihara nixed that when he looked into it. I don\u0027t intend to try to get something like that to work any time soon.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 4) is there any way to move the camera\u0027s viewport using screen arrows?\n\nUsing JSISteerableCamera for the background handler allows the screen arrows to aim the camera.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think the fix for the camera bug (I\u0027m guessing forcing a periodic redraw somehow) has broken the Vessel Viewer page.
