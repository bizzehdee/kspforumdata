So you can save just before encountering an asteroid and reload until you get a magic version. I believe the occurrence rate is about 1 in 20.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-18T21:58:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could find one such asteroid, then compare it in the persistent file to other asteroids to see if there\u0027s something in there that denotes such an asteroid as magical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no way I know of though to determine it beforehand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lewie","CreatedById":203745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-18T22:55:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/195516-grogs/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022195516\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/195516-grogs/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Grogs\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73725-superfluous-j/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002273725\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73725-superfluous-j/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Superfluous J\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0both are good ideas....yet still masochistic!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*cracks knuckles* time to do some good \u2018ol save file hacking....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-19T00:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I remember correctly, the code for making it magic is hiding in a shader, and it\u0027s \u0022random\u0022 based on some attribute of the PotatoRoid part (maybe the uid)?\u00A0 So if I was going to go save file hacking, I would try adding one to that value until it becomes magic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lewie","CreatedById":203745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-19T01:28:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223840399\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196393\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221597798108\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119307\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nightingale\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n38 minutes ago, nightingale said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I remember correctly, the code for making it magic is hiding in a shader, and it\u0027s \u0022random\u0022 based on some attribute of the PotatoRoid part (maybe the uid)?\u00A0 So if I was going to go save file hacking, I would try adding one to that value until it becomes magic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I will probably go with the GrayStillplays approach-add a bunch of zeros until something happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
