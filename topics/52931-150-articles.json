It doesn\u0026#39;t look for real chute modules and doesn\u0026#39;t try to do anything to those.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes, you\u0026#39;ll get the menu option but that doesn\u0026#39;t mean that it\u0026#39;s working or even trying to \u0026#39;work\u0026#39;.

If you stage it, the contract parameter should complete, regardless of whether the chute actually deploys.
