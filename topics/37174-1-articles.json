I first wanted to do all as a pluginless mod for KSP but there was other games where I anted to see this implemented. The whole project was born: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://sourceforge.net/projects/socketstp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESockets TrackPlayer\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESockets is not an usual track player: there is no \u0022next\u0022 or \u0022rewind\u0022 buttons: all is remotely controlled. The idea is to listen though a port via TCP (you see why the title?), waiting for instructions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the musics part, you have a main configuration file giving the tracklists corresponding to a \u0022situation\u0022 or a \u0022mood\u0022, and in the tracklists, you have the music files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there are the remote controlled part. You connect to the IP Address where the player is launched (technically you can connect to a computer in the far side of the world, but who will do this to listen to music ?) with the port 31180 and you can start giving instructions (case doesn\u0027t matter) :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u0026lt;TracklistName\u0026gt;: Change tracklist to the one entered\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- next: Changes track in the list\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- pause: Self-explanatory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- play: pretty straightforward too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- shuffle: toggle shuffle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- cfile: Returns the current playing file\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- clist: Returns the current list\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe non-fully implemented one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- cfg \u0026lt;config\u0026gt;: Changes the configuration file to \u0026lt;config\u0026gt;.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now the only way to link the player is to start it with, as an argument, the config file. This can be done because the installer adds a STP system variable linking to the installation folder. If the var is not here, the player was uninstalled, or worse, never installed ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I\u0027m asking help from guys who can help me building a \u0022bridge\u0022 plugin, it would be great \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thanks to everyone who will help me getting rid of the lots of bugs (mostly unhandled exceptions, and I have discovered some of them already), to see an even better player !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note: I don\u0027t know if my thread belongs in the right place, as it is a completely standalone program, but is still tied to KSP as a plugin will be done for it (or at least I hope). So, feel free to replace it at its rught place \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrGreatJob","CreatedById":43031,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T12:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis seems like a \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E cool and fun idea, but the implementation seems a bit odd to me.
