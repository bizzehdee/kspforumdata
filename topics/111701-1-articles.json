Maybe avcoat was selected because it generates the most man-hours of work?\n\nMaybe Orion has better radiation shielding?\n\nI should add that more importantly, what is the mission for Orion. Not what mission can be invented for it, what mission, with a launch date (EDIT: they claim 2021)? CST-100, and D2 have an actual mission that is wanted/needed, and will fly in 2017. Orion is a spacecraft no one actually wants.
