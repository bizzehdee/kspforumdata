They are two different vehicles built for different purposes. Dragon is \u0022better\u0022 to shuttle crew to the ISS, because that\u0027s what it was designed for. Orion is \u0022better\u0022 for BEO exploration because that\u0027s what it was designed for. It would suck for ISS crew rotations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe requirements that Dragon is lacking for BEO missions are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Radiation shielding\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Hardened electronics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Redundant systems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Life support duration\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mission duration\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Reentry speed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Navigation systems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Communication systems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- EVA capability\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDragon systems are not certified with the same requirements. It is optimized to be economical for short trips to the ISS and back. You might be able to modify each system to meet the requirements for BEO exploration missions, but you would need to go through the entire design and certification process again and you would end up with a very different vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T21:21:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 09:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
