I sent a satellite to scope the terrain, an orbiter to act as the return, and a lander. Since the trip out took 1100m/s, I thought I had plenty of fuel, especially since the lander could dump its excess into the orbiter once it made its way back up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs this is my 1st interplanetary mission, I didn\u0027t realize that 1100m/s would have to be canceled out. Whoops!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that I had enough fuel to properly orbit everything, and was able to land and then rendezvous with the orbiter. Flag planted! The bad news is that even after refueling the orbiter with the remains of the lander\u0027s supply, I don\u0027t have the juice to get back home. I\u0027ll have to send a gas tank over when the next window opens up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while I was able to achieve most of my goals, a flawless interplanetary return was not achieved. Now I know I have to take into account the fuel for those insertion burns, and to plan for those to take just as much fuel as the outbound burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T01:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot necessarily. Going to Duna, you lose some of that velocity as you reach the height of your orbit (near intercept). If you take 1100m/s ejection burn, it\u0027s something like 600-700m/s to circularize. Of course, if you aerobrake between 12-14km altitude at Duna, you can capture into a nice orbit no retrograde burning required, except to circularize. That saves you like 400-500m/s dV right there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T05:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol. The closest periapsis on insertion was 2.5Mm. Aerobrake insertion? Ahahahahahahahahahaha. Yeah, that\u0027s gonna happen. It was struggle enough just to get ANY insertion when leaving Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou must have better skills than I as I had to kill roughly 1100 m/s just to get an orbit. I used nodes at periapsis so this is not a guess. Getting down and circular was not even included in that figure, and frankly was a minuscule fraction of the fuel I burned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll just make sure to account for those insertion burns next time I go interplanetary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T03:39:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, Captain, I\u0027m beginning to see what you\u0027re talking about. I sent a probe to Eve, and again was way out on the initial insertion. I messed about thrusting in different directions and ended up with an aerobraking insertion. Lesson learned!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T08:21:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use aerobraking to semi-circularise the orbit. It might take couple of passes, but it saves a lot of fuel too. Just don\u0027t let periapsis drop too deep. I practised it returning my missions from Minmus - fun, but it takes more time than direct maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T14:26:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find that after you push away from Kerbin, get out of the sphere of influence, you can then mess around with your trajectory and change your approach significantly with very minimal fuel. Essentially you are doing a course correction from as far away as possible. About 1/3 or 1/2 way between where you are coming from and where you are going to, you can make large changes very effeciently. If you play around with it you can start to figure out which way you need to burn to make the correct adjustments. North, East, Prograde, etc. Oftentimes, you can use tiny amouts of RCS even, and still change your approach by a significant margin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T19:24:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ArmchairGravy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ArmchairGravy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELol.

It can save you a lot of fuel. Sure, you come in a lot faster that way, generally, but that just makes for better fireworks, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
