I think if you have not achieve it in career mode and go over to the tutorials, then the maneuver node does not show up. That was my problem anyway.

Sometimes the game just won\u0027t let me place a node for a particular ship, no matter how I hunt about and click on its trajectory. FWIW, quicksaving and reloading generally cures the problem, as it does the frequent freezing up of my staging that seems to have been happening for the last two versions as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sralica","CreatedById":116496,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T17:32:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also have problems placing maneuver nodes, but in career game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a vessel is on a escape trajectory, I can\u0027t place maneuver node between vessel and Periapsis.
