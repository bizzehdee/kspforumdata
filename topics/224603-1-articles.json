My plane has 4 engines like this.

This is a pretty significant difference for deltaV due to efficiencies and I\u0027m trying to figure out how to best reproduce the 1400/1500 ascent profile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy observations have been, given I\u0027m using a Delta-wing lifting body fuselage with canards and V tail fins is... My best bet is to fly up to ~8 km high and point with a barely 5 degree angle of attack if not less. The body/wings will cause me to ascend still and somehow I\u0027ll hit and maintain 1400/1500 m/s until 27 km high when I swap to rocket mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I rise to 20 km then do level flight, I\u0027ll never go higher than 1200 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this some sort of a feedback loop going on? That you need to break the velocity barrier when there\u0027s more air to maintain it higher?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy ascent profile works either way, and I can return/launch reliably.
