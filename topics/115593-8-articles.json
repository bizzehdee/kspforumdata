I\u0027m not sure if all the other mods amusing have updated to 1.0 .5, so I\u0027m tentative to try and update.[/QUOTE]  \n\nI assume you want the white tank instead of the orange tank. If this is the case, look inside the folder titled \u0022ShadowWorks\\_Stockalike\\_SLS\\_1\\_3\\_1\u0022 (the file you downloaded from KerbalStuff) and you should find a folder named \u0022AlternateSLSWhiteTextures\u0022. Inside that folder are four (4) more folders, each named the same as the part folder in the \u0022ShadowWorks/Parts\u0022 folder, and they are \u0022EUS\u0022, \u0022ICPS\u0022, \u0022SLSCoreStage\u0022, and \u0022SRBs\u0022. To get the white textures back simply replace the textures in the \u0022ShadowWorks/Parts\u0022 folder with the ones in the \u0022AlternateSLSWhiteTexutres\u0022 folder. For example, replace \u0022ShadowWorks/Parts/EUS/EUSBump\\_NRM.dds\u0022 and \u0022ShadowWorks/Parts/EUS/EUSColor.dds\u0022 with \u0022AlternateSLSWhiteTexutres/EUS/EUSBump\\_NRM.dds\u0022 and \u0022AlternateSLSWhiteTextures/EUS/EUSColor.dds\u0022 and so on for the ICPS, SLSCoreStage, and SRBs.  \n\n[quote name=\u0027RoketMan\u0027]Although I was wondering if you could edit the thrust curve esaly (as a user). Your help would be appreciated.[/QUOTE]  \n\nTo edit the engines, you only need to open their \u0022.cfg\u0022 files in a text editing program. Getting the thrust curve of the engines to be what you want them to be can be a little tricky. The amount of thrust the engine provides, in KSP, depends on the \u0022maxThrust\u0022 defined in the config file, the \u0022minThrust\u0022 (it is 0 (zero) unless one is provided), and the \u0022atmosphereCurve\u0022. The atmosphereCurve typically has 2 \u0022key\u0022 values, which represent the specific impulse (Isp) at sea level and in vacuum.  \n\natmosphereCurve  \n\n{  \n\nkey = 0 390 //This is the Isp in a vacuum  \n\nkey = 1 180 //This is the Isp at sea level  \n\n}  \n\nThe thinner the atmosphere gets the more thrust you get until you reach near vacuum at which point the engine thrust is the \u0022maxThrust\u0022. The atmosphereCurve helps determine how efficient an engine is based on how much propellant is consumed and how much thrust is exerted in that process. So if you want to change the engine\u0027s performance you will likely be editing 2-3 values in the config file, \u0022maxThrust\u0022 and the two \u0022key\u0022 values in the \u0022atmosphereCurve\u0022.  \n\nChanging the \u0022maxThrust\u0022 alone will have more consequences than simply being able to lift the rocket faster. If you change only the \u0022maxThrust\u0022 and nothing else, the propellant will be consumed sooner. This is due to the relationship of thrust to Isp and propellant consumption, which is given by the following equation:  \n\nT = g[sub]o[/sub]I[sub]sp[/sub]m\\_dot  \n\nWhere \u0022T\u0022 is thrust, \u0022g[sub]o[/sub]\u0022 is acceleration due to gravity at Earth\u0027s surface, \u0022I[sub]sp[/sub]\u0022 is the engine\u0027s specific impulse, and \u0022m\\_dot\u0022 is the propellant consumption rate (the mass of propellant consumed per second). We can rearrange the equation to see what affect changes in \u0022T\u0022 and/or \u0022I[sub]sp[/sub]\u0022 will have on \u0022m\\_dot\u0022  \n\nm\\_dot = T/(g[sub]o[/sub]I[sub]sp[/sub])  \n\nIf we doubled the thrust of an engine, the equation would look like this:  \n\nm\\_dot\u0027 = 2T/(g[sub]o[/sub]I[sub]sp[/sub])  \n\nWhich is gives us: m\\_dot\u0027 = 2\\*m\\_dot. This means that by doubling the thrust, we have doubled the propellant consumption. Similarly, if you double the I[sub]sp[/sub], you would cut the propellant consumption in half. So, if you wanted propellant consumption to remain the same, you would have to change the \u0022maxThrust\u0022 and the I[sub]sp[/sub] values by the same factor. To an extent it is kind of trial-and-error, looking for what gives you the performance you want. You could start by choosing the \u0022maxThrust\u0022, setup the launcher they way you want, and test fly them. You can them start playing with the \u0022atmosphereCurve\u0022 to improve or decrease the efficiency of the engines. I apologize for the long-winded explanation, but I thought it might help if you want to alter the engines, to know what would happen and why when you start changing things in the config files. I hope this helps."},{"CreatedByName":"RoketMan","CreatedById":148731,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T12:48:30Z","Content":"Yes, that dose help.
