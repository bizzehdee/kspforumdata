I\u0027d scaled a copy of that tank down by half (down to 0.625m) and replaced its fuel with xenon for ion engines; it was about the size of three stock xenon tanks, which made fuel transfers a bit easier. It also made it easier to build ion probes, since placing items on the seams between xenon tanks was causing all sorts of problems. So now I\u0027ve got one texture for structural xenon tanks, and a different one for structure liquid fuel. Very handy, although using custom parts does make it difficult for others to use your craft files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the original topic, the new flaps are really nice, although removing the old types does make it tough on those of us who like transferring our craft files from one version to the next.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T16:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...As to the original topic, the new flaps are really nice, although removing the old types does make it tough on those of us who like transferring our craft files from one version to the next.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl surfaces are automatically replaced when you open the .craft file.

A lot of translation problems in 0.25 are similar; the craft file stores the position of every part, but when the part changes it does strange things to your designs. (Changing the basic SAS wheel to a 0.625m part created gaps in a lot of my designs.) The shapes of the control surfaces are mainly aesthetic, but it\u0027s still an annoyance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psyper","CreatedById":90641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T14:05:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thanny\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thanny\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI play on a big screen (2560x1600), where all parts in each section were always visible, so I was caught off guard when the increased number of parts pushed some to different pages.
