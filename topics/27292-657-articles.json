As the descent stage would break apart the moment it\u0027s staged off, and the ascent stage only barely has a Mun TWR above 1, he took off with the descent stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/Z40dcL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Z40dcL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/qQ3C70.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qQ3C70.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECircularisation and escape didn\u0027t use up all of the ascent stage\u0027s fuel, either.
