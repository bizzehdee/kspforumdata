It truly excited a small handful of people who consumed science fiction stories, and they were able to convince a few government people to support their efforts \u0022for science\u0022, but on the grand scale of things? People had no idea what to even do with the concept of spaceflight. Put something into a long-term orbit of the Earth? Why would you do that? What use could it possibly have? Dumbest idea ever. It only costs money and then just sits there. You can get the same research value out of short flights. Maybe put something in orbit once just to confirm the theory, but that\u0027ll be it.

That the enemy had figured out that having satellites is worthwhile. And they realized how incredibly far ahead such capability would put them.
