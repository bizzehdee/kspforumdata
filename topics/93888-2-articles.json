You deliberately put yourself into an almost sun-grazing orbit. At perihelion, your solar panels work ridiculously well, and you can generate enough power with one to power several ion engines.

It\u0027s very easy to edit some part files and make some bigger ones, with 85%\u002B fuel by weight. I\u0027ve done them before, but they had the skins of the regular fuel tanks. Anyway, with big, efficient xenon tanks, a mulit-staged crewed electric-ion ship with 100 km/s dV is probably reasonable, but it will be very massive, a few thousand tons.

The Rockomax X200-8 Fuel Tank, which has similar dimensions to a scaled up PB-X150, weighs 0.5 tons empty. These are xenon tanks intended to go on a spacecraft, not sit around in some lab somewhere, so they are designed to minimize mass. I can\u0027t see how it\u0027s possible to make a case that 3.2 tons empty is a realistic number for a spaceflight application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, a 4X scaled up PB-X150 xenon tank would measure about 1.25 meters radius by, let\u0027s just say 1.25 meters tall (I can\u0027t remember the actual length, but I did know it at one time). The volume would therefore be 6.14 cubic meters. Liquid xenon has a density of 3100 kg/m^3. If the tank\u0027s volume was 100% utilized as storage for liquid xenon, it would therefore hold about 19000 kg of xenon- or 190 thousand units of xenon fuel. However, a scaled up version of the tank only holds 44800 units of fuel. Therefore, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ethe stock xenon tank only utilizes 44.8/190*100% = 24% of its volume to store liquid xenon fuel\u003C/span\u003E. Again, is that realistic?! HELL NO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the stock xenon tanks are doubly unrealistic- they weigh far too much, and they only utilize about a fourth of their volume to store fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what I did for my scaled up xenon tanks is design a better, more realistic tank. Let\u0027s be conservative and say that the dry mass is 1500 kg - the tank must be heavier because the fuel is more massive, and maybe the tank needs some extra thermal shielding. I donno. But, while less than half the mass of the scaled-up stock version, 1.5 tons is still three times the mass of the regular liquid fuel tank of the same size! Also, let\u0027s say that it utilizes 70% of its volume for storing liquid xenon. This sounds pretty reasonable to me. 70% of 190 thousand is 133000, which is 13.3 tons. So a realistic, scaled-up 2.5 meter xenon tank using the PB-X150\u0027s shape holds 133,000 units of xenon fuel, weighs 14.8 tons full, and 1.5 tons empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANYWAY, all that said, you don\u0027t have to use ion propulsion to go a measly 2.5 billion km in a reasonable time span.

When I made my xenon tanks mod, I used the real density of liquid xenon and the physical size of the tank to determine the amount of fuel the tank contains. I make the mass of the tank only like 10% of the mass of the xenon because xenon is an extremely heavy gas- liquid xenon is like 3 times denser than water.

You were talking about changing the ratio of dry and wet tank mass. In the constraints of the game, that\u0027s cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot every mod is cheating. For example procedural parts\u0027 tanks have the same stock dry:wet ratio and they\u0027re basically used to change the look of your craft. It does not alter the gaming itself. I don\u0027t know any of my mods to change crucial game values. They\u0027re mostly plugins that add stuff like Planetshine, Distant Object.
