If you\u0027re tracking the manoeuvre node, it will flip when you get near the end of the burn: as you get closer to zero, any tiny error you have will get amplified, the manoeuvre node will scoot across the navball, and your autopilot will try to follow it, sending your craft out of control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolutions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(1) Don\u0027t use manoeuvre mode. Instead use regular autopilot and track the node manually. When you\u0027re close to the end of the burn, cut throttle, and then do a few repeated burns at minimum power to get it as close to target as you need. Note that 0.0 m/s is usually overkill!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(2) Continue to use manoeuvre mode, but cut throttle just before you hit 0 and the node starts jumping around. (Yeah I know, this is like the pizza baking instruction that says to take it out of the oven two minutes before it starts to burn, but it\u0027s also equally correct.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-09T13:30:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetter to use retrograde, I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-09T18:09:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/184031-dankmemes/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022184031\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/184031-dankmemes/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@DankMemes\u003C/a\u003E:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s not a glitch.\u00A0\u00A0You\u0027re just reaching the endpoint of the burn.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are always little sideways errors (sometimes as small as mm/s) involved in any burn.\u00A0 It\u0027s an unavoidable consequence of the fact that no system can ever aim exactly perfectly; this is why correction burns are a thing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, when the remaining burn is measured in m/s and the errors are measured in mm/s, the errors don\u0027t even register.\u00A0 When the remaining burn gets below\u00A01 m/s, the errors become more pronounced.\u00A0 When the remaining burn is zero, the errors are the only thing that register--but the marker on the navball can\u0027t tell the difference between the\u00A0100 m/s burn\u00A0you planned and what it thinks is a\u00A0.001 m/s burn that you can\u0027t actually do; it only shows direction.\u00A0 To keep your rocket from spinning round forever trying to correct what it doesn\u0027t need to correct (and usually can\u0027t correct anyway), the system automatically switches you to stability assist when your remaining burn gets low enough.\u00A0 It does the same thing when going retrograde to the surface (if it didn\u0027t, then your rocket would try to dive into the ground nose-first on landing) and when moving retrograde relative to target (this is useful when docking).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen you get your remaining burn (that\u0027s the gauge to the right of the navball) down to 0.1 m/s, that\u0027s usually good enough.\u00A0 If you can make it 0.0, that\u0027s great, but you don\u0027t usually need to be so accurate.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DankMemes","CreatedById":184031,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-12T02:40:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is very confusing, I wish KSP\u0027s tutorials could be a little easier to understand\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-12T15:34:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223266033\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169396\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221515724816\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022184031\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DankMemes\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, DankMemes said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is very confusing, I wish KSP\u0027s tutorials could be a little easier to understand\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite true.\u00A0 But you came to the right place, so let\u0027s take another try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, orbital mechanics and manoeuvring\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0confusing; everything you thought you knew about motion goes right out when you put it in orbit.\u00A0 When I was learning this, I found it hideously frustrating, but the trick sometimes is to step back and watch someone else do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSet some appropriately-themed music....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hxibHJOE5E?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...
