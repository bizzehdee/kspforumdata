This 8x8 rover can climb pretty much any incline on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-picsnip-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if the condition is one launch, this is a robotic mission so it will be pretty easy to fit a small unmanned rover on the actual ascending rocket. Once it lands on the hill the rover get dropped off, drive to the ocean, get a sample, drive back to the rocket and the rocket takes the sample offworld.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo long as you get a sample of eve ocean back to Kerbin, the rover method is fine.

Wasn\u0027t sure if it had enough delta-V to do the ascent from sea level or have enough left over to return to Kerbin, but I sent it off to Eve for a test anyway. When I got there I found having aerospikes and 2 full SRB\u0027s meant lots of tumbling during re-entry, standard parachutes broke off at deployment (with no hope of having the engines pointing the right way). I went in and hacked the quicksave to replace them with drogues to see if that made a difference, it did mean a lot less tumbling, but then I realized that 3 aerospikes gave a TWR less than 1 at the surface of Eve (my landing mass was about 38 tons), so there was no hope of landing safely on water (or whatever liquid Eve\u0027s oceans are made of). I think I\u0027ll go back to the drawing board, this time replacing the solids with something I can use to help with landing. I might replace aerospikes with T30\u0027s to avoid the drag tumbling, I\u0027ll have to play around some more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T13:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey say Eve ocean is made of liquid fuel.
