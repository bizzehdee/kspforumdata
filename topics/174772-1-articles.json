When light from a receding object reaches us, it does not arrive \u0022slower\u0022 (see: relativity), light always arrives at c, but its frequency can shift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe energy of EM radiation (light) is dependent on its frequency.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen light from a receding object arrives, it arrives at c, but its energy will be lessened by a proportional amount to the difference in velocity between origin and destination. Thus, its frequency is lowered, moving it towards the red end of the spectrum (even if its nowhere near the visible portion of the spectrum, red-shift denotes a lowering of frequency, blue shift an increase). Yes, this does actually make some blue objects appear red.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is very common for very distant objects to have their light red-shifted into non-visible parts of the spectrum (hence radio-telescopes are used to observe distant parts of the universe. Radio is the very-low energy part of the EM spectrum), this is one of the reasons why the night sky isnt a blaze of starlight from all directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLight from beyond the edge of the observable universe, where objects are receding from us faster than c, never reaches us. This seems to go against the idea that \u0022light always arrives at c\u0022 but it might help to think of this light as being infinitely redshifted to invisibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConversely, object approaching us quickly have their light blue-shifted. This is how we can tell that distant galaxies are rotating, because one side will be blue shifted and the other red shifted (or both red-shifted but to different degrees).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow can we tell if incoming light is blue or red shifted? Isnt it just light?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, however light from hot things (stars and such) have close-to \u0022black-body\u0022 spectra, in that the frequency of light emitted is very predictable and tells you what the material is that is glowing. Different elements show different patterns, appearing as spectral \u0022lines\u0022 (a specific set of frequencies).\u00A0When the pattern\u00A0is red or blue shifted, the pattern can be seen to be in the \u0022wrong\u0022 part of the spectrum, thus we can tell how blue or red shifted it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Spectral-Lines-shifted-spectra.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022641\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/Images/Spectral-Lines-shifted-spectra.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-09T14:50:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2018 02:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by p1t1o\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-09T15:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo the gravitational waves from the galaxies far, far away, suffer from the red shift, too?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo they attract us weaker?\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Not just for r\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, but due to the energy loss.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes the universal gravity law require a red shift factor?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-09T15:58:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2018 03:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-09T16:22:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, gravity waves are redshifted.

Before the big bang, the whole universe was in a hot, dense state, and then inflation started. After inflation, the universe was not nearly quite so hot or dense...but was still about as hot and dense as the core of the sun, which is pretty hot and pretty dense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe universe continued to expand in the post-inflationary epoch, for about three hundred centuries.

But the galaxy with the black hole merger was 1 billion lightyears away. That\u0027s far, but it\u0027s not very far in cosmological terms; only about 2% of the way to the edge of the observable universe. And expansion is metric. So the actual duration of this part of the fluctuation was probably just 0.14999999999995 seconds or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCome to think of it, that\u0027s a theoretical (if experimentally impossible) verification of Hubble\u0027s Law. Since the masses of the black holes can be known independently, their merger could be modeled, and the duration of the merger peak\u00A0could be predicted. Deviations in the duration of the merger peak\u00A0would be a direct measure of\u00A0redshift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-09T21:05:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been expanding as I get older.
