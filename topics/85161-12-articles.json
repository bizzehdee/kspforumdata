It means that static objects - what you\u0027d normally consider terrain features - can now properly interact with the player\u0027s actions. And they are no longer static, in the sense that it is now possible to modify them ingame. This also means that we get a UI specifically dealing with restoring damaged buildings in the KSC. Put it all together, and add the devs\u0027 earlier statements about the huge amounts of content being worked on for the upcoming .26 feature, and how big the feature is, and you get something along the lines of \u0022we will be able to build new buildings, maybe just at the KSC, maybe anywhere we want, and we\u0027ll be able to blow them up and otherwise interact with them\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure where people are getting damageable parts from though.
