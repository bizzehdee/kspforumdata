Unless there is a fire, most turbines take less than two minutes to spin down, and once the plane is on the ground, there is a fuel cutoff control for each engine in case of fire or the need for rapid egress. Outside of that, there should be no forced air ahead of or behind the engines by the time the aircraft has come to a stop. Plus the slides would only be detached immediately in the event of a water landing, in which case that is all moot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is quite innovative... and... weird. I just would like to note that I will never fly Delta again; I was on three different aircraft and all three times the seats were just too small.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
