(I was a little disappointed when Scott seemed to be flying to get to Eve\u0027s orbit, and I already have one of those doing its job rather nicely. When he went on to get inside Eve\u0027s orbit to start mapping Eve, I saw the wisdom of your words.) A circular orbit at Jool\u0027s distance from Kerbol is sometimes outside of Eeloo\u0027s orbit. Thankfully, I\u0027ve got a fair amount of fuel and a nuclear engine on the thing, so I\u0027ll try bringing it completely within Eeloo\u0027s orbit and seeing what happens when I have time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nikolai","CreatedById":23085,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T22:17:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: That did the trick!
