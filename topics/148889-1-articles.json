There was a big game update since I quit last and so I started over.. Finally get up to where I was before and.. even with my newer computer... performance is still crap and unplayable.

However, every part in KSP contains a large amount of data about its motion, mass, connections to other parts, etc. and most of the calculations performed on these end up requiring data from every other part in the ship and must be performed in a specific order.

I haven\u0027t played with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E in quite some time because of the bugs I encountered (it was a while ago and I\u0027m not familiar with recent performance), but it is possible that is exacerbating your issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink of KSP as a\u00A0car.

Now, the shape of that car top carrier depends on who made it. Some people\u00A0make it more aerodynamic than others. In the same way some mods are more efficient than others. Regardless of the aerodynamics involved, I\u0027d be foolish to think that adding this accessory on top of my vehicle, which adds additional weight and drag, won\u0027t negatively impact my average gas milage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach mod you add (that is more than just a parts mod) is like adding another accessory to the outside of your car. If you expect performance to be just as good as stock, well, I would say your expectations are unrealistic. And some mods have more of a performance hit than others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne other thing after rereading your posts. You mention connecting the vessels with hoses.

KSP is capable of multithreading now. It handles separate vessels in separate threads when it can. However, once you dock two or more vessels together, they become one vessel which is now being handled by one thread. So with mods installed you may be reaching the single vessel part limit that your machine can handle once you connect everything together. If you undock, or in this case unhose, you may experience a small pause while the game splits vessels unto separate threads, but your frame rate should improve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you really need to check the log for errors. Either error spam or just a mod having an error period could be a potential performance hit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr just wait for 1.2 to be released and then wait for your mods to be updated and hope that is enough improvement for you.\u00A0And remember, there may be no hard coded limits to number of\u00A0parts in the game, but there are very real practical limits. I haven\u0027t seen any physics based games with user created objects handle large\u00A0creations without either performance issues or slowing the simulation to allow accuracy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KOCOUR","CreatedById":37749,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-01T10:19:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni have similar problem.
