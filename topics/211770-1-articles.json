If you have large parts counts, which this game seems like it will have more of, you need the ability to empty and fill all tanks at once to see the different positions of the center of mass etc at it moves. Especially if you try to do something more complicated. Or some equivilent. Like showing the range of positions of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E etc. But I would prefer all of the above. You can\u0027t have enough means to design the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-31T10:54:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a good idea.
