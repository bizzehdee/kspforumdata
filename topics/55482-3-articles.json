During launch 2 and 3 are common. Generally, 3 is a Soviet solution and 2 is an American one, though the Soviets invented 2 - at least as far as I can gather from the history. (There\u0027s a 4 - very kerbal - spin the craft on yaw or pitch axis using reaction wheels, let the centrifugal effect settle the tanks before the burn.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Mechjeb doesn\u0027t like 3 much as far as I can tell, but once you have SRBs you can use proper staging and 0 stage delay to make 2 work just fine during launches. What would need to change is the flying of manoeuvre nodes in space and the reentry/landing burn. Once the craft is in space it needs to do that ullaging process. I would think that a short RCS burn wouldn\u0027t hurt a non-ullage modded game, it\u0027d just look strange. Those of us with the mod would certainly appreciate it, however. I tried looking at the Mechjeb source and seeing if it would be possible to add such a burn easily with my lack of programming knowledge, but I didn\u0027t know what was going on inside there at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStartup and shutdown would be nice as well, though I can see why determining what engine to turn on-and-off would be much harder than just turning on RCS and using it for a few moments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T11:54:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToolbar isn\u0027t working for me, the button doesn\u0027t work.

Something like \u0022Trim with RCS? Y/N\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen set no, it behaves as normal when burning a manoeuvre. When set yes, it precedes and follows each burn with a couple seconds of forward RCS and doesn\u0027t use the throttle, instead just ramping straight to 100% and straight back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real spaceflight, they need to start with the RCS to ullage, and follow with it to get the deltaV of the burn exactly right. This would replace the normal functionality where it slowly throttles down the engine then \u0027trims\u0027 the burn with the main engine. This would support realistic thrusts /and/ ullage simulations. (It would also be potentially useful to regular players who want to conserve main-engine fuel.) This might be better functionality in general, when there\u0027s an overburn, instead of turning the ship around and burning backwards for a moment, it just trims it with forward and reverse RCS after a burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESarbian, how asinine would something like that be to implement?
