The bigger higher the orbit the less\u00A0an INC change costs. I can get into a polar orbit with no issues but to get back to a reasonable inclination to return to Kerbin is expensive. My guess is that I have to be at at least 58 degrees to get to all the sites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-01T02:13:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the contract requirement is \u0027in orbit above 94,500 meters\u0027, then you are correct, anywhere in Eve\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E (above that altitude, of course) should fulfil it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jbdenney","CreatedById":201835,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-01T02:26:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
