If you have camera mode on orbital mode... before going on eva, adjust your ship so that it is nose-up and appears to be aligned to 90 degrees regardless of which way you pan the camera (if you\u0027re equatorial it will be pointing toward your normal vector (or anti-normal if your orbiting the other direction).

I really hope they do) and then you align one to point at the normal vector, and the other to point at the anti-normal vector... then you know they are perfectly aligned.
