The stockalike execution of this pack is \u003Cem\u003Eperfect\u003C/em\u003E. If my RAM budget wasnt so tight this would make it into my permanent mod list (currently it sits in my primary rotation).

I\u0027d almost bet that it\u0027s KIS or TACLS more than anything else. I also run a \u0022technically outdated\u0022 mod called Science Containers that adds experiment storage abilities to all command modules yet that is far more simplistic in implementation than KIS or TACLS and less likely to be the culprit.

It allows me to test out new stuff with fully modded games to see how well things work together but it does make tracking down issues a bit tough if I don\u0027t have a lot of time to futz around with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T18:45:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI pulled USILS and it still happened.
