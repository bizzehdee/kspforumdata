I mean, the original R7 was developed back in 1956-57 and basically used ever since. By the time I unlock the tier with the R7 stuff, I\u0027ve already unlocked the Soyuz capsule (which is on the same tier) which was developed a decade AFTER the rocket that carried it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tiers are difficult. I understand they need to be balanced that really good rockets don\u0027t end up getting unlocked really early (such as the R7s). I personally develop two mirror space programs simultaneously in my games, one based on the US program using the stock capsules and one based on the Soviet program. After I move stuff around the tech tree, my Soviet program has a major advantage over the American program until the Apollo-esque program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I may recommend is using Dang It! which allows for a certain degree of reliability, which is what\u0027s missing in this game. It allows a balance between building large rockets using primitive parts and reliability. The rocket will probably lift a small Death Star with circa 1958 parts, but it also will probably explode thirty seconds after liftoff. Dang It! is actually pretty nasty with this mod because of how it handles engine clusters (single engines rather than multiple) so an entire cluster will fail rather than a single engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-02T19:08:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2017 07:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by captainradish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-02T19:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d not worry about career too much. career in KSP is just awful (and I play career).

Particularly the second \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E - the SSTU - SC-ENG - \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E-A - it has a max thrust of 1250, which exceeds everything up to (in the CTT) Heavier Rocketry that is four nodes later at the 160 science level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand about the tank, I didn\u0027t realize you had an intentional mode that removes the stock parts, so yes if that\u0027s your smallest tank then it needs to be there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what I would do were it mine to do, which it isn\u0027t, and again admittedly this is not exactly an issue where lives hang in the balance, so just a suggestion:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Like how the Procedural Parts parts limit their diameter/length on their tanks/SRBs, limit the length of the Magic Fuel tank to no more than 1m longer than whatever is the longest stock tank available at that tech level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Leave the SSTU - SC-ENG - \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E-U at the Basic Rocketry intro node but as above,\u00A0limit its sizes so it\u0027s only a bit more powerful than whatever stock has at that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Move the SSTU - SC-ENG - \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E-A to at least General Rocketry one node later (player already has one very competent SSTU \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E), but preferably to Advanced Rocketry, but limit its sizing to a max thrust of ~750kN. I have most part packs including Contares this time around, and the biggest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E I see at that node is the Globe X at 614kN, so the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E-A at that point would supply a reasonable somewhat larger option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) As for the Probe Core and its upgrade to 1.875 being in the same node, that looks odd, exactly like you couldn\u0027t figure a better plan so just went \u0022fark it\u0022 and dumped it there \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0The simplest solution out of that oddity is to move the 1.875m upgrade to Miniaturization one node later. But I think a more interesting and arguably more logical progression is to make the default part 1.875m and available in the Basic Science node. For miniaturization, you get an upgrade to 1.25m, and in Precision Engineering you get .625m. Remember new designs generally start fairly big, and with lots of experimentation and engineering we make parts that are just as good, only smaller and lighter and therefore cheaper. So starting with a mid-size and having to do engineering to get smaller, lighter versions makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I had one request, it would be for something that\u0027s a little different from most of your parts, but I\u0027m asking because SSTU parts work better and are better-engineered than any other parts I\u0027ve seen. I think I\u0027ve tried every winch \u002B dart, magnet grabber, and the grabber units and claws, and so far I give every one of them maybe 1/5 stars, especially the grabbers, which I have managed to trigger once in eleventy thousand attempts; almost all of the parts they tell me to go get are so light you\u0027d need to be moving fast enough to destroy the part to generate enough impact force to trigger the grabbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real head-scratcher for me is why none that I\u0027ve seen have a manual trigger. Anyway, I\u0027m sure you could make something better, what made me think of it was the fairly long procedural nose-cone with a smooth ogive. What I was thinking was a very large (compared to others) grabber that opens like an umbrella and then when activated to grab a part, tries to close down to its original long ogive. It could have an auto trigger, but I was thinking more along Konstruction lines where you have a UI for control.That big umbrella isn\u0027t meant as the final hold, that is just literally to grab and control the part so you can get it oriented correctly for its final hold. Final hold\u00A0 would be either magnet, or if you want to get creative, could also use linked \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E pipe nodes, but that requires EVA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike\u0060","CreatedById":180637,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-03T10:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223185475\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022117090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221506997390\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179033\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vossiewulf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Like how the Procedural Parts parts limit their diameter/length on their tanks/SRBs, limit the length of the Magic Fuel tank to no more than 1m longer than whatever is the longest stock tank available at that tech level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, what\u0027s the point though?
