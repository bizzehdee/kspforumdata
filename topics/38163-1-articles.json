Game seems to like that better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to know if that\u0027s a wholly necessary thing to do. I too have encountered problems with the 90-degree lip; first time I tried to do a Mun rescue mission, I had Seeley piloting to go rescue Jeb, Bob and Bill and was going to get him out for a group photo before sending everybody home. He fell off the damn ladder; ultimately had to jetpack him back up to the CM. Thank goodness that was a place with low gravity...had that been someplace like Tylo or Eve, he would\u0027ve been killed...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheebsta","CreatedById":74167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T14:28:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been toying with a part model that has double levels and two ladders. I am able to climb up and down no problem at this point, on Kerbin anyways, but not at first... At first it was just like stock ladders, fall off all the time, possibly roll off the second level, and splat on the ground. I kept playing with it till it worked, and the trick was to angle the top of the ladders in a little, or kick the bottom out, whichever way you want to look at it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been wanting to try it with vanilla ladders, but have yet to get around to it.
