Another fighter revealed by Goporium Industries, the Leap Frog, our very first VTOL style interceptor. It features detachable VTOL rockets and like all of my designs is completely salvagable even in the event of a botched landing thanks to the built in parachutes. To lift off, start the throttle at just under half and then ignite the main horizontal engine to keep it level and once you reach your desired height jetison the VTOL engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/lAsnpuQIt9k\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/lAsnpuQIt9k\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-30T19:54:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENce-looking plane, but acronym-wise, that\\\u0027s JATO rather than VTOL. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gopa4","CreatedById":30373,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-30T22:43:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood play good sir, you are in fact right. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gopa4","CreatedById":30373,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T22:31:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry about the double post, however Goporium Industries proudly unveils its latest design: the Load Barron, a light bomber capable of providing danger close ground support and able to deliver a fair amount of ordinance before having to return to base.
