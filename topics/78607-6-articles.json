You just run it, then check if the parameter it returned is null, if it is then something failed a check (the experiment part hasn\u0027t been researched, the science has already been collected, etc...), and if it isn\u0027t null then you can add it to the contract\u0027s list of parameters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been adding \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/DMagic1/Science-Contracts/blob/master/ContractScienceUtils.cs#L79\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eseveral overloads\u003C/a\u003E to the parameter generator. You can generate a fully random experiment, or you can specify a planet, an experimental situation, a biome, or an experiment.

Instead of that generic contract you could generate one or two experiments for a specific biome or location (on the surface for example) then generate way points for those locations. I\u0027m not actually sure how to go about generating way points for a given biome on a planet, but\u0027s that\u0027s something that can be figured out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problems I described before about tracking where exactly your experiment was collected still apply, but I don\u0027t think that really matters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would theoretically be possible to ask for experiments from one biome with way points at one location with that biome. You could then collect science data from one area with that biome, then go to the way point in another area with that biome; the contract would still complete, but who cares. There is little functional difference between collecting the science where you are supposed to and going to the trouble of visiting two locations just to trick the system (except that the later is a whole lot more trouble), so I think it would work well enough. I suppose the only real reason for doing this might be to use different vessels to complete each segment of the contract, but that still seems like it would generally be more trouble than doing it as intended.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T10:43:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Arsonide, awesome mod, adds a great variety to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI encountered a small bug yesterday, I accepted 3 asteroid redirect contracts (to bring them into orbit around Kerbin, Mun and Minmus each).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a C-class on collision course with Kerbin, so I thought I HAD to rescue those poor kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I grabbed it with a claw, but as it was too close already and I didnt had the power to tow it away from collision -\u0026gt; in the end it crashed into Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I switched vessels to my station around Mun -\u0026gt; asteroid contract to bring it in Mun\u0027s orbit completed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould reproduce it also with Kerbin\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is that the mod does not detect if you switch vessels, but retains the \u0022grabbed\u0022 status of the asteroid \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo big deal, but maybe you can look into it.

Reverting to the VAB will not affect this. If the station doesn\u0027t have all the parts and you add some to complete the criteria, it will still succeed, but again, only if the initial station was launched after the contract was accepted.

I think it would be a much better idea for the RT2 devs to hook into the contract API stuff that Extra Contracts (Fine Print?) exposes (or perhaps should expose if not already) so that THEY can make RT2-specific contracts. That way the contracts will be kept up to date with new releases of RT2 and can take advantage of all of the RT2 code. For example, if the contract was to put up a comsat constellation around Duna (3 sats, altitude range x, min separation y) that can communicate with kerbin, RT2\u0027s going to be handling the code for whether your antennae have the right range and finding a path through the connection graph to verify that all three are reachable from KSC. If Arsonide were to try to code all of that, his mod would become heavily dependant on the inner workings of RT2, which I do not believe to be desirable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking forward to a lot of mod-specific contracts in the coming weeks, but I think it\u0027s up to those mods\u0027 dev\u0027s to implement them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T00:40:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright I just learned how to support those things without creating a hard dependency, I\u0027ll work that into the release.
