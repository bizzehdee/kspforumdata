This time, it was around Pol.\n\nBefore accepting I had a look at the tracking station. Nothing.\n\nTook the contract, went to Pol, and of course there was noone around.\n\nNot a real surprise, every time I go to Pol, strange things happen.\n\nPlease remove Pol from the game before the final release."},{"CreatedByName":"Jansn","CreatedById":131392,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T11:02:06Z","Content":"Had and accepted 2 of them.
