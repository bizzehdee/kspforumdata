There are only four for right now, but there will be more. Hopefully much more. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThis pack includes the F-86 Sabre, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the F-18 Hornet, and the almighty F-22 Raptor. Each one has semi realistic aesthetics (as in I tried to make them look like the real thing) But are not 100% accurate, so don\u0027t expect that. They are close though, I will say that. They also have stunning performance. Each jet is capable of pulling 5-6G constant turns, with spikes up to 16-17G when coming from high speed and jerking on the controls. The F-22 is capable of turns tighter than the diameter of the VAB. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nF-86 Sabre\n\nThis is one of the first Jet designs used by the US Air Force, it was a response to the Mig-15, and was frequently pinned against it in battle. Like the Mig-15, it has an intake on the front of the Fuselage, and its engine at the rear of the fuselage, almost like a flying cigar. It has small swept wings near the front of the fuselage, and horizontal stabilizers at the root of the Vertical Stabilizer. On the wings are 2 small drop tanks. Great jet. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![wPwv1eU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wPwv1eU.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![n8vN66M.png](http://i.imgur.com/n8vN66M.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![gWmNd90.png](http://i.imgur.com/gWmNd90.png)\n\nF-16 Fighting Falcon\n\nThis is a beast of an aircraft. Boasting a large \u0022scoop\u0022 under its cockpit, like a mouth sucking in air for its engines, it roars across the sky. Capable of some fun stuff and high speeds. It has \u0022Wingtip Hardpoints,\u0022 and is a wonderful jet. The USAF Thunderbirds Aerobatics team fly this plane.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![7aH6D4I.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7aH6D4I.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Vv4aTeH.png](http://i.imgur.com/Vv4aTeH.png)\n\nF-18 Hornet\n\nThe F-18 is a dual engine jet frequently used by the navy. It has small wings very far back, with wing strakes lining the front of the fuselage. The Navy Blue Angels Aerobatic team fly this plane.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![OIzgtKw.png](http://i.imgur.com/OIzgtKw.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![MBCBJww.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MBCBJww.jpg)\n\nF-22 Raptor\n\nThe F-22 is the Air Force\u0027s Current Air Superiority Fighter. It is virtually invisible to radar, boasts dual thrust vectoring engines which give it not only speed, but tremendous maneuverability. This plane will max the G meter at full speed, and can pull a turn tighter than the VAB. So be careful flying circles around the VAB. I\u0027ve also gotten this jet to hover vertically for a small period of time. Great fun, this jet is.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![KNQAsyU.png](http://i.imgur.com/KNQAsyU.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![I8Pt3W0.png](http://i.imgur.com/I8Pt3W0.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nWell, that\u0027s it for Part One of my American Fighter Jet Pack. Here is the [Download](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nkdhaborx2nee7v/AACfmOnObUiyBvkru25Xcx9ta?dl=0)\n\nThis takes you to a folder with all 4 craft. Only want one? you can download each one individually by clicking on them. The download button will appear greyed out and broken, but it works, just click it. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) There is a ReadMe file attached with the action group list, its rather short though.\n\nEnjoy! Feel free to leave comments about the jets, give opinions, constructive criticism. There are more to come. But remember, rep=love, and love=more incentive for me to make more of these jets. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWant Armed jets?
