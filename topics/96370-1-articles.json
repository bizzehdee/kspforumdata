I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a couple of months, I can dock vessels around Kerbin, Minmus, and Mun without issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to Duna however... it\u0027s like my direction indicator for Hohmann transfer nodes is a moving target. If I\u0027m piloting manually, I\u0027ll bail out and there\u0027ll be a couple of m/s left on the node and I won\u0027t get the intercept. If I let MechJeb do it, he\u0027ll flip the ship end over end with 0.3m/s left - possibly forever. Sometimes I get to ~5km, with prograde marker directly over the target marker, and yet somehow I\u0027m getting further away from it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis happens in a variety of ships; I\u0027ve been Hyperediting them out there just to see, and it\u0027s a very consistent problem.

The nodes represent instantaneous velocity changes, as an instantaneous change in velocity is impossible and we most do them over time they have some measure of inaccuracy. The game tries to add up your vector changes over the burn and subtracts that from the remaining change on the node. Slight inaccuracies throughout the burn will have no immediate visible effect but they show up towards the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay for example you want a 100m/s prograde burn. You point prograde but your .1 degrees off in the normal direction. It looks like your right on the node all through the burn but your actually adding a small amount of normal vector. the game accounts for that and adds a comparable amount of anti normal to the node to correct the error. This isn\u0027t visible at first because it may only be .5m/s vs 50 m/s of prograde left in a node at the halfway point. However when you get down to .5m/s of prograde left that antinormal correction component is half of the remaining node and so the manuver node will drop down to halfway between prograde and antinormal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb is normaly prety good at following nodes although its possible a mode is screwing things up. However mech jeb tries to follow the node as precisely as it can including the correction the node will produce for overburn and steering errors. If for whatever reason mechjeb cant hit the node to withen its error margian (.1m/s default as I recall) it will keep trying untill it does sometimes resulting in it spining around and thrusting back and forth trying to follow a node, getting less and less effective as you move further from the time of the node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly I\u0027d recommend you fly the nodes manually to learn how to do it. By all means use mechjeb to plan out the manuver if your not confident in doing that yourself (although you should learn that too) but try to fly the node yourself. a human mind is better at deciding when your close enough for the job than a script that just keeps trying even if its makeing things worse.
