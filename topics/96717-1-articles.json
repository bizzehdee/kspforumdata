But when I look at it up close, I realize it\u0027s actually quite a blurry picture. It\u0027s probably due to the limited resolution the picture was printed from (I believe this is the pic in question: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://anjungsainssmkss.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/merlin_1c_firing_21.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://anjungsainssmkss.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/merlin_1c_firing_21.jpg\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I looked around online, trying to find better resolution pictures and I\u0027m finding it VERY hard to find any. Very little is over 1024 x 768, and those that are are often blurry upscales (or out of focus raw pictures). Does anyone know of a place that has good, high quality pictures of rocket engines? Either sitting on display, test firing, or even nice renders. The bigger the resolution the better, because that should help alleviate the blurry pixelated look that PC printed pictures sometimes get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/35440057/disp/47e74b892a3b9e58d2cf9aa917e68b12.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002247e74b892a3b9e58d2cf9aa917e68b12.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T00:00:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s someone who has good pictures of it then it must be SpaceX.
