Saying that SQUAD is infinite could also mean that you think that the updates will most likely keep coming over a long period of time, eventually reaching the apeiron.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne could wonder how that also affects our current society. Yes, it might live on forever, but there\u0027s a great chance that we might end up destroying ourselves. May it be not with weapons, it will be via our society. We\u0027re getting more narcissistic with every advance in technology, and with the advancement of robotics people are getting lazier. Does that mean something about us? We\u0027re constantly changing. Our society is never the same, it\u0027s like a living being. It can evolve, but most of the times the mutations aren\u0027t beneficial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, we might reach a state where our society is effectively disbanded. But there\u0027s always the optimistic, slim chance that it will survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaying that monkeys are infinite could also serve as a metaphor that our species will live on, seeing as monkeys are close relatives to our species. Yes, our legacy will live on, our advancements, exploring, etc. But what are their purpose if there isn\u0027t anyone there to see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless, of course, we touch the extraterrestrial argument. ETs might find us by that time, learning about how our society worked. Or maybe not, maybe they\u0027re so advanced that the only reason they came here was for resources... which is more likely in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut still, back to the SQUAD thought: what if we compare kerbals to us, humans? There\u0027s a lot we can learn from kerbals: they\u0027re peaceful, somewhat intelligent, and really want to explore, independently of political constraints. Humans? War-mongering, unpeaceful pollution makers that have their progress halted because of old men in suits that only seek personal benefit. Kerbals are truly an inspiring species. If there are infinite universes, there must be one where they exist, in my opinion. If it\u0027s possible for humans to leave this universe (considering that the multiverse theory is true, of course. But it makes sense. We thought that Eurasia were the only continent, we were wrong. We thought that the Moon was the only moon, we were wrong. We thought that Earth was the only planet, we were wrong. We then expanded and found out that the Milky Way isn\u0027t the only galaxy in the universe. The next delusion is probably going to be finding out that there are more universes hanging around. It could be amazing if we could ever visit them, but it\u0027d be quite different. Instead of having a spacesuit that supplied you oxygen and protected you from vacuum, you\u0027d have to create a \u0022mini-universe\u0022 around you, since the physics in the other universe could be different. And what if there are beings in these other universes... would they act the same as us, humans, or more like kerbals? Truly, something to think about.). If we ever find kerbal-ish creatures, we must definetively learn from them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETruly, something philosophical...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-07T00:49:17Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2015 12:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wx7\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UnionPacific1983WP","CreatedById":140982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T01:39:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E10/10 Yes, I know you were added in....
