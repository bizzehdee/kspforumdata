Are you suggesting that it would land acurately without a course correction? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way that it works in the current version is (perhaps a little simplified) as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) High deorbit burn (unless it is doing a low deorbit burn, but that is a different matter!) This involves waiting until it is a quater orbit away, and then both changing the plane (hence the quarter orbit away) and lowering the periapsis until it is 10% below sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Then it performs a course correction which will stop once the predicted landing spot is \u0026lt;150m from target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Then it coasts towards a deceleration burn. If the predicted landing site is more than 600m from target it will got to step 2 and course correct again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If there is an atmopshere, during both 2) and 3), once the atmospheric drag is \u0026gt;100mm/s2 the statistical analysis of the predictions starts to time the parachutes. This is significant because if the flight path does not pass over the target at this point then timing the parachutes can not move the landing spot laterally. However because it can correct for over/undershoot it is likely to bring the error down to less than 150m and therefore not course correct, and so not correct the lateral error. For this reason it might make sense to turn the autopilot off and on again before reaching step 4 (100m/s2 drag) to force a correction if the error is let\u0027s say 300m (and significantly if there is a lateral error.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) The parachutes will open at the time that the satisitical analysis say they should - once at least one parachute is deployed then course corrections are not allowed, as the parachute drag would prevent the craft having effective attitude control. The deceleration burn will fire if the speed exceeds the target speed defined by the breaking policy*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) When we reach the deceleration end altitude above the predicted landing point (where the deceleration end altitude is something to do with the distance covered to produce enough drag to cancel our current speed, or something - it is a bit complicated and I do not quite understand it, or for bodies with no atmospehere it is 500m) we then move to the final decent phase, which is esentially a free drop down to a suicide burn to hopefully touch down at your desired speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) The landing legs will deploy at any stage once the AGL \u0026lt; 1000m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is pretty much how I understand it. So like I say I am not sure what you mean when you say a course correction is unneccasery. In the high atmosphere it is possbile and can result in a more precise landing. Once the drag gets too large then performing a course correction becomes difficult depending on the design of your craft, and once a parachute is deployed it becomes impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-04T20:22:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2014 08:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by codepoet\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T20:17:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have seen it but it was totally random for me.

Are you suggesting that it would land acurately without a course correction? \u003Cp\u003EThe way that it works in the current version is (perhaps a little simplified) as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) High deorbit burn (unless it is doing a low deorbit burn, but that is a different matter!) This involves waiting until it is a quater orbit away, and then both changing the plane (hence the quarter orbit away) and lowering the periapsis until it is 10% below sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Then it performs a course correction which will stop once the predicted landing spot is \u0026lt;150m from target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Then it coasts towards a deceleration burn. If the predicted landing site is more than 600m from target it will got to step 2 and course correct again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If there is an atmopshere, during both 2) and 3), once the atmospheric drag is \u0026gt;100mm/s2 the statistical analysis of the predictions starts to time the parachutes. This is significant because if the flight path does not pass over the target at this point then timing the parachutes can not move the landing spot laterally. However because it can correct for over/undershoot it is likely to bring the error down to less than 150m and therefore not course correct, and so not correct the lateral error. For this reason it might make sense to turn the autopilot off and on again before reaching step 4 (100m/s2 drag) to force a correction if the error is let\u0027s say 300m (and significantly if there is a lateral error.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) The parachutes will open at the time that the satisitical analysis say they should - once at least one parachute is deployed then course corrections are not allowed, as the parachute drag would prevent the craft having effective attitude control. The deceleration burn will fire if the speed exceeds the target speed defined by the breaking policy*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) When we reach the deceleration end altitude above the predicted landing point (where the deceleration end altitude is something to do with the distance covered to produce enough drag to cancel our current speed, or something - it is a bit complicated and I do not quite understand it, or for bodies with no atmospehere it is 500m) we then move to the final decent phase, which is esentially a free drop down to a suicide burn to hopefully touch down at your desired speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) The landing legs will deploy at any stage once the AGL \u0026lt; 1000m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is pretty much how I understand it. So like I say I am not sure what you mean when you say a course correction is unneccasery. In the high atmosphere it is possbile and can result in a more precise landing. Once the drag gets too large then performing a course correction becomes difficult depending on the design of your craft, and once a parachute is deployed it becomes impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m saying is that I have seen it do course corrections after it\u0027s already hit atmo and that I\u0027ve had to turn it off so that it doesn\u0027t go off course or worse burn fuel that I\u0027ll need for a soft landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also to prevent it from doing things like Bobe described or to stop it from doing things like burning \u002B/- NRM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes it do it all the time?
