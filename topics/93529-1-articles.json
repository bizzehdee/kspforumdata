Whenever it is active, it takes every science reading that does not disable a part (goo and materials).

If several contain the same reading (to squeeze the last points out of a biome) only one will be kept. (The same would happen if you EVA\u0027d to pick them up one at a time, and boarded with each reading.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
