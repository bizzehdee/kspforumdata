No beach parties would be held there at all. Only science. Anyway they soon discovered that to build something, you need stuff to build it with. This is were you come in! Your challenge is to find the fastest way to transport a 72 ton payload (2 Rockomax Jumbo-64 fuel tanks) to the island and return.\n\n**The Rules:**\n\n- Completely stock physics, drag models etc. (There will be a separate FAR leader board)\n- Completely stock parts (Informative mods and visual mods are fine)\n- Payload must be left at the island INTACT\n- Vessel must remain completely intact apart from the payload\n- Time runs from the moment you start your engines to the moment you come to a complete stop back at the Ksc runway\n\nGood luck!\n\n**Stock Leader Board**\n\n1. t3hJimmer: 4 mins 10 seconds\n\n2.

It took an awful lot of blowing up orange tanks at the Old Air Field before I was able to get this run. I chose to go with a side by side deployment to keep the length of my aircraft down.
