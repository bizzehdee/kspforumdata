Shimano quality does not differ depending on which bike it is mounted on. They have different product lines, but the Nexus stuff seems to be the cheapest road bike line they have and that is mounted on pretty much all the decent bikes that do not cost an arm and a leg. You also do not need Rohloff hubs to get around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhatever the case, just get a decent brand bike with decent brand gear stuff if you plan on using the bike regularly. Cheap Chinese stuff will last a year or so, before falling apart fairly permanently. Spend a little more than you ideally would want to, but not a stupid amount of money. A good bike will last you decades. If you do not plan on using the thing regularly, it probably matters less what you buy, as long as you store it inside. Even then, paying a bit more for quality might be the prudent thing to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt probably helps to be somewhere where bikes are actually a means of transport, rather than them being almost exclusively a hobby.

Shimano quality does not differ depending on which bike it is mounted on.
