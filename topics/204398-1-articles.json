Crafts seem to have a state and a general where-it-is line. For example if you launch a booster but land it directly on the pad, it goes from PRELAUNCH at KSC_LAUNCHPAD to LANDED at KSC_LAUNCHPAD. The trick, I think, is to change the vessels\u0027 states to LANDED, but also ensure they are not at RUNWAY or KSC_LAUNCHPAD. Once I realized this it\u0027s obvious, but if anyone has more details it is welcome! For now I\u0027ve solved my problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
