I feel like they\u0027ve really been detracting from my game, because I spend far more time building random, awkwardly staged and impractical vessels to jump through as many arbitrary hoops as possible than doing the kind of thing I enjoy doing ingame. I *could* just not take them, but they represent a substantial portion of your available resources, so it feels like i\u0027m hobbling myself by doing that. I\u0027m the kind of player who obsessively strives towards maximum efficiency, and not doing so is difficult. Which means, oh, you had these two near-identical probe engines you were supposed to test, but one had to be done with the run test command while the other had to be staged just so at just this point in time, and you got them mixed up?

My main gripe with the part testing missions is that I feel that they act more like hoops to jump through than goalposts. With the rescue missions, or when redirecting an asteroid, or travelling to Jool and back, there are a ton of ways for you to achieve that objective, and it\u0027s up to you to do it in your own unique style. I feel like that freedom is greatly lessened with the part testing missions, as their criteria are extremely specific to the point where you are forced to conform the mission around them, rather than being able to just test organically through standard use in the field, which I feel would be better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may well be in the minority with that view.

I\u0027ve been seeing a ton of gripes on here about the part test profiles, their restrictions, and their very strict requirements. Most of these gripes have been along the lines that they are patently ridiculous, unnecessary and overly difficult to accomplish. I would like to point out that this is ACTUALLY how testing works. Test profiles for unknown parts are extremely stringent and require weeks, sometimes months, of repetitive flights in order to gather the necessary breadth data to analyze part performance. Test pilots spend day after day flying the aircraft within a very tight range of tolerances for the flight test engineers either in the aircraft or on the ground receiving data-linked telemetry and sensor information. If you exceed the tolerances by a little bit, you fly the profile again. You do this until you a) run out of fuel or \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E run out of crew duty day. In either case, you\u0027re most likely heading up tomorrow to fly the exact same profile. I had the opportunity to spend a week flying a test run for my company where I had to put the aircraft over a point on the ground \u002B/- 1 minute, \u002B/- 50 ft (altitude), and within 1% of a target aircraft gross weight in order for the test to be valid. If I messed up, it was back to the airfield to refuel and try again. I know that this statement smacks of realism, not game, but how many posts are on here and the boards about things not \u0022being realistic enough?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But Kal, I can\u0027t engage my LV-XXX where it says, because the stage timing doesn\u0027t work right!\u0022 Ok, if you\u0027re going to take these contracts (which you don\u0027t have to do, btw), you gasp might have to put forth some thought, consideration, planning, and, yes, MATH. MOAR STRUTS! MOAR BOOSTERS! Might not work! (Say it isn\u0027t so!!!). Consider launching the test vehicle at a 45* angle or less in order to maximize the time you spend within the test window. As you gain aircraft parts, consider creating flying testbeds to test parts: aircraft that you attach something to and then fly it into the test window to engage the test item. 14000m to 20000m at 250m/s to 450m/s is well within the flight envelope of aircraft in KSP, and it\u0027s recoverable. Most aviation corporations as well as governmental organizations keep an inventory of testbed aircraft (B-52\u0027s, BBJ\u0027s, G4\u0027s, Lears, SR-71, etc) for the purpose of strapping odd things to them to test performance. While I find the \u0022science mode\u0022 versus \u0022career mode\u0022 graphics as funny as anyone else, test aircraft really do look very odd.

It\u0027s generally a quite reasonable and realistic way to provide a source of funding and science points. Sure, some of the offered contracts might be unprofitable, silly, crazy, or whatever, but that\u0027s something which can be fine tuned in later releases, and it\u0027s not entirely unrealistic for some offered contracts to be crappy (such things happen in the real world, and real companies/agencies have to pick and choose the contracts which are both appropriate and viable for them). The key reason why they absolutely should not be removed is that it\u0027s clear that there are many people who enjoy the challenge presented by them (I see your \u0022ton of gamers\u0022 who don\u0027t like them, and raise you several tons who probably either like them or are happy to decline any that sound unprofitable or tiresome), and they can be declined without penalty by those who don\u0027t like the sound of a particular contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than in the early stages of career mode (where you have far less choice of parts, etc), the key is mostly to find ways to clear Kerbin testing contracts for near zero cost. My approach to this is either by reducing the mission to fuel-only by being 100% recoverable (the Ravenspear Mk3 and Aeris 4A provide an excellent starting point for sub-orbital and orbital testing of small parts); or vastly reduced cost, by completing 3 or 4 contracts in a single mission or incidentally to something you\u0027re wanting to do anyway. Pretty much all of my launches only cost fuel plus a small number of SRBs, with the main launcher achieving circular LKO then parachuting back to KSC after detaching payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf something should change here, a more useful change which would look towards the entire player base would be to provide contract preferences, to let you specify the broad types of contract that you are willing to consider.

Aerobatics are so much harder when you don\u0027t have your stomach and butt sensors aiding you (I\u0027ve flown aerobatics for real, although max around 3-4g peak), but still a whole load of fun when you get good at them. It\u0027s safe to say that my KSP piloting skills have vastly improved directly as a result of flying short contract sorties, either testing, or rescue-cabbie (a tweaked Aeris 4A with 2nd cockpit is perfect for fuel-only rescues) to LKO and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome part tests are crappy, annoying, or unprofitable, but that\u0027s a minority of them, not the majority. Mostly I feel it\u0027s a good part of the system and a very useful income stream, plus a welcome bit of variety to fit in between exploration. Easy contracts local to Kerbin provide the funding for more lavish interplanetary missions, like spending about 2 mil on sending a full station, lander, probes, fuel dump, etc out to another planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
