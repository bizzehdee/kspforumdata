Of course the electricity consumption is irrelevant, you just stick enough batteries, solar panels, and/or NUKs to it and it can work forever.

The current amount of asteroids passing Kerbin is fairly excessive, and I think that there should be far fewer to make it a more special occurrence. I also think there should be a belt of asteroids at about Dres-orbit height that spawns in and can only be monitored with the new part. This would lend itself to realism considerably whilst adding to gameplay (You want an E-class? Usually you just TW a year and one appears, but using this new system you would have to go out and find one!
