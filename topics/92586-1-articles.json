Let\u0027s say I have a central stack with an engine at the bottom and also 4 smaller stacks in a 4-way symmetry formation along the sides (2 pairs of 2) and each of those has its own engine too. The way I usually see this is with asparagus fuel lines and decouplers so that you eject the first pair of side stacks, then later on the second pair, leaving only the middle stack for the remainder of the ascent. With this design, you will lose thrust at each stage because you are losing the engines and the fuel tanks together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, alternatively, if I were to move the 4 engines from the side stacks and attach them directly to the center stack (separating them from the side fuel tanks and using fuel lines to stay functional), then as I eject the side fuel tanks I would keep the same amount of thrust all the way to orbit. I would still use the usual asparagus setup on the side fuel tanks. The trade-off is that I keep the same constant amount of thrust all the way to orbit, but I also keep the mass of those side engines all the way too. Also, with more engines active during the entire ascent, I would burn through fuel quicker. The real question is whether the additional thrust would make up for keeping the mass and burning the fuel faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if being more specific about certain engine and fuel tank parts matters, but it might.

Yes, that was under 0.20 (0.19?), but the general principles are still valid - and these days they\u0027re far easier to implement (no thrust limiters back then). What his philosophy boils down to is having a 1.6-1.7 TWR at launch and having a core stage that\u0027s more powerful than any of the individual booster engines (he uses a 22%:13% core-to-booster engine thrust ratio for three booster pairs or 22%:9.75% for four booster pairs). Each stage gets up to 2.2-2.3 TWR before it\u0027s discarded, dropping the TWR back down towards 1.5-1.6; the final core stage is around 1.3 when it finally has to start working on its own.

The Atlas engines couldn\u0027t throttle (it gained that capability only after the introduction of RD-180), and full thrust with tanks nearly empty would\u0027ve introduced unacceptable loads on the flimsy balloon tanks the rocket was made of. Dropping the engines was more like a poor man\u0027s throttling mechanism. It had the problem of littering the orbit (though being big and light, spent rockets decayed quickly) and wasn\u0027t very cheap, either. The reasons for doing the Atlas that way was to avoid igniting a large (turbopump-fed) liquid rocket engine at altitude, which was an unresolved problem at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtlas was an oddity, because normally, you\u0027d want to drop spent tanks with engines (the way R-7 handled the same problem), but Atlas was made with a monocoque construction, and the tanks were very lightweight (the walls of the tank were also the hull). As such, dropping tanks designed like this wouldn\u0027t have saved enough to justify the added mass and complexity of a separation system. On the other hand, those tanks were problematic to handle and had to be kept pressurized when in storage, or they\u0027d collapse. That\u0027s why they\u0027re not used anymore, except on Centaur (being an upper stage, it\u0027s smaller and its mass is at premium, so it\u0027s worth enduring the handling difficulties).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
