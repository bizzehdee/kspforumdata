From a simple souvenier to expensive accessaries, You have to supply raw materials and some tools which are required to make those products, and also some kerbals to make the workshop to operate. You can deliver your supplies from KSC or harvest it in-situ, like asteroids. Products should be delivered back to kerbin, specifically on KSC in order to recovered safely and to be sold, without experiencing too much g-force during reentry. Too much g-force should be lead to loss of the products. It means that the best way to deliver your cargo back to kerbin will be using space planes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n#2 Outsourced launch\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEver experienced difficulties to put some weird looking payloads on LKO, or had hard time figuring out the designs of new heavy lifter with low-tier parts? Or, your last attempt to send some supplies to Jeb failed and can\u0026#39;t find anyone to help you? Borrow hands from other kerbals with proper expense. As we now have big airliner parts, deliver your payloads to another launch site so that they can put it on top of their rockets. The size or volume, weights, target orbit of your payloads and launch dates will determine your expenses. But always remember that they also can fail, nothing you can do about it. Maybe regular, or irregular investments to their company might help to reduce the rate a little bit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs far as I know, currently no mods available for these ideas. I know it\u0026#39;s not more than a rough sketch of ideas, but I spend hard times tried to make it myself. Eventually failed, as I know nothing about programming languages or part modellings. So I thought it would be better to post them on the forum and wish that they can meet some nice modders who can turn them into something more than mere ideas. You can take these ideas if you like, and l\u0026#39;ll really appreciat it. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T14:23:23Z","Content":"\nFor #1, look at [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545\u0022]EPL[/URL] and [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108234\u0022]OSE Workshop[/URL]. Building things in space (particularly Gravioli detectors) and then recovering a [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111\u0022]KIS[/URL] container full of them is already quite profitable.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdd in some contracts to build specific things - and to check the G load - and you\u0026#39;re all set.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n#2 sounds a bit like [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85630\u0022]Routine Mission Manager[/URL], only without having to record a run first. Perhaps it could just add an \u0022outsourced\u0022 option that gives a set cost per payload size, then puts your payload into orbit?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JWS","CreatedById":136190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T21:33:41Z","Content":"\nFor #1, Yes,those mods already provide great space workshop. But, what I thought was some ornament or accessories , not rocket parts. So, I started my own mod. It\u0026#39;s just few MM and EM patches at this moment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/140413-WIP-1-0-5-Made-in-Space-%28v-0-1%29[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor #2, You are correct. Except that delivering my payloads to other launch site so that big airliner parts can be used for transfer. May require other mods like \u0026#39;Kerbin side\u0026#39;. On the second thought, shipping the payloads can be another option. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks for reply!\n"}]}
