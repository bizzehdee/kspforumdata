Almost like we have a 50\u0027s era jet engine from an F-86 or F-100 and one from the SR-71. Which is cool, I use them both, but I sort of wish we had a more powerful, non-turboramjet engine like what an F-15 or Su-27 KSP-analogue would mount. That ramjet curve sometimes feels like a runaway freight train when it kicks in, you really have to back off the throttle when at lower altitudes before you tear your jet apart. A third jet engine with performance between those two would be nice. But it\u0027s no big deal, just a preference.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the \u0022thrust\u0022 realm I find the gap between the two a little wider now with the reduced engine thrust of the J-33 BJE. However, this is offset it seems by the tweaked drag characteristics of v1.0.3. I\u0027m not finding any noticeable changes in performance, speed or acceleration in most of my \u0022conventional\u0022 J-33 powered aircraft, but then again, those are all fairly light craft files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does become noticeable are J-33 powered VTOL\u0027s or anything else that requires the Basic Jet Engine for vertical thrust. The obvious answer would be: \u0022just put the more powerful J-X4 on it\u0022. However from certain design points-of-view, the J-X4 is almost twice as long as the J-33 and is a little more challenging to fit in certain areas for said purpose. I know, this seems like sharpshooting or whining, but it\u0027s not. I\u0027m very pleased with the 1.0.3 update so far, including the aero and jet engine updates (although some of my planes don\u0027t have quite the range now due to the increased fuel flow \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, SPH engineers out there, feel free to weigh in on this; how have your craft designs needed to change or be tweaked?
