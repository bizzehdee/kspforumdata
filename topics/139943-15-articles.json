But in career you\u0027ve probably already got orbital labs up around the mun and minmus, so the needs of you ever going to another planet are significantly reduced, not to mention that because of the months of the (poor?) kerbal you sent in interplanetary travel, you\u0027d rather do other things while you wait for that to get there. (also having to monitor said orbital labs so they don\u0027t get completely filled with science.) Also the risk behind it. I prefer NOT having to go rescue kerbals from another planet when I can barely get them back from said planet in the first place.
