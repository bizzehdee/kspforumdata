I didn\u0027t appreciate how lucky I was with every previous intercept having a near 0 heading. Now, unlike the perfectly planned transfers between moons, planning ejection isn\u0027t so obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I\u0027m imagining the most efficient thing is to first escape to Jool such that the pe gets nice and low, for maximum oberth effect. However, I can\u0027t see to plot an escape from this angle that actually reduces it. That means just escaping, followed by a less efficient burn to drop it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Attempts to flatten the orbit around Bop seem incredibly expensive.

When you have a far out orbit, it is easier to change the orbit. In other words, extend you apoasis and periapsis first. Then since you are in a polar orbit, you will pass the equator at some point. That\u0027s the best place to level your orbit. Use a maneuver node! Bob doesn\u0027t have too much gravity anyways so it should take up to much delta-v. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T23:16:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBop has negligible gravity.

Alternatively, you can just barely burn to leave Jool\u0027s SoI, warp to one of the places your orbital plane intersects with Kerbin\u0027s, and do your deceleration burn there. Your periapsis will be very close to Kerbin\u0027s orbit after that, even if you have the wrong inclination, and you can easily adjust your orbit to hit Kerbin. Since you aerobrake at Kerbin, it doesn\u0027t matter that much if you wait to change inclination until then, so this is probably a more fuel-efficient method.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T00:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you\u0027re escaping Jool already on Kerbin intercept trajectory.
