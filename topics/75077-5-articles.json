The bigger airbags too close together will jostle and vy for placement, and wind up knocking parts off the main craft or making the bounce/roll take more time. I had to manually inflate/deflate a couple to stop from destroying my craft. This may just be WAD and be up to the ship designer to not place these airbags too close together.
