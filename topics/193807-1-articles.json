It\u2019s based on average values for launches, so getting your launch right will give you more range once you\u2019re in orbit. A gravity turn is the best launch profile, there are guides on how to do those and even a dedicated mod (called Gravity Turn, oddly enough) to automate them; just launching up out of the atmosphere and then sideways to orbit is very inefficient and wastes fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere\u2019s a difference between sending a crewed mission and a probe or lander, in that generally you want to bring crews back again, so you\u2019ll need a lot more fuel. Probes are cheaper and expendable, so start with those and build your rocket from the top down:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the top is your probe, probably an OKTO or a HECS, with an antenna and some power (batteries and, if you have unlocked them, solar panels) and some science experiments. If you have small parts unlocked, use Oscar-B tanks and the Spark engine for their low weight which will give you better range, if not go for the Terrier and FL-T100 or 200 tanks which are slightly overkill for a small lander but which will also have a lot of range. Under that, add a decoupler and a payload fairing to cover the probe up during the ascent, and build a transfer stage that uses a\u00A0FL-T400 tank and a Terrier engine, which will do the job of finishing off your orbit around Kerbin and then carrying your probe out to the Mun. Check Where can I go (WCIG for short) with \u2018payload only\u2019 mode on to make sure you can get to the Mun and land with fuel to spare (the numbers are green) in case your launch isn\u2019t as efficient as it could be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour main booster should be made of FL-T400 and/or 800 tanks and a Swivel engine with some basic\u00A0fins just above the engine for stability. Add some radial decouplers (2-4 should do it) and enable crossfeed, then add some solid boosters like Hammers or Thumpers with a FL-T200 or 400 on top: the extra fuel tanks will help you go further and will drain first so they\u2019re empty when the solid boosters burn out and get dumped; add nosecones to the boosters,\u00A0then make sure the solid boosters and main engine are in the same stage and if so check\u00A0your thrust to weight ratio (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E) on the first stage- if it\u2019s above 2, reduce the power limit on the solid boosters to make them last longer and reduce wasted thrust from atmosphere, anything between 1.4 and 1.8\u00A0should be OK. Check WCIG again without \u2018payload only\u2019 and make sure you can still land on the Mun with fuel to spare. If you can, great; if not, you may need a bit more fuel, but just remember more fuel on the upper stages will need more fuel and then more thrust on the lower stages to get it into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u2019re in orbit and want to go to the Mun, you need to time your transfer burn right. It takes one day to get out to the Mun and 4 days for the Mun to orbit Kerbin, so you need to aim for a spot 90 degrees in front of it. This makes it pretty easy to time the transfer burn as this will need to be on the opposite side of Kerbin, so 90 degrees behind where the Mun is. This means that you\u2019ll be pointing straight at the Mun,\u00A0so when you\u2019re pointing prograde and the Mun is straight ahead, fire those engines! You can use manoeuvre nodes to help your aim, but make sure you end up in orbit and not on a direct collision course as you will most likely crash if you try to land directly from a transfer burn without orbiting first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinmus is a little bit harder to aim at due to its inclined orbit and greater distance, but is actually a lot easier to land on as it\u2019s lower gravity means lower orbital speeds and so less delta-V needed to slow down and land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-12T14:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223784089\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022193807\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221589283073\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204582\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zishan fj\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Zishan fj said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo , the problem is , i tried to get to mun\u00A0many times (about 10) and every time i face the problem of insufficient fuel\u00A0 .
