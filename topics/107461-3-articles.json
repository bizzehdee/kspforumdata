It allowed you to record data from specific sensors (like temp or barometer) at intervals throughout the mission - into .csv files for more accurate analysis and graphing using 3rd party apps and such. You could toggle them on/off. Really great mod - in fact, it still works! Partly - there are few issues, but the core functionality seems to be intact.\n\nAnyway, here is the thread for it:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52403-0-21-1-Flight-Recorder](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52403-0-21-1-Flight-Recorder)\n\nIt is creative commons CC BY SA 3.0 license.\n\n--------------\n\nupdate - nevermind! I didn\u0027t realize the Graphotron had the same feature to export data as a .csv. Thats great, finally have a replacement for the old mod!\n\nDouble thanks!\n\n--------------\n\n2nd update. Would it be possible to scale the window if we choose a large data point size? It can get pretty huge.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-16T01:08:10Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2015 01:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zilfondel**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T01:55:06Z","Content":"one more request: Can the logging interval pause be changed to ensure that the data is logged at the *start* of each interval rather than add the interval to the end of the last logged data time?
