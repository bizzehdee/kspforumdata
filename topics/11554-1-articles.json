I thought why not just put the wings on the rocket and eject them? So here it is, the Sparrow. \n\nYou have to take it to the end of the runway and keep your nose up when you drop off. Then work your way to a vertical climb. Wait until you reach 17,000 meters, when the engines produce no more lift and eject the wing assemblies. You have to wait until they don\\\u0027t produce lift or else they will fly up and crash into the remaining rocket. There is a wing at the front of the rocket that needs to be ejected separately or it will crash into your engine. From there just follow standard orbiting procedures and you are good to go. Have fun!\n\nOk, fixed the problem with the forward wings, they can now eject with everything else."}]}
