I was appalled by it in real time as I watched. They treated the GR effects at the planet as if there was not a gradient, and approaching that world would not have continuously exposed them to dilation. They also entirely ignored the fact that as they approach the Schwarzschild of their black hole, this effect goes to infinity. So merely approaching the hole (let alone what they did, which is to go through it---twice) effectively makes them stop, while the universe races ahead to time=infinity. That\u0027s aside from the fact that, even assuming that Miller\u0027s planet wasn\u0027t just shredded by tidal forces by exactly placing in the right spot outside the Roche limit, it would be bathed in hard radiation. Not slightly elevated, like \u0022instantly dead\u0022 levels. They should have never checked it out, and not bothered wasting time going there. Also, it\u0027s gotta be moving fast enough that the main ship having enough dv to transfer to it seems pretty dubious. It\u0027s really absurd. It would have been easy to get the same desired plot elements (time mattering) with nothing more than limited dv, and widespread planets (perhaps a binary system). Then make the FTL an artifact, not a black hole, so they can hand wave whatever they like.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E For Hollywood, it set a very high bar, because apparently you\u0027ve never seen any other Hollywood space movie attempt. There will always be the good trio- Gravity, Interstellar and The Martian.\n\nIf you think Interstellar is realistic, you have a weak list. Gravity has plenty of issues as well. 2010 is arguably a better movie in many ways than 2001 (the ending of the latter was terrible for someone unfamiliar with the short story, or later book). It\u0027s all a matter of what you are willing to ignore. To like Interstellar, and particularly to think it is realistic in any way, you have to know basically nothing about spaceflight or black holes. To like Gravity, you need to not understand orbital mechanics (and possibly like Sandra Bullock in yoga shorts, which I\u0027ll admit is a mitigating factor ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ). I don\u0027t yet have an opinion on the Martian, but we\u0027ll all have to suspend belief on the storm (in the book and in the movie), and certainly on the choice of landing location in the movie. Past that I can\u0027t say yet, though I\u0027m certainly going to see it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-10T18:20:41Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2015 06:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T18:18:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It is funny how that article says they are using big words, but it sounds like just another week day on this forum.

I have seen 2010, and Europa Report and all the other movies of such, and while 2010 certainly had realistic physics, Interstellar takes them to a stellar level. We\u0027re not talking about airbraking in gas giants\u0027 atmosphere\u0027s and assisted gravity escape maneuvers, we are talking flying to Saturn with plasma engines powered by compact tokomaks with a ship built over many years through many launches, doing a gravity assist using Mars and going through a **realistic** wormhole(first time ever in a movie) and arriving in another system with a black hole and a neutron star, doing complex landing maneuvers, using multiple craft to accelerate one big one while getting a gravity assist from a black hole by flying at crazy speed close to its event horizon. Show me a movie that did all that in less than 3 hours of screen time.\n\nDid you really expect them to waste time on explaining every gritty maneuver and every single flight with an SSTO?\n\nAnd no, they didn\u0027t treat the time dilation as a non-gradient. It was always there, they just didn\u0027t want to confuse the audience by announcing the time dilation factor every 2 minutes as they sped up or slowed down. \n\nAnd no, 2001 is better than 2010 because 2001 actually made you think and had a much deeper meaning, and itself set a new standard for sci-fi movies.\n\nStop going on about maneuvers they never did and \u0022impossible\u0022 flights. Admit that SSTO\u0027s aren\u0027t silly, you are simply living mentally in the 20th century filled with wasteful rockets. Interstellar takes place in the 2050s-60s.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-10T19:34:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2015 07:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceXray**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T19:47:18Z","Content":"Guys comeon get a thread already!\n\nI was actually hoping that it would be an ad featuring The Martian not just a quick cameo.

I understand that it might have been my fault in a way for perpetuating this slightly in the beginning but can we stick to the martian. Actaully I don\u0027t have a problem talking about science and certain parts of the movies. Thats fine but for all intents and purposes no more comparing gravity and interstellar. No more complaining about either movie. If you want to have a discussion about the realism of the blackhole in interstellar thats fine. But if you want to talk about how the blackhole sucked and the power of love was stupid hence the movie sucked please keep those opinions to yourself. Its not because I want to stifle conversation but the realism in science fiction movies are such a polarizing topic it tends to derail threads. Gravity and Interstellar are SO polarizing they have driven threads into the ground. \n\nSo lets stick to the martian for now. I mean guys the movie is coming out in less than a month!!!! Ok so here is a strange feeling I have been having or strange reactions. Because I enjoyed the novel so much I am obviously very protective of it. As the hype and popularity grows about the movie I get excited to see clips and trailers but when I hear critique and breakdown from people who clearly haven\u0027t read the book it deeply frustrates me. For example my local news showed a clip from the martian this morning. One of the anchors said verbatum (I remember it because I was annyed so much) \u0022uhhhh I don\u0027t, it looks beautiful but it looks like science is gonna be too much apart of the movie and people probably aren\u0027t going to like that\u0022 I yelled dozens of words we aren\u0027t allowed to use on this forum. THATS WHY THE MOVIE IS GOING TO BE AWESOME! A family member of mine said \u0022uhh its probably gonna be another boring space movie!!\u0022 she said this not knowing I read the book. After forty minutes later I might have convinced her its gonna be good. The other problem I have this isn\u0027t exclusive to the martian but I am not a hipster but when it comes to nerdy stuff. Even though I am overjoyed that the movie is coming out I am sad that after October second The Martian isn\u0027t something I know that isn\u0027t a happy surprise for someone. Like \u0022do you want to read an amazing book that no one has heard of?\u0022 \u0022sure\u0022 2 days later \u0022OMG you\u0027re totally right!!\u0022 \u0022great pass it on to only awesome people\u0022 lol.
