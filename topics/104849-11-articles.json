I understand that it might have been my fault in a way for perpetuating this slightly in the beginning but can we stick to the martian. Actaully I don\u0027t have a problem talking about science and certain parts of the movies. Thats fine but for all intents and purposes no more comparing gravity and interstellar. No more complaining about either movie. If you want to have a discussion about the realism of the blackhole in interstellar thats fine. But if you want to talk about how the blackhole sucked and the power of love was stupid hence the movie sucked please keep those opinions to yourself. Its not because I want to stifle conversation but the realism in science fiction movies are such a polarizing topic it tends to derail threads. Gravity and Interstellar are SO polarizing they have driven threads into the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets stick to the martian for now. I mean guys the movie is coming out in less than a month!!!! Ok so here is a strange feeling I have been having or strange reactions. Because I enjoyed the novel so much I am obviously very protective of it. As the hype and popularity grows about the movie I get excited to see clips and trailers but when I hear critique and breakdown from people who clearly haven\u0027t read the book it deeply frustrates me. For example my local news showed a clip from the martian this morning. One of the anchors said verbatum (I remember it because I was annyed so much) \u0022uhhhh I don\u0027t, it looks beautiful but it looks like science is gonna be too much apart of the movie and people probably aren\u0027t going to like that\u0022 I yelled dozens of words we aren\u0027t allowed to use on this forum. THATS WHY THE MOVIE IS GOING TO BE AWESOME! A family member of mine said \u0022uhh its probably gonna be another boring space movie!!\u0022 she said this not knowing I read the book. After forty minutes later I might have convinced her its gonna be good. The other problem I have this isn\u0027t exclusive to the martian but I am not a hipster but when it comes to nerdy stuff. Even though I am overjoyed that the movie is coming out I am sad that after October second The Martian isn\u0027t something I know that isn\u0027t a happy surprise for someone. Like \u0022do you want to read an amazing book that no one has heard of?\u0022 \u0022sure\u0022 2 days later \u0022OMG you\u0027re totally right!!\u0022 \u0022great pass it on to only awesome people\u0022 lol.
