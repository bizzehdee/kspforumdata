I should provide an argument, but the video speaks for itself. No more ram issues as this system only loads the mod if it is enabled in that specific save. Might mean you have to spend longer waiting if you hop in between saves a lot as it would have to reload some mods, but frankly it would be worth it. Also no more giant parts list for those who have many mods installed. Mods would auto update like any patch on steam, .craft files on the workshop, auto downloading the needed mods when firing up a published save file, if a mod does not work, the game only deletes the offending parts, keeping ships and worlds loadable.... Using mods in SE is so easy now, you would be hard-pressed to find a stock purist. I\u0027m not sure how hard this would be from a coding standpoint, but unless there is a serious issue that makes it too difficult to add, I think it would be a great idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatch to (3:00)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=UUiIu5_NeaCkv3Nt8R5u7pNg\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/130/f/b/puppy_eyes_plz_by_puppywantplz-d36fpka.png\u0022 alt=\u0022puppy_eyes_plz_by_puppywantplz-d36fpka.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod popularity would \u003Cem\u003Eexplode\u003C/em\u003E if this were added!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-06T02:40:54Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2014 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by WhiteWeasel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T03:10:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI completely agree, all we need if for squad to just enable it. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95377-Steam-Workshop\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etheres discussion on it here\u003C/a\u003E Could be one of those use it if you want to, don\u0027t if you don\u0027t situations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still wonder what percent of users use steam for ksp....
