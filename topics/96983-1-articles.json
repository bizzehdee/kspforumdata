So much more fun than rockets, for me. I think it\u0027s the frustrated Air Force pilot in me. Anyway, I\u0027ve got quite a selection of craft I\u0027ve been tweaking and refining since .22 and had lately been flying them with a quickness to orbit in .90 x64 on Windows. Then I repaired an old high-performance desktop of mine and switched over to 32-bit KSP, .90. And suddenly none of my previously-exemplary (I mean seriously, 200km AP without touching the rocket engines) can even get above 1200m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat changed, please? I\u0027m completely confused that a starting TWR of 3.8 and a GLOW of 14 tons doesn\u0027t result in a plane that can burn itself up in the upper atmosphere! I\u0027m a MechJeb-only player. I can fly in atmo, but space completely tangles my reflexes. So when I can\u0027t even trigger anti-flameout, I wonder what\u0027s gone wrong...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-17T19:39:27Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2015 07:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snowwy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T19:14:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a similar experience with my aerospace planes not making it to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it turns out, I\u0027d installed some parts from B9 Aerospace, and B9 Aerospace comes with a modulemanager configuration that reduces the performance of the stock jet engines significantly.
