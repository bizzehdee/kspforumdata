With a lander, you generally have a cylindrical base either 0.625, 1.25, or 2.5 meters in diameter. Not much differentiation needed. However, with a plane, you can have several different types of fuselage, different engine arrangements (e. g. under-wing, like an airliner, or flush in the back, like a fighter jet), often several different fuselage bodies, plus you might be going for different aesthetics (like old-style biplanes, or something like a Cessna). You can see why you need to have different wheels. Same with rover wheels, and that\u0027s exacerbated by the fact that rovers are usually irregularly shaped."},{"CreatedByName":"hobbez","CreatedById":138355,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T20:11:53Z","Content":"You guys realize you\u0027re talking about a space game and not a plane flying simulator, right?

My campaign currently has a tier 2 R\u0026D, and not even all those nodes unlocked, and I already have a plane that can go to the Mun and back. Personally I find building (space)planes to be *more* fun than building rockets. There was a time when I couldn\u0027t do without B9 because plane parts were fairly lacking, and I\u0027m happy to see that I can now play this game the way I want to with stock parts.\n\nThat\u0027s not to say rocketry should be abandoned by any means. I still build plenty of rockets and enjoy flying them. Going forward, I hope to see additions to both aspects of the game (including longer landing struts for VTOL). I see the recent focus on planes simply being a result of the game starting with rocketry, making it necessary for planes to play catch up.

Like what the heck?? Pardon me if my numbers are way off, you get the gist.\n\nThat\u0027s a very necessary difference, to ensure that landing gear isn\u0027t too fragile to the point of making plane landing near impossible. I won\u0027t say the landing gear tolerance is perfect, but it\u0027s vastly better for it to be too large than too small.\n\nLanding legs in normal usage should be dealing with 0 m/s horizontal speed and max of around 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015310 m/s vertical. Landing gear, on the other hand needs to be able to handle 100 m/s horizontal combined with 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015310 m/s vertical. (Yes, 10 m/s vertical should mostly involve some unplanned rapid disassembly, and it typically does.) I have no doubt that people may find ways to abuse the high tolerance of the landing gear, but that is almost entirely irrelevant; all that matters is that they work for the normal use cases on planes and that too violent a landing still results in some form of destruction. I don\u0027t see any real problems arising from those numbers, but I can see some likely problems from lowering them.\n\nBottom line: it is cheating to abuse the plane landing gear for unrealistic survival, but cheating is not wrong in this type of game. Cheat if you want to, just please don\u0027t deny obvious cases of cheating (which includes any time that you take significant advantage of some behaviour in a way that is quite clearly not the intended use cases)."},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T02:21:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You guys realize you\u0027re talking about a space game and not a plane flying simulator, right? ... they\u0027re more like sidequests to what this game should be really about: rocketry and space exploration.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Spaceplanes have taken over KSP.\n\nIf you\u0027ve ever seen (or better, read) *The Right Stuff*, high speed/altitude flight has it\u0027s place in rocketry and spaceflight.

No, I do not think we have an urgent need for more landing struts. The number of types of landing gear is entirely irrelevant to that, there is no reason for the number of each to be in any way related. What matters is that we have the necessary choices available to build the types of craft which are \u0022in scope\u0022 for the game. Right now, we\u0027ve got struts for 0.625m, 1.25m, and 2.5m, which is really all we need. Struts for 3.75m don\u0027t really make a whole lot of sense when there is no suitable 3.75m lander engine.\n\nPlane landing gear, on the other hand, we\u0027re actually a bit short of that even after the recent additions. The completely different requirements of planes mean that we really need both long and short versions of each of the main 3 weights; arguably even short, medium, and long.
