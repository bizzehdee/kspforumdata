KSP is more Kerbin SoI Program now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an interesting point. I\u0027m not entirely convinced this is a bad thing, as realistically much of what a space program would do would happen around its home planet. The difficulty with KSP of course is the large difference between the timescale of interplanetary operations and local space operations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027d love a serious space program mode, where time is important. Done well, periodic budget, travel times, and launch windows cause you to both take interplanetary exploration more slowly and seriously, and spread out the timing of your local endeavours more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u0027course, it could get boring if there still wasn\u0027t much to do during you stay on the other planets...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022 data-cite=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think the problem with interplanetary can be solved with a mission planner that makes nodes for you. I have a feeling this is going to be called cheating but it is what happens in real life, a space agency is huge and some tasks are handed to different departments. .\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo it for me? No thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGive me access to that department and the data/launch window calendars it has made? Yes please.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission planning tools in the mission control building would be awesome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt bare minimum, it could have a map view which allows you to warp forward and backward, \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(without really warping in game,)\u003C/span\u003E set up maneuver nodes, then later load your pre-prepared nodes once actually flying. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EI imagine you\u0027d have you get into the right orbit first before the game would let you load that, otherwise all your nodes would be messed up.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
