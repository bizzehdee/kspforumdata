I have experienced no game-crippling bugs, and nothing that has really required me to restart the app (I\u2019ve only had one \u201Cunexpected error\u201D occur, closing out the game), but nothing significant. The only bug that I\u2019ve really noticed is how you sometimes don\u2019t get credited with a trophy you\u2019ve earned... for example, I just orbited Moho, but didn\u2019t get the trophy for visiting the planet..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdmittedly, the controller controls take a LOT to get used to, and there\u00A0are a lot of \u201Chidden\u201D controls... and since it\u2019s a pc port, that relies on a\u00A0keyboard and mouse, you can really tell. Also, console\u00A0part limit is about 100 before you get crazy frame rate drops, but this is a technical limitation and not a bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m curious, what bugs are you referring to?
