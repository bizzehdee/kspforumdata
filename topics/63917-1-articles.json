So no matter how good your system is it\u0027s limited to 32 bit specs. Meaning 4GB-ish of RAM for starters. So depending on what else you have going on with your comp at the time it could be just hitting that ceiling and crashing. KSP just tends to fall over sideways when you put hundreds of parts into a single vessel. This is why I tend to keep my craft under 100 parts to keep the processing bottleneck in check.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
