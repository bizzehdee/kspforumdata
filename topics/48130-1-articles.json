That may be throwing your balance and drag off just enough to produce the unwanted effects. You might want to rearrange all radial mounted hardware to allow for a straight climb down. I actually go further in my designs. I place ladders in 3 symmetry to ensure more balance, but most people here probably would just use the one ladder, properly placed relative to the capsule hand holds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-12T16:42:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2013 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dispatcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ebalance \u0026amp; drag\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T16:41:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, who let the Kraken in?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kendfrey","CreatedById":85449,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T16:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see no way possible that those ladders could be the cause. They don\u0027t change the centre of mass much, and the ship flips over in a different direction. It spins as though the left engine (on the picture) is stronger. Exactly along the pitch axis.

They\u0027ll balance better than a half-collar of horizontal ones, and Kerbals can move sideways across ladders just fine. Eightfold symmetry should do the trick. Also, be sure that if you\u0027re using MechJeb that you install the AR202 unit parallel to the axis of thrust and pointed upwards.
