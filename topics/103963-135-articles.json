I\u0027ve been playing this game for 3 years off and on, lurked on the forums on a regular basis the whole time without ever posting anything. You\u0027ve truly taken this game to a whole new level graphically. It would have been incredibly hard to imagine KSP ever looking this good when I first started. It\u0027s amazing what a proper atmosphere, oceans, shadows, flares, eclipses, and godrays have added to the experience. I think you\u0027ve changed everyones expectations of what KSP can be and I hope Squad takes notice, as you deserve some serious credit for the work you\u0027ve done adapting Proland to this.   \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I can\u0027t wait to see the updates you continue to put out.
