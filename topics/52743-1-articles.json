I have struts between the bottom stages and the payload, I have struts on my lander engines and my capsule, I have struts. Struts... struts, struts, struts! How can I make launching a pleasurable experience as I used to have with my mods?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind regards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANWRocketMan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T19:23:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) With a 1.2 TWR on liftoff and a 4% payload fraction, you can get stuff into orbit with one stage. Pretty much the same goes no matter what kind of rocket you\u0027re building - though it\u0027s 8% payload fraction and around 1.5 TWR for onion staging, 15% payload fraction and 1.6-1.7 TWR for asparagus. Basically, build your payload first, then put it put on the pad without a booster. Go to the map screen and get the mass, then go back to the VAB and start designing the booster around what you discovered. Keep the gee meter right at the top of the green meter as you go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample - say you\u0027ve got a thirty tonne payload. If you wanted to launch it on an SSTO rocket, you\u0027d need something that had a mass of around 750 tonnes (30/.04 = 750). You know automatically that you need a launch thrust of 8829 kN or so (750 * 1.2 * 9.81 = 8829), so six Mainsails. Six mainsails weigh 36 tonnes, your payload\u0027s thirty, from 750 tonnes that leaves 684 tonnes (750-36-30 = 684), which you then divide into seven stacks (a centerline and six outboard, the engines would go outboard and you\u0027d run fuel lines from the center to outboard); each stach would therefore need 97.7 tonnes of fuel. That\u0027s two orange tanks, an X200-32, and an X200-16 in each stack. Add whatever other accouterments you\u0027d like (RCS and a probe core for deorbiting, winglets, nose cones, etc). Oughta do the trick. You can generally build simple SSTO boosters for payloads up to about 45 tonnes; after that they get complex. Flying them requires you to adjust the throttle downward as you go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing to consider - if you want to do a staged rocket, try to have each subsequent stage up progressively add a greater fraction of the total 4550 delta-V to orbit requirement. I go with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 stage: 1/1 (all 4550 there)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 stage: 1/3 in the first stage, 2/3 in the second\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 stage: 1/6 in the first stage, 1/3 in the second, 1/2 in the third\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 stage: 1/10 in the first stage, 1/5 in the second, 3/10 in the third, 2/5 in the fourth\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso helps to consider for purposes of building boosters that the full mass of almost every liquid fuel tank in KSP (with the exception of the Oscar-B and Round-8) is exactly nine times its dry mass. When using Tsiolkovsky, you can add the \u0022dead mass\u0022 to both the M and Md parts of the equation, and then substitute M=9Md and run it backwards. Be sure to add your engine mass and decoupler mass to the deadmass of any subsequent stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) What\u0027s your launch TWR? If it\u0027s above 2.2 (i.e. the gee meter jumps up above the green area the moment you hit the space bar), throttle back - you\u0027ve got too much thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might also try putting launch clamps on the booster - they\u0027ve become increasingly necessary in 0.22.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then you might also want to put your engines into the ground in the VAB; the game will automatically adjust them to ground level for the launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-11T19:38:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2013 07:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T20:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ANWRocketMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ANWRocketMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebesides some essential tools such as Kerbal Engineer, Enhanced Navball \u002B Docking Indicator and Editor Tools\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat doesn\u0027t count as playing stock.

So building what you consider a nice rocket is like trying to breed a fish to have shape of a bird. You may succeed but it will probably suffer a lot of problems from the shape not suited for its environment. Fish are beautiful, too, if you don\u0027t expect them to look like birds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also trying to force my KSP rockets into real-life shapes when I started playing. Since then I learned to appreciate beauty of conquering the game physics instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best you can do is to fasten parts of your rockets together with struts in a way which will not break the shape. Stacked tanks can be strutted together in a way which does not stand out - just pull struts just next to the edge of one tank to just next to the edge of the other tank and it will become much less wobbly. You can find an example in the picture below where the payload is long and thin and I did not suffer any problems lifting it. Notice struts right at tank edges, lower ones are placed with 6-fold symmetry for greater strength, upper ones at 4-fold symmetry to make it easier on part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important thing is correct ascent. When getting to orbit, you need to burn as close to prograde as possible and avoid sudden turns. People in KSP often ascend to 10 km, then turn right at 45 degrees. If a real rocket did that, it\u0027d snap in half.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bf5prO1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bf5prO1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepants","CreatedById":74088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T17:56:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ANWRocketMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ANWRocketMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQuestion #1: The delta-v...

Build small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, ultimately I think everybody\u0027s goal is to get huge stuff into space, but in my opinion the smaller the better. It took me a while to figure out that you can go to the moon and back, for instance, in only three stages, without using any of the \u0022big\u0022 tanks or engines. The problem I suffered when getting started, and the problem I think a lot of new players suffer, is that we think the solution is more fuel and more engines. That\u0027s part if it, but it\u0027s the part with quickly diminishing returns. If you can build a small rocket, you can get into space. After you\u0027ve done that 100 times, then magically, getting larger rockets into space will be easier, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, watch youtube videos of skilled players (OperationDX is my favorite, Scott Manley is also popular). Even if you don\u0027t copy their designs, you will learn from them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you\u0027re using Kerbal Engineer, you might research how much dV you need and experiment with different designs that give you that amount. You will almost always find it easier to give small rockets the necessary dV than larger ones. And remember, stage-relative dV matters. If you have 100dV in your first stage and 10,000dV in your last, you probably won\u0027t get to space.
