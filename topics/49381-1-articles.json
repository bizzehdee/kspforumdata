I have a strange problem that I can\u0027t decide if it\u0027s a bug or if I did something wrong somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy craft has five LV-909 engines, each below a FL-T800 fuel tank. One of the five is in the center, and the others are arranged in a \u002B shape around the center engine. I\u0027ll call them North, South, East, and West.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorth has a fuel line pointed at East.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESouth has a fuel line pointed at West.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEast and West have fuel lines pointed at Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, a standard small asparagus staging setup. I\u0027ve done it a hundred times or more, never had trouble until now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I throttle up the engines, the fuel in the North tank is consumed at a faster rate than the fuel in the South tank, leading to a weight imbalance and my craft starts tumbling. After shutting off the engines to figure out what\u0027s going wrong, I examine the fuel levels in each tank and find that the center, east, and west tanks are all full (as they should be, since I didn\u0027t burn very long) and the north and south tanks are both partially used, but NOT by the same amount. North is significantly emptier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll five engines appear to be burning, it\u0027s not like one of them is turned off or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anything I could possibly have done wrong to cause this behavior, or does it seem like a bug? Has anyone else run into this kind of problem with .22?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have only one mod installed, it\u0027s the chatterer mod that adds background radio transmission noises to the game.
