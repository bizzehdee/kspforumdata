However ingame i encounter this error:\n\n- It seem like the collision mesh i shrinked correctly also the attach nodes are correctly replaced but the Texture part of the part is still bigger.\n\n![blender.png](http://s15.postimg.org/edte8sjaz/blender.png)\n\n![screenshot96.png](http://s16.postimg.org/n7mi3ru03/screenshot96.png)\n\nIn the picture on the right side is the \u0022smaller part\u0022 on the left is the real mk3 monoprop tank. The clipping part is the new real size of the part.\n\nHow can i make it smaller so it is smaller ingame ?\n\nThanks for the help !\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T09:07:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 09:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ManuxKerb**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T01:58:29Z","Content":"I don\u0027t understand the problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Ven","CreatedById":109931,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T07:17:16Z","Content":"Are you using Module Manager to add these new tanks?
