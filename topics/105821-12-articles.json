I do see two mods messing with RPM textures - although it looks like Texture Replacer is probably benign. However, Filter Extensions renames some textures. I\u0027d suggest removing Filter Extensions, and see if that fixes the problem; if not, remove Texture Replacer and see if that fixes it. If neither of those steps fix the problem, please post logs that include going into Flight (even if it\u0027s an RPM-enabled pod on the launch pad), so I can see what RPM is saying when it needs to configure the props for use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vixr","CreatedById":133940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T17:33:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MOARdV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MOARdV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E ...I do see two mods messing with RPM textures - although it looks like Texture Replacer is probably benign...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running Texture replacer for epic suits and RPM is working perfectly, dont know about the other mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
