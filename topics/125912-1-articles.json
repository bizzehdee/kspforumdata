For our inaugural test of this new tech we\u0026#39;ll be launching a sounding rocket out over the Kerblantic. Click the image to head over the the craft page, which will auto-update through the whole process. Just sit back and watch! Please consider opting in to the post-launch survey - even if you don\u0026#39;t want to answer any questions it is also filled with debug data that would be very useful. If this turns out to be something people are interested in, this thread will be redone to include all launch streams moving forward.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you miss the launch live stream, [URL=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/Flights/crafttest.asp?db=sndrocket5-5\u0026ut=55427700\u0026survey=true\u0022]this link[/URL] will take you back to the archive mode once the launch has completed.\n"}]}
