I know they are a unity feature but I read somewhere that they require dx11 and KSP runs on dx9, also I\u0027d assume they require some kind of loader like regular shaders but I don\u0027t see any constructors for putting them together out of text.\n\nDoes anyone here have any experience with compute shaders in KSP?"}]}
