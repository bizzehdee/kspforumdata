One of the three. Maybe even depending on who\u0027s who.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E No, not really. Derpiness as in retardation (for the mods - ......: a slowness or limitation in intellectual understanding and awareness, emotional development, academic progress, etc.).\n\nAgain, a trait which all Kerbals share. Except some of them are geniuses in their specific area of research. For instance, even Bill, who\u0027s so stupid he just keeps walking into walls and doesn\u0027t quite understand why he stopped moving forwards, he\u0027s great at engineering. But Bob is a genius. He knows how to use beakers and science instruments and he can even figure out why walls stop him! But when you try and pit him against trees, he\u0027ll run away screaming that \u0022we\u0027ve been invaded!!!\u0022 Jeb meanwhile is truly badS at piloting, flying, jetpacking, fighting, and being a badass, but he really can not see danger when danger is obvious. A rocket with moar boosters but no struts? He\u0027s the first one aboard!\n\nJeb is derpy in intellectual understanding.\n\nBill is derpy in awareness.\n\nBob is derpy in emotional development.\n\nValentina therefore is probably derpy in academic progress.\n\nValentina knows things. She knows how to tie a shoe, for instance, something that has baffled every single Kerbal engineer and scientist that she\u0027s met. She knows how to fold that one really really cool paper airplane that flies really far. She knows how to catch and fry a candied cockroach with her bare hands (and a grill). But she doesn\u0027t know what F=M/A or E=MC^2 means. She never paid attention. She can fly a rocket into space just as you tell her, fly it back down, and she\u0027ll know how orbital mechanics works intuitively. But, she still has no idea what delta-v means, or any of the math behind orbits whatsoever.\n\nMy guess for Val\u0027s stats:\n\nBadS=True\n\nCourage=70%\n\nStupidity=50%\n\nProfession=Pilot\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T14:18:03Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T14:11:47Z","Content":"Perhaps we shouldn\u0027t define Valentina\u0027s personality in terms of how she reacts to male kerbals\u0027 attention."},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T14:18:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps we shouldn\u0027t define Valentina\u0027s personality in terms of how she reacts to male kerbals\u0027 attention.\n\nWhich really begs the question..
