The idea is that the tanks will allow surface attachment so, you can essentially expand on a 1.25m part. Using 8 times symmetry you\u0027ll end up with an octagon to give small landers and such a less cylindrical shape. I\u0027ll have to set up the node_attach correctly so that two sets of 4x symmetry is possible or attaching other parts in symmetry mode will not work well.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like this framework idea. It suggests the possibility of other part types using the same frame, so you could have say, 4 fuel tanks, 2 batteries, and 2 of something else and they would all fit together nicely. As for the space in the middle, maybe some kind of label, like a flammable or toxic liquids warning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECpt.
