If so, then your problem is aerodynamics, not MJ. As speed increases during ascent, the wings on top produce more and more asymmetrical lift, and also drag at the front instead of the back. This pretty much always results in tumbling rockets unless you put even bigger wings on the lifter to overpower those on the nose, plus beaucoup torque and RCS to then force this over-stabilized machine onto the desired path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually easiest to do VTOHL with 2 identical planes, one on each side of the rocket, so their lift cancel out. And put them at the bottom of the rocket so they act as the rocket\u0027s tail fins during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/photos/39416639@N02/17727503938/in/album-72157652773078908/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.flickr.com/photos/39416639@N02/17727503938/in/album-72157652773078908/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T14:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s just a wobbly rocket, then you can reduce the gimbal authority of the engines of that stage by tweaking them in the VAB.
