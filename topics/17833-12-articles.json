I wrote the configs for MechJeb and RemoteTech for All (which also includes Engineer and Protractor for all). I first wrote them leaving [ModuleCommand] in the configs and splitting the electric resource between the crew=0 remote control requirement for ModuleCommand and between the [ModuleRemoteTechSPU]. In the latest update, I removed the ModuleCommand from the stock probe configs and use just ModuleRemoteTechSPU. MechJeb and Protractor are still showing up but the build engineer won\u0027t show up even though it\u0027s defined in the cfg. The flight engineer shows up though. There must be a check for ModuleCommand in the build engineer. Would you remove this check? I want to include Engineer in my popular add-on because it\u0027s still the only way to get delta-v info for other planets/moons. MechJeb doesn\u0027t cut it. But compared to the extra clutter (and CPU \u0026amp; memory, I\u0027m sure) from having both ModuleCommand and ModuleRemoteTechSPU on a part, MechJeb will have to do. You can test this using the Module Compatibility add-on for RemoteTech1. It removes ModuleCommand from all the probes and adds ModuleRemoteTechSPU.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoctorJon","CreatedById":81593,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T01:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found a strange occurrence while using both Engineer and Ferram.
