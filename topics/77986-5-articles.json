After a few of the miners tried to eat some becoming deathly sick in the process, it was names Acktonium from the sound of \u0022Ack, that is not a snack.\u0022 followed by vomiting and all sorts of other unspeakable noises.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAcktonium was later looked at by Kerbal scientists who had plenty of snack on hand, and was found to not only react bady with Kerbal physiology but was also unstable releasing particles and slowly breaking down into other elements. When concentrated the Acktonium would also generate a lot of heat, unfortunately the research center was lost when the material went critical as the scientists were busy making smores. But there are always more Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReactor Core: The reactor core unit does not hold any Acktonium, instead it acts as a central control and power generating mechanism. The core unit Has nodes for the placement of Acktonium Reactor Chambers or ARC\u0027s. The amount of power that the core can generate is directly related to the number and type of ARC\u0027s attached to it. But a reactor core is limited in the number of ARC units it can hold, smaller units only holding one while larger units can hold many more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAcktonium Reactor Chamber: The ARC is a self contained modular reactor that has Acktonium in it. ARC units range in capacity from 25 to 100 energy per second based on the Core they are mounted to. The ARC came about when Jeb saw the research and hazards that Acktonium presented. Seeing that this material was too tempting to took some Coffee cans, tubing, some shielding, and made the ARC to keep it out of his own mouth. Later his designs were purchased by Icky Things Inc. and mass produced as a safe and reliable power solution no Kerbal could eat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EARC\u0027s are mounted to the Reactor Core radially. The Acktonium in the ARC is guaranteed to be good for a year of continuous operation. After that time the Acktonium is inert and useless. Fortunately while not in use, Acktonium will not decay. ARC\u0027s can thusly be used all at once or one unit at a time depending on the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ARC\u0027s can also be replaced in flight through the use of an EVA. The spent ARC can be easily removed and a new one installed due to a recent innovation in the design...handles. Spent units can be placed into an ARC Processor to have the Acktonium replaced and the ARC restored to operation...assuming you have mined the Acktonium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EARC Processor: This module, while large (2.5m\u002B form factor) is a one stop shop for refining Acktonium and putting it into ARC units. It needs a good amount of power to operate, but given the lifespan of an ARC unit while in use, it is worth it to keep ARC\u0027s running without having to wait months for a new shipment so you can make your popcorn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EColonial Facility: The Acktonium Power Facility is a second generation colonial structure that takes Acktonium and produces power at a higher efficiency than the Power Distribution Module. It requires a constant flow of Acktonium, but will provide a base with a supply of energy for much of its needs. the APF is useless without a large amount of Acktonium, so it is only recommended that it be used after suitable drilling operation have commenced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI Admit it, I am an idea (explative)...any one that wants them can have them for a can of Dr. Pepper...I am so ashamed!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-16T03:44:45Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2014 03:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SyberSmoke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T21:59:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Deployable Solar Panel part for the Hex Truss is ready to launch.
