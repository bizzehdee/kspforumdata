I changed the 2m-1.75m adapter to allow side attachments. (change the attachrules to 1,0,1,1,0). There\u0027s a 1 pixel wide sweet spot that has just the small gap as seen, I also used some struts to hold them together at the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso these guys have custom items that won\u0027t load on your machines with just the .craft files. I posted the 1.75m SRBs in Nova\u0027s main SIDR thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made some retexts of the main long 1.75m tanks, short 1.75m tank, and 1.75m decoupler to kinda-sorta resemble some of the historical US rockets. Some are also posted in the SIDR thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you find the big boosters, only fire them in pairs. I fire the bottom two plus the main engines, then the top two, then eject the side pods when they are out. Firing all 4 at once tends to break things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have also noticed the big yellow ball at the bottom of the cargo section. Based on a comment by HarvesteR I added a \u0027, 2\u0027 to the end of the attach nodes that would be 1.75 or 2m in size and a \u0027, 3\u0027 to all the nodes that would be 3m. It changes the size and color of the attach node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxDamage","CreatedById":1257,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-21T17:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eah yeah I noticed that yellow ball and wondered what it was. too bad about them not loading on somebody elses machine, they still look awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andras","CreatedById":3716,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-22T06:28:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a legal workaround for the cargo shell. If you use Sunday\\\u0027s long 1m decoupler at the bottom of the command/pusher stage you can side attach the cargo shell to it.
