Many career saves die to version changes and deciding to un/install certain mods so it would be better to make the requirement simply having access to the largest rocket parts, which is far more reasonable and makes sense for heavy launch mass contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d suggest that you implement launchpads and resource production in these bases so they have a more appealing function and that you continue having contracts to send kerbals to those bases and back. A closed arcology doesn\u0027t make sense until they declare independence (which ultimately requires several million of a population to be a reasonable pursuit, but would be a very fun mechanic especially if they spawn giant enemy crabs around their territory to shoot at).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would be an interesting way of bringing KSP 2 to KSP 1 and I am interested.
