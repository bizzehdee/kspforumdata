Well I\u0027ve had to cut back recently as I just started college again(going for my Master\u0027s degree, so it\u0027s hectic), and trying to juggle that and a full time job, I don\u0027t have much time for doing things like this. However, I thought I\u0027d share the progress I\u0027ve made on the S0 Truss just for kicks. This was about an hour and a half of work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UUrfAvE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UUrfAvE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll notice that it\u0027s still missing a lot. I\u0027m still working on modelling the bits and pieces. You see the four pin-looking things sticking out of the top and bottom? Those are grapple fixtures for the Space Shuttle\u0027s Canadarm(not to be confused with the ISS\u0027s Canadarm2), and for full functionality they should be a separate part, though it doesn\u0027t really matter until someone makes a proper Canadarm(I have ideas for how it could work, as I stated previously). You\u0027ll also notice the rail sticking out. That could also be a separate piece, used as a gantry rail for the mobile base system that will hopefully be added in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still coming up with ideas. I know that the trusses were attached via tiny magnet hooks, and then secured later. I was thinking of doing a system like that for the docking ports, though as you can see they haven\u0027t been modeled yet. The grapple fixture for attaching the S0 Truss to the Destiny Lab is also a hook, so it will be a challenge making it universal(because lower part counts are a plus). I think that perhaps the magnet hook and the magnet clamp will be two separate, small pieces that will be used for docking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"actieveling","CreatedById":18708,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T11:23:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope the awesome modders behind this pack are re-releasing this pack for .23, My machine always got a bit laggy when building this monster \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I hope with some texture improvements and the improvements the devs made for .23 this mod will be more awesome(less laggy) then it ever was.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spooks","CreatedById":68403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T15:22:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022actieveling\u0022 data-cite=\u0022actieveling\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI hope the awesome modders behind this pack are re-releasing this pack for .23, My machine always got a bit laggy when building this monster \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I hope with some texture improvements and the improvements the devs made for .23 this mod will be more awesome(less laggy) then it ever was.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you remove the japanees models from the frond the 2 on the right and it wil stop lagging\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T15:24:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 03:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spooks\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T17:06:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could also try deploying JEM-EF.
