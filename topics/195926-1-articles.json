What you think, the design is feasible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nMy idea is a cheap spaceship with electric propulsion (low thrust, high delta-v) which could be used as a probe or small (tens of tonns) cargo hauler. The ship contains few\u00A0parts connected with 1mm steel\u002Bcopper cables - two propulsion modules (can be more than two, connected in triange/square/etc shape) and large solar panel array (flexible panels or multiple small panels with flexible connections between). Basically, it is hammock in space. :) After launch - propulsion modules slowly position themselves at predefined distance between, rotate panels so they get maximum power and start accelerating with same acceleration, constantly checking distance/orientation. Since acceleration is quite low - stress to panels will be minimal. Modern microcontrollers shouldn\u0027t have any problem to keep modules in correct formation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nEeach propulsion module weight 2-3 tonns (without propellant) has:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nVASIMR engine VX-200 (200kW power, 5N thrust, 5000 Isp)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\n8 small ion engines used for precise orientation\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\n10 tonns propellant tank\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nRotation mechanism for the\u00A0array\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nSome rechargable batteries for ion engines and a control system with cameras/laser rangefinder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nSolar panel array has 4000 m2 (20mx200m) of solar panels for 400kW electrict output, weights 10 tonns\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nSteel\u002Bcopper cable 1mm diameter (used to carry panels and for transferring power to propulsion modules), weights 2 tonns\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nThis ship will able to carry up up to 40 tonns load (loaded on top of propulsion modules in two 20x tonns chunks), dry weight 18 tonns, loaded with propellant - 38 tonns. Delta-V without load - 36 km/s, with full load - 14.5km/s, enough to travel to Mars (without load - doesn\u0027t need any launching window even) and back. Since thrust is very small, acceleration and capture burns will be very long (weeks or even months). Travels to Venus or Mercury will be more efficient as there is more sunlight and VASIMR engine can use more power to give better Isp. The ship can be launched by something like Falcon Heavy to LEO (folded like scroll for 2x modules version or like origami for other versions).

We\u00A0can even start rotate whole ship during non-thrust time, so modules will be pushed in opposite direction by centrifugal force (available power will be much less but still a lot to keep ship working). That\u00A0will save ion engines propellant and power but requires good mass balancing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMass budget is pretty conservative (4000m2 panels may weight under 7 tonns even, array may be arranged in 40x100m shape to lower stretching and reduce cable length, etc), so a lot of room to improve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-28T16:38:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2020 04:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by vasimv\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
