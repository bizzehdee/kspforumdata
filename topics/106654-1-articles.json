However, I am running into problems regarding fuel crossfeed. No matter what I do, the tanks from the detachable SpaceShipTwo are feeding into the engines of the carrier WhiteKnightTwo, so that by the time I\u0027m ready to detach and burn to space with SpaceShipTwo, half of my liquid fuel is gone. I have no fuel lines on the entire ship. Anyone know how to stop the tanks from crossfeeding to the engines? (I\u0027m not going to completely turn off the tanks, as that would make the second stage fail.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:07:53Z","Content":"There are a few parts that block crossfeed; structural panels are one of them. Insert a 1x1 panel everywhere the two ships connect and that should solve the problem. I have not done this personally but I saw a Twitch streamer pre-1.0 release doing this to make his replica space shuttle feed only from the external tank and not his orbiter\u0027s internal fuel supply."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:07:57Z","Content":"What you can do is use a fuel line going from the carrier to space ship 2. This would force fuel to flow into space ship two."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:22:07Z","Content":"Jets ignore any kind of blockage to crossfeed though, because they use STAGE\\_PRIORITY\\_FLOW (aka \u0022all\\_vessel, sorted by stage\u0022."}]}
