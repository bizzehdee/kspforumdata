As stated, negative mass did not cause any particular change, while negative friction had an unintended side effect. While it was utterly useless for providing lift above 35KM, it did have a few amusing and one potentially useful side effect. One of the side effect, the useful one, is that if you started going really horizontal, you would eventually accelerate to escape velocity, which means in theory if we could change drag mid-air (possibly with the help of the chute), we could make a device which would allow an easy 35KM orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other side effect, more amusing this one, is that while it DID slingshot you out of the planet, the reverse was also true.

However, this alone is still not fully sufficient, as it would still cause a divergent situation at low AOA until the (presumably interpolated) drag value crossed the zero mark. To make up for this, I\u0027d probably look into using the winglet module instead and adding some degree of lift to pull the net-force vector back to (or at least close to) the centerline of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Also, drag IS a vector.
