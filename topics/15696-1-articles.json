Designed with the latest in Kerbal safety and environmentally sound principals, the Pulsar1 is a stage-and-a-half design that will guarantee your Kerbal\\\u0027s safety and the safety of future kerbalnauts by ensuring a minimum of orbital debris every launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESafety systems include multiple parachute braking systems in case of brake failure, and an ejectable cockpit module in case of de-orbit problems causing you to miss land entirely. Your Kerbal will be safe no matter if you are forced to land away from the runway and end up on land or in the water!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur first craft, the Pulsar1 is designed for low-orbit missions only, but we are working on the next generation which will allow for routine exploration to outer space whilst guaranteeing safety for our kerbalnauts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy, and please, we are open to comments and improvement suggestions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
