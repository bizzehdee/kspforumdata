However it\u0027s what happened after is my issue. I could enter one building but never leave, after browsing the forums I discovered Claw\u0027s fix of modifying my persistent files so that conflicts can\u0027t occur. I did this however it only partially worked. I can enter the Kerbal lounge, and only the kerbal lounge. I can exit it, but when I do I get stuck in KSC and I can\u0027t quit to main menu or select any menu options. This is after a fresh install with a changed .sfs \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be greatly appreciated. It\u0027d suck to go from doing what I want to be doing, which is designing using and modifying SSTOs into something useful apart from a bus system into LKO, to having to do another fresh install and start again and get those ....... upgrades to the VAB and SPH which make them meaningful (This run-through I had every science object researched with ~2500 science and was still knocking about 750,000 monies).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seaview123","CreatedById":130421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T16:43:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m with you, man.
