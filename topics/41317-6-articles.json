I can see several benefits to that, the main one being a greater tactical depth. A few examples :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No need for artificial rules like \u0022use one craft at a time, in the order of their weight\u0022 or \u0022target only one thing\u0022. Just do whatever you have the time to do. You think you need the firepower of a capital ship ? Go ahead and maneuver it into position but you probably won\u0027t have the time to do anything else. Need to fight on several fronts at a time ? Use your fast and nimble fighters. You can surely pilot several of them in one turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You can choose to let your precious carrier away from the battle to ensure it\u0027s safety. But that means your fighters will have to travel longer and will not be able to join the battle, deliver their payload and get back to the ship in one turn. It also makes re-fitting / repairing (docking your front and aft section back together after the middle one exploded) in combat less \u0022over-powered\u0022 since doing so will likely cost you a turn. You can also plan ahead more efficiently as you know how many time will pass before your next turn, and therefore where the fighter you left drifting will be when you get to play again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If the fleets start away from each other, pre-engagement maneuvers will now mean something ... as they will finally exist. The player who gets the first turn may not be able to reach the enemy fleet and one-hit-kill a capital ship with its fighter before the other player can react. It also means fleeing / kitting / guerrilla tactics becomes real things as slow ships won\u0027t be able to catch up on fast an nimble ones anymore as they won\u0027t have all the time they want to perform an intercept before their prey can play again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It brings stress and human error into the equation a lot more. If the fight is going badly for you, you will probably want to do as much as you can in one turn and are more prone to commit an error while rushing a maneuver. Or you can fail to see a move your opponent is slowly pulling out because you are blinded by the few distractions he keeps throwing at you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Reinforcements. A backup fleet on it\u0027s way to save your day but you will have to survive long enough to see it. It is an interesting engagement scenario but is more or less impossible right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you get the idea by now. This system would make time a thing to consider and to play with. And as a consequence it makes distance a meaningful data too. It promotes different playstyles ans offer more choices to the player. It also diminish the number of additional rules needed. Who cares a given ship is too big to be considered a fighter and cannot play first ? It\u0027s potentially better firepower is offset by the fact that is is slower and thus less \u0022time-efficient\u0022. Hell, why couldn\u0027t I just decide to take my first tun with my heavy cruiser and try to severely cripple some high priority targets, so that they would then be more vulnerable to the light weaponry of my fighters ? Again choices, tactical depth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is how it could work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Once the battle is ready to begin (the players agreed on the fleets, the place, the victory/defeat conditions, ramming or not ...), MET is set back to 0 via save editing, the players decide how long a turn will last as well as an \u0022inter-turn\u0022. The file is given to the first player, he has the time of an \u0022inter-turn\u0022 (let\u0027s say 30 seconds for this example) to select his ship, get his bearings and whatnot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - When the 30s are elapsed he can do whatever he has decided to do during this turn (let\u0027s say 3 minutes). At the end of it, he quicksaves. The MET is now 3 min and 30 seconds (approximately, the inter-turn is there to serve as a \u0022buffer-zone\u0022 for the small errors). The first player can proceed to take after-action screenshot freely as the second player will just reload the quicksave to go back in time afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - The second player gets the files, loads the quicksave and has until the MET reaches 4 min to get ready, then he plays, quicksaves and gives the save back. And so on until the game is over.Tell me what you think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also thought of another rule concerning civilian/support ships. Basically, my idea is to disallow a player to engage a civilian/support ship (designated as such before the fight) if an escort ship is less than 1km away from it. The idea behind it is to render escort tasks possible in a turn-by-turn system because right now, nothing prevents you to hit a target at will even if there are 50 fighters near it since they are \u0022inactive\u0022 until you\u0027re done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill on the topic of rules, I want to say that the need of a nearby controlling ship for using smart torpedoes and unmanned ship seems a fair and good rule to me, even if it is not the more \u0022realistic\u0022 one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly I want to say that I really appreciate camulus videos and that I love how a little community has built a \u0022game in the game\u0022 and keeps making it better everyday. I am clearly not really a vocal member of the forum but I spend a fair amount of time reading it and I am always amazed by those threads that retrace battles or showcase amazing starships.

It might be nice to add a probe control unit to the missile to slightly improve aim, but since you can\u0027t kill the engine you only get one shot and less range. Alternately any missile can be launched in one turn (perhaps only under a certain range) but can\u0027t be guided in. A player would launch the missile, rotate the missile as he thought necessary to properly aim it, and then would engage the throttle and engine, but would not be able to control or adjust it\u0027s flight path after activating the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way there would not be an unbalanced advantage when launching a guided missile from far away as it would still require two turns giving the opponent a turn to attempt to move and evade or intercept, but would also allow guided missile ships some means of defense if they were fighting in close rather than the waiting two turns to score a hit.

I am so in - work and school permitting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy two cents on stealth and scouting in RL space - though complete stealth is impossible practical measures for limiting the information the enemy has ... or falsifying intelligence - are possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can mange energy emisions, spoofing other ship types and even classes. You can eliminate waste heat asymetrically and appear like something or someone else. You could even shed energy is wavelengths that are noisy. So against a large patch of sky that is bright at deep infrared it is possible to shift waste heat to blend in to that patch ... the universe is noisy in many ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing to remember, which some here have, is that detection has its limits. There is no sensor system that scans cubic light years of space ... the ones we have do it a small slice at a time and the resolution is cruddy at best. Massive telescope arrays completely and utterly fail to detect well understood types of natural objects unless they are huge, bright, etc. Furthermore the mountain of data generated by our sky searches today loterally takes decades to analyse in a proper fashion. If astronmers have an idea of what to look for then maybe tbey might shrink a survey to months in duration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo scouting would be very important and stealth a very real strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spaceflighters are useless fellow everyone quotes is dealing in scenarios of ideal technology ... and he will probably be correct in a few centuries or millenia.

We already cool things in space to near absolute zero for purposes of shrouding IR detectors from interference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus you don\u0027t need to have such an extereme solution, because space is radically different depending on where you look.

Truth be told we have no idea what it is going to be like or what technology will be implemented. They mention shielding in future ships but if we ever do work out how to manipulate magnetic, or static, fields to the point that we can create a shield of some kind they will not and can not work the way they do in any sci fi movie or show. But they have no problem saying that they will work. Not to mention that lasers are cool and accurate and all but the power requirements are one hundred times to one thousand times more that a rail gun. So strapping millions of lasers on a ship and saying that they are all powered to the point that they can all be fired off at the same time and each take out a space ships is ridiculous. Your ship would have to be 90% capacitors to fire off a few of them and then they would probably burn out.
