When I go to Space Centre and select my lander / Kerbal - they cannot interact with the moon buggy. Similarly, when I am \u0027in the flight\u0027 of the moon buggy, they cannot interact with the Kerbal or lander - cannot check battery levels, extend ladders and landing gear etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy aim was to get the Kerbal sat on the (remote controlled) moon buggy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://users.aber.ac.uk/mcr1/php/uploading/upload/2013-08-02_00006.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-08-02_00006.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMatt\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nurph","CreatedById":59509,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T21:58:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou must be in direct command of a craft to view resource levels or provide control inputs, but nearby Kerbals can extend solar panels and ladders or use command seats. Based on the picture I think you need to, um.. walk the Kerbal closer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E PS: use bracket keys to switch between crafts [ ]\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
