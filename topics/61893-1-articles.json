For the delta-V equation, one must use the gravitational constant, which for Kerbin is 9.81. When would you change to another celestial body\u0027s gravitational constant? I am assuming when you are within that body\u0027s sphere of influence, but didn\u0027t know if anyone else had thoughts on the subject.

The reason for that is that I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E is impulse you get \u003Cem\u003Eper weight of fuel\u003C/em\u003E. But it\u0027s always weight on Earth/Kerbin. It\u0027s really just a terrible definition that results in that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA better definition, and indeed, what Tsiolkovsky used, is to define impulse per \u003Cem\u003Emass\u003C/em\u003E of propellant. In which case, you end up with I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E measured in m/s instead of seconds. It also ends up being equal to average exhaust velocity. And then you don\u0027t have to carry around a convention constant. Alas, most of formalism on rocketry comes from U.S. engineers, and they have a funky way of dealing with weights, resulting in some weird constants you have to drag around. (Basically, it all comes down to pounds of weight and pounds of mass.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"price.michael79","CreatedById":102458,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T04:12:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe explanation of the Tsiolkovsky equation I found uses effective exhaust velocity, which uses the g conversion factor.
