The GAV blueprints lay in the corner collecting dust for many months until the release of 0.22 where the Heavy tank all of a sudden stopped working. The GAV was reborn as the GAV-2 now equipped with hydra rocket pods and gatling guns. While it may be fast and have considerable firepower it is lightly armoured to keep the weight down to 6.5 tonnes and the part count down to 65. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NV40k5L.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NV40k5L.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGleno-Space created the Destroyer as a means of defending orbital stations from attack. At 192 parts and 75 tonnes it is a force to be reckoned with though still fairly light weight for a capitol ship making it economical as well. The destroyer class O is equipped with 3 Hadies Solid Rocket Torpedos and 8 guided anti fighter torpedos. With 4 nuclear engines to power it this vessel can travel great distances on its own power. The Destroyer Class O can be reloaded once all missiles have been fired thanks to tugs attached to each missile assembly and the craft itself is manned by 3 pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust to weight ratio: 0.6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta V: 3298 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PYypigQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PYypigQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SAF-5 is one of many fighters Gleno-Space has been developing, mainly for station defence.

It has a massive hollow center that will allow you to fit surprisingly large ships inside as well as a launch tube with a functioning mass relay that can boost ships into new orbits (use at your own risk).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/41982944541445302/2B26CC406DFC68D04DBD71F3C44514917D077D1B/\u0022 alt=\u00222B26CC406DFC68D04DBD71F3C44514917D077D1B\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/41982944541448448/E0985B9B1A51106370DC3F1FFEF19F20473723BF/\u0022 alt=\u0022E0985B9B1A51106370DC3F1FFEF19F20473723BF\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, its not the toughest of ships, a well placed I-Beam round could easily destroy it. But still it is massive and could be cool to have as the target of some light fighter attack or something. I can also do some customization work if you want it (How many fighters you want, of what kind, how much ammo, other specialized features, where you want it in orbit). The capsule fighters shown with it are also really nice as they have a pretty good range, good RCS, and are only 16-17 parts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Also thanks for pointing out super happy squid, always nice to have even more KSP to watch, though he is eerily similar to Macy dean during the early days)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-26T16:08:46Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2014 04:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DerpenWolf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Halban","CreatedById":89536,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T16:06:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks awesome but I honestly don\u0027t know what I\u0027d be able to do with it :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WackyMan157","CreatedById":116511,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T16:39:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HatBat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HatBat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt looks awesome but I honestly don\u0027t know what I\u0027d be able to do with it :/\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe have it as another HKA base that GMI blows right out of the sky? :3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Halban","CreatedById":89536,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T16:42:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WackyMan157\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WackyMan157\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe have it as another HKA base that GMI blows right out of the sky? :3\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, I\u0027m leaning towards using this in a cine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
