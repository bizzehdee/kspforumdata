Upon further examination, I noticed that my ailerons were barely even moving. Later, on the ground, I switched the other control surfaces along the wing to roll as well and took a couple of pictures. The problem should be immediately apparent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl surfaces in normal position:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/621843625269502271/FF7CCEE14F154D713B98742FC8ECE33A9A510023/\u0022 alt=\u0022FF7CCEE14F154D713B98742FC8ECE33A9A510023\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl surfaces in roll position:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/621843625269502468/993682AEA800AB22F73B9A535C6A7714FF76678E/\u0022 alt=\u0022993682AEA800AB22F73B9A535C6A7714FF76678E\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe control surfaces have barely moved at all! What\u0027s worse is that the leftmost 2 control surfaces have actually rotated in the opposite direction that they are supposed to (This was later confirmed in flight). It is very possible that this is due to the forward sweep of the wings, which is shown in the picture below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/621843625269502649/275E0B033864B99B64F7B0E751D828AF490F3B13/\u0022 alt=\u0022275E0B033864B99B64F7B0E751D828AF490F3B13\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I bring this post to a close, there are definitely a few concerns some of you might have which I have to address:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I did have a few mods installed when I took those screenshots and first observed the problem, but removing the mods did not solve the issue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The sideways facing pod shown in the SPH picture was not attached in any of the tests, with the kerbal in the command seat. The ailerons actually moved more when the craft was being controlled from the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-In case this was some glitch with controlling from the command seat, I added a forward-facing probe core in the fairing acting as the nosecone of the aircraft. This did not solve my problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I did replace the aileron with several other control surface types, all of which experienced the same problem\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly have no clue why my control surfaces set to roll just aren\u0027t acting correctly. I suspect it to be something with the aerodynamic changes SQUAD made in the most recent update. It would be most helpful if anyone could shed some light on what is going on here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T23:44:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Noname117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T22:11:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust tested, it works perfectly for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd don\u0027t complain about people taking under a day or so to reply.
