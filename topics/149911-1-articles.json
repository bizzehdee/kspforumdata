Make sure your completely updated. If you are, then it could be a few other things. As it means the driver cant communicate with the hardware.. including heat effecting the hardware, or a failing PSU rail. Maybe give the fans a dusting, and see if that helps. Does it still do it if you aren\u0027t running a game? If it\u0027s not driver related, I would assume it\u0027s heat or power.
