I had one PC that had all the best equipment in it that was available at the time... unfortunately it turned out that the memory I used, while being a top rated (and expensive) model just refused to work right with the top rated motherboard. There was just something that caused them to not like one another. Another fact is that games like Fallout 4 will be more graphics intensive than KSP which is actually CPU intensive. So while Fallout 4 will run fine on your PC it could have problems with KSP. Remember, KSP has to do a LOT of physics calculations to do with flight paths that are not needed in something like Fallout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T16:06:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222399257\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131399\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454943415\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212858\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Red Iron Crown said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t consider 1.0 with its reworked aero model and resource system to be significant?

Squad is not a marketing company. some of the people now making KSP were working for a marketing company when they got\u00A0the idea for KSP. They were split off from the marketing company several years ago as their own sub-company. They do not do marketing. Most of the people now working for Squad have never done marketing.

If there was news about Squad splitting, I\u0027ve certainly missed it, and you\u0027re the first time I hear about it. Everything else, including this forum\u0027s footer, reference \u0022Squad S.A. de C.V.\u0022, which I\u0027m pretty sure is the same old company. I mean, sure, I know that it\u0027s a distinct team with distinct tasks and maybe even their own office\u00A0(though even in dev notes not more than a year old I remember mentions of someone helping with the main Squad operation - but it was just once and mentionable, pretty unusual I guess), but \u0022hey, it\u0027s separate companies\u0022 would be significantly bigger than that. Seriously, the only reason not to dismiss what you write out of hand is your mod status.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
