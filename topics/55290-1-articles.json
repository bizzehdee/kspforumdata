So, I would appreciate an explanation, and would enjoy a discussion on this topic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T15:47:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs usual, horrible reporting. What scientists found is another gravity-QM duality. There are actually a few known ones already. And it\u0027s not really surprising, since most of the QM is built on the same symmetry principles as General Relativity, so it\u0027s likely that you\u0027ll find systems in both that behave in dual ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dominatus","CreatedById":76870,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T16:14:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAck. Just read the article again. Cutting through the crap, it made more sense. Why even mention black holes and wormholes if the report is actually on QP\u0027s and further evidence supporting QE? And to mention that \u0022if you were on the edge of one black hole and someone else was on the edge of another, and you looked in, you would not be able to see them\u0022 ... Um, duh?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T17:13:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, that last bit is actually important. It shows that such a wormhole follows the no-communication theorem of the entanglement in Quantum Mechanics. I mean, yeah, it\u0027s obvious, but it\u0027s an important feature, so it\u0027s worth mentioning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dominatus","CreatedById":76870,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T17:34:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, okay then. Actually showed that article to a buddy who\u0027s big on quantum physics- he asked me \u0022what kind of stupid did I just read\u0022. I can see how it\u0027s worth mentioning since it confirms a theory, but as for the rest, seems like the guy doesn\u0027t really understand it. My physics teacher also took a look and agrees.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T17:38:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an article in a popular publication.
