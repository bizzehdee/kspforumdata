Henry Steinbrenner sank in a Lake Superior storm in May of 1953. The ship had been carrying iron ore from Superior Wisconsin across the lake when it was caught in a storm. The vessel\u0027s telescoping hatch covers began to work loose through the night and despite attempts to save the ship it was hopeless. A distress call was issued at 7:30 AM on May 11th and the ship sank stern first shortly after. Out of the 31 crew of the ship 17 would not survive. Survivors were picked up by several nearby ships, the rescue was captured on camera and there are images of survivors waiting in a lifeboat and a raft waiting to be lifted onboard. The main cause of the loss was attributed to the choice to not install tarps on the ships faulty hatches before the storm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wreck was located by two different teams this september at a depth of 230 Meters underwater. The wreck is lying in a field of its own cargo, implying it broke up during its descent and impact. The field of ore makes the wreck hard to distinguish in sonar images. It seems to be badly buried into the mud and much of the cabins seem to be crushed beyond recognition. So far only the stern has been explored, there are plans to return in the future to see what condition the bow is in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022The wreck of a ship in Lake Superior\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.17\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022https://img.apmcdn.org/a1a01f86a1ca1e3f24a7ddb58555e3e9c2760f5d/normal/affcaf-20230926-steinbrenner01-600.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jOCKB4K6y44?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Lake Superior shipwreck found 70 years after sinking\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A view of a shipwreck at the bottom of Lake Superior\u0022 data-ratio=\u002292.45\u0022 width=\u0022861\u0022 src=\u0022https://img.apmcdn.org/fc418dba285904975d54d45a83b519dc99beb41f/uncropped/e1930e-20230926-shipwreck02-861.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
