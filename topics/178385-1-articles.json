The last of the night\u2019s sea breeze carried the iodine smell of the ocean. The updraft from the building carried the ozone-machine oil smell of the interior. The sun had not yet breached the horizon. Only one light remained in the eastern sky. Duna? Eve? Minmus? The sky had never interested him. Science had never interested him. Engineering had never interested him. He had learned them out of the necessity of his job. Only his numbers and tables had ever interested him.\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:115%;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003EThe sun breached the horizon. He looked at the primary Launchpad. He knew its construction cost, its maintenance costs. Its eventual replacement cost. It sat empty. The only reason he could do this. It would be filled in a week. The pad would be filled in a week, another commercial launch. He knew its cost, its design amortization, its revenue. \u003C/font\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:115%;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003EThe sun rose higher.

He knew the cost of what he was about to do.\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:115%;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003EHe lifted his arms straight out from his sides. Would anyone look up? Did anyone look up anymore? Would they see him if they did, or would he be just as invisible as if he was back in his office?

He stood on the edge, only on the balls of his feet. He leaned forward slightly. He felt gravity start to pull him further forward. He felt the breeze feebly try to push him back. He surrendered to gravity. He pushed off as he fell forward.\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:115%;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003EHe slowly rotated forward as he fell. He heard only the sound of the rushing air. He felt only the pull of it against his clothes. This must, almost, be what it is like up there.

He felt the tug of the cord on his ankles. He snapped vertical, his head to the ground. He felt the cord pulling him, slowing him to a halt. For an instant he felt the presence of the tarmac, smelt the spilt lubricants. The elastic in the cord jerked him back up.\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:115%;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003EHe bounced up and down a few times before stopping. He swayed slightly in the turbulent breeze. He sighed and opened his eyes. He looked down ten meters to the ground below. He took the slack out of the line attached to his waist. He gave it a sharp tug. He slowly was lowered to the ground. On the ground he sat up and unhooked his ankles.\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:115%;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003EHe stood and looked at the top of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. He sighed again, another cost. Was it worth it? He walked towards the fire escape on the side. Not according to the tables, the numbers. But in the way that had such things always disquieted him; the way they escaped the numbers and tables; it was.\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
