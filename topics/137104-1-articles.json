I was wondering if someone could make a mod that creates a folder for loading screens. Whenever the game starts, it chooses a random loading screen from the folder. Another request would be to have a folder for loading hints, so we could make our own. Both the loading screens and hints get repetitive over time. And, maybe, the loading screen could be a slideshow of pictures in the loading screen folder. Is such a thing possible with a mod? If so, would someone be willing to make it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
