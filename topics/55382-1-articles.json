You can just take in atmospheric nitrogen, heat it up with your reactor and expel it to produce thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing back to your point about chemical propulsion though, keep in mind that titan actually has higher atmospheric pressure than Earth so the 5% methane is a larger absolute quantity than a 5% proportion on Earth would be. Additionally, you use more oxidiser than fuel by mass, methane burning uses 2.67x more oxygen by mass than methane, which means that with both of these factors accounted for, you can burn methane with oxygen almost as quickly on Titan as you can on Earth. Yes, you have to carry oxygen rather than methane, so you\u0027re carrying the chemical that is both heavier and needed in greater quantity but that part is accounted for by the reduced gravity on Titan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: when you take both Titan\u0027s atmospheric pressure into account and the methane/oxygen combustion mass ratio into account, burning methane in stored oxygen there would be like burning stored methane in a 20% oxygen environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-08T17:56:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2013 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Fractal_UK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T19:48:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the response, Fractal_UK. I\u0027d somehow lost the context of a nuclear jet merely heating the native air (mostly nitrogen in this case) as opposed to combustion to generate thrust. This would work very well at Titan, with its relatively cold environment. In fact, preheating the air might be a necessity anyway, in order to keep engine components from freezing up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, of course the O2 would be carried, rather than fuel; which is why a \u003Cem\u003Ecombustion\u003C/em\u003E jet could be an acceptable method of getting around. I\u0027m pleased that you feel that the density of the air offsets the methane fraction as such.
