After much construction, Burns, Tests, Fails and General Havoc, We finally managed To make Operation Crest a Success, Not without trouble. Here\u0027s how it went and what we did.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKNSC\u0027s First landing on the mun was the first day of the KNSC\u0027s Great Journey. Once we knew that kerbins SOL Was poorly protected and that KSC Before KNSC, KSC Never focused on defending the SOL, Is how we we\u0027re formed. So we needed to start with the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter KNSC\u0027s First Successful Jool Discovery we need to get scientists on the mun to search for anything that may be of importance to us when we cant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this very reason Operation Crest Was formed, The first of many operations of colonization to come. So our first design was a ship called the Dawn of Space Without very much expirience we did what we could. It was a simple design As a real life one would look like a can like design. 3-4 Lander Cans and 4 Landing legs, On a rocket our design plan was simple: Create the main base part, Strap some decouplers strap the main base part to the rocket that will make it go to mun then once we\u0027re in a good enough position get vertical and drop the main base part, We knew that if it was going to fast it would blow up, We anticipated this by putting engines on it so it could control its descend speed. This would be a 3-4 or more launch colonization, All bringing a certain part of the base. Once our final design was ready, We tested it on a test burn it was going good so far, Then we had complications of the descending drop. I lacked to remember to add alot of fuel tanks so we didn\u0027t have enough fuel to descend with. The test was a failure. There was alot more failures i won\u0027t write about to sake the heavy writing. But finally one design worked the same plan but with more fuel and with things we didn\u0027t need just to be safe. So at the end of the mission our base was a success. After tons of explosions we finally got it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
