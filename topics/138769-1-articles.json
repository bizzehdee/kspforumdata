I suppose for LF/O engines you have options. \u00A0You could mate one FT800 per Terrier engine and that\u0027d be about the right compromise between fuel endurance and thrust for a spaceplane. \u00A0If LF only however, the biggest we have is the 400 capacity mk1 fuselage tank. \u00A0The mk2 has an 800 LF fuselage tank but it\u0027s the wrong diameter and much draggier.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nfuel ducts. \u00A0Draggy ! \u00A0Also, the tanks have to be the same size, because unlike the jet engines, \u00A0ducts don\u0027t take account of how big the tank is that they\u0027re pulling from. \u00A0It will pull (for example) 3 fuel per second from each tank whether it\u0027s a little Oscar B or a Kerbodyne.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nlocking tanks and manual transfer. \u00A0 \u00A0TBH, \u00A0this arrangement works pretty well if you\u0027re keeping Rick Wakeman, \u00A0Tony Banks,\u00A0Geoff Downes or other legendary keyboardists\u00A0chained up in your basement, \u00A0they can work all that for you while you operate the flight controls. \u00A0 Unfortunately the food costs were breaking me and i had to let them go.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo devs, how about a nice little toggle on each engine so we can set fuel drain mode between \u003Cstrong\u003Esequential\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Ebalanced\u003C/strong\u003E?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can sort of see why sequential mode exists for rockets.. \u00A0gravity feed and all that, it assumes you\u0027re combining three FT400s into a single large tank, but it\u0027s not the same if the tanks are lying horizontally in an airplane. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Even in a rocket, \u00A0do the tanks not have internal baffles, multiple pick up points etc?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems to just be an artificial way of increasing difficulty in the VAB on early career mode. \u00A0Make us want to spend science points to unlock larger tanks even though they\u0027re exactly the same in terms of dry/wet mass ratio, \u00A0diameter, heat tolerance and fuels carried.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T03:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the meantime i\u0027ve had another go at working around the problem in a bone stock SSTO. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Balancing the fuel tanks fore and aft so that CG doesn\u0027t shift with the balanced fuel drain of the jet engines is something i can do already - see the above post for the SPH pics of my craft fuelled and defuelled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what of the NERVs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to attach them to the largest LF tanks i have access to , the FAT-455 airplane wings. \u00A0 That\u0027ll be the only ducts i\u0027m using for drag reasons. \u00A0 On the front node of this engine we can also fit a single FT400.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first thing I had to do was find out where the CoM of the wing itself lay. \u00A0This was a process of trial and error, \u00A0moving the wing back and forth until i found the location where emptying or filling the wing tank would have no effect on the vehicle\u0027s CoM. \u00A0 It turns out the wing\u0027s CoM lies halfway between the rear spar and the trailing edge. \u00A0 You\u0027ll notice that placing the wing in such a way is going put our CoL too far forward. \u00A0We\u0027ll need substantial lifting surfaces to the rear to correct for this if we\u0027re building a canard.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160502195735_1_zpstohi38sh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/20160502195735_1_zpstohi38sh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe NERVs will also pull from the 400 LF fuselage tanks mounted to their front node when the wings are empty. \u00A0Being a regular shape, the CoM of this part is more obvious. \u00A0 I arranged things so that the CoM of these tanks and the main wings and the vehicle itself are all in a line. \u00A0 The NCS adapters at the front of the stack are locked, \u00A0they can be part of our minmus injection fuel once orbit is made. \u00A0 \u00A01000 LF per NERV should get us to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built some \u0022angle iron\u0022 tail booms out of Big S strakes to give both a rear lift surface and a yaw stabilizer, but they weren\u0027t near enough to correct for the wing placement, \u00A0 so a horizontal wing plank was added to the top. \u00A0 Another strake to seal up the unsightly gap between front fuselage, sponsons and the canard, and it\u0027s actually looking a lot nicer than i thought it was going to , for something based on a random combo of mk1 fuselages and airliner wings..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160502203703_1_zpsnkbwg8k9.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/20160502203703_1_zpsnkbwg8k9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
