But let me tell you, almost everyone, both regular citizens and people in gov\u0027t and industry, compare the two. And right now, SpaceX has a huge lead. Actually, you can tell just by asking yourself, \u0022Where do the hotshot young engineers want to work for?\u0022. And right now, it\u0027s SpaceX, and there\u0027s pretty much no other competition (not Lockheed, not Boeing, not NASA). They\u0027re helped by a charismatic CEO, an underdog story, good marketing, and a media world that absolutely loves everything Musk or SpaceX does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut let me provide a counterpoint. When I studied abroad in Ecuador a couple of years ago and talked with Ecuadorians about the US, they all revere NASA. It definitely surprised me. When I wore a cheap NASA shirt (not a real NASA shirt, just a souvenir one) to class, I got peppered with questions. I have to admit that probably this reputation is really just a legacy of the NASA glory days, but still. It was enough to make kids in another continent basically bow down to me when I told them I had some experience \u0027doing space stuff\u0027. I thought that was funny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also, compared to the rest of the federal government, NASA is ALWAYS ranked as the best, most-loved, and most-respected organization. There\u0027s no doubt within gov\u0027t that NASA is still top-dog. I\u0027ve sat in meetings with ppl from other big agencies like Defense or FBI or FAA or whatnot, and I haven\u0027t ever met someone who doesn\u0027t think NASA personnel are excellent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s that durability of reputation that matters.

It\u0027s true that ESA has never been involved in designing manned spacecraft or anything similar, but that\u0027s mainly because ESA is just a group of very different members, we aren\u0027t a single state or anything like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ChrisSpace\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ChrisSpace\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENASA: sways from -900 to -999\u003Cp\u003ERussian space agency: -800\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndian space agency: 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, NASA worse than Russia?

This is, in part, because they\u0027ve made themselves economically valuable to constituencies whose representatives sit on committees that oversee their budget and operations. But it\u0027s mostly because science funding at the national level is largely driven by advisory councils staffed by scientist/managers, not by political representatives. I work at a government funded research facility; politics is certainly important to our funding, but not high-level national politics; more like small inter- and intra-agency politics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"abowl","CreatedById":110827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T18:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is NASA\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A8s budget this time around?
