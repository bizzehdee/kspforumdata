The success comes after years of struggling to get the laser to work and is another step in the decades-long quest for fusion energy.\u003Cp\u003EOmar Hurricane, a researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, says that for the first time, they\u0027ve produced significant amounts of fusion by zapping a target with their laser. \u0022We\u0027ve gotten more energy out of the fusion fuel than we put into the fusion fuel,\u0022 he says.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrictly speaking, while more energy came from fusion than went into the hydrogen fuel, only about 1 percent of the laser\u0027s energy ever reached the fuel. Useful levels of fusion are still a long way off. \u0022They didn\u0027t get more fusion power out than they put in with the laser,\u0022 says Steve Cowley, the head of a huge fusion experiment in the U.K. called the Joint European Torus, or JET. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/02/12/275896094/scientists-say-their-giant-laser-has-produced-nuclear-fusion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/02/12/275896094/scientists-say-their-giant-laser-has-produced-nuclear-fusion\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaser fusion is possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve done it!
