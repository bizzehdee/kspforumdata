But the whole principle of area drag goes against maintaining a cargo in centre of mass. Especially with a SSTO with a huge cargo mass. If anything you want most of the mass of the plane in the middle of the craft. So shrinking the fuselage right where it needs to be heaviest is almost counteracting the point of carrying a reasonable sized mass. I can see the point of area drag being useful in terms of low altitude supersonic speeds. Yet the point of a SSTO is to get above the atmosphere anyway... So really, this isn\u0027t as much of an issue for a SSTO. In practice you get much less drag by climbing above 25km altitude anyway which makes the area drag less important. I instead focus on a strong glide angle (lift to drag ratio) while still having a TWR of over 1.5 at the very least. Also if you have plenty of thrust, drag is less of an issue anyway. So for me it was a matter of climbing high enough with some kind of jet engine before powering up rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/31867631257700713/6BCE522270D7227DA8D65ED3F9C6F65DBDD59BE2/\u0022 alt=\u00226BCE522270D7227DA8D65ED3F9C6F65DBDD59BE2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice here with My Jumbo sized Rockomax 64 which I think weighs over 30 tonne. Right smack dab in the middle of the centre of mass of the plane. So once the mass is removed, the SSTO acts almost exactly the same. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/31867631257707105/E91E030C24852FB8E1B02CDF58D62ABD58097B1B/\u0022 alt=\u0022E91E030C24852FB8E1B02CDF58D62ABD58097B1B\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Ferram4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo the engines count as part of the area wave drag? It wouldn\u0027t seem right if they did because the engine would be creating a vacuum right in front of the engine nose cones? I don\u0027t know much about air flow dynamics. But I guess that higher speeds a vacuum would not be present once going supersonic. The air wouldn\u0027t be able to move fast enough to counter the sudden air pressure changes in front of the engines. I could imagine an engine stalling say a vacuum bubble was created in front of the engine too... I\u0027m unsure if nuFAR can account for this though?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T11:18:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 11:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by B15HOP_xmen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
