Given the capability and low part count of SSTU, such a tree could easily make up for anything unbalanced due to the lower part requirements---sure, you get better rockets with a fraction of the tank parts, for example, but at a given point you might be only able to afford kerlox engines.

have 2 or more raycasts at even intervals along their length (every 1/3 of the panel, so that a small occlusion doesn\u0027t completely stop EC generation).\u00A0 These really only matter for part-to-part based occlusion though (see below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlanetary occlusion -- I use stock code for that, the bits that determine if a vessel is in sunlight or not (vessel.solarFlux \u0026gt; 0).\u00A0 So if there are any oddities going on there, they are much deeper rooted than the SSTU solar panel module, and are bugs that need to be fixed in stock code.\u00A0 To be fair, I have seen a few cases where panels think they are occluded by planets when they really should not be, notably right on the transitions from light-to-dark, and strangely it doesn\u0027t happen in time-warp.\u00A0 Mostly they appeared as edge cases though that had negligible effect in actual use (e.g. occluded for an extra 3 seconds at dawn/dusk, not a big deal), and regardless, they are problems with the stock code that I can do nothing about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you do manage to narrow down the cause, or have a particular setup that duplicates the problem

CTT integration, and general tech-tree cleanup, over the weekend.\u00A0 While CTT doesn\u0027t fix the problems that I have with the stock tech tree, it does allow for a decent career experience.\u00A0 The CTT balance that I\u0027ve put in is suited to a much longer game than the stock career balance -- many engines are moved into later nodes, and all of the station-core stuff comes later in the habitation node lines.\u00A0 The next few days will be spent going over the HAB and LS balancing on the StationCore parts and updating the patches for the rest of the ShipCore/LanderCore parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was the other bit that I did this weekend, career playtesting, focused on balance (using CTT\u002B\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space

their size, not because of their raw performance stats).\u00A0 Things generally went well.\u00A0 Didn\u0027t run into any new bugs, found and squashed a couple old ones, everything else pretty much

Will be optional as many of the patches are destructive (remove or change parts from stock or other mods).\u00A0 This will contain things like part-overhauls for other mods (converting things to MEC, MFTs or MSCs), part cleanup for stock and other mods (many parts are redundant / not needed when using SSTU, and can be removed to clean up the editor parts list), and part rebalancing for stock or other mods (mass/cost/tech; not many get rebalanced).\u00A0 Will be highly recommended, entirely optional, and \u003Cem\u003Ecompletely unsupported\u003C/em\u003E -- use at your own risk, modify as
