I think I might just need to make a more advanced config, but I have little to no experience messing with mods, let alone tampering with ones that already exist, and so this is a bit of a problem for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been working on it for a week now, and still no progress. I really think the fact of me using RealFuels may have something to do with it, though that might be just me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the advice, though! (I alreayd have TS installed. I need things like Monoprop that- at my current point- Proc Parts can only do for me, since I don\u0027t have ServiceModule parts otherwise.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
