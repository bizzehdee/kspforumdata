Possibly my best mission ever was a 550km (one way!) ground-trip to the nearest ore deposit. The round trip, including flying out extra RTGs because I had forgotten power for my auger, and the mining itself, took about 22h on the MET, or five days playing (many crashes, both of KSP and my truck: yay for quicksave). I then smelted the ore at KSC, loaded the metal onto ships (via KAS) and flew it to the waiting freighter in LKO, and flew that to Minmus. That 11t of ore produced 8t of metal, which produced just enough parts to build enough storage to build a mining smelter unit (this was before timed builds). Flying up auger and smelter was unreasonable because I use FAR, so I had to build them on Minmus. Disabling mining on Kerbin would have removed the potential for a lot of fun.

This makes a situation when constructing 100t aircraft costs you 200k no matter what parts are inside. And this is okay for standard tech rockets. But if we think about more expensive stuff like MKS or NFT or FTT modules (starlifter reactor that costs normally 526k without fuel but only around 55k when constructed of rocket parts) it makes rocket parts quite unbalanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there is no easy workaround and restricting tweaking rocket parts is gameplay negative. Maybe if you construct rocket from rocket parts you have to pay the difference between the price of rocket and price of rocket parts? But this isn\u0027t ideal and real either.

So you\u0027re at least restricted to MKS output or my machinery in respect to that resource \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E That would also add realism (rocket parts as alloys that include rare earth metals).

What purpose does preventing players from shipping parts from Kerbin serve? Disabling filling of parts and related resources does serve a puprose: it forces the player to get out and explore Kerbin. Possibly my best mission ever was a 550km (one way!) ground-trip to the nearest ore deposit. The round trip, including flying out extra RTGs because I had forgotten power for my auger, and the mining itself, took about 22h on the MET, or five days playing (many crashes, both of KSP and my truck: yay for quicksave). I then smelted the ore at KSC, loaded the metal onto ships (via KAS) and flew it to the waiting freighter in LKO, and flew that to Minmus. That 11t of ore produced 8t of metal, which produced just enough parts to build enough storage to build a mining smelter unit (this was before timed builds). Flying up auger and smelter was unreasonable because I use FAR, so I had to build them on Minmus. Disabling mining on Kerbin would have removed the potential for a lot of fun.
