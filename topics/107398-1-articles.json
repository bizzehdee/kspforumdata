I\u0027m working on a tiny mod and was wondering if anybody would mind lending me a hand (with due credit of course!) in texturing the model I\u0027ve made for the mod. I\u0027m only half way decent at modeling and my texturing is terrible lol so any hand lent would be super appreciated!!! Here\u0027s what the model looks like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CfAwymm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CfAwymm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t unwrapped it yet but each part is a separate object so that shouldn\u0027t be too difficult.Im not asking anybody to model it for me, mostly just lend me their stylistic hand x3. Im really uncreative when it comes to texturing cause i never really learned and espeically with KSP i have no idea what style i should even try. (im so lost here v.v lol). lastly, thank you so much to anybody willing to lend their time and hand to me! it really means a lot! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s. if this is the wrong forum location (as opposed to like, mod requests or something) please let me know so i can move it there asap. tyvm! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.p.s the object is a refinery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T11:01:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 11:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ackley14\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T11:14:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes it have to be so detailed?
