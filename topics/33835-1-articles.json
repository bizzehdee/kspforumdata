So you\u0027d have this station, your crew arrives in orbit around the Mun and docks to it, and an awaiting lander takes the crew and sends them down. When they get back up, they dock again, and go back to Kerbin with the original ship.

Ships with parts flew to the station, docked the part on the bottom of this ship then flew into the Mun (to reduce debris). The landing ship then fly down and dropped of the part, sky crane style. The station itself was a big fuel depot, with 6 orange tanks of fuel, and tons of monoprop.
