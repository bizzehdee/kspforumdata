Although the release of the original was troubled (the game really lost a LOT in translation, literally), CD Projekt Red came back with the Enhanced Edition and nailed it. The Witcher 2 was top notch, again, in my opinion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, like anything you read on the internet, do your own research first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a blanket rule, don\u0027t pre-order anything by EA or anything with Assassins Creed in the title.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
