I decided to revist another old flight, this time from an engineering standpoint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in September of last year I started a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49388-Reasonable-goal-for-low-mass-Mun-mission\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethread \u003C/a\u003Ewhere I asked if my attempt at a low mass Mun flight seemed reasonable and if the math was correct. This was the first ship I designed by making delta-v calculations ahead of time (my excel method), instead of just trial and error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy best design back then was this 34.5 ton ship. As part of the flight plan for this ship I tested and learned how to dock without RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/t5gwn489j/screenshot849.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot849.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I\u0027m taking a fresh look at designing a low mass mission. The basic criteria are no exploits (infinite glider, intake spamming, etc) and I\u0027d like it to look good. While I\u0027ll admit to doing it over in my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67549-Space-is-too-scary%21-%28Dave-s-probe-only-career%29?p=942891\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post942891\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eprobe thread\u003C/a\u003E I\u0027m not a fan of \u0027pancake\u0027 shaped ships on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately I came up with this. It weighs 21.99 tons on the launchpad (I used tweakables to drain a little unneeded fuel from the center booster) and looks reasonably like a rocket with a big center booster and 6 smaller boosters. The 2 fuel tanks on the side of the capsule are bending things a bit, they rely on the cubic strut trick to let me mount them radially like that. I did that mostly for looks, if you use a radial decoupler with the T100 tank it just looks terrible. Another alternative configuration that would have a slight effect on flight would be to place a single T200 tank on top, moving the parachutes to the sides. The weight can be brought back to 21.99t by removing the science gear which is just there for show (though you can actually get a lot of science using just those instruments plus kerbal stuff)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L5NWOfJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022L5NWOfJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tQi6S2n.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tQi6S2n.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Pnc8PT9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Pnc8PT9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter launch there is still 6L of fuel left in the booster but for this mission I\u0027m just going to discard it before burning for the Mun. The side tanks provide just enough fuel for injection and capture. I push away from them as I slightly adjust the orbit and prepare for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MDETawW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MDETawW.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TEB4jyD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TEB4jyD.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Vxm05fL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Vxm05fL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we land, plant a flag and come back. There is some fuel in the tank so I aerobrake and then setup a return to try and reach KSP. I managed to come down pretty close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oDmcTEx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oDmcTEx.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sr82Hkq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sr82Hkq.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2mTc1UO.png\u0022 alt=\u00222mTc1UO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qZSr8HU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qZSr8HU.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PFVmJ7d.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PFVmJ7d.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3ba971h.png\u0022 alt=\u00223ba971h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with half a year of experience I\u0027ve managed to knock of 1/3 of the weight and make it look nicer. But that\u0027s not really enough to show for improvement, especially when there are pancake ships that do it for under 15 tons. I don\u0027t really want to make a pancake so is there something else I can do, somewhere else I can go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3klSr3Z.png\u0022 alt=\u00223klSr3Z.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YaJnkPa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YaJnkPa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is not how you get to Minmus. Arriving at Duna I have 3.06L of liquid fuel left in the side tanks. I\u0027ll use some of that to slightly adjust for aerocapture. I didn\u0027t actually get into orbit, instead coming into a long descent that brought me around to the day side of Duna (just barely). In the thin atmosphere I was still going over 400 m/s but the partially deployed chute slowly reduced until it fully deployed which instantly eliminated most of my horizontal velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EgWqdDm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EgWqdDm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/g8vyJ0r.png\u0022 alt=\u0022g8vyJ0r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is still 1.18L left in the side tanks so they\u0027ll last all of 2 seconds for the ascent. I got a little lazy on the return and didn\u0027t correct my return PE until I entered Kerbin\u0027s SOI. I burned most of the remaining 9L of fuel (close to 200 m/s) to correct and put myself into return over the pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1lqvfs6.png\u0022 alt=\u00221lqvfs6.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OA7lOHo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OA7lOHo.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jlETxpd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jlETxpd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rS2T8va.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rS2T8va.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qG4Ql6T.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qG4Ql6T.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CcyAVc3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CcyAVc3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T17:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongrats.

If your ladder is close enough to the parachute you can do it on the ground. If you have parachutes far away from any ladder then you can wait until you are back in space and do a space walk with the jetpack to reach them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zFR4Jrs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zFR4Jrs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWijbrandus, if you send a Kerbal out on EVA, there are several things he can do to parts, if he is close enough: repair broken tires, extend solar panels, and yes, repack parachutes for re-use.
