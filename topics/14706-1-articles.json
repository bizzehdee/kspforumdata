Also noted that this craft has a penchant for skimming the ground with it\\\u0027s rotor tips just inches above the ground - this coupled with the difficulties experienced during landing make for a decent danger rating. Overall an excellent craft, I discovered that if the tips of the rotors are removed (generally happens by trying to cut the KSC\\\u0027s grass) that the aircraft can accelerate well past 150m/s in level flight.
