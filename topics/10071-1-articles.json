Hopefully it comes with the new assembly set-up in 0.16\n\nYou can manly edit the .craft file, and alter the POS line for each item,\n\nas you add things to the craft, they come in at the bottom of this list.\n\nSo you would make your top stage, and get that as level as you can, at say the 1st fuel tank, and surrounding ones, then set them up the same.. I will post some examples for you.."},{"CreatedByName":"Sordid","CreatedById":535,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-01T13:25:35Z","Content":"Alternatively you can edit your settings.cfg and change VAB\\_ANGLE\\_SNAP\\_INCLUDE\\_VERTICAL from False to True."},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-01T13:26:00Z","Content":"Open up the file \u0027T1-un.craft\u0027 in word pad(when dealing with your crafts, all ways back up the files after you have gotten out KSP)\n\nPlease note the way the file is devided up, for this example their is the MK1 Pod, one Fuel tank, followed by 2 tanks in symetry.\n\nThe first tank is set up with the POS as \u0027-0.4698442,**11.53677**,0.002250103\u0027 that middle number is the hight.\n\nnote the next two tanks are at \u0027...,**11.47266**,...\u0027 you just need to change 11.47266 to 11.53677 for both those entry\\\u0027s..\n\nsave the file and exit notepad, load KSP and look at the craft.. it should now look like the attached \u0027T1-fix.craft\u0027\n\nNow the number decimal places is not fixed, you may only get 4 numbers sometimes, that do-sent matter if you are changing from 5 points to 4 or the other way around.\n\nWhen placing stacks of fuel tanks, just place the top single ones, edit them, then all the ones below will be at the same hight, same with engines, no point editing them, just make the top item in the stacks the same and everythign that connects directly below will also be the same.\n\nWhen dealing with large numbers of symmetrical tanks, I have found its easer to use Find-replace to change the numbers, but be warned, if something unrelated happens to be at the very same pos in any of the 3 axis it will be replaced if you forget to have leading and trailing commer marks in both the find and the replace feilds.\n\nNow you can put more tanks and the engines below those three ones."},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-01T13:27:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Alternatively you can edit your settings.cfg and change VAB\\_ANGLE\\_SNAP\\_INCLUDE\\_VERTICAL from False to True.\n\nTHANKS!
