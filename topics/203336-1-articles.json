Then you\u0027ll want to look around in Backup, as the guy above me mentioned, but also in your quicksaves to try and find the most recent .sfs file. They\u0027re all in the same format and valid game save files. Once you have one, go ahead and copy it and replace the persistent.sfs file we deleted earlier with the copy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve done that, you should be able to load up the save without issue on the version you last played it in, or any later version. The game auto-upgrades save files to the format of the current version if it\u0027s older, but the format hasn\u0027t changed much and mods don\u0027t really bother it typically, so there shouldn\u0027t be any other issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
