However, when I fly rocket with ~150 parts, it slows down my pc quite a bit (mobile 1st gen i7 \u002B 5870m \u002B 8gb ram). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to ask, if all the parts have the same influence on the game engine. Is one tank causing the same loss of performance as one solar panel? Or maybe struts cause a lot of trouble?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, please share anything regarding increasing performance in the ascend stage? And which parts to use the least, if they are known for big performance loss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T09:16:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Phemark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a six years old laptop so i think i can help. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, decrease the texture size and the rendering quality in the config menu of KSP. Also, avoid using any anti-aliasing multiplication. If you still want to increase performance, you can also set de max physics Delta-Time per Frame a bit slower. (i\u0027m around 0.10 per second if i\u0027m correct)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you can use the Kerbal Joint Reinforcement plugin. It helped my poopy laptop a lot to less compute about the joints that link parts together. I can easily go above 150 parts per rockets without too much performances loss. An other useful plugin, but it is still on \u0027work in progress\u0027 is Ubiozur Welding part. It merges differents parts as one. Very useful for building stations/bases that use a lot of structural parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, avoid using plugins that do the same thing: for instance Mechjeb, Flight engineer and VOID. Somehow it also helped my game a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, but i\u0027m not sure about this one, I think that muting the music helped me getting rid of those 5/10 sec long lags and those .exe crashing due to a lack of memory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the part beeing more demanding on performance, I would say that they are all the same... maybe not engines...
