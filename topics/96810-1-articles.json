You\u0027ll understand why in a second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of yesterday, Keen Software House, the group responsible for the awesome space sandbox, Space Engineers, announced pre-order for the early alpha of Medieval Engineers. Even after getting control of my absolute unbridled rage, I still left a rather sarcastic, smartass\u0027d post on the KSH forums. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EPardon my french, the whole thing had me livid yesterday and I\u0027m still pretty annoyed.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat gets me is that SE has an unstable dedicated server module, semi-stable multiplayer, horrendous performance optimization, and now programming where people can backend in and remote access the server from console. There is a metric crap-ton that needs fixing before it can even be considered for a beta release and they\u0027re off making a new game on the same unoptimized engine! What\u0027s a metric crap-ton? It\u0027s more than a short crap-ton. All the effort they put into Medieval Engineers would have done loads to make, oh I don\u0027t know, a planetside component of SE which the majority of the vocal community have been requesting for ages. They also made a bold move to sell and early access game as a boxed edition in stores. I\u0027m sure that went over well with people expecting a finished game only to get the mess we have now. I love the game, but I can\u0027t even bring myself to play it because I want to kill the guys at KSH right now for the sheer idiocy. Xbox One version, Boxed Edition, now a whole \u0027 nother game? COME ON! FOCUS! Focus on what your task at hand is and get it done. Put all these resources into a single point and make some real progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that leaving my so damn angry, I wanted to stop and say this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ETHANK YOU SQUAD!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for staying focused, for getting the game all the way to beta, and for consistently delivering when it was asked of you. Just recently you gave us SP\u002B integration, new Mk3 parts, upgradable buildings (even if the artwork is a bit lacking), and now we have an incoming aero revamp, and leaked information with a rather likely conclusion being a first-draft of a stock ISRU mining/refueling framework.

A development asymptote is, in all actuality, a self-imposed limit by the decision to limit yourself to a predetermined scope. By letting go of that predetermination and using creativity, is is more than possible to find substantial content to add, and with the creativity of the KSP community available, there is no shortage of potential content. If Squad wanted to keep expanding on sandbox mode indefinitely, they most certainly could. They would, however, run into a point where there is so much there, that what they are adding does not have enough of an impact on the metagame to justify the development effort and this is more of a content asymptote.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad, thank you for sticking to your work, for delivering such an awesome game, and for getting it this far.
