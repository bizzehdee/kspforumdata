The larvae typically finds its way to the brain (which is NOT where it would mature in a pig) and causes a lot of problems and potentially death (for both the human and the worm). The same seems to be true for worms living in a closed system with pigs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find this particularly strange because the cycle seems to suggest that these tapeworms would have had to evolve relatively fast. It relies on the relationship between humans and pork, and therefore would only have been able to thrive in the short time that humans have practiced animal farming. Is this a possible scenario in which a species made a quantum leap in evolution?

People keep on thinking of it as a very slow process, but it turns out to be a lot more dynamic that originally thought. This is probably partly because of genetic triggers - by only changing one gene, larger (probably dormant) traits can be turned on or off. Our thin body hair is one example, another is a creature where (if I recall correctly) changing a single letter in the genetic sequence causes it to change from a creature with one hart chamber and a tail to a creature with two perfectly functioning heart chambers and no tail. Evolution is not just developing new traits, it is also switching on and off older ones and recombining those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mechanism turns out to be more and more complex every time we take a close look at it, but that is what makes it so interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T23:15:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would be willing to bet that the original primary host wasn\u0027t human, but some other predator.
