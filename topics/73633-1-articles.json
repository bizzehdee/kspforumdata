I think the primary issue is that vBulletin has an issue with session cookies when you use the forum in more than one tab simultaneously, and it can\u0027t properly keep track of what is and is not read. Hopefully the impending upgrade to vB5 will make that somewhat better, if not fix it entirely, but we won\u0027t know till after the upgrade is live.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ghimb2000","CreatedById":74996,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T09:45:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it\u0027s due to opening many tabs.

It will only mark you threads as unread that had new content between the current and the last session. This kinda makes sense since you don\u0027t have bazilion unread threads all over the forum, but can be annoying if you haven\u0027t read a thread in the last session (since you just wanted to DL a mod via google) or were distracted and didn\u0027t do anything on the forum long enough that the forum considers your comeback as a new session. Understanding this rly changed the way i\u0027m using the KSP forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
