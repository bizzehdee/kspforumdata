I\u0027m not arguing that in the slightest. The features and changes it added really bring a lot of fun to the game. \u003Cem\u003EHowever\u003C/em\u003E... the change to SAS modules seems more like a bug than a feature. I understand that Pilot kerbonaut is needed to provide the \u0022direction-hold\u0022 style SAS early on, which makes perfect sense. That being said, I unlocked the Advanced Inline Stabilizer (old \u0022ASAS\u0022) early on so that I can take Engineers and Scientists up early in the game without having to have a multi-crewed craft. When I get on the pad, though, I get the whole \u0022You don\u0027t have SAS functionality because you don\u0027t have a Pilot or SAS module installed\u0022 message. The fact that the message mentions having an \u0022SAS Module\u0022 implies to me that you\u0027re supposed to be able to activate SAS if you have the module installed, but I can\u0027t find anything that appears to actually provide SAS functionality other than having an actual Pilot aboard.
