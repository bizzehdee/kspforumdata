Those two should be most relevant, however, since the others are mainly for probes and small landers. Also, I have a part that combines two stock nuke engines into one 2.5m part. It\u0027s exactly the same as having two stock nukes, but reduces part count and looks better on larger ships.\n\nI\u0027m not necessarily asking for you to make my craft for me.

Use just one on the mothership, doesn\u0027t need a matching one on the lander. Or, even better, a small decoupler. \n\nDo you need landing struts? Some angled stacks of (massless) Cubic Octagonal Struts would do as good a job. \n\nUsing one LV-N is heavier than your engines but you\u0027ll need half the fuel and so the craft might weigh less overall. \n\nI doubt you need four inline stabilizers. Try it with one. \n\nConsider (massless) OX-STAT single solar panels rather than PB-NUKs (assuming that\u0027s what you are using).\n\nI doubt you need that huge battery pack.

Roughly speaking, this means that there must be one nuclear engine for 10 tonnes of vehicle mass (not including the engine itself). With 35 tonnes of payload, you need 3.5 engines for just the payload.\n\nLet\u0027s assume that our standard fuel tank is the FL-T800 / X200-8, with 4 tonnes of fuel and 0.5 tonnes of dry mass.

The biggest issue I\u0027m running into is that the contract stipulates:\n\n- Space for 10 Kerbals\n- A viewing cupola\n- Power\n- Radio\n- A docking port (unspecified size or placement)\n\nMy usual habitation module only has room for 5. I decided launching two hab modules, a base crawler, and a connecting truss module along with their respective landers would be heavier and more expensive than this craft.\n\nSo next I played around with stock components, and then a few other stockalike mod parts I have at hand, and I still cannot hit the mission parameters for space for less than 8 tons. The original, just the cupola and living quarters, are 8.8 - just .4 more than any other combination I could put together, and was the simplest.\n\nAfter that, it was just a case of implementing suggestions. I removed the 4k battery and replaced with two massless 400 batteries. It\u0027s hard to see in the shot I provided, but power is from four stock OX-4L solar panels, weighing in at 0.0175 each (0.07 total). I removed the bottom docking port, and replaced the top standard port with a junior. The junior only saved me 0.03, while removing the senior saved me 0.2.\n\nSwitching from LT-2 to LT-1 legs saved me 0.3.\n\nSo now, not counting whatever method I use to land it, I\u0027m down to 21 parts and 9.2 tons. Playing around with other configurations and living arrangements didn\u0027t net me very much difference in weight, but increased the part count.\n\nFor the landing engines, I played around with several different configurations. I did remove all RCS and SAS modules, which immediately saved 5.4 tons -- a significant savings. Ideally, I want to be able to detatch the lander engines after I reach the surface, sending them away to crash (or deleting them from mission control). I believe (and will test this tonight) that I only need in the neighborhood of 1000dv to safely reach the surface. This gives me enough room to tweak my landing area if need be and leaves enough fuel that the separated stages can fly safely away to crash and burn. I switched the four FL-800 tanks for FL-200s, saving me another 3.375 tons and increasing the Moho TWR to 3.12. So now as it stands my total payload to LMO is 14.4 tons -- roughly half of what it was when I posted this thread this morning.\n\nI may can shave a bit more off by completely redesigning it, and I might play around with it some more tomorrow. However, I\u0027m fairly confident that this is the most useful and least complicated design that will meet my mission parameters.\n\nI just saw the suggestions to try different engines, so I will do so. I can almost guarantee, however, that the 48-7S is probably going to be the one I go with; the LV-Ns were too heavy and way too long. I\u0027ll try the LV-909s just to see what changes. Maybe I can go with two 909s and larger fuel tanks instead of four 48-7Ss and smaller tanks.\n\nWe\u0027re supposed to get an ice storm tonight so I may not respond for a day or two if we lose power.

Gigantic, staged chemical rocket. Pro: high TWR. Con: annoying to build, launch and fly because of tedium, part count lag and sheer mass/size. Likely needs orbital assembly.\n\n2.) Classic nuclear transfer vessel. Pro: doesn\u0027t need to be as big. Might be able to do it in one launch. Con: low TWR.\n\n3.) Nuclear-electric high tech boat. Pro: will give you the smallest vessel. Might even have the fuel to return itself to Kerbin for reuse. Con: Low TWR, very expensive (in career mode).\n\nGoing from Aethon\u0027s numbers, you want at least 5200 dV when starting your transfer burn in LKO.

Low, yes, but you can use this stage for the two non-critical burns - the Sun periapsis maneuver and the orbit insertion. TWR will improve as you burn and be highest when you need it most. For Kerbin departure, let\u0027s stack a beefier stage below it...\n\u003E \n\u003E Payload mass: 58t\n\u003E \n\u003E Fuel tank mass: 7.2t fuel for 1t dry mass\n\u003E \n\u003E Engine mass: 6.5t per KR-2L\n\u003E \n\u003E Isp: 380\n\u003E \n\u003E One Kerbodyne S3-14400 fuel tank, one Kerbodyne KR-2L and a bit of spare change dry mass for adapters/decouplers/reaction wheels: this stage with all the previous stuff on top does another 2400 dV, while having a TWR of over 1.7 fully fueled - that ought to be enough for anyone!\n\u003E \n\u003E Now this thing has a total of 4900 dV in its first two stages, give or take a few depending on how you build. You\u0027ll notice that this is a few hundred short of Aethon\u0027s example, meaning you\u0027ll run out of juice probably after capture but before low orbit circularization. Thing is, though: your landing stage has 2100 dV, not counting RCS, which is more than enough - you need about 1400 to land from a 50km circular orbit. So you can use the lander to supplement the missing dV.\n\u003E \n\u003E Total transfer vessel weight: ~150 tons. 3 stages from LKO to Moho surface. Launching 150 tons in one launch is not unheard of, but you can also launch it empty (~48 tons) and fill it up in orbit, or launch each stage separately and dock them (though that will require adding extra mass in the form of RCS and probe cores and batteries and whatnot).\n\u003E \n\u003E Not much room for mistakes, and certainly not enough to mess around with plane changes in Moho orbit (insert directly into a polar orbit so you can always hit your desired landing site no matter where on the planet it is). But it\u0027s economic ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) If you feel unsure, the huge TWR of the Kerbin departure stage lets you add in more fuel without hurting, but the launch weight will increase noticably.\n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT: Bonus method to increase dV for free! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Just occurred to me over lunch break. Nowadays in .90 you can do symmetric fuel transfers involving multiple tanks in stock KSP. When the nuclear stage runs out of fuel, you can transfer over some from the lander\u0027s four tanks without causing a fuel amount imbalance in them. Despite the added dry mass of the spent nuclear stage, the superior Isp of the LV-N\u0027s still gives you approximately 60% more dV for your fuel than if you were to decouple and use the 48-7S\u0027s. Heck, the two LV-N\u0027s even have exactly the same thrust as the four 48-7S\u0027s! Hence, finish your orbit circularization burn this way - and, in fact, keep using the LV-N\u0027s for the first part of the landing too. Hang onto them until the spent stage gets in the way or it starts dragging your down too much, then (make sure you transferred all remaining fuel back symmetrically and) ditch it during descent and finish the landing normally.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nWant me to try and do a Near Future equipped electric variant as well? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T11:57:25Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 11:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T16:04:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E shamelessly exploiting massless parts may earn you a ton or so less weight, but it\u0027ll also look dumb, leave a bad aftertaste and the small savings won\u0027t actually absolve you of the need to design a giant transfer vessel.\n\nWe might have to agree to disagree on that one ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif). \nThese parts are deliberately made massless by the dev team.
