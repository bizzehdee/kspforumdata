I decided launching two hab modules, a base crawler, and a connecting truss module along with their respective landers would be heavier and more expensive than this craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo next I played around with stock components, and then a few other stockalike mod parts I have at hand, and I still cannot hit the mission parameters for space for less than 8 tons. The original, just the cupola and living quarters, are 8.8 - just .4 more than any other combination I could put together, and was the simplest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, it was just a case of implementing suggestions. I removed the 4k battery and replaced with two massless 400 batteries. It\u0027s hard to see in the shot I provided, but power is from four stock OX-4L solar panels, weighing in at 0.0175 each (0.07 total). I removed the bottom docking port, and replaced the top standard port with a junior. The junior only saved me 0.03, while removing the senior saved me 0.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwitching from LT-2 to LT-1 legs saved me 0.3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now, not counting whatever method I use to land it, I\u0027m down to 21 parts and 9.2 tons. Playing around with other configurations and living arrangements didn\u0027t net me very much difference in weight, but increased the part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the landing engines, I played around with several different configurations. I did remove all RCS and SAS modules, which immediately saved 5.4 tons -- a significant savings. Ideally, I want to be able to detatch the lander engines after I reach the surface, sending them away to crash (or deleting them from mission control). I believe (and will test this tonight) that I only need in the neighborhood of 1000dv to safely reach the surface. This gives me enough room to tweak my landing area if need be and leaves enough fuel that the separated stages can fly safely away to crash and burn. I switched the four FL-800 tanks for FL-200s, saving me another 3.375 tons and increasing the Moho TWR to 3.12. So now as it stands my total payload to LMO is 14.4 tons -- roughly half of what it was when I posted this thread this morning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may can shave a bit more off by completely redesigning it, and I might play around with it some more tomorrow.

You\u0027ll notice that this is a few hundred short of Aethon\u0027s example, meaning you\u0027ll run out of juice probably after capture but before low orbit circularization. Thing is, though: your landing stage has 2100 dV, not counting RCS, which is more than enough - you need about 1400 to land from a 50km circular orbit. So you can use the lander to supplement the missing dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal transfer vessel weight: ~150 tons. 3 stages from LKO to Moho surface. Launching 150 tons in one launch is not unheard of, but you can also launch it empty (~48 tons) and fill it up in orbit, or launch each stage separately and dock them (though that will require adding extra mass in the form of RCS and probe cores and batteries and whatnot).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot much room for mistakes, and certainly not enough to mess around with plane changes in Moho orbit (insert directly into a polar orbit so you can always hit your desired landing site no matter where on the planet it is).

Nowadays in .90 you can do symmetric fuel transfers involving multiple tanks in stock KSP. When the nuclear stage runs out of fuel, you can transfer over some from the lander\u0027s four tanks without causing a fuel amount imbalance in them. Despite the added dry mass of the spent nuclear stage, the superior Isp of the LV-N\u0027s still gives you approximately 60% more dV for your fuel than if you were to decouple and use the 48-7S\u0027s. Heck, the two LV-N\u0027s even have exactly the same thrust as the four 48-7S\u0027s! Hence, finish your orbit circularization burn this way - and, in fact, keep using the LV-N\u0027s for the first part of the landing too. Hang onto them until the spent stage gets in the way or it starts dragging your down too much, then (make sure you transferred all remaining fuel back symmetrically and) ditch it during descent and finish the landing normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWant me to try and do a Near Future equipped electric variant as well? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T11:57:25Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 11:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T16:04:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eshamelessly exploiting massless parts may earn you a ton or so less weight, but it\u0027ll also look dumb, leave a bad aftertaste and the small savings won\u0027t actually absolve you of the need to design a giant transfer vessel. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EWe might have to agree to disagree on that one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E. \u003Cp\u003EThese parts are deliberately made massless by the dev team.
