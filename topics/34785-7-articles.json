I wrote that based on MJ (once again !) class with the same name. By default everything is handled by angle style (one double value, things simpler). And I added two new properties, \u0022DMSlat\u0022 and \u0022DMSlong\u0022, which returns DMS version of the angles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s a bit of a problem, because for an obscure reason only the Degrees part of the DMS is taken in account when entered into HyperEdit\u0027s Lander.

If a value the user entered is being changed in the code - like reverting to a minimum or maximum, or whatever - it should warn the user and possibly offer options, as I believe this is where a lot of confusion arises. I realize this makes for more complex code, but I think it\u0027s worth the effort to provide a truly professional grade product.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will not be my cup of tea - I hardly does things pretty and user-friendly.
