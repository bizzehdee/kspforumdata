I\u0027ve been considering going back to pure stock but then think about how many mods/plugins I would miss greatly, so I\u0027ve come here to ask if anyone has any tips on how to limit mod selection? Or do we all have this problem of wanting all the things?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gl0ryh0und","CreatedById":63038,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T02:19:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHa I feel your pain, actually I\u0027m on the fence myself. I have some mods I avoid for personal taste reasons, a couple because they are overly complex or buggy.

So what I basically did is peel away the fluff and build up a list of mods that represented the type of game I wanted to play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome Mod packs add excessive amounts of parts to try and accomplish a unified look for their mod, that\u0027s fine, but not my idea of an efficient use of the limited resources the game has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome try to reinvent the wheel with everything they do, or make things over complex\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve given up on procedural anything, really have difficulty making parts stick to them just the way I want.. I find them wonky and more difficult to work with than static parts, couldn\u0027t be bothered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR, this mod is really cool. I tried it for a while, but it doesn\u0027t fit with the game experience I want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS, this mod makes me drool and depresses me at the same time, too buggy yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar, another drool worthy mod. ZZZ I think is one of the really good artists in this community and his work is something to behold in game. Way too complex to bother with unfortunately. Or rather suffers from Feature bloat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 just too much stuff, a fine example of bloat but so damn beautiful. The best IVA work and all those lovely lovely cargo bays and wing parts.. \u0026lt;sigh\u0026gt; too bloaty it was out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDamned robotics is my next experiment, It looks complex but so cool..
