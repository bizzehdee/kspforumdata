Hmmm... Here\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s an idea: crop pictures from close to them and use those in your hints. Altitude profiles, maybe. Then you only have to codify the body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: For body identification, you could place some sort of rosetta stone early on, which would assign a glyph to each planet (by graphical means, NOT: \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Moho = \u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u00B8\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4..., but a pictrogram of the system with the glyphs shown next to the planets, or maybe simply the sequence of glyphs as the planets with smaller glyphs for their moons below each), and use glyphs on the other hints - some people might not find the stone, but figure it anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: I guess the distance from the equator of a site could also be universally codified as a pictograms, as the equator is fixed by nature. For the other (i cant ever remember which is long- and which is latitude) you could use the highest elevation of the body as reference and shift default coordinates accordingly for each one. Then you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d have to translate each set of coordinates into some sort of other convention, that is somehow alien, yet accurate enough, in its own logic. Maybe, they should not be given in degrees, but actual distance from that point of reference (y=equator,x=of highest elevation), so the logic behind it is not that obvious and \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B420\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0N\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 reads completely differently for two bodies of different sizes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings us the units - be they degrees or distances. Those have to be universally codified as well and a hint given as to what \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4something\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 in \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B41 something\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 means (after you have figured how a \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B41\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 looks like). As this will probably something of planetary scale (i\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d suggest the distance between some moon to its planet - which one is the most circular?), you probably will have to find a way to write something as \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B41/x\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, there could be some micro-scale, again to be figured by finding stuff.

You would find these monoliths doing quests and then ship them where you want to teleport. Obivously you have a finite number of them and nobody knows how they work. Maybe the quests could reward you with monoliths some times, and other things some other times, so you don\u0027t end up with a hundred teleporters all over the place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I\u0027m thinking in having more than just one quest here, but that\u0027s maybe too much, because you have to come up with a ton of riddles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the messages.
