The idea is to scatter encrypted messages left by some ancient civilization on different planets which would lead to some prize in the end.\n\nNow, there is a fine point where the process of decryption turns from fun into a headache, so I came up with a little test:\n\nHere\u0027s an encrypted phrase in English):\n\n    0 10  7  1  15  10  16  -7  1  1  5  7  -5  15  -5  -4  9\n\nIt is a relatively easy cipher and there is a hint: the key has something to do with KSP planets.\n\nThe questions are:\n\nWas it easy/hard/impossible to decipher?\n\nShould the riddles in the quest be easier/harder than this example?\n\nP.S. I will post the key and the explanation in a few days.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T10:40:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 10:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cicatrix**\n  \nUpdated the message, sorry for mistake."},{"CreatedByName":"Borsek","CreatedById":129852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T11:21:51Z","Content":"You forgot the Wut? option in the poll.

Numbers/math is okay, too, but even using them like \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B41\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B42\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B43\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4... takes a bit from the alien-ness (better: |,||,|||, ... for example). Dont do codes like that, please, cause if somebody left the message, it was meant to be understood - intentional codification should not be the obstacle to understanding it, but simply trying to figure what is meant by the forms and pictograms or whatever. Any use of conventional stuff (like the alphabet) should be avoided, imho, and only \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4universal truths\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 and/or strange glyphs be utilized.\n\nAlso, if possible, you could do something like using a certain science instrument (something is supposed to scan actively) close to an \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4alien crate\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 might open it, with some hints to that depicted on its lid (say a wave next to an open crate), for example. If the player cant figure it out, he might be able to excravate the crate, bring it home (as soil sample, so to say) and get what\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s in it after that.\n\nJust throwing idea out there, trying to help... i\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d like to play such a mod very much.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nNew, post for the last was an xpost:\n\nYou could leave the very first hint right at the KSP and THAT ONE could use conventions (Alphabet, numbers) - it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d be something you snatched from the KIA - top secret stuff about something found close to the north pole...\n\nAs for giving coordinates: That\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s really hard, i guess. Hmmm... Here\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s an idea: crop pictures from close to them and use those in your hints. Altitude profiles, maybe. Then you only have to codify the body.\n\nEDIT: For body identification, you could place some sort of rosetta stone early on, which would assign a glyph to each planet (by graphical means, NOT: \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Moho = \u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u00B8\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4..., but a pictrogram of the system with the glyphs shown next to the planets, or maybe simply the sequence of glyphs as the planets with smaller glyphs for their moons below each), and use glyphs on the other hints - some people might not find the stone, but figure it anyways.\n\nEDIT2: I guess the distance from the equator of a site could also be universally codified as a pictograms, as the equator is fixed by nature. For the other (i cant ever remember which is long- and which is latitude) you could use the highest elevation of the body as reference and shift default coordinates accordingly for each one. Then you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d have to translate each set of coordinates into some sort of other convention, that is somehow alien, yet accurate enough, in its own logic. Maybe, they should not be given in degrees, but actual distance from that point of reference (y=equator,x=of highest elevation), so the logic behind it is not that obvious and \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B420\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0N\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 reads completely differently for two bodies of different sizes. \n\nWhich brings us the units - be they degrees or distances. Those have to be universally codified as well and a hint given as to what \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4something\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 in \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B41 something\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 means (after you have figured how a \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B41\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 looks like). As this will probably something of planetary scale (i\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d suggest the distance between some moon to its planet - which one is the most circular?), you probably will have to find a way to write something as \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B41/x\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 as well.\n\nWell, there could be some micro-scale, again to be figured by finding stuff. Say the distance between two peaks on some planet. There be a hint, showing the peaks and a line between them and the glyph for that distance - but you might not figure it, until you maybe accidently, while in orbit, notice those peaks and go \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Ahhh!\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T12:49:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 12:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy**"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T12:45:35Z","Content":"well, I got as far as the sum of all the numbers is 76, 7 \\* 6 is 42 so having arrived at *the answer* I was happy to leave it at that! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T12:47:47Z","Content":"While I\u0027m just enough of a crypto geek to figure out one-time pads in high school (merely from reading Neal Stephenson\u0027s Cryptonomicon, of course), decryption has never been my thing.

Having no knowledge of ciphers, it would not have occurred to me that a -*key*- would be needed.\n\nThing with one time pads is if op used a truly random key the same length of the message, it would have been literally impossible to break. I\u0027m talking about theoretically perfect security. You can try all possible keys and all you get is all possible messages and no way of knowing which is the original. To be fair he did give a hint regarding the key which was quite short and we knew the message was in english, should have been fairly easy to crack. Basically you\u0027d have to either guess the key and know how to apply it to decpiher the message, or have some knowledge of attacking one-time pads with weak non-random keys.\nAs for puzzles in games... I dunno, otp seems overkill. Better just obfuscate the message, like someone posted about geometric shapes and such. If you already have to piece together the key from hints it is imo unnecessary to have the additional step of applying it to the cipher. Just have the message itself splattered across the Kerbol system.\n\nIf you want a universal number system, binary. It is the simplest one, all others are fairly arbitrary. There are cases for base 6 and 60 afaik due to being equally divisible by 2, 3 and 6 (and 4, 5, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30 in case of 60).
