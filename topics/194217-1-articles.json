I am having problems with the lighting/normal maps. I am modeling in Blender 2.8, and I am using the default smooth shading option. My models are very simple and are pretty low-poly, and are very basic shapes. I did not know how to generate a normal map, so I just filled the normal map with the color (127, 127, 255) because that is the color seems to be the default color of the normal map. How do I fix these problems? Here is the Imgur album with in-game screenshots as well as the materials in Unity:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/bc6UUOn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/bc6UUOn\u003C/a\u003E.

You can also click the cube icon under Mesh Display in Blender and it will show the normal\u0027s for all the tris/quads or what ever. For normal maps I use Gimp and create a layer of gray (128, 128, 128). I then add the bumps by drawing shades of gray from black to white. Filters | Map |Normal Map will then change the layer to a normal map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-06T16:23:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2020 04:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by wasml\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
