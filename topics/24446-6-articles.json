Basically, the mod requires that for any mass you teleport to your spacedock, equivalent mass is already present at the spacedock.

(For example, you can ship \u0022Spare Parts\u0022, the resource used by OrbitalConstruction, to the Mun. You land the tanks with Spare Parts one at a time, then use them to build a base on the moon in one piece.

OC is dead slow. Ok, the initial scan for space docks being slow can\u0027t be helped (unless there\u0027s a better way than unpacking and repacking every craft in the game*), but once a space dock is selected, the game becomes almost unusable until the ship is constructed in orbit. The reason for this is clear from KSP.log: OC is checking the dock\u0027s supply of spare parts every frame (and to do so, unpacking and repacking the craft). Why not save the dock\u0027s supply of spare parts with the dock \u0022name\u0022 when first scanning for docks? There is no need to check every frame since there\u0027s no way the supply can change due to the dock being on rails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I sure hope there is, because I suspect the way OC unpacks the ships is breaking my struts and fuel lines.

I doubt it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs another point, undocking a ship from my space dock immediately after constructing another ship (ie, construct ship, switch to space dock (via ]), undock) caused an explosion.
