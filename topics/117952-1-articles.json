I\u0027m not sure what the drill\u0027s collision mesh looks like but a potential issue I see is the drill tipping you when you deploy it. If the drill is not a solid object this wouldn\u0027t happen, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T14:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust treat Gilly like a very large asteroid. Don\u0027t orbit it or try to be super efficient on your landing. Once you\u0027re in the SOI just get moving toward it and \u0022dock\u0022 with the surface with your landing gear.

My station obits Eve at 2000km in Gilly\u0027s plane. Rendez-vous with Gilly is 500 to 600 m/s, then capture and landing. Should fit under 1100/1200 m/s, leaving 250 m/s for docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest Gilly approach is when rendez-vous is made at periaps ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T15:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Warzouz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Warzouz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBest Gilly approach is when rendez-vous is made at periaps ?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour periapsis won\u0027t matter that much. To spend the least fuel as is (reasonably) possible, you should actually just aim to hit Gilly. Once you\u0027re close, burn to stop, pick a place to land, and fly there. The low gravity and time warp issues (i.e., you can\u0027t when you\u0027re too close) combine to make any normal approach unnecessarily time-wasteful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding will take a bit longer than on normal worlds, as you will bounce if you come down at over a couple m/s and going that speed is tough because touching the engines can make you fly off into space. But with practice, thrust limiting, and a ship designed to land on Gilly (not just land, but land on GILLY) and you\u0027ll be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy last Gilly ship had 6 engines: 2 poodles to get there, 2 48-7ses to come in for a landing, and 2 Ants facing upward to give a little push on landing. I could have done it all with just the poodles, but figured the extra mass was worth saving the pain in the neck igniting a Poodle would bring. As it was, I had to thrust limit the 48-7ses down because they were too touchy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T16:53:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith my general lander, I did it with the RCS and time...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
