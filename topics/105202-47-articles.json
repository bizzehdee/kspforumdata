I was not able to see when but found the IsGrouchy flag set to true in the persistent file. I discovered that hewas a tourist in flight on a vessel that had no supplies on board (it was a rescue mission to LKO so I did not thnk it would take longer than a day). I am not sureif he entered the vessel as a pilot or not, but he is now a tourist after he respawned.

Bob stayed in the 3 man command pod on orbit while Val and Bill did the landing portion of the mission. When it came time to separate the ascent module from the lander module, I realised I had goofed in a big way (actually this was the third such realisation in the mission) - I had attached the supplies only to the lander module, on the descent stage (the other such realisations were both remembering that I never got around to attaching fuel lines to the tanks on the lander - so I had to pump fuel around using Ship Roster during each engine burn, for both the descent and ascent stages). I figure, I dont have a lot of options here. KIS is installed, but apparently I didnt bother to bring a screwdriver, so I cant just move the supply containers. I figured seeing as its a short mission in the Kerbin SOI, why worry? The mission has been going on for like 10 hours at this point. These little guys go for like 15 days without supplies if they have to, so it should be fine.\n\nIt was not fine.\n\nI get back to orbit, rendezvous with the command module. No docking ports, we just EVA over to it and board the command module. And the problem becomes clear. According to the USI-LS status window, the command module has been 402 days without supplies. It is 10 hours MET, but somehow the crew are just that hungry. No messages of crew raiding snackboxes (likely because there arent any, oops), and the vessel is still controllable at the moment, although Im not sure if it will be once I switch away from it and come back to it. Im thinking as the mission was only started after installing this version, it should not be due to stuff from the previous version, but perhaps it is. Time to restart and see if I can still control the command module long enough to do the transfer burn back to kerbin aerocapture.\n\nI think the time elapsed since supplies figure is actually the UT figure for the launch time. Like, it says supplies for -402 days - the mission launched on UT day 402.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-02T13:07:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2016 01:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by blu3wolf**"},{"CreatedByName":"CorBlimey","CreatedById":134058,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T14:15:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, akron said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am a little confused from a page or two back.
