Shortly after the KC catastrophe KMC quickly rose to power with the new discovery of kethane, the company halted all research into nuclear reactors and changed its name from NextNuclear to KMC pouring all their funds into researching Kethane as a method of powering Kerbal Cities. Kethane proved to be a wonder substance which could not only power kerbal Cities but when coupled with the right chemicals could be converted into virtually any element known to Kerbals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe KC (Kerbin Crater) Catastrophe:\u003C/strong\u003E Kerbin Crater was once the location of Kerbin City, the capital of Kerbin, centre of knowledge, research and all things Kerbal.

The brothers propose that rather than staying stuck on the ground when it comes to take-off and landing, they could develop a vertical take-off aircraft. KMC shows great interest in this as it would allow them to cut down on the size of their airports while also increasing their daily take-offs, which are as of now limited by the amount of aircraft the runway can handle. The corporation agrees to fund the VTOL space plane project with a significant investment of $20,000 in the hopes they can boost their annual profits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn 12/3/2027 New Horizons debuted their $14,880 VTOL aircraft, the plane showed exceptional vertical lift off capabilities, and although prone to slight forward momentum the engines could be tilted slightly towards the retrograde cancelling out this movement and allowing for a smooth touch down. Its dual pilot cockpit allowed for Bill to be in control of the Vertical movement while Jebediah ensured that the lateral movement remained at a minimum, additionally this allowed for reduced pressure on the pilots as they could share tasks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the flight the craft managed to reach speeds exceeding 1000m/s making it the fastest craft in kerbal history, its high speed capabilities greatly impressed the KMC assessors watching the flight. While at this speed the pilots encountered an unforseen problem with the air pressure in front of the craft raising to such an extent that it combusted, coating the exterior of the craft in a fiery glow. Jebediah decides they should perform a barrel roll to distribute the heat evenly around the plane. While upside down Bill takes a quick photo of the mun using the high zoom camera mounted underneath the cockpit, due to the thin atmosphere they encountered at their altitude the image appears especially clear and is sent back to Mission Control for further analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter 14 minutes of flying the craft reached Mu the relatively unexplored continent on the other side of the Laye Ocean, Bill and Jeb find a relatively flat piece of land situated near a small lake and decide to land there to display the landing capabilities of the craft and run a quick diagnostics. They come in to land plotting a course for landing and engaging the auto-pilot, however, the assessors from KMC request the pilots attempt a manual landing. If they prove a landing can be made without the aid of an autopilot then they could scrap the computer systems and save funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill and Jeb were slightly nervous going into their first manual landing with so much at stake. Airbrakes are engaged as the plane is brought into hover mode with the auto pilot disengaged. This is the defining moment, the plane is slowly eased down as the throttle is reduced, 70m above ground with the throttle set to half way the plane begins to slowly move forward, Jeb rotates the engines to 100 degrees then to their maximum of 120 to counteract the movement. 30m above ground with lower thrust and the forward movement is picking up again, RCS thrusters fire in a vain attempt to slow down lateral speed. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CPulse the engines, this is our only shot\u0022 Bill says, Jeb complies and pulses the engines to counteract the forward movement and get them to the ground faster, 10m, 5m, the front wheel touches the ground just as Jeb went to fire a pulse, the force makes the rear of the plane move upwards as the wheel acts like a pivot. Jeb pitches the plane up desperately trying to counteract and the rear engines grind into the ground ripping them off the plane, with the plane now unbalanced it is now impossible to control \u0022Brace yourself!\u0022 Jeb Yells, as the plane crashes into the ground side wing first, the wing crumples as the weight of the plane comes bearing down on top of it, the cockpit hits the ground now, the impact testing the strength of its welds, it shears off from the rest of the plane, Bill and Jeb holding their seats white knuckled as it comes to a halt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb gets out and assesses the damage, at least they both survived.

They manage to salvage and sell $19,380 worth of parts, giving 30% to the contractors as they had agreed and leaving them with $13,566 to complete their mission, Kepler\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s construction costs approx. $12,355 fully fuelled leaving $1,211 for refuelling and part replacement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrior to its flight the team must test Kepler\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s engines and fairing decouplers to ensure everything they have built is in good working order, given the current fuel costs they can only afford to run one short test on the rocket\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s engines before it is to be launched. The tests all come back positive, the engines and fairings work perfectly although at a price, fairing replacement costs the team approx. $350 while the refuelling costs them a whopping $840 almost draining their budget to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16/7/2027 and Kepler is launched into the fray, having all of its commands pre-programmed into its computer all the team has to do is wait until Kepler passes over Mission Control once more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn its second pass over Mission Control the team gets its first batch of data from Kepler, data continues to be sent for the next 5 days until the map is complete.
