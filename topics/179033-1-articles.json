There is only one real spoiler, so I won\u0027t discuss that. Overall, I thought it was a good movie. Not a great movie, but worth watching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe movie is about Neil, not about Apollo\u003Cem\u003E per se\u003C/em\u003E. It takes a sort of dark path with the death of his young daughter, and shows Neil as a quiet, brooding figure who is driven to move his goal forward. He comes across rather cold in the movie, which I don\u0027t think is very accurate. Buzz comes across as a bit of a jerk, which might be accurate, he was a difficult person by all accounts at that time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnically? The sets for the X-15, Gemini, and Apollo are awesome, though the latter 2 interiors are grossly too weathered. I think they forgot that the ones sitting in museums are USED spacecraft, and that when the astronauts boarded them, they were brand new. There are some other, minor technical errors (contact light call bugged me, you\u0027ll see), but it was generally good in that regard. They got space right (black).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther issues? The music was often too loud, particularly on the Moon landing. I think in general the use of shaky cam was OK for X-15, and for the 7 g ascent of Gemini, but for the LEM they could have created better drama with the landing than they did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KG3","CreatedById":182951,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-17T11:43:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t like the

The movie focuses entirely on Neil and his family life and the struggles he goes through there.\u00A0 That in itself wouldn\u0027t bother me, but there are a few times in the movie where the director takes a few too many artistic liberties with the depiction of some events in order to frame the narrative he\u0027s trying to construct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe look of everything is very nice though.
