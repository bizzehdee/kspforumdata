Drills? Nerfed. Radiators are only good with suddenly exploding tiny parts.\n\nAnd your hot fuel cell idea brings a little life to this heating system that is only affecting Moho and atmospheric entries. I want some hot fuel cells (and RTGs could run a little hot too..)"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T07:16:46Z","Content":"I\u0027ve done it myself.
