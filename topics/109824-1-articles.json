If the player is \u0022the\u0022 Kerbal Space Program, there should be a delay before the rescue contracts start spawning of at least a few days, if not weeks, plus the time required to send someone there (How could you strand someone around Jool two days after I explore Jool?!?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and as I\u0027ve mentioned elsewhere, SQUAD should put in a blurb in the flavor text suggesting that if we decline a rescue, some other agency will take care of it, unless we\u0027re supposed to worry that the Kerbal will be stuck there until it dies :C\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.: I\u0027m also with the others who would like to see a greater variety in upcoming versions, e.g. \u0022Go and deploy the panels for us\u0022.
