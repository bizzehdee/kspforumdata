The occasional in an EVA suit would be OK too. I really do enjoy the rescue missions. I restarted my career with 1.0 release. I have just manage my first Mun landing and unlocking tech level 4 so I have a lot more to do in this career.\n\nMy question is will there be rescue mission to stranded Kerbals around other planets or moons?

Even if I already have several in progress, they seem to just keep spawning, and Kerbals are piling up at my Astronaut Complex. I do admit this is a good problem to have.\n\n- Too soon: as soon as I dare to send a tiny probe to Mun, suddenly I find that Jeb\u0027s Junkyard or whoever has reverse engineered my technology and stranded someone in a retrograde orbit, and now they expect me to go get him. If the player is \u0022the\u0022 Kerbal Space Program, there should be a delay before the rescue contracts start spawning of at least a few days, if not weeks, plus the time required to send someone there (How could you strand someone around Jool two days after I explore Jool?!?).\n\nOh, and as I\u0027ve mentioned elsewhere, SQUAD should put in a blurb in the flavor text suggesting that if we decline a rescue, some other agency will take care of it, unless we\u0027re supposed to worry that the Kerbal will be stuck there until it dies :C\n\nP.S.: I\u0027m also with the others who would like to see a greater variety in upcoming versions, e.g. \u0022Go and deploy the panels for us\u0022. A start could be including a parachute or two on some of the rescuee vessels so we have the option of going there, opening the chutes, and then pushing them down in the ship, or perhaps including a simple tank \u002B engine system so we can go and refuel them instead. If necessary, SQUAD could include a small selection of simple prebuilt ships that would be unavailable to the player (maybe with a game rule setting about it), which would spawn in space the way the current pods do and EVAs did.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T20:57:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 08:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid**"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T21:01:59Z","Content":"\u003E If necessary, SQUAD could include a small selection of simple prebuilt ships that would be unavailable to the player (maybe with a game rule setting about it), which would spawn in space the way the current pods do and EVAs did.\n\nYou mean like...\n\nStock ships?\n\nMadness!"},{"CreatedByName":"BDelacroix","CreatedById":121050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T21:37:57Z","Content":"Seen one for Eve and Duna.
