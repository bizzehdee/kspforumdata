I can now develop light space planes easily, but I have found that larger SSTOs really give me trouble. With that in mind, I have designed the following stock airframe utilizing the Mk3 size components.\n\nCraft file: [http://drive.google.com/uc?export=download\u0026id=0B7woBToR2eXwSTk4MFc5QU5FRlU](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download\u0026id=0B7woBToR2eXwSTk4MFc5QU5FRlU)\n\nScreenshot (with stats): [http://drive.google.com/uc?export=download\u0026id=0B7woBToR2eXwSUlVNWVfdTNrRVE](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download\u0026id=0B7woBToR2eXwSUlVNWVfdTNrRVE)\n\nDesign Goals:\n\n- Stable/Controllable Flight\n- Robust lifting capability (size: 3 unit cargo bay)\n- Docking Capability\n- SSTO (optional: rendezvous, refill, travel to other bodies).\n- Safe return/landing\n\nWhat I\u0027ve got so far:\n\n- The principal flight surface is a delta wing configuration to maximize lifting surface and place the center of lift as far back as possible.\n- RCS and monopropellant with a large capacity for loitering in orbit (may be overkill, but it also puts more weight in the front).\n- Winglets, canards and rear flight control surfaces are large enough to provide fairly robust flight control. After throwing 3x LV-T30 engines on the back to test take off without a load I was able to easily control take off utilizing around 2/3 of the runway.\n- A controlled glide into the ocean was manageable enough to allow the crew cabin to survive sea surface impact at a descent rate of roughly 25 m/s with a forward speed of around 60 m/s.\n\nReally, I will take any sort of advice, but I\u0027m principally concerned with techniques for mounting stock engines in such a way that I have enough thrust and fuel to fly a typical SSTO ascent plan to orbit, dock or deliver payload and return for a safe landing.\n\nThings I\u0027m okay with:\n\n- Intake stacking (but not throwing them everywhere... I can do that ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)) with drag and weight ratios in mind. Typically Ramjet Air Intakes \u003E Circular Intakes \u003E MG-350.\n- Maintaining aesthetics without going overboard with flight surfaces, struts, fuel pump lines, etc.\n\nThings I\u0027m not okay with:\n\n- Debug menu (infinite fuel, clipping allowed)\n- Physics engine exploits (basically no crazy contraptions)\n\nThings I don\u0027t know:\n\n- Pretty much anything new with the Beta (root tool, etc). Still learning the changes and deciphering patch notes.\n- The newer techniques from the last 6 months or so.\n- How to build a large SSTO and properly fuel it to get to space.\n\nI\u0027m learning, but after several failed attempts I\u0027m stumped. Any and all assistance will be much appreciated. Don\u0027t forget, I\u0027m open to any recommendation on the design- not just the engine/fuel/intake implementation!\n\nUpdate: my attempts earlier today were not fruitful. I was successful in adding five turbo jets and intakes that could reach 40k at around 2 km/s, but after attempting to mount two nuclear engines it fell apart from there. My first inclination is to make the craft a horizontally and vertically symmetrical as I possibly can.

Deltas are the most convenient for large structures, but they\u0027re also the least efficient part for the job. The most efficient parts are strakes, structural d, and swept (in that order), but using them results in floppy wings and high part counts. Refer to this chart for wing panel performance by type: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105090-KSP-90-Spaceplane-wing-comparo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105090-KSP-90-Spaceplane-wing-comparo)\n\n I have run 1.0 lift coefficient per tonne of spaceplane previously with good results, but lately I\u0027ve upped that. Now I\u0027m running about 1.5. This cuts down on the induced drag,loss of intake air, and loss of horizontal thrust in the 32-36km region.\n\n A Mk3 spaceplane will still be using turbojet/ OMS rocket combos for maximum efficiency, but it will require multiple engines and multiple intakes to feed them. You will need to design and build to minimize asymmetric air starvation to keep this from ruining your day. Lots of tutorials out there on this subject.\n\n Intakes, like wings, are not all created equal. [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106114-Stock-KSP-90-intake-comparo-for-SSTO-turbojets](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106114-Stock-KSP-90-intake-comparo-for-SSTO-turbojets)\n\n Generally, one turbojet per 15 tonnes and .015 m^2 of intake area per engine are recommended, but I\u0027ve been pushing those boundaries lately. My most efficient designs are using 1 engine per 18 tonnes with .01m^2 of intake per tonne. This gives you just enough turbojet to make 70km apoapsis on jet thrust if you nurse it, with a tiny rocket boost to circularize.\n\n Other than that, basic spaceplane construction techniques still apply. Intakes behind the center of mass, canards instead of elevators, lift/thrust/ mass all in line, yadayada. You just have to scale it and get a little creative.\n\nHTHs,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Zerik0","CreatedById":139467,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T19:38:33Z","Content":"Slashy,\n\nMan, that is a comprehensive and supportive response! I have just begun to post in the forums (usually just a lurker), but I sincerely appreciate it!\n\nWould you be willing to provide some examples of your pre- and post-efficiency-overhaul models? The move to less thrust/more lift/fewer intakes is interesting, and I would love to take a gander at what you\u0027ve done so far. I have to admit that I usually have a much higher intake ratio to get the job done, but I had no idea that lift surface ratio would help so much at those higher altitudes.\n\nMy other issue is scaling up! It seems so easy to build and fly a spaceplane with Mk1 components when you only need one or two of everything in a nice, neat package. Mk2 gave me some problems, but it was a fairly simple adaptation of Mk1. Mk3 has been a beast to figure the things out that you pointed out. I\u0027ll try a little this afternoon to get something going.\n\nThank you much!"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T20:12:35Z","Content":"Zerik0,\n\n Not a problem. That\u0027s what we\u0027re here for ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n My older designs are kinda lost to the sands of time, but I think there\u0027s still some pics floating around.\n\n![Sample8_zpsb45e9327.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/KSP/SP%20tutorial/Sample8_zpsb45e9327.jpg)\n\n This would be an example of an older typical Mk2 design. It could orbit cargo at about $43/ tonne. \n\n![XL%20Series_zps7iaxcdes.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/XL%20Series_zps7iaxcdes.jpg)\n\n These are examples of where I\u0027ve gone since then. They are running about $27/ tonne. As you can see, they\u0027re really just bigger planes running on the same engine as before. re-tweaking the lift/weight allows me to run a little cleaner in the 32-36km range, so I can push more mass.\n\n Reducing the intake area doesn\u0027t actually help any, but it\u0027s surprising how little intake area you can get by with.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T20:29:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 08:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T21:57:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The main problem I had with a conventional wing design of that size was getting the center of lift to stay sufficiently far enough back behind the center of mass. \n\u003E It seemed like the obvious answer was to fly a delta wing so that I could have the majority of the lift surfaces as far back as possible.\n\u003E \n\u003E Of course, my big issue so far has been having to adapt real life designs to the stock physics engine for atmospheric flight.

I\u0027m suggesting, instead of a single delta wing, which puts all your control surfaces at the rear of your aircraft, have a single wing at the rear, with a set of canards up front, similar to this:\n\n![Beech_Starship.jpg](http://www.lakeglenvillemtntop.com/Beech_Starship.jpg)\n\nYou don\u0027t have to put the tank at the back, that\u0027s just normally where I put them because that\u0027s where I think they should go.
