I know you\u0027re wanting to take a step back for a while, but I\u0027m running into some major hurdles in attempting to expand our non-KF part conversions. The biggest of these hurdles comes from the lack of documentation as to what each of the parameters in the various modules does exactly. Some of them are self explanatory, such as the \u0022Name\u0022 fields (susTravName, colliderName, etc.) but fields such as \u0022moveColliderBy\u0022 in OverrideWheelCollider are not quite so easy to figure out, and \u0022spring\u0022, \u0022damper\u0022, and \u0022mass\u0022, while not exactly hard to understand, don\u0027t come with any matching values in the standard part in which to make a guess with a new part conversion.

That\u0027s how I manage to get more suspension travel out of the stock part, for example. Probably the ERS Wheel too, thinking about it... What that bit does is actually translate the wheel collider by the specified amount in the Y axis. This is going to be a little tricky to get a handle on (with them being invisible, and all) without have a good idea of how things generally look in Unity. If I hadn\u0027t moved the collider inside most of the models, I would have ended up with suspension which doesn\u0027t compress enough and extends way past where it should. The small stock wheels are a great example, actually. The default travel is something stupid like .05m. I wanted .2m! So I set the travel and played with the mover module until it all worked nicely and nothing dislocated itself. Hope that makes sense?

Yeah... it\u0027s sad. Anyway, I\u0027ll give it another go later if I feel up to it. Considering all the complexity of RoverDude\u0027s wheel model, there might not be all that much that needs to be overridden really, as long as the KF modules know what the various transform and object names are. The animation is going to be another thing all together, but considering the issues we have with the animation and the functionality of the ERS wheels (I\u0027m unsure, but I think we may still have issues with them actually working and not simply getting stuck in a retracted state no matter what they are visually) I\u0027ve actually been thinking about taking inspiration from the various mods that makes their own animation modules (such as RoverDude\u0027s plugins) and implement a KF-friendly animation module based on those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, you\u0027ll notice I made a new release and already got at least one happy report back, so things are looking up.
