I hope, however, that your mod requires minimal editing to fit into 1.0.\n\nThis seems to be the case. It looks like most of the stock aero and heat calcs are handled through backend code instead of values in the parts. So the adaptors and cockpits should be fine. I wouldn\u0027t recommend using the engines, as those have taken more programming hits, though.\n\nNevermind. The nodes don\u0027t work right.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T07:47:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 07:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CptRichardson**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grunf911","CreatedById":102151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T10:55:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Edit: Grunf I tested the symmetry that you described and I found that mirror symmetry worked fine and both engines point down, but when I switched to radial that was when the directions flipped.

It occured when i was designing this baby:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/c3BrEiXXd7A?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nWhat you need (i am using 0.90 parts):\n\n1. OPT Spaceplane parts\n\n2. B9 Procedural wings\n\n3. MKIV system\n\nSteps to reproduce (2 different cases)\n\n1. Put OPT J-Cockpit and fuselage\n\n2. On the side, toggle radial attachment, MIRROR symmetry and attach Mk2 KFANs (radial to J-fuselage), the fans are displayed correctly\n\n3. Attach Mk2 VTOL Turbines (the F-35 ones) to the KFANs (look at my craft in the video), also mirror symmetry. That is when i got the turbines to flip (after i pressed toggle VTOL in editor)\n\n4. Same thing happens, if i.e. you add B9 Procedural wing, and then on that wing you put Mk IV BIG RADIAL Intakes (ones you can mount mk1 engine on)\n\n(they can be found at [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101699-0-90-Mark-IV-Spaceplane-System-%2814-12-14-important-fixes!%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101699-0-90-Mark-IV-Spaceplane-System-%2814-12-14-important-fixes!%29) - look at IMGUR parts library, page 3/16, the intake that is the rightmost one)\n\n5. When you attach your **mk1 VTOL turbine**(not sure of the name, the non f-35 one) to that intake, you get the same issue\n\nI resolved the issue by putting each engine individually, so its not an issue.\n\nI WILL for sure be making the \u0022making of\u0022 that Valkyrie craft, but due to my lack of available time, it can happen it takes a week or two, so i figured i give you a faster way to reproduce and fix it :-)\n\nAt around 0:35 in the video i am highlighting the VTOL turbines, so you see what parts are being used\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T10:57:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 10:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Grunf911**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dragon1057","CreatedById":142180,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T07:57:06Z","Content":"SO!
