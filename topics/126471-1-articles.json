It consists of two radial Hammers, a reliant with 4 tones of fuel, and a swivel with 2 tones of fuel. dV= 4462. If you dont have these you may not be quite ready. to calculate dV, its dv=lsp(engine)*9,81*ln(mass fueled/mass emptied) do this for all stages to get the sum delta V. Until you get good at launching, I\u0026#39;d say shoot for a delta V above 4000. I also like to send them unmanned with the basic probe head so i don\u0026#39;t waste kerbal lives and know how the thing will fly without SAS, but thats my personal preference.
