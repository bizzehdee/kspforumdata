In one case, I had just come back to a vessel from another one, and there was an odd white disk sitting sort of askew right in the docking port. I decided that it wasn\u0027t \u0022really there\u0022 and ignored it... when I maneuvered the vessel, it went soaring off! Weird. Then, a few days later, I went to pick up a rescuee from the surface of Minmus, and there was one on the ground next to her... again, once things started moving, it went zooming off.
