I\u0027ve also got a rather annoying flashing white shape every now and then in the actual flight scene which might actually be centred on something in kerbin orbit, I guess.

In one case, I had just come back to a vessel from another one, and there was an odd white disk sitting sort of askew right in the docking port. I decided that it wasn\u0027t \u0022really there\u0022 and ignored it... when I maneuvered the vessel, it went soaring off! Weird. Then, a few days later, I went to pick up a rescuee from the surface of Minmus, and there was one on the ground next to her... again, once things started moving, it went zooming off. (I wondered if the Ship of Lights from the old Battlestar Galactica was lurking about somewhere...)\n\n(I have Distant Object Enhancement, and I have recently been experimenting with -force -opengl, so if those have something to do with it, it seems logical.)"}]}
