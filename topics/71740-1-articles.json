I found your short video to be a bit mechanic, but the longer video was very fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour video wasn\u0027t full of \u0022uhms\u0022 and whatnot (which is good), but when they are perfectly scripted and perfectly executed in the same pacing and same tone, they start to get boring and uninteresting. Think of a teacher in school who was monotone and never changed pace: you zoned out after a while. Be entertaining. Be fun. Smile while you talk, as that makes a big difference on the listener\u0027s end. Change volume, change pitch, change pace, and remember: if all I want is information, wikipedia exists. If I\u0027m watching a video, its cause I want something more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideo was great.

I\u0027m with you, I like the informal, but detailed tutorials. But it does seem easier to get people to watch when the length is short. So perhaps it really is best to do these in pairs, with the short video sending people to the longer one.

I don\u0027t know how many videos I\u0027ve skipped over because the presenter had a voice that was simply annoying, or muttered, or had such a heavy accent that even the closed captions made no sense...
