Their ship was broken, so they appeared to be stranded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of them decided to try to get to orbit with his jetpack. He made it pretty easily with over 60% fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom orbit, he changed to an escape trajectory back into Kerbin\u0027s SOI. About 60% jetpack fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeorbited from there to a Kerbin re-entry trajectory with \u0026lt;20% left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter slowing to terminal velocity in the lower atmosphere he tried desperately to use his remaining fuel for a soft landing, but there was no chance of that. The jetpacks are far too weak to overcome Kerbin\u0027s gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, burning the last of the fuel meant his jetpack wouldn\u0027t explode on impact! He hit the ground hard, bounced a few times, twisted into terrible positions, but eventually came to rest, surely dead, but in one piece. Then to my surprise, he actually stood up and was able to walk around again! I don\u0027t know if I just got lucky, or if they\u0027re just immune to all non-explosive injury, but it was quite an adventure!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish I could say it was Jeb that did this, but he died earlier trying to jetpack down to the surface from an orbit that was way too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexL","CreatedById":32200,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-13T08:26:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThats a real feat doing that with just the EVA pack, well done! Yeah, Kerbals suits are extremely impact resistant, especially if they\u0027re going almost parallel to the surface they collide with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
