All this time, the Atmo Efficiency readout was 50-55%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds... wrong, right?

The Mount Everest is less than 10km high, and the air there is already so thin that humans generally need a breathing apparatus to survive (unless you\u0027re an exceptional athlete with a lot of time to acclimatize yourself). And because Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is a lot less high than Earth\u0027s, but has the same suface pressure, that means the air on Kerbin at 10km is even less dense than the air on Earth at 10km. That\u0027ll put your terminal velocity way up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good test for whether or not atmospheric efficiency is calculated correctly is to launch a simple pod and parachute on a small suborbital hop. As you come down, the pod will eventually slow down to terminal velocity; this counts especially if the parachute is out. If atmospheric efficiency then approaches 100%, that means the calculation is performed correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the number as a drag indicator nowadays, by the way, for questions like \u0022should I jettison my fairing now?\u0022.
