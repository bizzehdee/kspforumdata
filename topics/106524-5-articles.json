I click on the Pitch down button secondary input, pitch down on my controller, and nothing happens. Same with all the other axis related commands. I can understand maybe the little mini stick on top, but the joystick itself?  \n\nI checked on a website to see if my joystick was even working in the first place and it seems to say that everything works just fine. So the problem is somewhere between the stick software and the game. And I have a similar situation with the xbox contoller. It doesn\u0027t seem to acknowledge the joystick input commands, but the buttons work just fine.  \n\nI think it is worth mentioning that when I went to the site that was used to calibrate my joystick, it seemed to say that I was getting full input from the mini stick on top of the main stick. Pushing it in other directions only seemed to give it slightly less than full input (sometimes even negative depending on the direction i push it in).
