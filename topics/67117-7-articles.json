It may just be the image, but the grab-latches (I think that\u0027s what they are) on the smallest ring look a little \u0022messy\u0022 for lack of a better word. Also, the round widgets on the outer two rungs look a little \u0022pixel-y\u0022, to me. Again, might just be the image. I generally agree with sentiments that the smaller sizes ought to be thinner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the mass: personally I\u0027d stick with a fairly realistic mass using aluminum or something as the primary material. If people want to tweak it heavier to get better connection strength with KJR, they can just use a modulemanager patch (I\u0027ll even write one if asked).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
