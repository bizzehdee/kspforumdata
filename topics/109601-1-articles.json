I was going to test this new rover I made before I mass produce it and send it to all the planets, but then I saw the [Elcano Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113778-The-Elcano-Challenge-Ground-based-circumnavigation). After not very much thought it was decided that circumnavigating the Mun is the most efficient way to test drive it.![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif) This mission will probably take a while... Let\u0027s get started!\n\n**Part 1**\n\n*-KSC-*\n\nA 400,000 fund rocket takes flight! One booster is missing due to budget constraints (this is my career mode).\n\n![Wv1DTQC.png](http://i.imgur.com/Wv1DTQC.png)\n\nDumping the booster...\n\n![zoAenuP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zoAenuP.jpg)\n\nConfetti\n\n![4IzFoYm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4IzFoYm.jpg)\n\nStage sep! The core stage will return to KSC later, flowed by the upper stage.\n\n![KadQLBM.png](http://i.imgur.com/KadQLBM.png)\n\n*-Somewhere in LKO-*\n\nIn the giant orbital spaceship hangar\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2, a nuclear tug is dispatched, along with a small crewed lander.\n\n![vrKARmd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vrKARmd.jpg)\n\n*-Later-*\n\nThe two ships rendezvous, followed by me messing around docking things together, transferring fuel around, etc.\n\n![chFGssq.png](http://i.imgur.com/chFGssq.png)\n\nThe nuclear tug boosts the rover with it\u0027s skycrane to a Mun encounter.\n\n![R4QhedL.png](http://i.imgur.com/R4QhedL.png)\n\nNext up the crew lander/ship flys off to Minmus. *Wait why Minmus?!* Ah yes, you see, this mission requires a skilled Kerbal to drive the rover, but unfortunately KSC is all out of Kerbals... One which is already in space must be chosen. After careful examination and much discussion, it was decided that Bill Kerman was to accompany the rover, for he has elaborate training in the Art of Repairing Wheels\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2. Bill\u0027s current assignment is to drive a fuel tanker, delivering massive amounts of LF from the minmus refinery to LKO. At present he is enroute to Minmus, but not if I can help it!\n\n![h4uFE4p.png](http://i.imgur.com/h4uFE4p.png)\n\nThat looks about right... .\\_.\n\n![9TIjGgW.png](http://i.imgur.com/9TIjGgW.png)\n\n*-Over the Mun-*\n\n![TPp8quc.png](http://i.imgur.com/TPp8quc.png)\n\n*-Minmus Orbit-*\n\nI mange to catch up to Bill just as he was about to deorbit to the base, now I need to convince him to participate in this new mission.\n\n![IrGP2QP.png](http://i.imgur.com/IrGP2QP.png)\n\nOk Bill is on board, back to the Mun!\n\n![xt4oDMp.png](http://i.imgur.com/xt4oDMp.png)\n\nBill suddenly notices that the ship has 300 m/s delta-v left... uh...\n\n![t5KkeAC.png](http://i.imgur.com/t5KkeAC.png)\n\n*-Later, back in Mun orbit-*\n\nHey Bill, you\u0027re a bit short on fuel, in fact you have none left! Just bail out, I\u0027ll reclaim this ship later.\n\n![FCqfod0.png](http://i.imgur.com/FCqfod0.png)\n\nNow that wasn\u0027t so hard was it?\n\n![o1LAVWr.png](http://i.imgur.com/o1LAVWr.png)\n\nDon\u0027t mind the radiation... it will be fine.\n\n![njsMFYu.png](http://i.imgur.com/njsMFYu.png)\n\n![y2bbV6D.png](http://i.imgur.com/y2bbV6D.png)\n\nLanded... Now decouple the skycrane! The crane is very low on fuel and has to limp back to the nuclear tug in orbit. This crane (if refueled) can land anywhere on the Mun, where the rover may then redock to either refuel for just leave the Mun.\n\n![CX3Xh61.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CX3Xh61.jpg)\n\nSo now a look at the rover. I don\u0027t have any special name for it yet, but I will decide on something soon. This rover was designed for all airless (including Duna) bodys, and as I said before this is the test run. I am aiming for convenience (speed) and reliability (I get grumpy if I have to quickload every 2 minutes). It consists of 6 rover wheels, which alone can speed the rover up to around ~25 m/s. There are 2 Ion thrusters for turbo boost, which can be used for accelerating the rover up to very high speeds and/or for getting up a steep hill. All of this is powered by one of those fancy new solar cell parts. For speeds over 60 m/s (which probably wont happen on this trip) and high impact resistance 4 aircraft rated landing gears are on board (also 1.0 made rover wheel\u0027s brakes almost nonexistent, so this rover cannot stop without the stronger landing gear brakes).\n\n![5ljVaZH.png](http://i.imgur.com/5ljVaZH.png)\n\nThe start... And the end...\n\n![yQEu8j3.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/yQEu8j3.png?1)\n\nThe rover is also equipped with the ore sensor thingy. This handy piece of equipment spits out the current Biome the rover is in, the coordinates, and the ore concentration.\n\n![JOArh3m.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JOArh3m.jpg)\n\nI have left Mechjeb off the rover to make this more hands on.\n\n![rDB6Itv.png](http://i.imgur.com/rDB6Itv.png)\n\nJumping is very common...\n\n![Mee3sIn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Mee3sIn.jpg)\n\nIn my opinion, the Mun is by far the hardest place to rove, because it has those nasty (but neat looking) [procedural craters](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/667-Procedural-Craters). It can be very disastrous (for obvious reasons) to drive off of a 50 to 1000 meter cliff wall (everything gets kinda smeared all over the surface like a swatted fly). I ended up spending a half hour just figuring out the safest way to drive. I settled on speeding up to 20 m/s using the rover wheels (to save fuel) and then boosting the vehicle up to 30-40 m/s with the Ions (and deploying the landing gears). Due to low gravity and very little wheel friction, once up to speed the rover does not stop, and thus needs no further ion/wheel power. That means I may not even have to refuel!\n\n![g3TlC5u.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/g3TlC5u.jpg)\n\nAnd this is what I meant by those \u0022nasty craters.\u0022 Normally when driving a rover you can just drive in a mostly straight direction for hundreds of kilometers, but doing that here means certain death... The course must be carefully plotted to drive around these craters. The course depicted in this image is only about 50 kilometers.\n\n![KO6HIqh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KO6HIqh.jpg)\n\nProgress so far. (displayed path may not be accurate, that is just what I vaguely remember)\n\n![24aCg6u.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/24aCg6u.jpg)\n\n**To Be Continued...**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T03:07:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 03:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketPilot573**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sutternalt","CreatedById":134220,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T05:06:54Z","Content":"Mmmm, the Mun is such a delicious place to rove.

I could get more oxidizer from the Minmus base, but that Tanker is also out of it (it needs BOTH LF\u002BO for the Vernors, which is needed to dock to the base).

Assuming your design can handle 40m/s indefinitely over reasonably good terrain, that means 2500 seconds per 100km, which is 42 minutes. Each step of physical warp reduces this, so 22 minutes at 2x, 14 minutes at 3x, and 10.5 minutes at 4x.\n\nThe trick, therefore is to design a rover that\u0027s stable enough and strong enough to handle all the routine jumps and bumps you\u0027ll get on \u0022reasonably flat ground\u0022 at 40m/s. It also helps to use one of the several methods that let you keep moving without having to hold down a key all that time."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T13:46:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Seriously, how long does it take to drive like 100 km?

Never use that part.\n\nWhat does PSA mean?\n\nAnyway, I\u0027ve never had such problems with the \u0022Ruggedized\u0022 wheels. The main issues I\u0027ve had are it\u0027s low ground clearance and the power of its brakes, which means I always remove the front wheels from the default brakes action group. Otherwise, I prefer it to the long-handled, babypoop-colored ones as being rather tougher, having better traction, and using a bit less power.\n\nBut if you\u0027re interested in high speed for long distances, you can\u0027t beat the Small Gear Bay. It\u0027s the most durable wheel of any reasonably small size, can be made to steer, and its ability to retract means you can simply your ladder arrangement or even do without ladders entirely. The only downside is that it has no drive, which means you need a separate means of propulsion (or a custom ModuleManager patch to apply a motor to it). A separate propulsion system is good in that you don\u0027t have to hold a key down to keep it moving, but OTOH you consume fuel of some sort, which can limit range."}]}
