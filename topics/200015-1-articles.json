He signed up for a final Gilly mission, and it was a success! They (It was a gemini pod with val, too)\u00A0plotted a course home, and after re-entry they hit the stage button. Just a click was heard, and no FWOOSH of parachutes. \u201CUh-oh\u201D said bob, at altitude 1,000 meters, and falling rapidly. In a desperate attempt to land safely, he flipped the capsule, pointy-end down. The docking port and monopropellant tanks weren\u2019t enough, and Bob\u2019s capsule hit the ground at 150 m/s, flattening both Bob and Val. One mistake, made 3 years before their return resulted in another revert to launchpad, only to add 2 radial mount parachutes. (For comedic value, let\u2019s pretend they were the orange ones.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-02T03:37:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2021 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by The wizard of me\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMore words\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daedalus3000","CreatedById":209714,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-03T02:43:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hate it when that happens.
