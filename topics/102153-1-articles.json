Einstein discovered that our universe is actually 4 dimensional with time being the fourth dimension. Hence the idea of 4d \u0022spacetime\u0022.\n\nYou are always moving through spacetime. If you come to rest with respect to the spatial dimensions, you will move through the time dimension at maximum possible speed. However, if you move rapidly through the spatial dimensions, you will find that your travel through the time dimension slows. If you manage to propel yourself to the speed of light (unfortunately impossible since it requires infinite kinetic energy), your travel through time will stop.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T18:34:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sillychris**"},{"CreatedByName":"MrZayas1","CreatedById":95654,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T18:36:29Z","Content":"Time measurement, in 24 hours, 360 days a year, etc, is actually just measurements based on our own relative space. Since we know that Earth\u0027s rotational period is 24 hours, we can divide hours into minutes and seconds to represent how much time has passed. Time is actually an illusion to us, it is a series of causes and effects, caused by the small molecules in our body, set into motion by millions of causes, and millions of effects. Rather than explaining all of this at one time, it is easier to designate it into chunks, like seconds, minutes and hours. So really time, it isn\u0027t overly a measurement. More of just, a human logical explanation of events happening. It\u0027s really a tricky subject. If we were really technical, we would be basing our time on the beginning of the universe, which again, we would bring down to minute amounts of \u0022time\u0022 in order to make it practically useful to us.\n\nDon\u0027t know if this made too much sense, but yeah, time is just an illusion of cause and effect that we put into chunks in order to make it practically easy to use."},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T19:27:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Since we know that Earth\u0027s rotational period is 24 hours, we can divide hours into minutes and seconds to represent how much time has passed.\n\nNot to pick nits, but the Earth rotates on its axis once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds (plus a few fractions of a second). It only appears to rotate (on average) once every 24 hours because we are moving around the Sun at the same time.

It says that dimensions come in sets of three, with each set directly previous to the current one being represented as one point on the new one. So time would be a 4th dimension, and then there would be 5th, 6th, and higher dimensions.\n\nIt\u0027s hard to explain with text.\n\nIt stems from the question, \u0022What is time?\u0022 Seeing how the universe changes over time, what if time has frames? If time is divided up into frames, then each frame could be one point on a different three-dimensional plane. If each frame is one point on a separate plane, then time can be classified as a \u0022super dimension\u0022 or \u0022higher dimension\u0022. If each superdimension then adds onto the others to become a new three-dimensional plane, then this one can be represented as one point on yet another plane.\n\nI don\u0027t know, I\u0027m not a theoretical, well, anything."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T05:43:34Z","Content":"It\u0027s a Stone Age definition.\n\nCurrently: One second = \u0022the duration of 9192631770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two [hyperfine levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfine_levels) of the [ground state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_state) of the [caesium 133](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium) atom\u0022. \u00A9 wiki"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T15:12:39Z","Content":"If there was no life, there would be no need for time, nothing would notice the passing of events.\n\nAs a physicist, i love ignoring the Science for a little while and thinking like that.\n\nTime is pointless.
