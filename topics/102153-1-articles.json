If you come to rest with respect to the spatial dimensions, you will move through the time dimension at maximum possible speed.

Since we know that Earth\u0027s rotational period is 24 hours, we can divide hours into minutes and seconds to represent how much time has passed. Time is actually an illusion to us, it is a series of causes and effects, caused by the small molecules in our body, set into motion by millions of causes, and millions of effects. Rather than explaining all of this at one time, it is easier to designate it into chunks, like seconds, minutes and hours. So really time, it isn\u0027t overly a measurement. More of just, a human logical explanation of events happening. It\u0027s really a tricky subject. If we were really technical, we would be basing our time on the beginning of the universe, which again, we would bring down to minute amounts of \u0022time\u0022 in order to make it practically useful to us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know if this made too much sense, but yeah, time is just an illusion of cause and effect that we put into chunks in order to make it practically easy to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T19:27:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MrZayas1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MrZayas1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESince we know that Earth\u0027s rotational period is 24 hours, we can divide hours into minutes and seconds to represent how much time has passed. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to pick nits, but the Earth rotates on its axis once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds (plus a few fractions of a second).
