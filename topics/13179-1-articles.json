This is considered an \\\u0027Open Alpha\\\u0027 where the game is always evolving and features may come and go at any time, and it also may be plauged with bugs. It is so early in Development I do not think there is any set time of when the game will be fully released but right now they are allowing it for Pre-Order, which allows you access to the Builds when they are finalized and released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically at this time you are playing a game and helping finish it.
