So that\u0027s why I\u0027ve thinked on making better contracts using Contract configurator. These are some ideas \n\n- Unlocking stuff that is more than just one node away in the tree - but tying it to a time-limited contract (so someone can\u0027t game it to keep the part and never do the contract).\n- Multi-part test contracts. Contracts for testing a bunch of related parts all on one vessel (perhaps parts all from one manufacturer).\n- Asteroid part-test contracts - because it\u0027s something stock doesn\u0027t have.\n- Part crash-test contracts. Smash a vessel with the right parts into the ground!\n- Plane part-test contracts. Try to have something that is specific to planes - part test at a specific location in flight, perhaps?\n- Free unlocking of parts when tested (only if the player is playing with part unlocking, and would require c# code).\n\nAlso This is a lot of work so if someone is willing to help me, you\u0027re welcome. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T21:12:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 09:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CosmoBro**"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T02:19:13Z","Content":"Some kind of intelligent grouping of part tests is a good idea (I think a lot of the stock contracts are improved by grouping multiple objectives together, like science reports and maybe some of the milestone-type contracts), along with more sensible test conditions.

There\u0027s a full mod dedicated to doing this type of thing but it\u0027s being done with plugins and is intended to be used for the entire tree. Seeing this come up as a contract you could accept would be fun to do. A couple things to be concerned about would be non-functional parts and mods which add parts without the ModuleTestSubject. For instance, how do you test a girder, strut or 1.25-\u003E2.5 converter? They have no right click menus right now and if you\u0027re getting that tech unlocked along with the rest of the nod then I personally would find that to be problematic. Of course, completing a contract where you have to test 10 or 15 parts and receiving those items you can\u0027t test as part of compensation could be argued too. \n\nThe bigger issue though is handling mods with parts that don\u0027t have the ModuleTestSubject parameter. For instance, I use the Shuttle Engines mod from dtobi/Sarbian and there\u0027s at least one node under the CTT that I can think of that has about 10 or 12 parts added to it from that mod. None of them have the ModuleTestSubject as part of the cfg. I suppose you could do a mass MM patch to cover that but for at least some parts it would loop back around to my first issue here, testing parts that have no normal functionality and how you accomplish that. I don\u0027t know. I do like the idea of opening tech through contracts as well as entire nodes if these problems can be addressed though."},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T21:39:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The bigger issue though is handling mods with parts that don\u0027t have the ModuleTestSubject parameter.

Examples:\n\n1. Science experiments can be tested by recovering science from specific situations/biomes.\n2. Wheels can be tested by landing in a specific location or biome.\n3. Other stuff can be tested just by getting a vessel with those parts into a specific situation/altitude/speed like the stock part test contracts."},{"CreatedByName":"TrainEngie","CreatedById":138031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T04:29:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Multi-part test contracts.

If you need to have struts tested for a node, get the craft to the specified location/situation. Science pieces would be easy and I guess other parts like panels, batteries etc could be treated the same way as structural elements would be."}]}
