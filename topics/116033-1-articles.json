There\u0027s a full mod dedicated to doing this type of thing but it\u0027s being done with plugins and is intended to be used for the entire tree. Seeing this come up as a contract you could accept would be fun to do. A couple things to be concerned about would be non-functional parts and mods which add parts without the ModuleTestSubject. For instance, how do you test a girder, strut or 1.25-\u0026gt;2.5 converter? They have no right click menus right now and if you\u0027re getting that tech unlocked along with the rest of the nod then I personally would find that to be problematic. Of course, completing a contract where you have to test 10 or 15 parts and receiving those items you can\u0027t test as part of compensation could be argued too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bigger issue though is handling mods with parts that don\u0027t have the ModuleTestSubject parameter.
