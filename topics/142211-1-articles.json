If I try to start the game by clicking on the icon, it says that the game could not preload the game manager. If I use the launcher, the launcher crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the Windows version, and I should probably try deleting the mods, but I\u0027ve got \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and HE installed. I\u0027m not sure if this is a mod problem or a patcher problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I used the patcher because it was going to take eight hours to download the game again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help is appreciated.

When I used it the last time, the game had a bunch of random problems, like assets not being there, ships frozen in space firing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, and essentially it breaks your KSP. Luckily is seems to not break saves, but who know. Try downloading a fresh install and port the save over and reinstall any mods you need, and it should work. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
