I definitely suspect that if we were aiming for realism they should be using a lot more power than they currently do, and/or weigh a lot more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISRU for indefinite colony support is definitely a good way of getting around the \u0022100% recycling is stupidly hard\u0022 problem (it is technically possible with sufficient energy input, but the required tech-level is ... high). For this mod we\u0027ve already assumed we\u0027re using TAC-LS, and if we want to do ISRU we either need another mod that handles that, or we need to add it ourselves. The two major ISRU mods that I can think of are Kethane and KSPI, and I\u0027m biased towards KSPI (as you may have noticed). By default, KSPI lets you use the refineries to harvest water from a variety of sources (either oceans, or ice in the soil of various planets and moons) and split it into hydrogen and oxygen (represented as LiquidFuel and Oxidizer, respectively). Using the config I posted earlier for the LqdWater -\u0026gt; Water and Oxidizer \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Oxygen converter modules, you can already use that to indefinitely supply a colony with Water and Oxygen. It\u0027s simple and easy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFood is the tricky part. You don\u0027t just find food lying around on planets the way you do water. Even for acquiring the elements to grow your own food, if you want to be realistic, it needs a fairly long list of substances:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMacronutrients (large quantities): carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMicronutrients (small quantities): boron, chlorine, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, zinc, and nickel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect if we want to maintain both realism and sanity, everything except the primary organic elements (CHON; carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen) should be abstracted away as \u0022minerals\u0022, as suggested by Temeriki. Hydrogen and oxygen are already provided by water. Interestingly, KSPI already includes a way of harvesting nitrogen- the refineries are capable of combining atmospheric nitrogen with hydrogen using the Haber Process to form ammonia. This is actually the primary process used to produce nitrogen fertilizer on Earth- sometimes it\u0027s changed into other chemical forms first, but raw ammonia works too. It does mean that you would be confined to planets with nitrogen-bearing atmospheres, namely Eve, Duna, Laythe, and Kerbin (the latter not being particularly interesting). Carbon dioxide is trickier; KSPI already models it being present in the atmospheres of the aforesaid planets, but there\u0027s no way of harvesting it by default, nor are there tanks for storing it. There are atmospheric scoops for extracting useful gases from planetary atmospheres, however, and with a little config-modding we might be able to convince them to dump CO2 directly into the TAC-LS tanks. That only leaves the \u0022minerals\u0022; there\u0027s obviously nothing for that in KSPI by default. You could just abstract them away, as Temeriki suggested, because to gather water you either have to be landed (for water ice) or splashed down (for ocean water), and you could probably gather the minerals while you\u0027re getting the water. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to go mess around with the atmospheric intakes now.

You\u0027ll need a tank to put the gathered CarbonDioxide in; given that we already have TAC-LS installed, all manned capsules can store a small amount, and any of the oxygen or life support canisters can store quite a lot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly catch: the atmospheric scoops were designed for things like extracting and compressing atmospheric oxygen from Kerbin or Laythe into Oxidizer, or hydrogen from Jool into LiquidFuel, so they require a fairly hefty power input- 6 MW for the \u0022small\u0022 radial scoop and 24 MW for the large, but it otherwise works with extremely minimal modification. The scoops produce resources faster when moving through the air, but launchpad testing shows they work well enough when sitting still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT #2: Ohohoho, this just gets better and better.

The rate at which they\u0027re being consumed should be proportional to the number of kerbals actually on board the ship, however. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TAC-LS life support information window just tells you how long the resources you currently have in stock will last with the current crew. It doesn\u0027t really take into account anything that generates more of said resources (solar panels for electricity, recyclers such as the greenhouse for other resources). What should happen is that if you\u0027re using the recycling greenhouse, the amount of resources onboard should decrease at a dramatically lower rate than the actual rate shown in the window, due to extra resources being generated by the recycler. As an example, say you have the 90% efficient recycling greenhouse and the life support window says you have 20 days of life support in stock. If you wait 10 days, the life support window should say you now have 19 days of life support in stock, because additional resources were put back in by the recycler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a little confusing, but if you know how efficient the recycler is it\u0027s easy enough to calculate your actual life support time remaining (if the recycler is running, multiply by 1/(1-e), where e is the efficiency of the recycler- in the example given, e would be 0.9, so you multiply by 10x).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-21T22:26:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2014 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ArcFurnace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smart013","CreatedById":106088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T08:22:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much!
