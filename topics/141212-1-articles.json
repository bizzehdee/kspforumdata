Places where you could build rockets, recruit Kerbals, and access a copy of the Mission Command center (offering different contracts on different bodies is just asking for trouble). However, building and launching rockets from those space centers would be incredibly expensive, at least at first. And upgrading buildings? Possible, absolutely, but you\u0027d need to take a few really high-paying contracts before even considering the level 2 VAB on Vall, for instance. The implication is that other companies are shipping rocket parts to your extraplanetary bases, at a cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to how it all would be built... I think it would be easiest for the game to pre-define available locations on the various bodies. You wouldn\u0027t have complete freedom as to where to build your space center, you would have to choose between pre-defined locations. A specific crater on the Mun. A flat-topped mountain on Eve. A plain on Duna. Just like how the KSC, the Inland Space Center and the Island Runway are all in pre-defined locations on Kerbin. Discovering those pre-defined locations would require a survey scan of the planet, maybe even painting a flag to demonstrate to the higher-ups that it is possible to land there. Maybe even returned surface samples. That would certainly make an Eve base a proper challenge to establish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe facilities could be built by bringing the necessary parts to the pre-defined locations, after which they would be converted to regular buildings. Maybe you\u0027d have to pay both Science and Funds to erect the buildings once parts were in place. Buildings could include ore mines, refineries and factories, to bring down the cost of fuel and parts. Maybe you\u0027d even have to construct solar arrays or reactors too, then again that might change the genre of the game too much. Maybe just have an upgradeable \u0022life support\u0022 building, which has to be upgraded before other buildings can be upgraded?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, no matter how it\u0027s done, I agree that Kerbalkind should strive for a permanent presence outside Kerbin. Not only would it give the game long-term goals to reach for, it would also make interplanetary exploration less daunting. After all, you don\u0027t need much delta-V to get to Duna if you launch from Minmus. From a Dres base Jool is not far beyond reach. Reach Laythe, and you can launch to Eeloo and planets beyond. With extraplanetary bases, transfer windows become less of a hassle too. There would always be some transfer window open somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporized Steel","CreatedById":108520,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-09T11:11:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought about the same idea aswell. The way I would like to see this implemented is this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRequire your space program to haul necessary building materials, containers and structural pieces to the target planet.
