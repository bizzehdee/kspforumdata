I made a nice little two-stage lander that works wonderfully, but it requires fuel lines. I can\u0027t drop it onto the interstage fairing base unless I use SelectRoot to set the bottom engine (or decoupler) as the lander\u0027s root part - which screw up the fuel lines. There\u0027s no way to fix them because the decouple shroud is in the way. Can anyone suggest how to get a pre-built lander onto the fairing base?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe normal root part is the top docking port (because who honestly builds rockets from the bottom up?) so when I try and bring it in, it snaps to the command module\u0027s bottom node (where the fairing\u0027s top node should be). This causes the rocket to spring and bend, which does not happen when the command module is simply anchored to the fairing\u0027s top node. I hope this made sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T15:57:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis MM config changes everything to 1m large step and 0.1m small step, for Realism Overhaul.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[KzResizableFairingBase*]:FOR[ProceduralFairings]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\t@MODULE[KzFairingBaseResizer]\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t size = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t diameterStepLarge = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t diameterStepSmall = 0.1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[KzInterstageAdapter2]:FOR[ProceduralFairings]\u003Cbr\u003E{\t\u003Cbr\u003E\t@MODULE[ProceduralFairingAdapter]\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t baseSize = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t topSize = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t diameterStepLarge = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t diameterStepSmall = 0.1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[KzThrustPlate]:FOR[ProceduralFairings]\u003Cbr\u003E{\t\u003Cbr\u003E\t@MODULE[KzThrustPlateResizer]\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t size = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t diameterStepLarge = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t diameterStepSmall = 0.1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\t@MODULE[KzNodeNumberTweaker]\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t radiusStepLarge = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t radiusStepSmall = 0.1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-15T16:07:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2014 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AndreyATGB\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"e-dog","CreatedById":73796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T16:04:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe same parameters for ProceduralFairingAdapter module, except baseSize/topSize instead of size.
