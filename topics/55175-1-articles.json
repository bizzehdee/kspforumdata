The former tends to happen when you have certain parts (most notably the cubic octagonal strut part) in the midst of a ship\u0027s construction; this tends to result in bad things all on its own, and during docking often results in the ship just ripping apart. Model load jitter is a lot easier to identify: when an object is loaded into the physics engine, it has its coordinates corrected very quickly by the engine. This causes the craft to jerk about a bit as it adjusts to its new real-space position. On the surface of a body, if the shift is too dramatic, this will cause explosions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The former problem is apparently being fixed (or has been already for 0.23; I don\u0027t know for sure). The latter problem... well, that will require a bit of a rewrite in positioning logic when loading physics models.
