Specifically about landing aircraft on ships. Since KSP is mostly a sandbox game about aviation and rocketry, it only seems prudent that a maritime pack support both of these. What I am bouncing around in the brain is a series of \u0027add-on\u0027 packs that add a collection of new parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E I shall explain. Early in my KSP experience I fell in love with the B9 pack. It was great. At some point, B9 became hugely popular and it\u0027s dev\u0027s just kept adding more and more parts to the pack. IMHO, B9 is now to the point that it\u0027s so bloated with things I\u0027d never use (like the HX parts) that I uninstalled it many months ago.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve come to the conclusion that the ultimate solution would be a basic part pack, much like what Maritime is now. You get everything you need to have ships. Then, create add-on\u0027s, which also remain independent, like a carrier pack.\n\u003E \n\u003E In this idea, you\u0027d have a Maritime Pack folder under GameData with the basic parts. If you added on the Carrier Pack, for example, it would duplicate some parts in the Maritime Pack folder, but not all, and add it\u0027s own CarrierPack folder. That way, each could remain independent, yet, if the user chose to install both, they wouldn\u0027t end up with duplicate parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E By doing this, if you, the end user decided they wanted carriers but not yachts, you wouldn\u0027t have to install the entire collection of parts. But, if you did want yachts, you could install both. This is what I think B9 should have done a long time ago. Let me choose what to install and not just dump hundreds of parts on me.\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s the theory. So, reverting back to this being an aviation and rocketry game, I think carriers and... floating landing pads (ala SpaceX\u0027s barge) should be pretty high on the priority list.\n\u003E \n\u003E Since I have conveniently created a connection node on top of the basic hull, the current theory is to first, create a wide-body ship design and second, to create snap-on carrier decks that essentially bolt to the top of wide body deck. You\u0027d end up with something much like the old carriers, which did just that... bolted a flight deck to a normal ship hull.\n\nI think that\u0027s a great idea! Have you considered a rocket landing barge part with a \u0022K\u0022 inside a bulls-eye, like on the spacex barge?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T01:45:37Z","Content":"Um...

And that\u0027s where the compressed water came from. The reason the blisters were originally in the fuel tank section is that I was attempting to create an extreme low density fluid to counteract balance. It didn\u0027t work.\n\nThat being said, the compressed water will submerge most anything given enough of it. The problem is, once submerged weight causes massive drag. If you want an example, mount a bitt on the bottom of a boat and fill it with compressed water and see how fast you move.\n\nSo, the submerging part isn\u0027t a problem. Enough propulsion to overcome the incredible drag is.\n\nThe other option is to put wheels on a vehicle and drive along the bottom. You can sorta get decent speeds. But, here\u0027s the next issue. Take the bathysphere and drop it in the ocean and dive to 1000\u002B meters. If you\u0027ve never done that, you\u0027re in for a bit of a surprise.\n\nFor now, I\u0027ll say I keep thinking about it but no solutions yet.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E We do have bathyspheres, which are, well, primitive submarines, sortof.\n\u003E Anyways, heres a bug that I\u0027ve been noticing, the compressor and decompressor have both of their buttons active at first.\n\nIt\u0027s not really a bug as I would term it, it just offers both buttons at first. Once you click one they start working right. I\u0027ll look into it a bit more though. BTW, the bathysphere has them built in. No need for external mounted ones.\n\nAnd the IVA\u0027s are Squad\u0027s default IVA\u0027s. I\u0027ve looked at the model for the Bathysphere one and... wow. Dunno if I\u0027ll get that far into modelling... IVA\u0027s are... scary.\n\nThere is [Camera Tools](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/190/Camera%20Tools) which lets you mount external cameras and switch around between them. Works pretty nice actually.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think that\u0027s a great idea!

I\u0027ve made some outriggers to add some stability but they\u0027re not working quite right yet. And next will be to create a bolt-on flight deck. Expect something like the pic I showed earlier. Something big enough for one... smallish plane.\n\nAs for arresting gear, I won\u0027t even try. With air brakes and parachutes now working, well... make a long boat. For taxiing, KAS winches would be my recommendation. Land then winch the plane backward to launch again. An again, for pitching around on the deck, KAS. Add some ground connections to the deck and pipe to the plane. KAS struts to tie it down.

Anyone who creates a mod, I\u0027m learning, deserves honest recognition. It ain\u0027t easy. Yours, just wasn\u0027t my cup-o-tea. And since I can\u0027t even being to code in C#, I\u0027m having to look at alternate solutions to solving the same problems you had to solve. If you look back in this post, you\u0027ll see at least one guy already trying to land an aircraft on a ship. So yea, I\u0027m beginning to grasp that modding parts is a fine balance between what you want to do and what everyone else wants. Dunno if I\u0027ll succeed but, I\u0027m having a blast making these parts none the less.\n\nAnd, if you look close, you\u0027ll see I\u0027m no texture artist either. I spray some colored pixels around and if it looks somewhat presentable... I\u0027m done. I may go back later and redo all these, but for now... I\u0027m having too much fun making and testing the parts to worry about realism. For now, I\u0027d rather have somewhat presentable parts out in the hands of the players than spend weeks detailing one part down to the last pixel.\n\nThanks for stopping in, always glad to see an old salt. Fair winds...\n\nAnd speaking of carriers...\n\n**Currently in testing...**\n\nThe Escort Carrier (CVE)\n\nSo, I said something about carriers. Well... \n\nDuring WWII, the CVA (Attack Carrier) was in huge demand. Unfortunately for most countries, there weren\u0027t a lot of them to go around. Plus they were expensive to build and operate and took ages to construct. As a stop-gap, many countries commandeered cargo ships and bolted a flight deck on top of them. Known as [Escort Carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Escort_carrier), the US alone built over 180 of them. Though they were slow and small, they still played a vital role in the war.\n\n**Ladies and gents, I present the Kerbal Escort Carrier** (though I probably should have named it a micro carrier)\n\n![CVE.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/CVE.jpg)\n\nIn the tradition of the CVE, this carrier too is built atop a standard hull from the Maritime Pack. Using the connection nodes on the deck of the hulls, you simply snap the CVE deck in place. \n\nAt the moment, it consists of 4 parts:\n\n1. The center deck, designed to fit on the Clipper Hull.\n2. The CVE Bow, designed to fit on the Clipper Bow\n3. The CVE Stern, designed to fit on the Clipper Powered Stern\n4. The CVE Bridge, a command pod designed to fit on the Clipper Hull\n\n![CVE-Build.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/CVE-Build.jpg)\n\n**Ok, so it sorta looks like a carrier but can you land a plane on it???**\n\nI can tell you this. I now know why all of the carrier pilots I met in my life looked like they had too much caffeine.\n\n***At 3km away, it\u0027s a speck in the ocean***\n\n![CVE1.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/CVE1.jpg)\n\n***At half a klick, it\u0027s just a big dot***\n\n![CVE2.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/CVE2.jpg)\n\n***1/4 kilometer, my god that\u0027s tiny***\n\n![CVE3.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/CVE3.jpg)\n\n***BRAKES!!!!!***\n\n![CVE4.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/CVE4.jpg)\n\n***Ok, KSP rarely gives me an adrenaline rush but... that did it!***\n\n![CVE5.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/CVE5.jpg)\n\n***And plenty of flight deck for a launch***\n\nOne of the cool things I discovered is, when you land on this lil CVE with the brakes on, it shoves the ship forward. If you then, release the brakes on your plane, you roll backward. Makes getting more flight deck to launch from pretty easy.\n\n![CVE6.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/CVE6.jpg)\n\n***And takeoff.***\n\n![CVE7.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/CVE7.jpg)\n\nSo there you have it folks. In the next beta release, a carrier.\n\nOh, and an outtake... that was my third attempt to land on the CVE. Here\u0027s a pre-texture test to see if landing a plane on it would sink it. I crashed, but the CVE kept floating along...\n\n![CVE8.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/CVE8.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T01:44:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 01:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T01:47:14Z","Content":"that CVE looked way bigger (more like KSCs runway width) until I actually saw the planes barely fit on it.

One reason I ask is I only know of two parts in the whole pack that even generate heat and it wold take a lot of work to overheat them.\n\nThat and if you would, show me a pic of your design in the SPH\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-21T00:43:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2015 12:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T00:46:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wold you mind trying to remove various parts and see if you can find the offender?

It seems the buoy is broken and is spawning my ships underwater. This caused the new ship to fly out of the water, and fall back in destroying the cargo bridge while capsizing. After reverting and loading up the CVE design again, the game lagged so I could see that the exact same happens to it, but the carrier parts freak out when they are submerged causing the issue.
