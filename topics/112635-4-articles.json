Specifically about landing aircraft on ships. Since KSP is mostly a sandbox game about aviation and rocketry, it only seems prudent that a maritime pack support both of these. What I am bouncing around in the brain is a series of \u0027add-on\u0027 packs that add a collection of new parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI shall explain. Early in my KSP experience I fell in love with the B9 pack. It was great. At some point, B9 became hugely popular and it\u0027s dev\u0027s just kept adding more and more parts to the pack. IMHO, B9 is now to the point that it\u0027s so bloated with things I\u0027d never use (like the HX parts) that I uninstalled it many months ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve come to the conclusion that the ultimate solution would be a basic part pack, much like what Maritime is now. You get everything you need to have ships. Then, create add-on\u0027s, which also remain independent, like a carrier pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this idea, you\u0027d have a Maritime Pack folder under GameData with the basic parts. If you added on the Carrier Pack, for example, it would duplicate some parts in the Maritime Pack folder, but not all, and add it\u0027s own CarrierPack folder. That way, each could remain independent, yet, if the user chose to install both, they wouldn\u0027t end up with duplicate parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy doing this, if you, the end user decided they wanted carriers but not yachts, you wouldn\u0027t have to install the entire collection of parts. But, if you did want yachts, you could install both. This is what I think B9 should have done a long time ago. Let me choose what to install and not just dump hundreds of parts on me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the theory. So, reverting back to this being an aviation and rocketry game, I think carriers and... floating landing pads (ala SpaceX\u0027s barge) should be pretty high on the priority list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I have conveniently created a connection node on top of the basic hull, the current theory is to first, create a wide-body ship design and second, to create snap-on carrier decks that essentially bolt to the top of wide body deck. You\u0027d end up with something much like the old carriers, which did just that... bolted a flight deck to a normal ship hull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that\u0027s a great idea!

And that\u0027s where the compressed water came from. The reason the blisters were originally in the fuel tank section is that I was attempting to create an extreme low density fluid to counteract balance. It didn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, the compressed water will submerge most anything given enough of it. The problem is, once submerged weight causes massive drag. If you want an example, mount a bitt on the bottom of a boat and fill it with compressed water and see how fast you move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the submerging part isn\u0027t a problem. Enough propulsion to overcome the incredible drag is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other option is to put wheels on a vehicle and drive along the bottom. You can sorta get decent speeds. But, here\u0027s the next issue. Take the bathysphere and drop it in the ocean and dive to 1000\u002B meters. If you\u0027ve never done that, you\u0027re in for a bit of a surprise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, I\u0027ll say I keep thinking about it but no solutions yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smjjames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smjjames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe do have bathyspheres, which are, well, primitive submarines, sortof.\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, heres a bug that I\u0027ve been noticing, the compressor and decompressor have both of their buttons active at first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not really a bug as I would term it, it just offers both buttons at first.

If you look back in this post, you\u0027ll see at least one guy already trying to land an aircraft on a ship. So yea, I\u0027m beginning to grasp that modding parts is a fine balance between what you want to do and what everyone else wants.

Besides that there are no other mod parts aside from the ones this pack has. My tanker ship in the previous unit had these parts (plus a LLL Comms tower) and worked perfectly fine, so I do not believe the mods parts are the culprit. Also, there are no parts on the actual hull and deck aside from the bitts, buoyancy blisters, and vernors for turning.

Besides that there are no other mod parts aside from the ones this pack has. My tanker ship in the previous unit had these parts (plus a LLL Comms tower) and worked perfectly fine, so I do not believe the mods parts are the culprit. Also, there are no parts on the actual hull and deck aside from the bitts, buoyancy blisters, and vernors for turning.
