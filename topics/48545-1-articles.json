Basically, when you plan a course that would result in a planetary, solar, or lunar flyby, the planner would show your course further, after you escape the flyby-body\u0027s SOI, thereby allowing you to include the gravity slingshots into your flightplan. With this, you could for example use the Mun to save on required delta-v during interplanetary travel or use Kerbol to reach Jool or Eeloo with less fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-16T00:32:41Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2013 12:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by szputnyik\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T00:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt does that already doesn\u0027t it? blue for current orbit, yellow for next SOI, purple for SOI after that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T00:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you really need it, you can even increase the number of predicted orbits in the settings .cfg\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T00:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I set it at ... 8 I think?

I\u0027m not sure if the maneuver node improvement mod does anything to change this though. You have to get pretty close to the planet in question for it to have a big effect, but it does work. You can see a Jool gravity assist here. I\u0027m on an escape trajectory away from Kerbin now, the first node is a correction for the Jool intercept, after that you can see how my orbit takes a sharp turn after I hit Jool in the upper right part. Then there are a bunch more nodes to get to Eeloo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Eeloo/Return/2013-10-14_00011.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u00222013-10-14_00011.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-16T01:28:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2013 01:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Person012345","CreatedById":33728,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T06:35:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs said it already does this, so I\u0027m not sure if this has anything to do with what he\u0027s talking about instead: For me, when I get an encounter with say, the mun on the way out of kerbin, this causes my \u0022closest approach\u0022 markers for the target planet to disappear (even if very little about the resulting solar orbit has changed). It\u0027s a giant PITA and would mean that I would not be able to use gravity assists if I wanted so I figure it might have some relevance to what he\u0027s trying to get at maybe. I should note that I have to do more testing to make sure it isn\u0027t just pulling my inclination too far out of whack, although the inclination tolerances for closest approach markers seem very weak.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-16T06:38:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2013 06:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Person012345\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
