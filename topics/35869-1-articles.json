As far as i know SOI transitions are performed normally. As long as you do the transfer burns close together, they will all arrive relatively close together as well (although the difference will expand to a few days, which is great because you will have plenty of time to aerobrake and set each vessel up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest installing Kerbal Alarm Clock, you can schedule maneuvers for your flights and it will alert you (and restore the maneuver) when the vessel comes close to it, even if it\u0027s not focused.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T12:27:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnattended ships will cross SOI boundaries, yes. The only problem is that ships can sometimes alter their courses when they cross SOI boundaries under time warp (especially high time warps), so I always like to focus on each ship as it crosses into a SOI so I can sneak them across the border at 1x speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm clock has been very helpful to me during multiple transfers when they are going on in multiple places at once...not as vital when all your ships are going to the same place and nothing else needs attention. You can spread out your launches over a couple days to help prevent having to handle everything at once.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sturmstiger","CreatedById":60543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T12:27:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust launch all of them to LKO before the transfer window, and do the transfer burn one by one when the window opens. Usually if you do the transfer burn within a couple of days from the optimal time, your may spend a just few tens of m/s of extra deltaV compared to the theoretical minimal deltaV transfer. Also they may arrive a few days apart which is often a good thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SZDarkhack","CreatedById":57439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T12:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe only problem is that ships can sometimes alter their courses when they cross SOI boundaries under time warp (especially high time warps)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is absolutely true, crossing a SoI boundary at 100000x warp can be so bad that it ejects you from the solar system (around Jool for instance), so make sure you pay attention to that (or have KAC slow down the warp for you).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0x7be","CreatedById":71709,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T13:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for you posts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout alarm clocks : I\u0027ve never used it before.

It allowed me to juggle between a land and return mission to Gilly, 6 launches to Duna and 7 (or 8?) to Laythe at the same time. Also it saves and restores maneuver node data which allows for much simpler and less time-consuming flight planning as you don\u0027t need to recreate those even if you exit the game and not play it for days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, this is pretty much the one utility mod the features of which IMO have to be integrated into the stock game.
