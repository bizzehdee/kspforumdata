All my games, including Silent Hunter 4 and Skyrim (heavily modded) work beautifully, or, at least exactly as well as they used to (SH4 still demands that I load it from an SSD to avoid as many looping sounds when loading games as possible). However, when I made the upgrade from Windows 7, I had the upgrade process remove all my old programs and drivers. For me, it was a necessity. My Windows 7 installation had end of life issues, and attempting to carry over old programs was causing BSOD issues, so I decided to cut my losses and upgrade without them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you decide to make that choice, which I feel is probably a good idea if you want to make absolutely certain that everything will work on the other end, you should know that Windows 10 will make a list of every program it uninstalled. It also doesn\u0027t actually delete very much, and things like your old Programs folders will be renamed so that you can still access all the old program files they contained, and reinstall them locally if you wish. It does seem to delete that stuff after a while though, not sure how it works, though I am now down a significant number of screenshots taken in steam (though I\u0027ve been uploading all the good ones, so it\u0027s not a big loss for me). Windows 10 has also been very good about finding the correct drivers for everything, including vendor specific stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are privacy settings you will want to tackle to personal taste once you have Windows 10 up and running, and some things like the start menu will take a little getting used to, or you might decide to roll with the new style. The only things that are really getting on my nerves are the loss of the desktop widgets, and their insistence on calling all programs \u0027apps\u0027 now. I grew accustomed to having an easily visible readout of my GPU and Network states, and I\u0027ve not found a suitable replacements yet, particularly for the network monitor. As for \u0027apps\u0027, I just don\u0027t like the name.

Things held together as I expected them to, though I had to upgrade my network adapter drivers to maintain VLAN support.

The Build 1511 installer did the same thing as it was like an in-place upgrade too. It kept drivers for things it didn\u0027t, such as my AverMedia capture card, but the Win7 driver worked. It didn\u0027t uninstall anything on me\u00A0except for Media Center, but it provided a DVD Player app to replace it,\u00A0a $15.00 value, for no charge.
