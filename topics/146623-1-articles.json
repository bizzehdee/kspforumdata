Anyone got suggestions? These mods must either have an archived link to the 1.0.0 version of the mods, or must be backward compatible with 1.0.0 (not sure if this is possible).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I would really like remote tech, but I cannot find any link to the 1.0.0 version :(.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-27T01:32:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2016 01:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by nascarlaser1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-27T09:05:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re not going to find much in the way of mods for 1.0.0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason: That version lived only three days. Then it was supplanted with a significant bugfix update (1.0.2). During those three days, only a small subset of mods with really zealous authors, plus those mods that were compatible anyway, declared themselves updated. Your best bet is probably to browse the version history of mods on SpaceDock, but don\u0027t expect too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, why not update to at least 1.0.2? 1.0.0 had some critical issues, which that version fixed. Another good version to take is 1.0.4, which came out a little over a month later, but lived a very long time. So a lot of mods updated to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your answer is \u0022I can\u0027t update because I\u0027m playing the demo, which is stuck at 1.0.0\u0022: be advised that the demo is locked down and cannot be modded at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
