Personally I think this would be a good idea to have stock. It would save me from having mother-ships with 8\u002B nuke engines on them.

(For example you have one small IRSU that fits into a 1.25M stack and can only convert ore into one fuel type.) So you would have \u003Cstrong\u003Ethree 1.25M refineries, one for liquid fuel, one for oxidizer and one for mono propellant.\u003C/strong\u003EBalancing might come with the fact that these are slower or require more power. It would also make sense if these were unlocked before the combo IRSU. This isn\u0027t one of the ideas that I think is more necessary or potent, but it would be sort of cool to have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about an \u003Cstrong\u003Einline monoprop engine\u003C/strong\u003E. The game has a (dare I say this pun) stellar selection of standard bi-propellant rockets. We need a few more monopropellant engines to level the playing feild, since they are such a novel concept and I have found them so useful. I imagine something similar in profile to the LV-909 with the 1.25M profile a little more thrust.While I\u0027m at it, can we get a \u003Cstrong\u003Emore powerful mono-propellant RCS \u003C/strong\u003Eblock? I see a lot of stock-alike mods with this implemented. Simply put it should probably have about 8-10 thrust and could keep that angular design that most RCS blocks have.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMore 2.5M habitat modules for things like lavatories, sleeper modules, dining modules, greenhouses, engineering stations, etc\u003C/strong\u003E would be awesome, and give a nice means to flesh out space stations and planetary bases.
