Personally I think this would be a good idea to have stock. It would save me from having mother-ships with 8\u002B nuke engines on them. I envision a 2.5M nerv engine with ~300 thrust with the same ISP. If squad thought the idea was unbalanced in the past, they can fix it now by making the large nuke engine more expensive.\n\nA **.675m and 3.75m nuke engine** would be nice too, but the 2.5M one is on the top of my most-wanted stock parts list.\n\nWhile I\u0027m on the subject of nuclear engines, I know a lot of people have asked for this since the release of 1.0 and the change to nuke engines only using liquid fuel. We should really have **dedicated Fuel/Oxidizer tanks**, so that I don\u0027t have to incorporate plane parts into my interplanetary mothership. Don\u0027t get rid of the current tanks, or the plane parts, just add a few new ones that hold just liquid fuel or just oxidizer. Though on the top of the priority list is a **2.5m tank that holds only liquid fuel**, made to go with the 2.5M nerv engine that squad will never make...![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\nI also considered the idea of smaller dedicated IRSU modules. (For example you have one small IRSU that fits into a 1.25M stack and can only convert ore into one fuel type.) So you would have **three 1.25M refineries, one for liquid fuel, one for oxidizer and one for mono propellant.**Balancing might come with the fact that these are slower or require more power. It would also make sense if these were unlocked before the combo IRSU. This isn\u0027t one of the ideas that I think is more necessary or potent, but it would be sort of cool to have.\n\nHow about an **inline monoprop engine**. The game has a (dare I say this pun) stellar selection of standard bi-propellant rockets. We need a few more monopropellant engines to level the playing feild, since they are such a novel concept and I have found them so useful. I imagine something similar in profile to the LV-909 with the 1.25M profile a little more thrust.While I\u0027m at it, can we get a **more powerful mono-propellant RCS** block? I see a lot of stock-alike mods with this implemented. Simply put it should probably have about 8-10 thrust and could keep that angular design that most RCS blocks have. **** \n\n**More 2.5M habitat modules for things like lavatories, sleeper modules, dining modules, greenhouses, engineering stations, etc** would be awesome, and give a nice means to flesh out space stations and planetary bases. I love the IVA look of the current laboratory and would love to see more views and modules similar to that. They would also be awesome for incorporating into contract requirements for bases/stations. It would also be fun to have them in contract requirements for tourism. (Example: Visit a dining module on Duna) Also, think of all the snacks jokes that could be made if we had a dedicated dining module.\n\n**A Magnetometer, Spectrometer and Surface Analyzer** would be new science experiments. Pretty straightforward what each one can do. Magnetometer meausres the magnetic field of a planet/moon. Spectrometer preforms spectral analysis to determine things such as surface and atmosphere composition. Surface Analyzer allows you to preform a rudimentary analysis on soil samples. (Good for probes/rovers, not so useful for manned missions)"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T23:21:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E More 2.5M habitat modules for things like lavatories, sleeper modules, dining modules, greenhouses, engineering stations, etc would be awesome, and give a nice means to flesh out space stations and planetary bases.
