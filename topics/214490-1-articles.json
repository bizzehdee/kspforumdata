It would give us engineering control over how beefy a connection between parts has to be based on where exactly the connection is. Part connections with lots of weight on top need more beef, than connections with little weight higher up on the rocket.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis simple tool would beef individual welds up while maintaining game balance with adding mass to the rocket. This tool would only work on weldable parts of course like tanks and other structural components. At max. weld strength it could \u003Cu\u003Eoptionally\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0weld two parts into one reducing the part count in game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this sounds a bit complex for a game but if you think about it it\u0027s a much more intuitive solution than autostruts. The devil is in the details though in terms of implementation. Good luck with that,\u00A0I\u0027m just an armchair dev!\u00A0 Any\u00A0thoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cQe1RrO.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/cQe1RrO.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
