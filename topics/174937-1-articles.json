And when I say resource system, I\u0027m not referring to memory allocations or anything along those lines, I\u0027m referring to vessel resources (ore, metallic ore, substrate, etc...). So... what are people doing to reduce lag and make their bases functional? Right now, I\u0027ve got 3 bases on the mun. 2 are automated mining bases and are completely lag-free. My 3rd base is too monolithic, and I know that\u0027s a large part of the problem. It handles all of the conversions from base mineable resources all the way up to finished products (material kits, specialized parts, machinery, supplies, colony supplies). The lag is at the point where I can still deal with it, but becomes frustrating over longer periods of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo.. the question is... what are the best ways of handling these issues?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know I need to separate out many of the components of my monolithic base. I\u0027m just curious if anybody has more knowledge about what needs separated and what will result in the performance increases. As an example, I was reading through a post that mentioned part of the problem is that a lot of the resource requests in KSP run in O(n^2) (or possibly worse). If this is the case, it might be a significant benefit to literally just take and have 10 bases that are relatively small in the same area because they\u0027re not hurt by that O(n^2) algorithm by keeping their part counts low. But I don\u0027t know if there are other issues that might make large numbers of individual bases in the same area problematic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, there are issues (due to using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E:LS) involving needing to put life support parts on all of these crafts (or at least on one craft\u00A0within 150 meters of a cluster of others, as crafts within that range share at least some life support structures though I\u0027m still not sure if they share colonization modules). This means that in order to fix a lag-problem within a game, I\u0027ve actually gotta be less efficient than otherwise makes logical sense which is frustrating and so I\u0027ll admit I\u0027m trying to balance my frustration over trying to handle lag vs. the frustrating which is going to be caused by adding otherwise unneeded life support systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are other solution to this problem? Am I even on the right track or is there a simple obvious solution that I\u0027m just not seeing to handling the life support requirements while simultaneously managing all of these requirements? If possible, I want explanations as to why things work rather than just \u0027Do it this way, because reasons\u0027. Feel free to be as technical as needed in the explanation. I\u0027m an extremely competent coder and have worked with game engines a fair bit. I fully understand concepts like big O notation, and am capable of learning nearly any algorithm that I might need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-15T21:49:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223378381\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174937\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221526306366\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022186781\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Darinth\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/14/2018 at 7:59 AM, Darinth said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, I was reading through a post that mentioned part of the problem is that a lot of the resource requests in KSP run in O(n^2) (or possibly worse).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill true in the current KSP versions as far as I know.\u00A0 Perhaps it is only O(n) or O(n*2)(linear), but it is certainly not anything approaching the O(1) (constant) that it should be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223378381\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174937\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221526306366\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022186781\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Darinth\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/14/2018 at 7:59 AM, Darinth said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is the case, it might be a significant benefit to literally just take and have 10 bases that are relatively small in the same area because they\u0027re not hurt by that O(n^2) algorithm by keeping their part counts low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.\u00A0 This will not only improve the resource calculations, but will -also- help with the physics calculations.\u00A0 Each separate \u003Cem\u003Evessel\u003C/em\u003E can process most of its physics in its own thread (e.g multithreading);

I\u0027ve now created crafts with 288 fuel cells and ran them both in a fresh sandbox and my current 1.4 career. In both of these instances, the lag is measurable but not anywhere near what I see in my Munar base. Both saves lag when the fuel cells are turned on/off. When I load up the craft in sandbox, I run at 58 fps and that drops\u00A0to about 38\u00A0fps when the fuel cells are running to charge up the empty batteries the craft starts with. In my career save, the craft loads up at about\u00A045 fps and drops to about\u00A028 when I turn the cells on. In both of these circumstances, the clock\u00A0stays green which I believe is an indication of the rate fixedupdates which process the physics are being called.
