But I love the idea and keep track of it until johnqevil has a chance to update.\u003Cp\u003EI always felt that the numbers were unbalanced. It seemed that the funding I received always outpaced my Kerbals\u0027 wages. If I was low on money I could just wait a few months and I was back in business. I also play with Kerbal Construction Time, which essentially requires you to eat up more time as you wait for vessels to be built. I made too much money without trying very hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I have some setting tweaked the wrong way or am I missing something? I wonder if it would be possible for funding to decrease based on how many contracts you do? So if you don\u0027t do anything for a few months or for a year or more then the funding would decrease.
