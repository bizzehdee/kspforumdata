Unfortunately, without logs we can only speculate on the cause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are using Steam, verify file integrity. Double check that there are no forgotten mods installed. The log files will show what is being loaded, and where it is stalling., so attaching or lInking to them would enable us to help you further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Parv Kerman","CreatedById":160918,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T05:53:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthank you so much. I read the topic posted by sal-vager - that the game won\u0027t be updated from the launcher. And I was doing the same. I bought it from ksp store and I updated it from there only. now the game is working fine with v1.1.2! Once again thank so much for the answer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
