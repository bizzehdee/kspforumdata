Let me explain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the cart mod ive created a rocket car and now im setting my sights on taking this thing around the moon. However one of the limitations of the cart is a weight limit, so adding heavy wings is out of the question. My goal is to fly to the moon, and re-enter eaths atmo and land safetly on the ground. But given that I suck at flying and this thing lacking apropriate wings, I was wondering if there was a addon/mod that would allow me to mount a Parachute laterally or on the side of a fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be greatly appreiated. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Duck","CreatedById":1156,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-29T00:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, the NovaPunch part pack has a radial-mount parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
