The only thing you miss is the science obtained from your ship itself that returns from the planet/mun you visted. Sure, this can end up being a lot of science, but my point is that for the actual experiments themselves there is no penalty for transmitting, other than you have to do about 2-3x as many experiments for the same ending science total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53170-Science-Question-When-How-do-diminished-returns-kick-in-with-radio-transmissions/page2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EReference\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mykill Metal","CreatedById":89183,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T13:43:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E....still makes absolutely no sense as to why the game TELLS YOU you are losing science by the percentage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T13:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mykill Metal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mykill Metal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E....still makes absolutely no sense as to why the game TELLS YOU you are losing science by the percentage.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, let me make it easier for you. When you go somewhere, there is x amount of science point in the area, let\u0027s say 100 points are available. Then, when you do an experiment, that experiment takes 10% of the available points, so you have an experiment with a value of 10 points. If you bring it home, you get all the ten points. If you transmit it at a transfer rate of 40%, you get four points. The six points left \u003Cem\u003Ego back\u003C/em\u003E to the science pool of the area. So if you transmit the experiment at a rate of 40%, after there isn\u0027t 90 points left in the area but 96. So when you redo the experiment, you will have an experiment value of 9.6, and if you were to transmit it you would send 3.84 science points home and there would be 92.6 points left. And so on until there are no points left in the area. Those are arbitrary values, but that\u0027s how it works. So you do not lose science when you make an experiment and transmit it, you just don\u0027t gather as much as you could by returning it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlazeFallow","CreatedById":83905,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T13:50:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENotSo_stupid_chris has it exactly right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is just the amount of science from the current experiments net worth that will be transmitted.

So you can do many more experiments before reaching a return of 0 with transmitting the science back in.

Why not just send 100% and call it a day, instead of tediously spamming the activate science bay and transmit buttons? That would make it fun and actually enticing to send probes instead of manned craft (would help on eve, since i learned the hard way not to land there lol). Also, you could do return (manned) trips for the rest of the science instead of farming all of it, going home, and calling it a good trip.
