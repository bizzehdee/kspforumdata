There are many creative people in the mod community who could write great mission packs. I am one of them (writing is a large part of my job). I want the ability to describe missions based on a host of variables such as onboard resources (ie fuel/O2 etc) included parts, orbit variables, planets, biomes, speed, altitude, crew count. I want requirements that X contract be completed before Y is available. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I worry. I worry that, like the tech tree, we won\u0027t have any variables to work with. I worry that missions will be limited to \u0022take X part to Y place\u0022. I worry that Squad will use contacts as yet another tutorial mode for new players. The worst case scenario would be a situation whereby there are only a handful of contract \u0022slots\u0022 such as a fixed number of companies that then randomly repeat based on what parts the player has unlocked in the tech tree. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will see soon enough either way. I\u0027ve got a few dozen missions written for the MissionControler mod. Those who played them had good things to say. I\u0027d love to covert these into contracts. I hope I get the chance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uui8457","CreatedById":96312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T07:33:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t even considered the possibility of the contract system being used as another tutorial for newbies.

I believe that each individual contract will be optional, so if you want to skip those and wait for a more challenging one like a minmus flyby or something, then you will probably be able to. I wouldn\u0027t want the mission text for each contract to do too much hand-holding to explain how to get into orbit or rendezvous with another ship or whatever, but I don\u0027t have a problem with the mission objectives themselves starting simple and gettng gradually more challenging.

I don\u0027t want any \u0022first few contracts\u0022. I want contracts to be a system, an API, that allows non-Squad people to write contracts. I really couldn\u0027t care less about the contracts Squad creates. They will be dead simple I\u0027m sure. They won\u0027t, cannot, incorporate any non-squad parts or resources and must be simple enough to accomplish with the limited orbital data provided in stock KSP (ie no KER/void etc). Even requesting a specific biome on Mun would be difficult in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlybys and altitude records are exactly the limited descriptors I worry about. How about something more like \u0022A Minmus flyby with at a max altitude of X and max speed of Y over a midlands biome\u0022, with differing science/money rewards based on which of those you manage to pull off. Or perhaps \u0022a 3-man pod in orbit around mun for three days, splashing down (ie in water) on Kerbin, with a minimum of 3 units of O2 remaining\u0022 (ie you have to be using a life-support mod). Those are the sort of descriptors made possible by the MissionController mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-03T08:03:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2014 08:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sandworm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T08:18:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom memory:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe contracts will be completely optional and they will be created based on the tech level and achievements of the player so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if there was a line of tutorial contracts you would be free to ignore them and do the others, although I do not think that the first missions possible with starting tech and budget would differ that much from hypothetical \u0022tutorial contracts\u0022 that you would not have to do them anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JonoRig","CreatedById":57882,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T08:37:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think he\u0027s referring to the contracts available in the game, more that it will be a system that\u0027s open for people to write their own.
