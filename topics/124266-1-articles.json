Yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter entering Minmus SOI with both vehicles in this test the contracts did not wipe (they are still there, and I think I know why). However, from the space center I switched to the detached probe (Probe 1), not the main vehicle which is still carrying the other probe, for the orbit capture maneuver node which comes up first for this vessel. I entered the node and began the burn at the appropriate time. The reported DV necessary, however, kept increasing rather than going down as it should. When I right clicked on the probe core and hit \u0027control from here\u0027 the navball orientation switched to the correct orientation for that probe, showing the maneuver node in a different place. Oriented to that node and continued the burn to capture. This probe, however, has no other probe core attached, so why was the orientation initially different? Below will be dropped a quicksave file just prior to the burn of the first probe, where the problem may appear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the reason the contracts did not wipe is because this time, unlike in the career play earlier, I switched to the detached probe and followed that into the Minmus SOI. In this test, I did not switch focus to the detached vessel until after both vessels had entered the SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LTrotsky","CreatedById":152994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T08:17:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter two separate attempts to re-create the disappearance of the contracts, I was unsuccessful. It may have something to do with a particular sequence of actions and a particular scene change method, but . . . not sure. I did the best I could to do what I had done before which resulted in the disappearance, but didn\u0027t remember what that was precisely. At least the nav ball orientation was discovered. I was able to get both satellites into their respective orbits and fulfill both contracts, and will now use this for my main save in this career. From now on I will use ALT-F5 to back up the career frequently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatmanFS","CreatedById":152677,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T20:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have encountered the disappearing contracts bug twice now. It happened once after starting the game back up for the day, and once during an interplanetary mission to Duna that I was working on while also cruising around the mun-minmus area saving astronauts and putting up satellites. It really sucks because I was earning money for the last VAB upgrade and almost had a few different objectives accomplished. Now they\u0027re just all gone, not failed, not anything, like they never exsisted. Before I was actually kind of glad because I had some tedious ones built up that I didn\u0027t want to take a penalty on, but now I\u0027m low on funds and am struggling to work up motivation to start over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
