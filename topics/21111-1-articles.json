The exhaust is your typical rocket fuel, only it has been superheated by the nuclear fission reactions. Now, there is certainly some radiation that leaks out, in the form of gamma rays (photons: light), while the engine is running, but those do not \u0022stick\u0022 nor turn ordinary matter into dangerous radioactive poison - at most it might ionize some molecular bonds (which helps sterilizing it, actually ! ) but there won\u0027t be transmutation.
