Historical (Alt-Historical?) events could fire and give your program bonuses/maluses Examples could include some rival nation beating you to a milestone, which triggers national interest in your program, granting a modifier to reputation gains/losses.\u00A0 Another event could be an outbreak of war driving the demand for surveillance, generating a few limited-time-only missions. I feel like if the game could support it, the possibilities here are endless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing I would like to see is more Alt-History paths, like with the D-2 alternate to Apollo that is currently in the game. Of course, this relies on the parts for those paths actually existing (something I couldn\u0027t help with right now, considering my current skill set). Specific alt-history paths I think would be interesting include an early german space program, perhaps in a setting where Germany didn\u0027t suffer such a brain drain of its rocket scientists. Another path I think would be interesting is if Goddard\u0027s research caught on very early in the US, turning them into the first rocketry power, whereas Germany was the first IRL. Anyway, some hypothetical derivatives of Goddard\u0027s work would be interesting to see regardless \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI\u0027d love to help out where possible, I am a unity programmer by day, but have never modded unity before.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELove the mod, and looking forward to see where things go!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"despondent_purple_","CreatedById":229319,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-10T00:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurious if anyone else has had issues with warp till morning with new update (2.1.0.0)?
