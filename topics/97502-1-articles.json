I have KAS installed and I want to be able to attach small parts to a satellite in orbit just for fun, kinda like the shuttle repairing hubble. I clicked edit container on the KAS parts container and the only parts I have a choice to put in the container are KAS parts. No Cubic Octagonal Struts, no torture chairs(external command seats) no batteries, no RTGs, only KAS parts. Shouldn\u0027t I be able to attach STOCK parts?? I tried attaching those small parts on a capsule just to test how KAS EVA works and I could only grab and place KAS parts. I saw in a changelog that the modmaker added the ability to \u0022grab and store the 3 rung ladder\u0022 which I assume is the Pegasus I Mobility Enhancer, and I couldn\u0027t put it in the parts container, couldn\u0027t grab it off the side of the capsule... I don\u0027t understand, it\u0027s really frustrating me. I just watched a Scott Manley IQ episode where he built a minmus rover out of Cubic Octagonal Struts, an RTG, wheels, and a command seat. What am I doing wrong??! Is there a Config to edit to add stock parts?? Ugh... I\u0027m so confused and frustrated XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the whiny rant, like I said I\u0027m getting really frustrated. I hope I can find a solution.
