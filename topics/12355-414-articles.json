I have KER up showing split burn start time at the same time and for every burn, it goes positive before the burn starts. Not a big deal for short burns, But I did have a minute burn go wonky partly because of a late burn and partly because the starting stage only had about 1/3 the required dV left with the next stage being a smaller engine and lower TRW.
