It\u0027s not hard to check their name, and generally one kerbal is as good as another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf kerbals were all had identical body structures, that could also affect their ability to identify each other. To be distinctive, a kerbal would have to modify their clothes, or their hair, etc, to stand out. If this was all there is too it, it would be easy for one kerbal to impersonate another. This could have varying effects depending on kerbal psyche. It is possible that kerbals would develop powerful identification technology, and/or become very attentive to details to avoid confusion and crime. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are other ways to identify different beings. Sound of voice, smell/pheromones, body language, speech patterns/vocabulary...If kerbals are physically identical, they could likely rely on behavioral cues to distinguish each other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing physically identical would have some benefits. It would be very easy to size all clothes, products, buildings, etc, to fit the adult kerbal. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(With some variation to cope with children, and disabled kerbals hopefully.) \u003C/span\u003E It could make identification of diseases, and physical developmental problems quite easy. However, there could be social consequences for these differing individuals- this could be positive or negative, again depending on kerbal psychology. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also level out the playing field when it comes to things like sport, modelling, and dancing, where the body you start with is a big factor in pursuing those areas. However, I\u0027m not convinced it would really be possible for them all to be exactly the same. Some kerbals would vary due to health, fitness, etc, unless kerbal physiology is set up so the body can\u0027t change beyond a certain template.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving one/no gender would make for a very different society to what we experience.
