I keep having my large 16 clusters of engines(from when I made it with 8 and applied 2 of them) declustering into a long list of engines. How do I put them back together. Or better yet customize them into groups how I wish... Is there a shortcut for this? and if not why is this not a feature(like a hundred other things we would need to make even remotely complex aircraft, or control any aircraft in a remotely complex way...).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Tegu","CreatedById":76643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T18:19:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUm, I\u0027m not sure how to put them back together again (try launching and reverting your ship, I find that can help debug the staging order) but I know how to get them into customized groups. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you click on a stack of engines in the staging order it will expand to show all of them. You can then hover over the module you want and it will become highlighted on the ship itself, you can then click on the module (in the staging order, not the ship!) and drag it into a different stage. If you place it back into the same stage it will rejoin its original stack and if you drag more than one (one at a time) into the same stage they will form together into one stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T19:29:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI will try that right after my test flight ends.
