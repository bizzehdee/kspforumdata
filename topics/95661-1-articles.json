Well, in an effort to not use the RAPIER (for efficiency\u0027s sake) I clipped an LV909 into the turbojet. On the runway its just instantly exploding. Its textbook symptomatic of collisions between parts on the same craft being enabled (for reference, they are disabled in the stock game). This didn\u0027t used to happen and I know its not a symptom of 0.90, so the question is does anyone know which mods enable this? Obviously I have one and I don\u0027t realize it (well I realize it now!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T19:30:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you say instantly explode, do you mean that it happens on load or when you start the engines?
