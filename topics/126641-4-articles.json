For instance, manually performing burns for station keeping is boring micromanagment. However, the game could include a \u0022station keeping\u0022 interface which tells you, before you launch, how much dV will be required for station keeping at a given orbit. Once the player establishes a specific orbit, the player toggles station keeping, and an autopilot takes care of all required burns from there on until the ship runs out of fuel, at which point it kicks it into a graveyard orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, however, that throwing every single bit of realism in the face of new players is overwhelming.

I plan things, send instructions to crew and make much technical micromanagement stuff to keep things going. But many people have perfectly opposite opinions.

It is not a bad idea to keep stock KSP cartoonish, numberless and oversimplified. However, engine on the behind of the screen should be made so that the game could be easily modded to even extreme nerdy micromanagement hell for professional engineers and scientists. Or whatever else. Most things are already OK and there are loads of well thought high quality technical realism mods but there are some several problems left. For example map view should have a complete overhaul.
