The reason I ask is that, if you catch Tylo (or Laythe as well) on the backside of Jool (when the moon is on the retrograde side of Jool\u0027s orbit around the sun), you will capture without any burn at all. This is one of the best things about going to Jool. You can plan for this in your design, and take advantage of the savings. Your ship is already built, obviously, but it looks just fine to me. I don\u0027t use the Nerv, so I\u0027m not as familiar with it, but I think I\u0027d forget about Laythe. The cost isn\u0027t worth it. I\u0027d just run experiments and EVA on the way through. After passing through, you can also easily get a rendezvous with Vall and Tylo for flyby science grabbing (they\u0027re actually tough to avoid).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, Pol or Bop should be your goal. With what you have for your lander, you could mine either moon for all the science it has. You should be able to return to Kerbin with your first Jool mission a resounding success. And when you do, I\u0027d forget the aerobrake. If your ship isn\u0027t designed for it, you\u0027ll have to stay so high that the result will be small and not worth the risk. Remember that you\u0027ll be doing the Jool-dive, and moving extremely fast. Easily doable with a shield, but most likely disastrous without one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-31T14:24:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2017 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt Kerbalkrunch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-31T15:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming this is your first trip to Jool\u0027s system and you are here for the science\u00A0then I suggest ignoring landing initially.
