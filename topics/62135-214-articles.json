Until it\u0027s resolved, you\u0027ll have to manually check the motors one by one (right click and reverse as necessary) whenever it occurs to correct them. Zoom in on them and note their direction. The state of whether the motor is reversed is not always accurate in the motor\u0027s context menu either. So you\u0027ll have to verify them by eye.
