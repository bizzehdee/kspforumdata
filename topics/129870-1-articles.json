All the buttons on the top row went grey (indicating they cant be pressed) but all the ground vehicles were still moving and I could still press all the buttons on the left (ship building). Is this a bug? If so, is there a way to fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTom_Ice\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-13T20:42:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe it\u0027s a bug, this has happened to me before as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI restarted the game and it was fine, hasn\u0027t happened again so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t say what causes it, perhaps someone else can shed more light on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tom_ice_0507","CreatedById":156952,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T10:00:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is, I had KSP on another laptop where I installed a ton of mods, and it started doing this thing on the other laptop.
