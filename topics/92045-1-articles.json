Some people don\u0027t like the holidays, but they are my favorite time of the year. I just wish they came in summer, my second favorite time of year. I also wish the news and the weather weren\u0027t so dismal--it\u0027s really ruining the mood. But here is something to cheer you up!

Werner had just finished working with Linus on a new theory about whether the white stuff on Eeloo was snow or ice. Mortimer had just talked Gene\u0027s ear off about how the Minmus All Purpose Science and Fuel Base (MAPSFB) was way too expensive and unnecessary (he had spent three weeks planning it out). And at the Astronaut Complex, the kerbonauts were sitting around with nothing to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E250 AU was a boring period in Jedi Space Program history. After the first month or so, a budget cut hit, which kind of put a damper on the schedule. In addition, Mortimer was getting tough about budget--he was quite proud of the new, balanced budget he had made himself. Nothing had really gotten done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo pass the time, Jebediah was telling a traditional Christmas story from his childhood, one that he had been named for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You see, I was born during the holiday season, and my parents, holiday lovers they, wanted it to be a big part of my life. So, they named me after the biggest Christams tale from my hometown, the legend of Santa Jeb. Santa Jeb was this big fellow, a fun loving guy. Every Christmas, he would get a sleigh pulled by eight missiles. Or nine, depending on which version was being told. Sometimes the ninth was a baby kangaroo. He would travel Kerbin every Christmas Eve night, delivering presents to all the good kerbs. He gave the bad kerbs boxes of shrubs. In the version my parents told, he also delivered to the supposed aliens on the Mun.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob smiled. \u0022I was told that story as a kid, right down to the Mun aliens. One year, I left snacks for him. It started something of a tradition in my town.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill just rolled his eyes. He wasn\u0027t the festive type of kerbal. \u0022Come on, that\u0027s just a story for children.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, aren\u0027t you a ball of fun,\u0022 Jeb said with a wink. \u0022Get into the spirit, Bill!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not until I see Santa Jeb himself walking on the Mun.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gave Jebediah a brilliant idea...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short order, a test lander was built, complete with festive lighting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fzsi2Zz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Fzsi2Zz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Mortimer walked into the VAB, he was absolutely incredulous. \u0022What is this?!\u0022 he yelled. \u0022An unplanned Mun landing is expensive enough, but the lights add a few hundred unnecessary Kerbits to the mix! This could throw off the mission budget for weeks!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene, already angry about the MAPSFB, walked up to him. \u0022Morty, there is no mission budget for weeks. Because there are no planned missions. Because of you. Now shut your mouth and get in Mission Control to watch the launch.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoor old Mortimer watched in horror as Jeb took the perfectly Mun-worthy lander for a test drive and promptly crashed it on the roof of the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UcVCpFI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UcVCpFI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thus, the new Legend of Santa Jeb began...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThanks for reading, be sure to leave comments and to tune in next time.
