This would be the first rocket ever where he only had to press one button to make it work, here goes nothing! AND THERE IT WENT! off into the sky, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off for science reasons, no stability at all, it gains a heading of 273 degrees and continues heading west, the first stage decouples perfectly, and the launch escape system activates, due to drag the capsule starts flipping retrograde as the sepratrons are still running, the launch escape system decouples, and the capsule starts tumbling, slowly it reaches an apoapsis of 22,432 meters, still waiting for the parachute to deploy, it\u0027s been more than 30 seconds, BigStar might just have to save this one, 10 km in the sky and falling, in the background Bigstar hears the first stage hit the ground he gets scared and presses the staging button to deploy the parachute, falling still, chute ready to deploy, it deploys what feels a little late, and perfectly he touches the ground, seconds later the explosions from the launch escape system hitting the ground near by ring in his ears! WOW FOLKS! What a mission! And he only had to press two buttons! What a wonder! Stay tuned for more of BigStars KAL Kontrolled Rocketry Adventures!!!!!\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA comment from BigStar Kerman:\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was quite the flight, I\u0027ve never had such ease flying, or well, not flying a rocket before. I just pretty much sat there and let it do its thing. Jeb was of course jealous that I was the one that got to save the day this time hehehe. Once I hit 10 kilometres I knew for sure that the KAL wasn\u0027t going to deploy the chute, but I waited until 3 kilometres to actually press the button in case there was a malfunction in the timing ore anything else. I\u0027ll be speaking to the engineers on ways that this could be improved, such as an auto-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E function, which sounds repetitive, but it might just work, some way to keep the capsule headed safely towards the eastern seas. Have a great night everyone, and don\u0027t forget to fly with BigStar Aerospace, we\u0027ve got nothing short of adventure!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigStar Aerospace","CreatedById":204131,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-07T06:02:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA SMALL REPORT: Juniper-2 is already in the works and BigStar Kerman is being readied for his second flight. There are rumors that Juniper-3 will feature a much larger \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E first stage with 6 smaller \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E radial boosters, each booster will have a different burn time as to make them all separate at different times in order to control the direction of the launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigStar Aerospace","CreatedById":204131,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-07T06:15:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow folks, three days later and Juniper-2 is ready for launch. This time the Juniper vehicles KAL-1000 will feature a redundant parachute arming system that ensures deployment. This vehicle will use a prograde \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E stability to maintain an eastward flight. And 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, ignition and liftoff, stability clamps are released, the vehicle is headed skyward, the rocket gains a heading of 90 degrees perfectly and as planned, the SRBs are halfway done, 5 Km now, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E burnout, 10 Km now, launch escape system activated, it deploys early to get away from the capsule, the capsule starts tumbling, this has gone much higher than the last mission already at 29 km, we\u0027ve reached a peak here at 31,796 meters, now falling back towards the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, it looks like we\u0027re right over the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E from here 100 m/s and 30.1 Km, still falling, 200 m/s at 28.5 Km, YES, parachute arming confined this flight will need no control, the parachute partially deploys and the capsule starts slowing down, 10 Km now, 7 Km and 220 m/s, we\u0027re a tad westward of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E by around 500 meters, PARACHUTE DEPLOY! and a soft touch down after 4 minutes 23 seconds of flight! That was exciting folks, don\u0027t forget to tune back in next time for BigStar\u0027s KAL Kontrolled Adventures!!!!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSadly today we had no comment from BigStar Kerman, we were told he had passed out during the fall at around 10 Km, they said he had \u0022Become incapacitated from hunger...\u0022 due to having \u0022eaten all the snacks during pre-flight checks.\u0022. Well folks, that shows that even BigStar Kerman himself is hungry for adventure!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
