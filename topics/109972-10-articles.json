The mods I used to cause the NRE are the latest dev version of FAR and latest MFI, almost lastest RemoteTech (will be verifying with the latest as well, but am currently assuming the NRE is still present), latest Connected Living Space and latest MM. It seems when placing certain antenna on a vessel connected living space somehow triggers FAR to keep running its update cycle and never finishing it. The strangest part is only some antenna trigger the constant update cycle, but all of them cause the NRE to be thrown. The NRE happens when selecting an antenna from the part list, and the constant updates are triggered after placing the antenna on the vessel. Nothing in my cache/part.cfgs correlates with which antenna trigger the constant updates. I found it easiest to trigger with antennas from the mod BlueDog Design Bureau. I do not expect you to DL part mods to test, but I want to give all relevant details from my testing. I will edit this post when I have tested with the latest RT. If you need more info or me to test dlls LMK. Thank you!
