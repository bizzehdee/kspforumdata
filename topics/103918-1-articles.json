It\u0027s a shame, but their reasoning is that KSP is a rocket game/simulator/thing, not a sea thing. It would fragment the game and their original vision. \n\nEDIT: I couldn\u0027t find a member of SQUAD saying anything about boats, but it is on the official DNS list\n\nAs for all the water lag, dangourousness, etc. I think it\u0027s like that because water is so much different than everything else, collision wise. If SQUAD is even semi-sane (which they are) they\u0027re probably waiting until other things are stable to fix this, because it could potentially be so buggy and hard to implement. That\u0027s not to say they\u0027re not doing it wrong right now, but I trust they\u0027ll fix it when they\u0027re able.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T18:03:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 06:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jlo96**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vallius","CreatedById":100188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T18:38:10Z","Content":"Why should it be?

[Here it is](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110766). Even though this thread got a fair amount of attention and replies, it didn\u0027t really result in anything happening. But then again, very few suggestions on that subforum are actually implemented for some reason.\n\nI still stand by all of the things I said there. Water is currently far too laggy; it looks quite unattractive; it\u0027s more unforgiving to splash down on it than to crash into hard Kerbin ground; rocket engines and jet engines work whilst submerged; and many parts are so ridiculously buoyant that they bounce hundreds of meters into the air (I\u0027m looking at you, air intakes). It\u0027s a placeholder that has basically remained unchanged since water was actually not rendered as a solid surface.\n\nWould overhauling water be a difficult thing to do? Probably. \n\nShould the devs overhaul water for 1.0? Absolutely.\n\n1.0 is supposed to be a \u0027feature-complete\u0027 version where all aspects of the game are more-or-less established. The water system right now is undeniably a placeholder, and placeholders have no place in a complete game. Water is not a \u0027small\u0027 aspect of the game, either - after 1.0 is released, boosters and other bits will likely have to be recovered in it more frequently than ever. It\u0027s really absurd to leave water as-is, and hopefully SQUAD won\u0027t do it. I have a sneaking suspicion that they will, though.\n\n*Please, SQUAD, fix water for 1.0*.
