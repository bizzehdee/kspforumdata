As such, Kerbalnauts will have no access to staircases or balconies, but should be able to walk down major streets just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Vessel/debris collision with buildings would result in affected structures and nearby areas within a certain radius being temporarily replaced by a universal, generic rubble pile and fire/smoke effects, before being fully regenerated within five minutes; no complex building destruction animations are required\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- At high altitudes, models should be unloaded (since they\u0027d be ridiculously small too be visible), and replaced with a generic, greyish tiled pattern of \u0022streets\u0022 (augmented by city lights at nighttime)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEffects of Biomes on Procedural City Generation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Most major population centers would typically be located in the grasslands, and in areas with relatively little variation in topography; town and villages may be found in both grasslands and highlands, while very small settlements may be found in lower altitudes of mountainous or warmer tundra regions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - If a major city is located near coastal and ocean biomes, it is likely to have a harbour/port to faciliate trading\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E[sTRETCH GOAL]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E Biomes may also influence the art / architectural style of population centers; for instance, cities and towns in desert biomes by take on a Middle Eastern flavour, while those in tundra and adjacent grassland regions may resemble Eastern European/Russian architecture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAllowances / Support for other Add-ons\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Users should obviously be able to substitute building asset models for the procedually-generated population centers, or to specify what assets should be included for generation (e.g. Maybe for a certain savegame, the user doesn\u0027t want regional/ethnic variations in buildings)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125644-Idea-Realistic-ground-scatter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eskykooler\u003C/a\u003E has proposed an improved ground scatter system for foliage, and the proposed procedural city generation system should obviously be compatible with his work; the combined system would either prioritize city placement (in which case there may be a handful of forest areas left as nature reserves) or foliage placement (in which case cities would be built around existing forest areas)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Allowances need to be made for special structures placed by Kerbin-Side, such as monuments, sports stadiums, alternative launch sites or government administrative buildings.
