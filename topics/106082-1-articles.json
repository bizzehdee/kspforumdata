Landed and performed an EVA. A couple of seconds after the Kerbal touched the ground, the game blanks out. The general format of the display is still present, but it shows no information about my plane, Kerbal, or navball. The view goes completely black. A previous quick save being loaded up did not resolve. Returning to the tracking station doesn\u0027t show the space center at all. I exited the game and reloaded and found my ship gone and Kerbal MIA. Otherwise the game seems to be working as normal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xxserilviaxx","CreatedById":79675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:00:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWere it perhaps a female kerbal you sent up there?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:36:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis happened to me at KSC, but with Bob.
