Its the speed calculation and its almost the same as the simulation-on-rail one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt applies to the whole ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second one is the bigpart corrector. It applies to all element of a stage(?) and makes the direction of travel more exact and allows wobble between stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third one is the part corrector. It applies to every part of a ship and make Intrastage wobble possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe size of all three is fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV1(shipvector) \u0026gt; V2(stagevector) \u0026gt; V3 (partvector)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the most of the speed is catched in the V1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest is taken by V2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV3 will move parts on Intrashipmoves (accelerating)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the together can make the total Vector of movement (Vt) more exact due using more \u0022dimesions\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy i say dimensions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts simple.

The total vector is now 2,325.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the third 3d system with a scale of 0,002 and a floatness of 0,00001 you can place it at 0,000079\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVt is now 0,0,0-\u0026gt;2,3-\u0026gt;relative0,025-\u0026gt;relative0,000079 = 2,32579\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eby using a two number system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope someone understands\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-30T09:07:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2012 09:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by eyecikjou567\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T09:20:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a feeling what you are proposing involves changing PhysX, which cannot be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, this problem has been solved already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eyecikjou567","CreatedById":22618,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T09:24:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont think you need to change PhysX.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYOu just take the point of the ship.
