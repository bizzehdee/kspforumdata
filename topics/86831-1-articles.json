So for example, you can expose like 6 goos in the same place at the same time and the pop-up reports will all show the same value, which is the same value as if you\u0027d only exposed 1 there. But when you get back to Kerbin with them, the science per experiment will be scored via the diminishing returns so only the 1st will get the initially reported value, the 2nd will get rather less, the 3rd will get almost all that remains, the 4th will get the last few points, and the 5th and 6th will get nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you have 3 choices, really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
