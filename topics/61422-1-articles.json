The only glitch I had was when the pink target marker was not really pointing towards a docking port. It only happened to me once, but it was not that much off, so after ships got within couple of meters, I made some adjustments to make it work. Most of the time target marker is spot on, so no adjustment is needed. Keeping it centered on navball is enough.

These should be short burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe alternative, of course, is to set up a long, hard burn at your periapsis once your planes are aligned such that you wind up setting a resonance with the target - you go wide, it makes several orbits in the time it takes your craft to make a single orbit and you wind up passing very close to one another. You make another hard burn to slow down your relative velocity. This method works, but it consumes a fair amount of delta-V in the process.

So you set up nodes to have closest approach like 5 km (the less the better, especially on low orbit or when close to atmosphere; watch your orbit during these maneuvers in order not to get into atmosphere while trying to approach target). Then switch navball to target mode and watch relative speed it shows. When you\u0027re in about 30-40 sec to closes approach, find retrograde marker (in \u0022target\u0022 mode!!! it won\u0027t be orbital retrograde, it\u0027ll be retrograde relative to target in that case) on navball and make a burn till target relative speed is 0-1 m/s (you\u0027ll brake relative to target and also match your orbit - watch map view to see it). Then point towards pink prograde marker and make a burn so taht your green prograde marker matches it (don\u0027t speed up too much, 20-30 m/s is enough). Your closest approach on map should be much closer now. Get close to it and repeat braking process.
