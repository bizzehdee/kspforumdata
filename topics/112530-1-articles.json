The idea was to avoid any of the weird high warp \u0026amp; not active issues, to having to cope with them via \u0027catchups\u0027 or \u0027background processing\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some mod/plugin that is like a ModuleGenerator/ModuleResourceConverter/TACGeneric... that can check some prerequisites for for producing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example one can easily use MM to create a \u0027reactor\u0027 part to produce as many kW as you like - but really it needs to have adequate radiators. Near Future Electrical looks like it\u0027s done a great job of detailed modelling, including overheat damage etc. But that is kind of overpowered for what I intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternate approach would be to have a resource \u0027ThermalSink\u0027 and some kind of \u0027ModuleResourceConverter\u0027 that \u0027required\u0027 a certain amount to be present in order to produce output but did not consume that resource. Like a CATALYTIC_INPUT vs INPUT_RESOURCE \u0026amp; OUTPUT_RESOURCE. It would be great/interesting if it could check for and require other things; needs photons, temperature range, atmosphere density, gravity/not, ... but just a resource check would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there isn\u0027t something like this does anyone have any suggestions re any existing plugin that would make a good starting point? or lesson as to how this kind of things gets implemented as a plugin?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T06:33:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave the same resource in identical quantities on input and output of ModuleResourceConverter.
