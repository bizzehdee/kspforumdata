Also the Stage light is purple instead of flashing green. I can select any part and all the various functions work fine, just no staging control (can\u0027t launch), and also no IVA. Originally I would just restore some of the old Spaces files for pods I got rid of back to the GameData folder and that alleviated the problem for a little bit but now it happens consistently regardless of the build or pod I am using. What could be causing this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using a pretty heavily modded install of KSP. I have parts from 20 different mods, generally only a small handful from each after I get rid of all the stuff I never use. My GameData file is 1.02G. Anyway is there any solution anyone knows of to fix this short of tossing a bunch of stuff out?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
