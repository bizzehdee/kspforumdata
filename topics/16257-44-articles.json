I just DL\u0027ed the Mod AIES Aerospace and it turns out it has some great work done. Has some great Sat models that are utterly useless other than eye candy.

Parachutes are the only one I can think of atm. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway bud, thanks for the great work maintaining your donation to the community and I hope you take this request up with a bit of follow through as I think the creator of \u0022AIES Aerospace\u0022 plans on staying.
