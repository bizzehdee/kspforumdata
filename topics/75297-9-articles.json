Ramjets lack a long tailpipe, which pulsejets need to be self sustaining. I say remove the centerbody and replace it with the valves a pulse jet would have, they\u0027re small enough to texture on as little more then a grid of rectangles, making the conversion easy. \u003Cp\u003EFor the ramjet, it\u0027s hard to say much about the shape of them in general, as it varies a lot with size and the speeds they\u0027re designed for. The best idea if you ask me is to find a picture of one you like the look of and base it off that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, ramjets can be used at subsonic speeds, and most of the ones tested during or immediately after ww2 wouldn\u0027t work at supersonic speed, as would the one you made, mainly because of the rounded inlet cone. They\u0027re cones because they create shockwaves to compress and focus the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, sorry for the nitpicking, and thanks for all the awesome parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Having now played around with it more, where did you get the sounds for the ramjets? They sound weird and kinda staticy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the ramjets should have a more gradual gain in thrust then zilch then lots like they do now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe jets sound the way they do because they were too loud for the mics, sampled maybe 100ft behind a J79 at a turbine shop in Canada. Some of it sampled from a camera mounted on top of the engine body, mixed in with the rest. They were the best ones I can find. Otherwise it\u0027d be some sound fx clips that are too soft and distant. I don\u0027t know anything about old time ramjets, feel free to adjust the configs to your liking. I\u0027ll flip the model so it looks like the pics I find online, small end forward, and change the thrust curves a bit. I\u0027ll add a 2nd thrustTransform so you can flip it and use it as pulsejet if you want. There\u0027s no good way to do these in KSP using only velocity curves and I don\u0027t want to spend too much time noodling with them.
