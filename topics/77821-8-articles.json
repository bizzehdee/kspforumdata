Could probably have avoided test flight confusion (and potentially disastrous mistakes by customers) simply by mounting the cargo bay probe with its controls facing in the same direction as the rest of the plane. A bit competent rather than extraordinary; it\u0027s an effective middleweight cargo/crew transport workhorse, but it doesn\u0027t really surprise with unexpected performance in either speed or lifting capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESP-10\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E: well built and fun to fly, with very good aerodynamic balance.
