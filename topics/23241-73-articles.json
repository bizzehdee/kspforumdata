Procedural wings helped with the main wing, but mostly everything else is B9 and I absolutely love the option to have cargo space and seating for Kerbals onboard. This is going to take me places.

I have no idea what it does aerodynamically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was fairly conservative on weight as this was my first design. It carries 1840 units of jet fuel and it has 4m of cargo space.

They found in a short-haul circuit flight to the nearby mountain range and back, that the aircraft cruises at around 7km altitude and over 200m/s surface speed. The hop burned only 17 units of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really, really pleased with this design, but it does have its issues. I can\u0027t really put it up to full thrust because the centre of thrust is below the centre of mass. At about 3/4 thrust it really wants to pitch up, and it\u0027s difficult to push it back down while maintaining aerodynamic stability. But I have to say a huge thank-you to bac9 for this pack.
