That gave me the idea, what if the 2nd stock jet engine could use that sort of system to give it an afterburner mode? Press an action group button or something and switch the afterburner on or off. I think that would not only be cool, but help to further differentiate the two stock jet engines. Anyways, just a thought, and who knows, you could use that further somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELexieAssassin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork_werewolf","CreatedById":90749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T17:10:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a really good idea and actually should be fairly easy to produce with just a .cfg modification.

The after burner cold have increases fuel usage and heat production making long term usage bad but helping you to get that extra boost when you need it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
