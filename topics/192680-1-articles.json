Without the wiki, it is hard to figure out how it works. Extraction efficiency is basically useless for drills : directly put the ore/second on ground and on asteroids, it would be clearer. Telling the engineer bonus would also be usefull. Speaking of engineers, I tend to think \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E are \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er).

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E with skilled engineers onboard and underpowered on automatic probes. Passing from a 0.05 factor to 1.25 for a max level engineer is a bit too much. I would prefer a different balance, for exemple the small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E to be only able to make a basic fuel giving limited delta V (monoprop for example) and the bigger one to do everything. Maybe I\u0027ll make a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch to implement that. That way, fully automated probes would be more practical, but limited to less efficient engines. Currently, it is more practical to build a monster with the biggest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and a lot of drills to achieve relatively short refuelling times on a automated probe.
