So, apart from a third-party testing team and BlitWorks own testing (whatever that may or may not be), Squad admitted having eyes on new builds as work progressed. I\u0027m sure that didn\u0027t always, or possibly even ever, involve rigorous testing by Squad, but Squad must have at least been aware of the controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow here\u0027s the thing regarding that: Squad had the port devs who could walk them through the controls as they were finalized, so Squad had a distinct advantage over the\u00A0end user when it came to understanding how to interact with the game. From a lot of the initial feedback I\u0027ve seen, it seems like there was a major lack of information provided in-game for end users to best familiarize themselves with the controls. It seems like there really should have been a skippable, repeatable control tutorial that pops up when you first run the game and remains available from the main menu if you need to refresh your memory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027m hopeful that many of the issues get resolved. BlitWorks has a significantly better reputation than FTE, and for all of the ugliness that crowd-testing creates, it certainly is effective at finding lots of bugs. I hope they eventually get this right. I thought I might finally be able to recommend KSP to a friend who only has consoles, but it seems like it still isn\u0027t the right time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-20T17:20:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223273170\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169812\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516468440\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269375\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mako\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, Mako said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to say to this that in many of the Weeklys Squad did say they were playing new builds from the port team as BlitWorks went along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs someone who\u0027s been a part of a beta test for a piece of hardware, It\u0027s possible that a lot of feedback goes straight into the trash.\u00A0 We reported a lot of device-breaking problems with that thing that were still present when the product was released.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, was there time to fix the problems?\u00A0 They had two issues they were dealing with - the quality of the port, and the barrage of users who\u0027d been screwed by the first port who wanted the new one NOW and PERFECTLY.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mako","CreatedById":69375,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-20T17:37:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179753-geonovast/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022179753\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179753-geonovast/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Geonovast\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile of course anything is possible and we have no way of knowing what happened, I was simply relaying the information that Squad themselves claimed in their Weeklys.
