There\u0027s two elements to the majority of power generation systems:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) The fuel, or power source. This can be fossil fuel combustion, the Sun, nuclear fuel rods, etc. Often, the energy from this fuel comes out in a high-entropy form like heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) The generator, which converts some other form of energy (often heat) into some other form of energy (often electricity), where that second form is often a lower-entropy form of energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this case, the fuel is heat from the Sun. This... is hardly a technological breakthrough. The generator is a commercially available thermoelectric generator (TEG), the same technology used in radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTEGs, though, are very inefficient ways of converting heat differentials to electricity; they\u0027re primarily used in small systems where their solid-state nature makes them more reliable and lighter than more efficient systems such as turbines and Stirling generators. You\u0027d need a lot of exposed area to collect the solar heat and a huge heatsink to store it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, there are actual, legitimate proposals that approach making sense to use collected solar heat for nighttime power generation. The one I\u0027ve seen is to use a large mirror array to focus light onto a tower with liquid sodium as the heatsink, used to drive a large high-efficiency turbine similar to those used at fossil fuel plants. This actually solves\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etwo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the biggest issues with renewable power supply: not only does it provide consistent power through many weather conditions (assuming you don\u0027t get a long stretch of multiple cloudy days), but it gracefully handles moment-to-moment power surges and drops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne big advantage of fossil fuel and nuclear plants is the sheer inertia present in the turbines. If power load goes up unexpectedly, the turbines\u0027 rotation rate drops minutely, but the sheer rotational inertia gives the plant operators time to feed in a bit more fuel. Same thing when the power goes down: the actual power distributed goes up very little, the turbines gain a little excess energy, and the plant operators can reduce the fuel feed. Solar panels and wind turbines, however, have much less of this inertia, much less capacity to buffer these moment-to-moment fluctuations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sturmhauke","CreatedById":190611,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-25T04:33:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis tech might be useful for planetary bases, but I don\u0027t see it being much use on most spacecraft.
