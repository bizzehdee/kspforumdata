You are correct, because if this is from the 1.8 to 1.9 mya range or later, then there are comparable finds in the Caucasus region, homo erectus georgicus, that are similarly a small brain on a otherwise generically human morphology brain morpholgy was variable. And also we have that small, medial australopiticine/erectine skull morphology of Homo floreinsis that dates to 13 kya. If this thing dates to 3 mya then its a very important find, even 2.5 mya is important, it basically blows all of paraantrops out as human contenders and only leaves the oldest australopithicines as contenders. So the dating is important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real problem in pre-erectine studies has been homo habilis and the smattering of habiline remains that have been discovered. Early studies placed these as tree dwellers, because of upper body strenth, but also indicated they would have been poor hunters, as time went on a pot of variable traits were added that confused the issue. The problem has been that the finds are largely fragmented and fractional. These naledi finds are mostly complete and suggest communites with lots of variation, not dissimilar to what was seen with the Georgian erectines. They were definitely biped, and probably obligate bipeds, which would make habilis an irrelvant catagorization if these were contemporary. Given the distance to the caucasus, and proximal variation in the cave I don\u0027t think a contemporary with the georgian find constitues a new species. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should point out that morphological variation tapers in Africa slowly while OoA humans radiated from Africa, and its likely that the rise of agriculture and cultivation put and end to structural variation in many areas. Thus maybe we are a bit biased by recent selection in the modern era, Erectus as a species maybe older than we think. Interestingly this find has made surprisingly little noise in the anthro discussion boards so I wonder if people have already discounted this as another early homo data point. While it is possibile that two hominid species lived in africa until late, Tishkoffs recent studies in africa and the recent discovery of an offset Y chromosomal PMRCA make this scenario only possible if one of the species lived in extreme North Africa, IOW the pre LGM variation we see in SSA is probably human, so the collapse of morpholgy post dates the genetic constriction that occurred in the human population.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this all says, basically is that variation is a longlasting trait of pre agrarian humans, and that we should not be so quick to call new species unless those variants are really diiferent and show strong regional identities. So yeah, its prolly a part of the missing link, but not the only one out there. Our ancestors were mobile, they did not stay in one place, and popsize estimates based on DNA suggests that we were spread thinly before OoA. In that context, this makes more sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
