Accommodating and efficiently using stock jury rigged weaponry is actually very fun and quite difficult to do and gives yet another goal for people who\u0027ve maybe only done parts of the above list, and don\u0027t want to build a space base on laythe, or a moon satellite network, or giant dres space station, or whatever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther actually efficiently piloting and using such things requires a skill(and design) that the normal game currently(and may never) actually ask of you. Both long range accuracy on a target(you never have any reason to shoot something at something else from any distance or speed), and if you want to get technical, be maneuverable in space. Most spaceships are large, hulking, and VERY slow, so building something that\u0027s supposed to be agile and zip around once it\u0027s up there is actually a heck of a challenge(heck a PLANE that\u0027s agile is tricky enough right now) and you have to develop completely different skill to pilot such a craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, there\u0027s a ton of people who just want to watch stuff go boom as is evidence by the endless supply of weak to deadly overpowered weaponry mods, but there\u0027s also a lot who just want to have a way to test, learn, and use new skills in the game.
