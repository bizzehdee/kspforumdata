I made my own robotic arm out of rotatrons and hydraulic cylinders, but it\u0027s so heavy it is drooping down under it\u0027s own weight. I would like to make everything more rigid. How do I do that? Reduce the mass of the parts I\u0027m using? Thank you for the mod and let me know if you have a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MartGonzo","CreatedById":65764,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T13:04:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny chance of a move and lock option in the action groups?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit kind of bugs me that the motors don\u0027t stop when using action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T01:00:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is nothing that can be done to make the joints more rigid.

The view of the ship he was using as reference is at the top of page 5. Those 3 arms spin to generate artificial gravity, and he tried using your free-spinning docking washer to accomplish this. However, the command module before the centrifuges is supposed to be linked to the rest of the ship below them. This was not doable without some Kraken-enticing strutting. I, along with others in chat, suggested a skateboard-bearing type part, where there is an inner race, and an outer, the inner remains stationary, while the outer spins. I attempted to make one, and successfully modeled it in blender. However, the two meshes are structurally fixed to each other whenever I test it in-game. I don\u0027t totally understand how to fix it, any help would be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T03:47:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou mean something like this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84566-WIP-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Station-Parts-%28Infernal-Robotics-required%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84566-WIP-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Station-Parts-%28Infernal-Robotics-required%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gkorgood","CreatedById":124879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T03:56:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sirkut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sirkut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou mean something like this?\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84566-WIP-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Station-Parts-%28Infernal-Robotics-required%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84566-WIP-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Station-Parts-%28Infernal-Robotics-required%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyes but a free spinning one so you could spin it up to centrifugal speeds. also, making it one part would be nice, and i just got into modding and wanted to try my hand. any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T04:23:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gkorgood\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gkorgood\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyes but a free spinning one so you could spin it up to centrifugal speeds. also, making it one part would be nice, and i just got into modding and wanted to try my hand. any ideas?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking it one part isn\u0027t going to be possible which is why this is in two pieces.
