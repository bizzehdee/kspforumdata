I gave it some serious thought and came to the conclusion it should contain the following information:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- lets you see what KSP version it was built for\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- lets you see what kind of part it is (more on that later)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- lets you see what version the file is at\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- lets you see if there has been a bug fix since last update\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI came up with this design: \u003Cstrong\u003Ev.0.22.a.1.33.2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be divided up into several sections to better understand the structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ev\u003C/strong\u003E: Version. Acts as a control to identify the following as a version number. This could greatly help with automatic update programs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E0.22\u003C/strong\u003E: KSP Version that the mod was built for. Why not the version it is compatible with? Because sometimes a mod isn\u0027t 100% compatible with a new KSP version. It also lets us see how well the mod has been maintained. Examples may be Bobcats rovers. Although they can work, you have to tweak the files a bit to get it to work. It also lets you know what you have to do to get it to work, like just add science node or also a PART{}.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea\u003C/strong\u003E: Package Type Indicator. It is used to help organize what the content of the file is. It can be categorized into \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-a: add-on (a package that is cored around parts (like KW and VNG), \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-p: plug-ins (packages that are cored around plug-ins like Kethane, Remotetech and MechJeb), \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-g: game play enhancement (packages that improve or alter game play like DR, VOID or Universe Replacer) and \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-f: bug fixes or patches (packages that are only intended to repair a file that was damaged on delivery or a minor update (like only replacing a .dll))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.33\u003C/strong\u003E: Version of the package. Major updates change the first number while minor updates change the second 2-digit number\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2\u003C/strong\u003E: A number indicating that there has been a minor/major fix to the previous update. It is not adding any new content, but repairing possibly incurred damage. By default it should be 0. Only when a bug fix has been brought out after the version update should this be raised to 1 or more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest trouble for me was the Package Type Indicator (PTI). How do you define something like Kethane and ScanSat that has both plug-ins and parts. First I thought to just leave it out, but I realized it would be easier to read if it was included. If you had to read v.0.22.1.33.2 you would have a harder time decoding it (not that hard, but this index is supposed to be used for glance-at situations) then if it was v.0.22.a.1.33.2. The a splits it up making it smaller bits that are easier to decode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also helps users organize their content, but how? Like I said some packages aren\u0027t easy to categorize as plug-ins or parts. So I needed to think of a definition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI came to the conclusion that a plug-in is a package to support a plug-in whilst an add-on is a package to support a part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat may be a little bit cryptic, so here is my explanation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A package that is a plug-in has the main goal to support a plug-in. Take Kethane for example. What it is all about is fuel. Everything around it is meant to get, use and expend Kethane. The same for ScanSat. Its main goal is to map, and the tools are scanners. The reason you download it isn\u0027t for the dishes, but to map bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A package that is an add-on has the main goal to support a part. A good example is OrdanInd Telescopes. What it is all about is the telescope and it has a plug-in to help you use the telescope. One without the other and it doesn\u0027t work, but you download it so you have a telescope, not a telescope plug-in. Another example is VNG. VNG is built around parachuting with the outcome of it all the EVA parachute. The plug-in is only meant to support parachuting and nothing else (well, it does support other mods, but for the same reasons)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you think? With such an active modding community, it would be nice to standardize this and make it even more easy for everybody to use. If there is something that can be done better, I would love to here it.
