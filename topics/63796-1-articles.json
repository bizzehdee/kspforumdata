I had a year of physics in university and did pretty well in it although that was a long time ago. I\u0027ve always been very interested in spaceflight, a few years ago I got really into Apollo and read a bunch of books. I\u0027ve learned a lot more in the last week with KSP and it\u0027s certainly the best $17 I\u0027ve spent in a long time! I hope the developers find something else to sell me as I\u0027d like to give them more $.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the name as it makes internet searches so easy. Just put in Kerbal plus whatever you want to know about and it pops up. Apparently there\u0027s nothing else with Kerbal in it on the web.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to landing on the mun one day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T20:03:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard, DrD!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UKNightWatch","CreatedById":104078,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T15:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m new to KSP and agree that purchasing the program was money well spent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a teen I was very interested in our own Earthly space program and read lots about it. That was so many years ago and a lot has changed for me since - so KSP is a very welcome \u0027distraction\u0027. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe name \u0027Kerbal\u0027 really is good when it comes to web searches.
