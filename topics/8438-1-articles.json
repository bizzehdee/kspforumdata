It works pretty well, but to be honest, there are some flaws. Pretty much for the major flaw, is that it can be iffy to pitch in the upper atmosphere. Anyway, it\\\u0027s equipped with Platinum Communications Model BXs9 satellite. I\\\u0027ve flown it quite a few times, and it succeeded in deployment about 90% of the time. After deployment, you\\\u0027ll most likely have more than enough fuel for splashdown. Unknowingly, my model is 20m taller than the real deal (Oops). Oh, well nobody\\\u0027s perfekt. =P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI almost forgot. After separation of the main fuselage, the satellite stage tends to topple a bit w/ SAS on. You\\\u0027ll have to stabilize it manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shedao","CreatedById":8981,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-21T08:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice work and welcome to the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting that your rocket fails 10% of the time.
