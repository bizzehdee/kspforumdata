Over longer time periods, it may start to approach an expotential decay of some sort. But it\u0027s possible that within the range of oxygen levels that would support humans, absorption and reaction of oxygen would be linear enough that a linear approximation may get you in the ballpark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you assume that the current oxygen levels represent an equilibrium between oxygen production by plants and oxygen absorption and reaction, then you need to find out how much oxygen is produced by plants yearly. If you make the assumption that without plants, oxygen absoprtion and reaction would continue at the same rate, then you can thus get a ballpark estimate of how long it would take for oxygen levels to drop below habitable levels, by using the aforementioned linear approximation by subtracting the oxygen production rate of plants from the atmosphere until levels fall below habitability. This will probably under-estimate the time it would take, but that\u0027s OK, since we\u0027re just looking for a ballpark figure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, the moment plants die then there is a quick drop in oxygen levels (probably only by a fraction of a percent though) because much of the decay of plant matter will involve reactions with oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANYWAY, in summary, look up the rate of oxygen production by plants, and make an estimate based off of the assumption that we\u0027re currently in an equilibrium state between oxygen consuming and oxygen producing processes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-14T21:12:26Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2015 09:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NERVAfan","CreatedById":72817,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T05:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, most of the oxygen removed now is due to animals \u0026amp; decomposing fungi/bacteria/etc, and these would die off quickly (many within weeks, scavengers/decomposers/detritivores would live significantly longer) due to starvation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a search, the mass of oxygen in the atmosphere is vastly greater than the biomass, so the rotting away of most life wouldn\u0027t reduce it much.
