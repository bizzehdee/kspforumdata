This ship is currently armed with four oerlikon-millenium cannons and 2 howitzers. The ship only has a crew of four and a little hangar for maby a couple of small shuttle crafts. I didnt bother taking picks of the ship in orbit cuz of the darkness of space, when the hangar offers much better lighting to showcase the ship \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here are some picks of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes the big sticks in the side of the ship are supposed to be the ships main charge laser cannons but cuz of ksp i had to use howitzers instead (in the nose next to the antennaes) and leave the main guns there just for show \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1omQehu.png\u0022 alt=\u00221omQehu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U8uMqeq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022U8uMqeq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i8M97C6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i8M97C6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EL9dFl7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EL9dFl7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as i said i used cheats to get it to orbit since i built this ship for looks not so much to actually make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i hope you enjoyed looking at this frigate that i made \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
