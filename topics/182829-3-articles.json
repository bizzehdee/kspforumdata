they wont want to use other\u0027s code I suspect) - they can make a feature identical to a mod without it\u0027s violating copyright - there are a lot of test cases about this.\u00A0 Mod creator might not see things that way however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this(as my first post) and controversial and probably will annoy Take Two that it does not get deleted!\u00A0 Thank you mods if people do see this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSigining Off,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGavin786\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-19T18:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223562347\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182829\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221552937440\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022183218\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cheif Operations Director\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, Cheif Operations Director said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Plus they have a competitor on the market now so as much as it pains to me say it in pretty much done with \u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003EKS\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003EP.\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple Rockets?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheif Operations Director","CreatedById":183218,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-19T20:01:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223563383\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182829\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221553020556\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165777\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jestersage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Jestersage said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple Rockets?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are a competitor so they will not be named however, draw your own conclusions \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-19T23:43:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaha, love the idea of forced \u0022arbitration\u0022 for forum users.

you can create something in KSP in a fraction of the time it would take in SolidWorks or such then get a pretty accurate simulation if it would work or not.\u00A0 If you then put it on YouTube you cant then cry foul when others\u0027 use it.\u00A0 I think the dividing line really should be if one makes the design public.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere have been some amazing creations in this game that have gone well beyond the initial intent of the developers.\u00A0 I just saw stock propellers today.\u00A0 Wow.\u00A0 There may very well come a day when the above clause needs to be tested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen it comes to Mods.\u00A0 Mods are not created by the use of the software.\u00A0 They are 3rd party tools which interact with the software.\u00A0 Mods are not covered by this section of the agreement, only works derived from the use of the software are covered by the section beginning \u0022USER CREATED CONTENT\u0022.\u00A0 Mods are not derived from use of the software, therefore they are not the property of Take Two(according to my understanding of this clause anyway).\u00A0 Mods are created by 3rd party tools then linked with libraries(possibly supplied and being part of the software).\u00A0 I have not created my first mod yet so I dont know the full technical details I am just looking into things right now.\u00A0 If Squad implemented a programming language into the game and the mod was then created by using that language it could then be reasonably argued the mod belongs to Take Two under the \u0027USER CREATED CONTENT\u0027 clause.\u00A0 If you create your mod in C\u002B\u002B the mod was created by the compiler and not by KSP.\u00A0 And every compiler license gives you the right over your own work created by the compiler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd all of this is theoretical stuff.\u00A0 Most mod creators do it out of love and have other stable sources of income that is their \u0027real life\u0027.\u00A0 In practice most mod creators are delighted when their ideas become \u0027canonized\u0027 and integrated into the main software.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease remember I am not a lawyer I have just spent a lot of time reading about law.\u00A0 Do not take anything I say as legal advice and even if it were good advice it varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\u00A0 Especially a lot of weird things like how copyright is intepreted varies from the USA to EU.\u00A0 So please dont bet your life savings or a year of your life on my words!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGavin786\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-20T21:47:25Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2019 09:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Gavin786\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheif Operations Director","CreatedById":183218,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-21T00:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223563707\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182829\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221553038997\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153264\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Plusck\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn \u200E3\u200E/\u200E19\u200E/\u200E2019 at 4:43 PM, Plusck said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaha, love the idea of forced \u0022arbitration\u0022 for forum users.

No. Except maybe in China, sinc\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003Ee China is basically the opposite to everywhere else as far as arbitration is concerned (at least it used to be, basically the opposite of the sort of pri\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003Evate arrangement that arbitratio\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003En is in the west). \u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot that I\u0027m surprised.

I was intrigued to see someone say that TTI\u0027s lawyers must be good and wouldn\u0027t impose something on its users that would be unenforceable. I have to say that that is a very optimistic view; I\u0027d suspect instead that the lawyers who decided it would be a good idea to draft this sort of mumbo-jumbo were more of the school of thought that says you try to impose endless insane terms because at the end of the day, \u003Cem\u003Esome of them\u003C/em\u003E might stick, and that\u0027s a positive result.
