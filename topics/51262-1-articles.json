I would imagine it\u0027s the same concept as phase angles for planets, but I don\u0027t know how it would work if, for example, I want a Duna lander to intercept the return stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-31T21:43:02Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2013 09:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SirSnuggles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T02:49:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExperience, mostly. Just do it a few times and you\u0027ll see when to launch. Mostly, though, I just launch aiming to get behind what I need to dock to, so I can orbit a few times below it waiting for it to catch up to me. If you get in front of it you have to raise your orbit higher, wasting fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that the exact time to orbit is variable based on your ship, your boosters, what you\u0027re carrying, how well you perform your gravity turn, etc. Even if you use MechJeb the varying thrusters and weights will cause deviations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merlinux","CreatedById":83117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T03:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is different for all planetary bodies and also relative to the altitude of your target.

Or to put it simply, draw a line between yourself and your target; when that line is tangential to your orbit, hit the throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently works if you are in a higher orbit as well, the line just has to be tangential to your target\u0027s orbit instead of yours.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
