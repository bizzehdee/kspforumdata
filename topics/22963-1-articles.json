I did a practice run on two normal simple ships I used before. I used it to launch and orbit the 1st ship, and then set up a rendezvous with a 2nd. After getting into orbit I used the phasing step to get the 2 together. But the recommended orbit was 120 to match the 1st, but it put it at 123. I then set te Hohman transfer to find the closest approach, but the closest approach was 214km. I manually brought the orbits close and tried to do the hohman again, but it was still at 214km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Is this a flaw in Mechjeb? Or do i still have to do that part manually.
