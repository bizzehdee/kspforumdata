\u003Ci\u003EAway\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0and a few things really bothered me:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nReal time communication. Three weeks out from the Moon en route to Mars, but their video calls are still in real time despite the light seconds of distance between the ship and Earth. This is particularly conspicuous because later they say the crew can\u2019t do video calls any more because the delay is too long. Also mobile phones in space!?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhy use one spaceship for everything- first flying to the Moon to load fuel and water (instead of carrying the fuel and water up from the Moon to the spaceship in orbit), then land the whole thing on Mars when even a minor mishap will strand them there permanently? Where\u2019s the dedicated lander? More importantly, building a spaceship with a deployable centrifuge and then aerobraking it in Mars\u2019 atmosphere sounds like a very dangerous thing to do even with the centrifuge retracted.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe ship needs 3 solar panels to operate at Mars, and has 3 solar panels total. One of them malfunctions really early in the series and has to be fixed or the mission is doomed- why are there only 3!? Where\u2019s the redundancy? What happens when they\u2019re landed on Mars and it\u2019s night?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNobody bothered to bring any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E jet packs for use during EVAs even though those would be an eminently sensible thing to include for a 3 year mission in space. At least two incidents occur where astronauts have to untether and float around near the spaceship, and where those jet packs would have made everything trivially easy.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere are only 2 water recyclers, one breaks and the spare doesn\u2019t have the capacity to supply the mission at full output; yup, the spare goes kaput as well with gradually decreasing output. Who designed this thing exactly? And their plan to solve the water problem- poke a hole in the hull to get the water from the radiation shielding- fails when they miss and poke a hole in the hull, but nobody tried to plug the leak and instead they abandon their crew quarters. There are TWO centrifuge modules, but they decided to poke a hole in their bedrooms instead of the other one...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThey use the InSight lander\u2019s seismometer to listen for the robotic supply droneship\u2019s sonic boom as it arrives on Mars ahead of them, but nobody thinks to scroll forwards a few minutes to listen for a) a big boom\u00A0or b) a sustained rumble from the super-sensitive seismometer on the geologically inactive planet, to check if the drone ship actually landed in one piece. And apparently none of the satellites around Mars could look at the intended landing site to see if there were any new craters, scorch marks etc. or any visible signs at all of the drone ship on the surface.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe spaceship has three landing legs. For something that tall and heavy, three legs seems inadequate and prone to falling over, especially as two of them take the full force of re-entry heating. Their landing site is perilously close to some substantial rock formations as well.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u2019s also unclear how the ship manages to hold enough fuel (looks like kerolox to me from the few instances where the engines fire) to get from the surface of the Moon all the way to the surface of Mars and back again, especially with a fully powered landing as the ship has no parachutes. The only other possible source of fuel would be the drone ship, but hauling many tons of rocket fuel a quarter of a mile over the surface of Mars sounds like an accident waiting to happen\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe second supply ship is scheduled to arrive after the crewed ship gets there. Besides the bizarre transfer window involved in that scenario, it\u2019s also reckless to send only one supply ship before the crew arrives because so many landings on Mars fail and it\u2019s literally a matter of life and death.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThey brought a greenhouse and grew some plants in it, but then the water supplies go kaput so they let all the plants shrivel and die. Those super sturdy,\u00A0drought tolerant plants\u00A0that are going to be grown on Mars,\u00A0wilt and die in a couple of weeks without water...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, so there were more than a few things...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd anything that suggests that the Soviets could have landed a man on the moon, ever, is utterly unbelievable for the simple reason that the N1 rocket would never have worked- over 40 engines on the first stage and every time (twice) they tried to launch one it\u00A0had multiple engine failures resulting in the rockets exploding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clamp-o-Tron","CreatedById":201818,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-09T20:12:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223851565\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170269\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221599680533\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n30 minutes ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd anything that suggests that the Soviets could have landed a man on the moon, ever, is utterly unbelievable for the simple reason that the N1 rocket would never have worked- over 40 engines on the first stage and every time (twice) they tried to launch one it\u00A0had multiple engine failures resulting in the rockets exploding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the NK-15\u00A0was an ambitious engine, even recently its derivative the \u003Cs\u003ENK-33\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0AJ26-62 engine failed in the most hilarious rocket explosion since maybe the proton mishap.

Rafe, Danny, and the rest are P-40 pilots. Retraining them for a different single-engine fighter would take weeks. Getting them to the point of being able to get a multi-engine bomber off the ground, much less landing it without dying, would take months.

Furthermore, the crews on the Doolittle Raid were specially selected for their experience and proficiency with the B-25, not for their willingness to take on a suicide mission.\u00A0Rafe flying for the RAF in 1940 while still serving as an officer in the US Army Air Force obviously wouldn\u0027t happen, as that would be a clear violation of American neutrality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.

A little fun fact is, if you slow down the dogfight scenes (especially the \u0022fly low to lure the Zeroes to collide\u0022), you will notice that all aircraft does not have functional control surfaces, meaning they maneuver purely using the power of plot)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.

What\u0027s the reasoning behind it!?.\u00A0\u00A0It is explicitly stated that due to the Earth Engines\u0027 influence, the planet\u0027s rotation stopped, causing tsunamis all across the globe, devastating the surface and forces humanity to live underneath each of the engine city. By that point there\u0027s nothing alive on surface, only perpetual darkness and eternal blizzard that flash-freeze anyone wandering outside without protective suit. If the reason for minigun is for self-defense, a handgun is more than enough. To hammer the point of stupidity even further, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/kWp0hEi.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe only legitimate \u0022target\u0022 that\u0027s being fired upon by said minigun is JUPITER, LOOMING IN THE SKY\u003C/a\u003E when one of the team member gets frustrated after losing the core and began cursing while firing on said planet\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the Earth has stopped rotating and it is being propelled away from the Sun, only the northern hemisphere is exposed to sunlight, while the southern hemisphere, facing away from the sun, is in permanent night. Since the Earth Engines that push Earth are facing towards the sun, this means that most of the Earth Engines are on the lit side of Earth, with only the torque engines approaching the dark side. However, the\u00A0engines are also mentioned to be powered by ordinary rocks burned using \u0022heavy fusion\u0022 technology. From John Elliot from the same article as above, it would also take 95% of the Earth\u0027s mass to power the entire 4.3 light year trip to the Alpha Centauri system. By the time Earth reaches it\u0027s destination, there will be nothing left of it to be considered \u0022planet\u0022 anymore\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022gravitational spike\u0022 that Jupiter causes. No, planets cannot randomly increase in gravity. What\u0027s even more stupid is, the solution to escape from Jupiter\u0027s gravity? Ignite the atmosphere of Jupiter to propel Earth away. Igniting Jupiter\u0027s atmosphere would cause a shockwave strong enough to wreck the entire Earth.\u00A0The plan\u0027s outcome is even more devastating for the people on the surface of the planet. Assuming such a powerful explosion can even happen, an explosion powerful enough to push Earth away to allow it to overcome Jupiter\u0027s gravity while it\u0027s 30 minutes from breaching its roche limit would crush all the Earth Engines on the side of the planet that the shockwave hits, killing everyone who is currently on that side of Earth, sending shockwaves through the entire crust and probably caving in every underground city on the face of the globe, and leaving the world with one hell of a dent. Of course, none of that happens and Earth simply continues on its merry way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t expect any sense from Chinese blockbuster anyways.

This is pretty inaccurate, starting aircraft engines, particularly older ones, is often complicated and time-consuming. Even in newer aircraft with computers to help manage the process, there are still a series of deliberate steps so pilots can notice and diagnose engine problems before costly damage and/or safety risks occur. In fact, many jets don\u0027t even have the ability to start their engines, and have to be hooked up to a \u0022starter cart\u0022 on the ground to get the engines spinning. Many piston-engine planes require either a ground crewman turning a starter crank or manually spinning the prop while the pilot does his thing in the cockpit.\u00A0There are plenty of aircraft that can start without external help, but even those have a\u00A0much\u00A0longer startup sequence than you\u0027ll generally see on television\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, on to the actual movies.

Aside from being based on a somewhat dubious concept aircraft which would likely have trouble transitioning between wing angles, there\u0027s the minor issue that they\u0027re apparently all but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E-capable, swing-wing CATOBAR aircraft with comically gigantic missile loadouts and utterly insane range; there\u0027s no way an aircraft with such a laundry list of capabilities would be able to take off from a standard\u00A0Nimitz\u00A0catapult, and it\u0027s doubtful if it could do so at all, especially not with the stated empty weight of nine metric tons for a 70-foot aircraft. And even if all that weren\u0027t true, there\u0027s the small matter of their rear landing gear being secured to the carrier\u0027s deck with tie-down chains when they\u0027re on the catapult. There\u0027s also the infamous exploding plane scene, where Jessica Biel punches out seconds before her plane explodes. Next, the pilotless-but-still-in-one-piece plane twists around and starts\u00A0barreling after her\u00A0(although it\u00A0had\u00A0been twisting around before she hit the eject).\u00A0Then\u00A0it explodes, and an enormous cloud of wreckage chases her down. The level of debris raining on her rather suggests she was carrying a Lockheed C-130 troop transport in her missile bay. Slightly less obvious but equally hilarious is how the F/A-37s are shown to outfly Su-37s using exactly the kind of cool supermaneuver\u00A0those very Su-37s introduced in real life. Somehow, the Russian pilots in movies only know how to fly in straight lines. Made even worse when you know that those very same maneuvers are reserved for airshows and technology demonstration, and that no competent pilot would actually be stupid enough to attempt one in an actual dogfight. Made even more worse (worser?) that they are in a dogfight at all, when both sides are equipped with Beyond Visual Range missile technology, which means dogfighting is your last resort, not your go-to strategy for an engagement. Or the fact the non-stealth Faux-37s weren\u0027t even detected until they were only 25 miles out, etc. There\u0027s also the fact that these Su-37s are shown as two-seaters, when the only two Su-37s in the real world only have room for the pilot. The F/A-37\u0027s cockpit also has more elbow room than do passengers on commercial jets. A bit more forgivably, the joystick is in a between-the-legs placement; most American jets since the F-16 have a side stick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn \u003Cstrong\u003EMoonraker\u003C/strong\u003E, the sequence in which a space shuttle blasts off from the aircraft carrying it. The shuttle is never carried with fuel or live batteries, that would be far above the carrying limit of the carrier aircraft. Even if Drax somehow arranged for them to be onboard, the Shuttle is basically a glider \u2014 its engine and onboard fuel aren\u0027t enough to fly it any great distance as if it were a regular jet plane. It is also impossible to carry a shuttle on the back of a normal 747, even if you could add a cradle on top. The turbulence caused by it renders the normal rudder basically useless (the NASA 747 used to ferry the shuttles had additional vertical steering surfaces installed at the ends of the horizontal tail surfaces for this reason, this is also why An-225 \u003Cem\u003EMriya\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0used twin-tail design: in order to put the rudders away from the turbulence caused by \u003Cem\u003EBuran\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0on top of it so it remains usable in-flight). The other problems can be explained with this being something more like an earlier design, which included air-breathing jet engines with a significant internal fuel store. You\u0027d still never get enough fuel on board it without it being noticed to be overweight when it was loaded on the carrier, or at the very least when the carrier was being pre-flighted and the crew noticed the landing gear was reading thousands of pounds more weight than it should be. Additionally, if the shuttle firing its engines while attached to the 747 causes the latter to explode, why does the 747 have an indicator in the cockpit for \u003Cem\u003E\u0027Shuttle Ignition\u0027\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0(!) as if they were\u00A0expecting it to happen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn \u003Cstrong\u003EGoldenEye\u003C/strong\u003E,\u00A0the real Eurocopter Tiger cannot survive an EMP and cannot lock missiles onto itself. The MC\u00A0at the demonstration where it is stolen announces it as a prototype with new features. Another is during the scene where the MiG pilot killed when his aircraft augurs gets unresponsive in after the first EMP (hammering his fist on the canopy in a vain attempt to escape). He should have pulled his ejection handle. Aircraft ejection seats are specifically designed to function with no power source of any kind, and are largely immune to EMP, the phenomenon being reasonably well-understood as an effect of nuclear weapons detonations. Even systems with electronic initiation have a backup system. As a rule, much more concern is spent making sure the ejection seat doesn\u0027t go off when it\u00A0shouldn\u0027t, such as when the plane is on the ground\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn \u003Cstrong\u003ETomorrow Never Dies\u003C/strong\u003E, the Chinese planes that attack the stray British ship are repeatedly described as \u0022Chinese MiGs\u0022. Although China does have MiGs, these aren\u0027t them; the aircraft are clearly recognizable as Q-5s, an indigenous Chinese type (admittedly partly based on MiG-19 technology, but very different in appearance). Apparently a case of the special effects department doing better research than the scriptwriters. On the other hand,\u00A0a Qian-5 that drops a torpedo would be an extraordinary beast. They should have used the Chinese Harbin-5 bomber, based on the Ilyushin-28. In the teaser, when the Royal Navy frigate fires the cruise missile at the terrorist \u0022flea market\u0022, M tells 007 he has four minutes to get clear. The target is 400 miles from the ship. A Tomahawk cruise missile (as shown) has a top speed of about 550 miles per hour. It should have taken the missile about\u00A043\u00A0minutes to get there. The novelization blows it even more thoroughly, with a Harpoon missile being launched, and traveling\u00A0800\u00A0miles in 4 minutes 8 seconds. First of all, a Harpoon (an\u00A0antiship\u00A0missile) has a maximum range of less than 100 miles, and second, it travels at about the same (determinedly subsonic) speed as the Tomahawk. To do 800 miles in 248 seconds, it would have needed to achieve about 11,600 miles per hour, or about 3.2 miles per second - about half of Earth\u0027s\u00A0escape velocity. Also, any object traveling that fast at low altitude would burn up like a meteor hitting the lower atmosphere - plus what the shock wave effects would do to anything along its path on the\u00A0ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn \u003Cstrong\u003ECasino Royale,\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0one scene features a prototype \u0022Skyfleet S570\u0022, possibly intended as a fictional version of the then-new Airbus A380. The actual plane we see, however, is obviously a Boeing 747 with external fuel tanks hanging from the wings (specifically, it\u0027s the decommissioned 747 that lives on the\u00A0Top Gear\u00A0test track). This makes very little sense for any civilian aircraft. Also, a Czech Airlines plane is seen. That airline did not operate flights to Miami in 2006 (no doubt due to the scene being filmed at Vaclav Havel Airport in Prague, where the airline is based).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn \u003Cstrong\u003EAsteroid,\u003C/strong\u003E a\u00A0laser\u00A0(judging by its size, geodesic; and of course, with the ray visible in space) fastened onto an F-16,\u00A0manually aimed at a megameter or so, which blows up the big asteroid. Made even worse by the comment in-film that the lasers\u00A0had\u00A0to be fired from within the atmosphere to be aimed properly, as though having all that air in the way made it\u00A0easier\u00A0to target something in space. Though one could argue that it would be silly even with the Pentagon\u0027s \u0022realistic\u0022 solution \u2014 an experimental laser cannon on a Boeing 747, which at least could take out missiles or aircraft. As opposed to the plain and sane original idea: arrange meeting of damn stone and\u00A0little fusion device, the higher orbit the better (even better with a group of miners), then watch some\u00A0fireworks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-21T15:27:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou dare bring logic and science into a Bond movie??\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-21T16:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFive cents more:\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn Moonraker the python was not hungry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-21T16:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223857459\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170269\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221600702020\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n46 minutes ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou dare bring logic and science into a Bond movie??\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat scene in Casino Royale with the barrel rolling DBX though...
