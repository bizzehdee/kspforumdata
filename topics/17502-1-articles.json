It is also a slide show producer ( in spite of the pic showing a mechjeb-less version, I was forced to use mechjeb for the launch sequence because of that ... ) so use at your own peril. The Kraken also loves it and it will start spinning at very low altitude ( 50-60 km ), so the tests on this ship will be halted until 0.17 comes out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?wscdxltf4j1st1l\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI leave here a zip with both the stock version and the one with MechJeb\u003C/a\u003E. As I could only launch with mechJeb, I can only say instructions wise that you should fire as soon as the physics kick in ( the bottom engine tends to break out of the ship due to the weight if you don\u0027t fire out ASAP ) and to use the standard Mechjeb flight plan ( not even thinked on optimizing it so far ).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueSubstance","CreatedById":40362,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T11:50:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheRocketMan","CreatedById":36918,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T15:14:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks Dangerous. :3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice plumbing work, You wouldn\u0027t mind coming and doing my U bend now would you? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been eating the KSC Canteen food. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartan117","CreatedById":25092,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T20:36:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure Jeb would most certainly approve of your rocket. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
