I find myself switching between map and camera constantly during launch and other operations because not all the information i need is in either view. Also having the apo/peri value stick to the marker would be a massive improvement over having to hover mouse to see it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T17:18:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it could look very pretty to somehow unify the map and flight views like that. Maybe it could be represented as a researchable item to be bolted onto the craft and dependant on an antenna, to indicate a connection to a tracking network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESilly idea: Selectable option to make it so you need this item on your craft to be able to switch to map view while in flight. Without it, you have to unload the flight and go to the tracking station. It\u0027s another use for antennae, and another limit on the ability to go to Minmus and back at tech 0.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-14T17:22:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2014 05:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by technicalfool\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EnigmaRaptor","CreatedById":38271,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T18:47:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of having to do a manual line of sight launch, except that orbiting is hopeless without any way of knowing what your apoaspis and periaspis are. They would have to add some info readouts to the cockpit or camera views. I know you can figure it out if you have the time and motivation to \u0022do the math\u0022 or research known orbital velocities, but honestly that is something for hard-mode players and your average beginner player is going to just quit when they don\u0027t understand what they need to do. I agree there needs to be a technical barrier to getting out of kerbin orbit. And also more use of the antenna would be cool. Mods already prove many concepts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
