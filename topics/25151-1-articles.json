I\u0027m hoping this is successful and will encourage more folks to do this, and maybe just maybe encourage some of the younger commentors to pursued a career in Engineering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECouple of notes before we get started. First, while you can ask me anything, I reserve the right to answer, \u0022No Comment\u0022. Second, I\u0027m thinking of letting questions collect until sometime tomorrow, and will decide on Sunday if I feel it was succesful. If it is, I will keep it open for a while, if not, I will stop taking questions. Thirdly, while I don\u0027t care what you ask (like I said I reserve the right to not answer), the mods might, keep that in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a little more background information about me so we can hit the ground running. I\u0027m living in Florida and grew up in the panhandle and I work for a large government contractor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bandit4910","CreatedById":14446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T17:33:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you done work for NASA?(Considering you work for a Government Contractor.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amram","CreatedById":8067,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T19:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEver do anything for the military(....that you can talk about if so)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tauge","CreatedById":39280,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T15:04:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t gotten an opportunity to work with NASA, though the company I work for has on many occasions. As for the military....well, I don\u0027t have a clearance, so for any project that is classified, I\u0027m not allowed to know the customer. For example, right now I\u0027m working on a part of a future satellite. I don\u0027t know what this satellite will do, I don\u0027t know who wants it, it could be any of a dozen government agencies, of whom about half are military,l. I only know what I\u0027m working on and how it interacts with the components next to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little more background. I\u0027m an FPGA engineer, before I started at my current company I was more involved in commercial aerospace. For example, I helped with a chip on Embraer\u0027s, upcoming Legacy 450 and 500. Anything else? My education? More specifics about what I do? What its like living within a hour drive of KSC? What it was like working for Disney(I went to college in Orlando, everyone worked at Disney eventually)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
