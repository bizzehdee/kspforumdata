I\u0027ve never heard of that version. The only R-36 versions I\u0027ve seen are the R-36, R-36M, and derivatives of the R-36M (like the R-36M2, R-36MUTTh, et cetera).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, among all of those only one is actually solid fuelled; the Minuteman III of course. The R-36 is most definitely a liquid fuelled rocket (so is the Titan II). Here\u0027s a quite impressive photo of the R-36 lifting off:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/r/r36ml1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r36ml1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plume of red \u0022smoke\u0022 pouring out of the upper end of the missile is some of the nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) oxidizer in the fueling lines pouring out of the now severed umbilicals. You usually see a similar plume -- plus condensation plumes -- on liquid oxygen (LOX) fuelled rockets; like the Titan and Atlas series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course both the R-36 and Titan series are bi-propellant rockets; in that they need a second substance to actually combust. A rocket with NTO as the oxidizer will, most often have some form of hydrazine as its actual fuel; the R-36 using unsymmetrical dimethyl-hydrazine (UDMH); a rocket with LOX (example, the Titan series, Atlas series, or the Saturn rockets that took US astronauts to the moon), will usually have kerosene (US rockets using a type called \u0022Rocket Propellent 1\u0022 (RP-1)) for the lower stages, and for space based stages will use liquid hydrogen (LH2) as it\u0027s more powerful. Of course the Titan II ICBM usually only LOX and RP-1. (Less \u0022stuff\u0022 to have to deal with in the silo fuelling equipment. Since the missile silo already has to deal with the LOX and RP-1 propellents, and Helium as well as LN2 for the pneumatics and hydraulics on the missile systems.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOX and NTO aren\u0027t the only oxidizers out there. There\u0027s red-fuming nitric acid (RFNA), inhibited red-fuming nitric acid (IRFNA), white-fuming nitric acid (WFNA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and as one last example chlorine triflouride (CTF).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat last one deserves special mention. Let me quote the excellent John Clark from his quite good book \u003Cem\u003EIgnition!\u003C/em\u003E (which is all about liquid rocket fuels):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John Clark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022John Clark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt is, of course, extremely toxic, but that\u0027s the least of the problem. It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water-with which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metals-steel, copper, aluminium, etc.-because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride which protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminium keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich of course means it is the most Kerbal of oxidizers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course we\u0027re getting way, way off topic of ICBMs. Though, I do have to question your selection of ICBMs to make.

The Titan I was the first silo based, and first \u0022proper\u0022 multiple stage missile. The Titan II\u0027s claim to fame was being the first American ICBM to use storeable rocket propellents (that is, the missile can sit in its silo with its fuel tanks full without having anything bad happening to it, or its fuel), which was NTO and Aerozine 50 (a mix of fifty percent pure hydrazine and fifty percent pure UDMH); the Titan II in a slightly modified civilian variant was used as a launch vehicle during NASA\u0027s Gemini program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Atlas F ICBM is picked for two reasons; number one is the fact the Atlas family of ICBMs (and space launch vehicles) was the first American ICBM, period. The second reason is that the Atlas F was the last ICBM version of the Atlas family; it and the slightly different Atlas E got converted into rather useful satellite launch vehicles (though not specifically used with the Atlas E/F launch vehicles, the RM-81 Agena and Centaur upper stages being most notable). There\u0027s also a third reason, that being the fact the Atlas rockets (all of them up to and including the Atlas II launch vehicle) had a very interesting \u0022stage and a half\u0022 design; where the outer two booster engines would be jettisoned leaving the main engine (and two vernier engines) as well as the fuel tankage remaining. Atlas III and beyond got rid of that design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Minuteman III was chosen as it is the only land based ICBM currently in use by the US. It\u0027s predecessors the LGM-30 Minuteman I was the first solid fuelled missile to enter service in the US, as well as the first missile to have an onboard computer guidance system (as opposed to the simpler guidance systems on the Atlas F and Titan II, or the effectively non-existent guidance system on the Titan I). The Minuteman III also had an interesting addition compared to the earlier Minuteman versions, in that it has a pseudo-fourth stage; the part of the missile that holds the actual \u0022boom\u0022 has a tiny liquid fuelled motor to adjust its course, and; for MIRV based goodness, help deliver each MIRV to the right place; the other three stages are all solid fuelled (with liquid fuel injected into the nozzles of some of the stages to steer them better); though the first stage actually does have a four nozzle engine, which I am surprised about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LGM-118A Peacekeeper (also known as MX) was picked because it was simply the biggest ICBM in the US arsenal. It\u0027s also in the photo at the start of this thread. There\u0027s nothing else I could say about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in terms of the Russian ICBM\u0027s...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe R-7/R-7A were picked becuase of two reasons, firstly they were the first Russian ICBM ever (and first ICBM in the world), secondly the a modified version of this ICBM was used for several of the early Russian space launches (most famously Sputnik, and Vostok 1 which made Yuri Gagarin the first human in space).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe R-36M was picked as it was a counterpart of, and the reason for the development of, the LGM-118 Peacekeeper, being the largest ICBM in the Russian arsenal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RT2-PM Topol was picked as it is the most deployed missile by the Russians; it was also the first road mobile ICBM deployed by the Soviets as well. It\u0027s solid fuelled too. (It also inspired the US to develop the Midgetman (not a typo) road mobile missile, which promptly got cancelled at the end of the Cold War.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe UR-100N was picked as it is the most modern Russian silo launched missile; it is liquid fuelled like the other ICBMs fielded by Russia/the Soviet Union.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anything else would be added I would suggest the RM-81 Agena and Centaur upper stages. Since they would make the American Atlas into its more common space launch vehicle design, as compared to the \u0022bare\u0022 Atlas F. The Centaur and Agena were also used on the Titan II base (with or without strap on solid fuel boosters) as the Titan III. (There was a dedicated Titan III core, but we\u0027ll ignore that. Just as we\u0027ll ignore the fact that the Atlas-Agena and Atlas-Centaur were usually atop Atlas D derived lower stages with Atlas F avionics.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could describe, in detail, what I think would be a good \u0022breakdown\u0022 of the various parts for the mod pack; but I\u0027m quite sure you wouldn\u0027t be interested (plus it is your mod, not mine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mark James\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mark James\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;Image snipped for space.\u0026gt;\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is the almost finished titan 2 engine. just have to add a few details and texture\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a good model; but it most assuredly is not even close to what the real Aerojet LR87 looked like.
