He\u0027s had it play games like Super Mario Bros., Tetris, Bubble Bobble, Legend of Zelda (unsuccessfully), Punch-Out, and more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOCurBYI_gY?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nThere are multiple videos on his program playing other games.

Not to mention the way he does his videos is ingenious, especially how he ends all 3 of the PlayFun videos. He also has a video on how to make a program to automatically make NES games 3D (albeit the status of the program as of the video was buggy but applicable). He also has ordered the \u003Ci\u003Eentire 4th Star Wars film (\u003C/i\u003Eor first depending on your circle\u003Ci\u003E) by the line. \u003C/i\u003EI believe he had a program do this as well, but still it\u0027s amazing (and kind of funny) to watch the entire process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nJust felt this guy deserves a bit more attention for this cool concept and so I decided to share it with the nerdiest group I know \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-02T22:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s pretty amazing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd when it realizes that it\u0027s going to lose at Tetris, it pauses the game, so that it never\u00A0loses.
