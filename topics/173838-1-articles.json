For axis run the left stick through thrustmasters virtual software and it will have a new name. You have to do that before you setup or turn on ksp.\u00A0Then for buttons use the mod Action\u00A0Group\u00A0Extended\u00A0to assign each button. Or if you run modless you can used Voice Commander to assign buttons to keyboard commands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GrubbyZebra","CreatedById":168140,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-14T21:34:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with the dual stick is that when using TM\u0027s virtual controller software, all the axes are split in half in the game with center stick being full deflection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GrubbyZebra","CreatedById":168140,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-21T04:43:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, got it to work by installing vJoy\u002BUJR.
