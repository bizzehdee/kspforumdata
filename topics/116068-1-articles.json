This means that I haven\u0027t been able to produce videos on my YouTube channel, called Bagel Rabbit (see my signature if you really want to, but again, it\u0027s not necessary). I want to make sure that when I return, I\u0027m producing enough quality content to attract a larger audience than I have right now.

This series attracted a lot of people to my channel, and many of the videos in it are among the most-watched things that I\u0027ve ever done. The only problem? The \u0022Bagel Drawings\u0022 videos probably rank as among the worst videos I\u0027ve ever made. Worse yet, I made an \u003Cem\u003Eabysmal\u003C/em\u003E video called something like \u0022How to Hack a Plasma Globe.\u0022 This video is the most popular one on my channel, in spite of its weak monologue and general dragging-on. Though I would love to delete it, it accounts for some fifty percent of my viewing traffic, and it may be directing people to my KSP videos... or maybe not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leads me to my first question: \u003Cstrong\u003EShould I delete some of my very popular but very bad videos?\u003C/strong\u003E Is it worth the reduced exposure to have a greater proportion of reasonably good content on my channel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2) Outros!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack when Andrew Hansen was at the height of his popularity, I asked him how I could gain subscribers as fast as he could (he was picking them up at a crazy rate). He said that one thing that would improve my videos would be an outro screen prompting people to subscribe and watch my other videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027m not a huge fan of outro screens and generally click off of videos immediately before they happen. They certainly seem to be popular amongst the more prominent YouTubers though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this leads to my second question: \u003Cstrong\u003EWould an outro be a good idea for my channel?\u003C/strong\u003E Would this cause my view and/or subscriber counts to increase?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3) Channel Content!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I would like to ask whether my channel\u0027s content is good as-is, or whether it needs to be punched up a little. Right now, the majority of my videos are craft showcase videos with commentary. I feel as if this form has gotten a little old though, and I\u0027m wondering about a change of pace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking that the best way to do this for me is to have heavily-edited short videos in which I show the building and the testing of whatever craft I feel like making (perhaps including subscriber-suggested craft). This would be nice because it would show a bit of behind-the-scenes and occasional humorous failures. I could also spread craft construction over two or more videos, creating \u0022cliffhangers:\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EWill I actually get this craft to work? Stay tuned!\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I currently abandon more than half of my designs. This type of video series would cause me to try to troubleshoot and actually fix the problems I\u0027ve made instead of abandoning the craft outright. I think that this would make me a better KSP builder as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy third question is: \u003Cstrong\u003EWould such videos work well, or are there any other video ideas that you think would be cool?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and if you can think of any other way to improve my channel, that would be nice too.

You can see this in the youtube analytics page. If not, then they aren\u0027t really contributing to your channel anymore. If you feel strongly enough about disliking them, you can hide them from public view, but still retain them on the channel if you ever feel like relisting them. The view counts may be misleading because they are older videos, it may be they just accumulate more over time.

Everyone creates content that appeals to a different audience. Knowing your audience can help you guide what you create. I will say that if you want to keep making videos you should go for something that you personally enjoy making. If YOU have fun, then the people watching will pick up on that and smile along.
