Perhaps the tolerance of docking ports should be a bit wider when the vessel is landed. I have the same problem, that you can\u0027t get the height exactly right and even if you can you still have to spend forever carefully lining up the alignment because on the ground the magnets of the ports aren\u0027t strong enough to slide the craft sideways into alignment like they are in orbit, so you have to keep fiddling with zig-zagging in and out from the port until you happen to find the sweet spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
