Use any combination of high speed, engine exhaust, and even explosions to attempt to heat a single stock part to the highest temperature you can - let\u0027s see if we can make something glow blue!\n\nSpecific rules:\n\nCheats are allowed, including infinite fuel and of course the option of showing thermal properties in the right-click menus. This also includes thermal debug colors, but it will be less awesome if you don\u0027t make things glow out of sheer hotness ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAny mods are allowed, as long as the following are true:\n\n- the part being heated is a stock part\n\n- any part used to heat that part, e.g. an engine, is a stock engine and the mod does not change its exhaust temperature\n\n- the mod cannot change the atmosphere\u0027s thermal properties, so until I hear proof that it\u0027s kosher, I\u0027m disallowing FAR and NEAR.\n\n- you acknowledge that simply using HyperEdit to re-enter an atmosphere at ludicrous speed is a cop-out and will receive fewer awesomeness points.\n\nThis challenge can be attempted anywhere in the game except near Kerbol - for the time being I\u0027m denoting this as any closer to Kerbol than Moho\u0027s periapsis and not in Moho\u0027s SOI.\n\nYou may use HyperEdit to put the ship in orbit, but your orbit before \u0022going manual\u0022 must not be hyperbolic and must have a Periapsis outside the atmosphere of whichever planet you\u0027re orbiting.\n\nThe stat I\u0027m using to score temperatures is the \u0022Temperature\u0022, not the \u0022Temp Ext\u0022 or any other measurements, so don\u0027t bother using physics-less parts as they don\u0027t appear to have their own temperature.\n\nProof of concept (not that it\u0027s hard to grasp):\n\n[![NEIORRQl.png](http://i.imgur.com/NEIORRQl.png)](http://imgur.com/NEIORRQ)\n\nMy score: 2761.7.
