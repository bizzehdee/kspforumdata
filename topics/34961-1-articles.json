Directional controls spin your craft to head in a new direction, whereas translation controls will shift your craft without changing its heading. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(default keys in default mode - docking \u003Cstrong\u003Emode\u003C/strong\u003E changes things a bit, hitting space changes WASD from direction to translation and back again)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could try adding small rockets to your rover that fire at a low thrust to provide continuous down force as you ride...
