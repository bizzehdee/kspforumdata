Might need DOSBox to run it though but most flight sticks should work, especially single, no throttle, non-programmable ones.\n\nIf you fancy 90\u0027s helicopter sims, not really complicated but somewhat \u0022realistic\u0022 for games that old, you could look up Hind, or Apache95.\n\nIf you want to go haywire full on study sim, Falcon 4.0 Allied Force, but honestly, that one is not one for casual gaming. Same goes for the DCS series of high fidelity sims.\n\nLast edit, promise: Forgot. For the DSC games, you probably want a full set of flight controls, not just a single button stick.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T22:18:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 10:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LN400**"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T22:18:42Z","Content":"If you want full- on realism, you\u0027ve got to get flight sim X and Superbug/ tac pack.
