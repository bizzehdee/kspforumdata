I\u0027m not very savvy with aerodynamics, but the outer section of the main wing (as you can see in the image, it\u0027s broken up into two sections, the outer one holds both control surfaces) has a very small stalling angle. Like, it will stall at angles of attack as small as 10 degrees. Those flaps will also stall at no less than 15 degrees of deflection. Is this a problem with how I shaped the wings, or the leading/trailing edges? Or is it a bug?
