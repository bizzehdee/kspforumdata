This would set what layers are active and on selecting an item to attach would set that item to those layers. Each Item would also have 10 buttons in its right click menu that would work the same setting what layer(s) it was assigned too. Only items on an active layer could be selected\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would also be a toggle button next to each layers GUI button that would let you toggle whether a layer was obscured, which would make all item on that layer become mostly transparent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally there would be 10 more buttons that could be selected to assign what level(s) of items the current selection can snap too. Items not on an active layer could be connected too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if something like this is even possible as a mod so some input would be helpful at this point. If it is possible I would probably see what I could do to implement it although it may take me quite a bit as while I\u0027m fairly proficient with python I have no idea how to use unity or c# (I believe those are what I would need to use for this). If it is not then I will make a post on the suggestions part of the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny input would be appreciated on if it is possible or the idea itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T21:57:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI personally feel this adds an unnecessary level of complexity to craft building, as one would have to keep track of which layer each part is built in, as well as moving objects between layers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatives available in the existing game include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Re-orienting / zooming your building view in the VAB/SPH to focus on the parts you want\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Split up complex projects into simpler subassmblies that can then be put together to make the final desired vessel\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T23:42:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree something like this could make life easier as things get more complex and you end up with multiple rings of craft and trying to place items on the inside stage but then again it\u0027s a balance thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of adding another organizing scheme could you do something like this more simply using the current staging system?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking add a checkbox to each staging widget so that when ticked the stage would ghost out and not except new parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you turn off the stage with root part then the closest visible part could become temporary root so that it all moves together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T01:02:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mattinoz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mattinoz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI agree something like this could make life easier as things get more complex and you end up with multiple rings of craft and trying to place items on the inside stage but then again it\u0027s a balance thing. \u003Cp\u003EInstead of adding another organizing scheme could you do something like this more simply using the current staging system?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking add a checkbox to each staging widget so that when ticked the stage would ghost out and not except new parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you turn off the stage with root part then the closest visible part could become temporary root so that it all moves together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that root part inheritance is needed for this function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Just a simple \u0022eyeball\u0022 gizmo on \u00225\u0022 next to \u0022root\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnabling this widget lets you left-click parts to turn them into ghosts, right-click unghosts parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGhosting/unghosting also affects any child parts, so ghosting the root node would ghost the craft, right clicking the root node would unghost the whole craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGhost parameters like translucence and color is configurable in the menu for VAB options.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-20T01:08:10Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2015 01:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KrazyKrl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
