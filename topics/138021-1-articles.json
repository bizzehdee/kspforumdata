Thing is if you can get the speed down to 1400 m/s or less with the engine taking the brunt. You can then safely turn around and use the craft parts for lift up. Most of the time when SAS in use if you are following the retrograde? marker in. You should be using 0.24 to 0.29\u00A0electricity about and if you kept the solar panels on and are in the day light.
