I\u0027m a relatively new player from Hawaii who\u0027s about halfway through their tech tree so far! Can\u0027t get enough of this game! I only have two Mods installed. Mechjeb and Alarmclock. I\u0027m trying to finish the tech tree with as little help from mods as I can, so I can understand the game better. So far, I have only been to the Mun and Minmus, but planning a trip to duna and it\u0027s moon to try and grab some major science. As far as career mode goes, I\u0027m only active on two missions right now (Temp surveys of Mun and Satelite in Mun orbit). I took an unmanned rover with me so I could try and knock out as much science on nearby biomes. I landed right on my last temp survey area (or so I thought)\u00A0which was required to be taken on the surface, but it doesnt seem to check the box for me. Does anyone know if the rover will trigger the message about entering the temp survey area, or do I\u00A0need the manned lander to do it? The only other issue I seem to be having but minor, in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, i cannot zoom in or out with the exception of the middle mouse click and drag. Everything I see says you can use then Shift\u002B/-, but it doesnt seem to be working for me.
