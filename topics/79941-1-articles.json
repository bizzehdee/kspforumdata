I\u0027m slowly losing my social life thanks to KSP, and I\u0027m still just practicing orbital rendezvous and docking! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, off to my question - I\u0027ve recently noticed that when I hover over a part in the VAB (not in the actual part list, but when the part has actually been placed in the VAB) I get a part info label that pops up. Also, in the lower left hand corner, I\u0027m now noticing a Delta V and TWR readout just to left of the COL icon. Anyone have any idea if these were introduced with the last major update, or either of the hotfixes? I didn\u0027t see anything that references these changes in the change logs, so perhaps it was added by a mod? Hoping someone knows where they may have come from, and perhaps how to disable them if possible? Worst case scenario I\u0027ll start removing each mod that I suspect may have added them, but am hoping someone here will know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t particularly mind the part labels when hovering over the part, but the dV and TWR readout text at lower left are covered and unreadable since I use Simple Part Organizer, and it\u0027s icons are covering the readouts. If anyone can give me a heads up on what mod may have added these, or if it was one of the recent KSP updates it\u0027d be most appreciated! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T05:20:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you mean ISP and TWR?
