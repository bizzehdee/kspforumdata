I think we should work together in allied space factions to achieve all kinds of new goals with recognition, funding etc. for our accomplishments. Afterall, this is Kerbal SPACE program. I think we should have a bunch of space agencies that anyone can join. No wars, no battles, no grudges. We will of course have budgets and other obstacles, but this would add a whole new thing to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t intend to have any particular leader for this, but I would like to start my own space program while this post is going up. I don\\\u0027t have a name yet, but I can probably take 30 people right off the bat. Then others could make their own space programs. By this time next month, we\\\u0027ll have entire cities built on Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you guys think.
