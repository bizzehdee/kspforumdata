In addition, any craft with those engines attached will not have any working engine, and the camera behaves very weirdly, remaining focused on the spot where the craft was first loaded into view while the craft itselfs moves on (if it has any other engine to move on with)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, luckily, I make a daily backup of my gamedata folder.
