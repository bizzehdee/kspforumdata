You get the same results if you use stock omnidecouplers. Solution: Don\u0027t put the decoupler and the engine in the same stage. Stage the decoupler, wait a second, then activate the engine. \n\n**@linuxgurugamer** -- you might want to move my patch to a truly optional install.

From a quick skim through I didn\u0027t really see anything that makes it desirable... For the most part the only thing I *did* see is making the decouplers omni directional, which, depending on the user, is a personal preference \u002B a petal adapter fix.

If I try to attach them, I still see their attachment nodes on the top. but after placing them, it\u0027s impossible to select them again. In addition, any craft with those engines attached will not have any working engine, and the camera behaves very weirdly, remaining focused on the spot where the craft was first loaded into view while the craft itselfs moves on (if it has any other engine to move on with)\n\nSo, luckily, I make a daily backup of my gamedata folder. I went and deleted the KWRocketry folder and replaced it with the one from the backup that worked yesterday... except that, weirdly, the bug is still present (do I have to infer that the community fix is in fact hosted in another folder than KWRocketry\u0027 one? If so, what\u0027s the folder I need to restore?)
