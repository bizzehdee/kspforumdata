Before I do that in the tracking station, I always click on the \u0022show crew\u0022 button over on the right edge, to verify that the thing I\u0027m about to terminate doesn\u0027t have any crew members on it. Did not know about the transparent-button thing, thank you very much for the warning!\n\nA really simple UI tweak they could make to the \u0022terminate\u0022 button that would make it a lot friendlier: Make it so that if you click it for something that has any crew on board, it pops up a big warning dialog that asks you \u0022this craft has N kerbals aboard, completing this action will kill all of them. Are you sure you want to proceed?\u0022 Wouldn\u0027t help you from accidentally terminating something that\u0027s unmanned but valuable, but at least would be an improvement.\n\nNormally I try to avoid using terminate at all, and when I rescue kerbals, I have them rename their vessel to \u0022debris\u0022 before leaving. However, that\u0027s not always possible: if their wreck is something that\u0027s not a command pod (like a hitchhiker module, or such), then it can\u0027t be renamed and the only way to get rid of it is either to deorbit it or terminate."}]}
