The second number (the value) would be the torque. Ignore the 3rd and 4th digits. (2nd key only has 3; I forget if that\u0027s a problem.

No luck. But thank you Starwaster that gives me some stuff to play with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I just realized.. This particular rover has negative camber set on its wheels ( the wheels are tilted outward slightly ) to give the rover more cornrring stability ( and it really works ) But when going straight not all of the wheels surface is flat on the ground so.. could that maybe explain my traction issues?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do others experience with the small S2 wheels? Has anyone else had traction issues in the past with them?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
