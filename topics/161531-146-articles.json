Anyhow, I found what the problem was. KSPI is conflicting with \u0022b9_hotrockets.cfg\u0022 from the b9 mod. I only bring this up because both mods are a must have for me and others may share my same feelings. I have since deleted the \u0022MP_NAZARI\u0022 folder containing the .cfg and the engine effects now work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Profit-","CreatedById":144948,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T03:50:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAm I reading this right? 65 Terawatts of heat dissipation????\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/gznid2y9l/full/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s28.postimg.org/8u5gexa0t/image.png\u0022 alt=\u0022image.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(On a side note, I do believe convection may not be working correctly, I am having problems with overheating even with really high dissipation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E145 Terawatts now, heat is still rising.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-28T04:51:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2015 04:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Profit-\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T06:47:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Profit-\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Profit-\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@freethinker This could change, but I have been looking and I don\u0027t have any bugs to report.
