I, too, disagree on the overpriced bit. The game is actually pretty cheap on sales. Heck, it\u0027s cheaper than its DLC (now the DLC, yes, I think is overpriced).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway. No, they won\u0027t delete it from Steam; they won\u0027t make it free either. It could go on (even cheaper) sales, but I doubt that\u0027d happen too soon (not until people have bought KSP2, that is).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI, myself, won\u0027t make the switch any time soon. I do find most games too expensive on release and can only buy them on sales, often years after release. Plus, I do prefer a game that is fully developed, vastly modded (the mods improve this game so much), with a strong community. So I\u0027d only switch from KSP 1 to 2 once the second is at a similar stage, if ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a risky thing, development-wise. I like racing simulators and this reminds of rFactor. I never made the switch from rFactor 1 to rFactor2; a lot of people didn\u0027t. Eventually we just moved on to other titles, as it was never the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-21T13:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCivilization V is still there, despite the VI already available.
