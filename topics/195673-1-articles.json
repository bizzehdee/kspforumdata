Not even complaining, as long as you save reasonably often (bugs like this and the spontaneously exploding surface bases are why I will never play without quicksave enabled), but it\u0027s kind of bizarre and a little funny. I just sent the first chunk of my eve space station. Burn went fine, intercept only needed a little tweaking. So I warp to get out of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, to make the adjustment easier, but it stops the warp halfway through; then, when I complete the warp, all of a sudden my flight path only goes halfway between Kerbin and Eve\u0027s orbits\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.
