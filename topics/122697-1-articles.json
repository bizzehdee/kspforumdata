This means that IR can end up with its robot arm (for example) being mounted backwards, which it doesn\u0027t like. As such we advise to avoid having docking ports at the end of anything robotic. Having them elsewhere on your craft is fine, as this won\u0027t affect the hierarchy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s interesting that you post this today though. I was watching a stream last night and this piece of information came to my attention about the rules that govern docking (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79594\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79594\u003C/a\u003E). Maybe there\u0027s a set of rules that can be followed that will allow for docking/undocking of vessels without the hierarchy being altered for the areas IR is used.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Springer-dinger","CreatedById":135863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T10:07:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you zodius and an interesting link.
