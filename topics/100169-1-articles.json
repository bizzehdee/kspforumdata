I am very new to this so all the help is much appreciated!\n\nGreat looking little fighter you have there. May I make a few suggestions?\n\n-I would dump the additional intakes on the sides of the lightning cockpit, they aren\u0027t needed. The cockpit has intakes in it. \n\n-I would add a gun, the BDarmory hidden 20mm is a wonderful weapon and fits nicely in the design scheme of the aircraft. \n\nLast the B9 parts are not meant to be used with stock aerodynamics. I would suggest getting FAR or NEAR to get the most out of those parts. Because B9 alters the way jet engines work so they work correctly in FAR."},{"CreatedByName":"UTK Aerospace Ind.","CreatedById":133266,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T16:11:42Z","Content":"Thank you for the suggestions! I didn\u0027t want to add any weapons to the base craft, because some people may not want to run BDArmory with the craft. I suppose I could just include it in the download without the option...?
