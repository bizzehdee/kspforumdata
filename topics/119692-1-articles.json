First question is definitely a big yes. Second question is a big no. I\u0027ll explain the 2 big reasons why:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The only way NASA can get something like this done is with the funding and competition that comes with a space race. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. There will be no second space race.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have seen WaitButWhy\u0027s blog on SpaceX you will understand the first point. The space race was never about exploration, or the moon. It was all just about being better than this guy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/6/68/NEWPERFECTAVATAR.jpg/revision/latest/zoom-crop/width/240/height/240?cb=20130512212847\u0022 alt=\u0022240?cb=20130512212847\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout America feeling \u0027threatened\u0027 by another nation surpassing them in their space capabilities, they think have no reason to continue expensive programs, let alone pour even more money into something like a mars mission. And because nobody else has landed on the moon \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E[\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ecitation needed\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E]\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E, the US still thinks they are unrivalled in their space capability, even though they are not.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second point is quite simple to explain: the USSR had better space capabilities at the start of the space race. Today there is no nation that has a higher capability in space than the US did in 1969-1972. Until another nation lands on the moon or beyond, the US will still think of themselves as the most powerful in their space capabilities, hence they will not feel \u0027threatened\u0027 as they did in the 50s and 60s, hence there will be no space race. And Russia has too many things it needs to focus on here on earth, such as a bad economy, to try again. And china is just... slow. It\u0027s super heavy launch vehicle is set to have its maiden flight in 2028, by which point SpaceX will have planted it\u0027s flag on mars ages ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA \u003Cem\u003Emight \u003C/em\u003Eget bragging rights by helping SpaceX, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElon Musk doesn\u0027t even have the 163 billion dollars (today\u0027s) used for the Apollo program.

Like, so primitive that travelling to the moon had only just become possible (\u0027steampunk space program\u0027 fans might disagree with me on that one). There was no reusability, no ISRU, inefficient and expensive fuels were used, the only rocket-building metals were really heavy, and almost all the calculations had to be done manually. It\u0027s no wonder it cost a sixth of a trillion dollars! If China or someone did it today, the cost could easily be halved or thrided. And that\u0027s not even including the studies and reports that full reusability could take off 90% of the cost! You simply can\u0027t compare our situation today with the space cavemen of the 1960s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceX could easily begin to send people to mars. It would be the single most expensive programme in the company\u0027s history, but with full reusability, lightweight materials technology and in-situ fuel producing, it can easily be done. Also remember that SpaceX will be wealthier in the 2020s than it is now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T02:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EISRU still isn\u0027t a thing.

That is not one mission, that is at minimum 5 launch missions, you won\u0027t be able to conceal the expenditure from the crazies in Washington for the 15 years or so it would take to start and complete the mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I see the pictures, but even NASA admits these are not comprehensive, that they cannot safely get a fueled lander on the ground yet. so . . . . . .artist concept. . . .great but.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow is this a response to my post?

FAIL. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow find a way to assess the public benefit. \\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Here are the ways\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -technology funding - lunar mission space in general - how about the magnets in your Wind-farm, Toyota Prius. Better solar panels - Solar farms. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -science produced - Dark matter, dark energy, how the earth moon system came to be, rising sea levels, falling ground water levels, earthquake science, earthquake prediction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E include side product like sea-floor sensors, ENSO detection, . . . . . . . .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -engineering revolution - changes in the way that engineers themselves trained in space industries change the way they think about building things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this you come to the conclusion that \u003Cstrong\u003ENASA has not gotten back the benefit that they have created\u003C/strong\u003E, and then you realize that the Manned Mars Mission benefit is running right now in your Toyota Prius that gets 50 MPG, plugs into a solar charged charging station and is getting gas at 2$ per gallon when the price should be 5$. Doesn\u0027t make sense until you realize that NASA feeds the US economy with wealth, but the US economy only feeds back a tiny fraction of the wealth it helps to create, the Manned Mars Mission is in everyone\u0027s bank account screaming to be reinvested for a hefty payback, not alone, but as a composite of publicly funded science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then you have to assess how is discovery-technology best funded, and the answer is almost always that public investment early is an absolute requirement and private sector branching off of this can happen later, but still the new big 50 year projects need public funding. So has discovery-technology been a success, it has been an overwhelming success. So is the return of investment being returned to science, about 5% of the product of publicly funded science is being returned. Think about the science driven portion of the economy (computers, smart cars, cell phones, plasma TV) and how much are these technologies paying to science as a portion of their sale price. And then you conclude that the reinvestment is not keeping up with the benefit. Every society in the world that has made a push to develop science and technology has prospered many fold more than the amount of funding put into it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you think about WWII you think D-DAY invasion and Hitler in a bunker, but all the while there was another war most everyone in the US is oblivious to. And when you see the pacific war you think Iwojima and marines with knives between their teeth scrambling up the side of mt Surebachi. But there was another war being waged in the US congress by Sen. Harry Trumans war to improve the operational technology; and one of the key areas was submarine technology, and we pushed bad torpedo\u0027s and made them better, we added and double the range of surface radar and added anti air-craft tracking and doubled the operational depth of our submarine fleet, all in two years - because he drove the corruption in the defense sector to face its funders. And in the end the hidden war destroyed more tonnage, unknown number of kills than all other forces in the pacific combined. To top that out, the war ended in a technological bang. A punctuation point that said technology is here, and to the losers who ignore it. After the war everyone understood this and we reached the moon with completely inadequate technologies and through training, will and refinement we made them work; there was essentially no difference between the pacific submarine campaign and the race to the Moon in terms of the general strategy to improve the technology to afford the final goal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then we turned away and we had ideas about taxation, inflation, religious wars, and censorship of technology through a process known as defunding - and here we are. Greed ate your Mars mission money, give it an emetic and maybe it will cough it up, I doubt it. Then take a look at history and ponder, Greeks, Romans, Goths, Spain, British, Americans. Persians, Arabs, Turks, Israel and you realize there is no look-back, no rescue, that drive that creates empires and malaise that destroys them moves on elsewhere, the wealth is almost always wasted in some form of corruption, and to the efficient go the next big revolution. And the funny thing almost all civilizations realize this before it happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E No one doubts the long term benefits of NASA or questions the value of its funding; every single appreciated economist argues that science-technology investments are the best investments outside of the education sector. But the funding is only about Debt is, current taxation and promised tax-relief, future entitlements; and then funding stagnates (falling with regard to inflation). This is not different from any past social collapse, the wise see the problem and the greedy take advantage of the social weakness and corruption overwhelms. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so the corruption is that NASA is not being reinvested with the rewards from the products they have already produced. We live in a world that exist, not a fantasy world were billionaire superheros fund trillion dollar public benefit sectors. This world you live in, they cut military research in many areas almost to zero to fund the Iraq War and the proponents of that war in large part don\u0027t want to pay for it. That is the corruption, see it? Science is a slow methodical process, its not one that takes well to being jerked like ISIS staring at a temple pondering whether it should be blown to bits, it requires respect and stability, room to stretch out and explore minutia that the public lacks all interest in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T19:32:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am having trouble understanding your train of thought here...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yet how is this related in any way to my initial comment?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou seem to be making assumptions about me, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know how science works...

Science is not wow and flutter, when you see wow and flutter in science you are looking the wrong direction, science is minutia of research. To get to the moon in apollo 11 took 10 missions 1 of which was a complete failure. But those failures and methodical process bore the success of the modern space age. And behind Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong where 100s of scientist and engineers never credited for their work. Some are still putting out research. You see hundreds of US satellites around the earth, eh? They do something other than looking to see where Sadam Hussien hid his infamous WMDs. Its not what you think.......... its 100s and 1000s of publications on\u003Cem\u003E trivial topics \u003C/em\u003Ethat accumulate information over decades. JQ public thinks that science moves like a queen across a chess board; nope, science is a bunch of pawns marching one tiny step at a time toward goals, often 1 step back and 2 step forward. This Mars Mission, to work will require the same methodological approach, its not going to be a one off, at least not in total. Its going to require far less risky missions.

Just search on any space or science topic and put satellite and you can pull up dozens of papers on what has been published.

Until another nation lands on the moon or beyond, the US will still think of themselves as the most powerful in their space capabilities, hence they will not feel \u0027threatened\u0027 as they did in the 50s and 60s, hence there will be no space race.

It\u0027s no wonder it cost a sixth of a trillion dollars! If China or someone did it today, the cost could easily be halved or thrided.

Yes private space can take over some of NASAs duties (not limiting the critique ESA has a bigger problem). The problem is that private companies need a return on investment of 3 to 5 years maximum. The return on space investments have been great, but they sometimes take 20 years (examples are GPS system) do develop and capitalize on the research and development required. Do you think google maps comes from a private ability, they essentially usurp from the public domain and sell advertisers to help them display it.

Mars is to me - A station with a lander, 3 to 5 people, 4 year mission, a station built in space, a station refueled in space, maybe several times.
