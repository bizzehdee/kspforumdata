And neither company is allowed to launch until all their milestones are completed (which also includes paying them). As a result, the United states must take twice the amount that Commercial Crew gets shorted, and pay it to Russia for another year\u0027s worth of Soyuz seats, in addition to the cost of NASA\u0027s budget. That\u0027s half a billion tax dollars paid extra for achieving less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, it\u0027s mostly a US-centric issue, but it\u0027s of interest to the space community because we\u0027re watching the development of these new crew vehicles with great interest. Delaying that program means also delaying the increase of crew size on the ISS, which means less space science; it means also delaying the manned Mars ambitions of SpaceX, who are using Commercial Crew as their development springboard; it means having another year of single-point-of-failure in human launch capability outside of China (which NASA is prohibited by law from cooperating with, even though they want to). The ISS is already forced to go into maintenance mode right now with only three people onboard for 1.5 months because Russia is still troubleshooting the Soyuz rocket after the recent loss of a Progress vehicle. We need this redundancy, we need more people on the ISS, and we need (well, want) more cool spacecraft \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also particularly noteworthy because president Obama has basically said \u0022you guys are nuts, I\u0027m not signing this\u0022 when seeing the kind of budget that the congressmen are trying to pass. All bills passed ultimately require the president\u0027s signature to become law, \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E both chambers of congress can indivudally cough up a 2/3rds majority overrule after the fact, which they are not going to get on this hotly disputed issue. So this is a pretty extreme measure that\u0027s rarely ever pulled. It\u0027s also equal to saying \u0022NASA doesn\u0027t get a budget at all\u0022, which is a worrying prospect considering NASA\u0027s budget is still higher than the sum of all other civilian space budgets worldwide, and a lot hinges on it on an international level. Thankfully, those budgets are created well in advance (over a year), so there\u0027s still plenty of time to find a compromise. Provided the presidential veto actually happens, they\u0027re not that far in the process yet.
