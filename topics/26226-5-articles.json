How can they justify/explain the ISS deorbiting? So I\u0027ve been thinking. In the trailers it appears as if only small modules are falling back in. Which brings me to a question. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.. when we deorbit the ISS.. will it come down in one piece? Or will we send people up ( by reviving the shuttle as it appears in the movie ) to deconstruct the ISS and deorbit it a module at a time? The later makes more sense to me. Because if the entire ISS deorbits as is over the ocean.. that\u0027s a big, messy strewn field. And it only takes a tiny chunk of metal to ruin a fishermans day lol. They\u0027d have to cordon off the entire ocean... ( I\u0027m guessing it\u0027d be the Pacific ) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo sending down smaller chunks seems more logical which brings me back to the movie. In Gravity.. what if \u0022STS 157\u0022 is up there doing just that? Taking appart the ISS and deorbiting modules? Then something goes wrong... What I don\u0027t know. This debris field that hits them has to be suddenly created. ( in the deorbit process maybe something goes wrong and there\u0027s a collision ) Because we track all this debris and those astronauts wouldn\u0027t have been caught in it to begin with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the reentry scenes could be modules that already made the burn. ( maybe they gotta fix retropacks to the modules ) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a long shot, but I\u0027d like to think that if this director had the ambition to make a movie like this he would\u0027ve done his homework. Wether itd be my theory there or something else I just hope that this movie isn\u0027t for the brain dead explosion junky.

The script has been written at least 4 years ago, and the director wanted to work with concepts of spaceflight familiar to people. Basically, the whole project shutdown was ignored when it happened. In Gravity\u0027s universe, Space Shuttle is still existing, and nothing I\u0027ve seen looks as if the story is positioned in future or past time. It\u0027s about today or near future, perhaps few years in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISS as it appears in the trailers is in trouble. Soyuz is docked to it and its parachute is out. That\u0027s certainly a huge problem. ISS solar panels look awful. Whether all this is because of the debris, I don\u0027t know, but it looks as if ISS has been abandoned and Tiangong is the main used station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think anyone will deconstruct ISS.

People responsible for this movie respected the Newton\u0027s laws and a significant portion of the movie is based on the characters\u0027 struggle to move around. It\u0027s not boring at all and it really lets you care for them because it\u0027s often brutal. People are getting hurt and by all means, PG-13 is a justified mark. Don\u0027t bring kids to the cinema. There are gore elements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3D is, as I\u0027ve said, of extreme quality. Nothing is forced as in that hyped Avatar. There is no ghosting, and sometimes you think the debris is going to hit you in the face. That, plus few instances of tools floating around, are the most intense 3D moments and that\u0027s the way it should be. 3D is a tool, not a purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could compare the suspense with the graph of global warming. It goes up and down, up and down, but overall, it\u0027s going up. The characters are constantly in a struggle for survival with certain pauses, but it only gets worse. Most people would cry in despair if they can\u0027t get home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe acting is really amazing and I think Bullock should get an Oscar for this. She managed to take a character from the script and turn it into a real, simple woman who is just loosing it as she gradually goes to a kind of psychosis because of the huge stress involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClooney was too Hollywood, but maybe it\u0027s because his persona is stuck with such image IRL. I\u0027m not sure if this was his intention, but I\u0027d say he really could\u0027ve done this with less \u0022cool\u0022. The situation the characters are in is grave danger. It\u0027s death coming through the door, and he\u0027s all super rational and shows no fear even after his \u0022jetpack\u0022 is empty. That is not what would happen with real people, but ok, it\u0027s not a big deal. Sometimes his behaviour is like a slight comic relief which adds a new hill in the whole rollercoaster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that was really impossible are all the stars in the sky. Even when the Sun is in view (and it\u0027s a bit yellow, which is not the actual case because it\u0027s white), you can see lots of stars. I think Cuar\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B3n wanted to leave the stars in order to give the audience a sense of motion. We can\u0027t experience tumbling, so if we see only black sky, it\u0027s not a big deal. With stars, it can give you a sense of disorientation, just like dr. Stone experiences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sounds are almost entirely physically accurate. No bull**** from the trailers. Honestly, you don\u0027t hear anything but them talking, and occasional dull thump, which is sound transmitted through the suit when they impact the station. This alone lifts Gravity towards the peak where Odyssey 2001 is at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and the music. You hear the soundtrack which purpose is to freak you out. So there is lots of silence, but also lots of loud and powerful sound to kick your ears in the nuts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe enormous hate towards Bullock in youtube comments is completely unjustified. The whole movie is not \u0022her screaming and gasping\u0022. Her character is not well developed as in usual Hollywood movies only because there are not much opportunities for that to happen, but when they occur, we see that she is a very sad person.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, the movie is a metaphor for her transformation. It\u0027s simply a masterpiece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must say that the script is highly exaggerated in the terms of the actual danger in orbit. Kessler syndrome is blow out of every proportion because it happens in a very short time, and its efficiency is absolutely fantastic. In reality, it would take a considerable amount of time before one orbit is ruined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf by any means you have access to IMAX 3D and enough money, go. This movie will enter history and try to make yourself a part of it. I\u0027ve spent quite a bit of money to to this, and I don\u0027t regret it at all.

The movie might be better in the realistic sense with your proposition, but remember that this is a movie. It\u0027s about art, too. There simply has to be a buildup and catharsis in some way (good or bad), and indeed, there is a huge catharsis, purification of the main character (still not spoiling, lol). Cuar\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B3n respected the art part as well as almost every bit of reality. He is truly an artist and I just hope he\u0027ll get a bunch of Oscars for this.
