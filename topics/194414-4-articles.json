Everything else is secondary to them, even if they pretend that it is not.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is the people within a corporation that have empathy, morals and a sense of ethics, just like most other human beings, but like everyone else, the further you are distanced from the immediate impacts of your actions, the less empathy you feel for those your actions affect. This means that, usually, smaller business that only operate on a local area have\u00A0much higher (relative) empathy and ethical standards than larger corporations, mostly because those who are in charge of them can feel the impact of their decisions (both inside and outside the company) more directly.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a large corporation like TTI that operates on a multidisciplinary international range, that has thousands of employees and is directed by a small number of executives and shareholders, empathy and ethics are little more than an afterthought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2013Those who call the shots (Shareholders, CEOS and top executives) are focused on their personal lives and families, not in the millions of persons their actions affect (they can not sense what they feel, after all). For them, ordering a hostile takeover or green-lighting the reduction of a\u00A05% of their workforce means that they will be able to enjoy an extra day or two with their families and/or loved ones in their favorite resort the next summer, or that they will finally will be able to buy the car they have been eyeing for some years. They don\u0027t think about the hundreds of lives their actions have ruined, simply because they can not feel them. Does that make them evil?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2013And those who work for a large company? They also worry about themselves and their close ones first, and then everyone else. They will do all they can do to keep their job and, if possible, get a better one,\u00A0even if they have to jump ship to another company in expense\u00A0of those who they worked with before. Are they evil for doing that, specially in times like this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2013And where does the consumer fall in all of this? Is the consumer unethical for purchasing a product that has been, in some way, made on an unethical manner? Perhaps, but they are no more unethical than any other human trying to live in contemporary society.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis same pattern applies to every human discipline, not just businesses, and the unfortunate truth is that it is a problem that can not be solved by boycotting, nor with policing (another enormous can of worms), but trough culture, art,\u00A0self education and the encouragement of empathy, critical thinking and responsibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPurchase KSP2 when it comes out if you wish, or don\u0027t if you want to. That wont change much, but it may give you some peace of mind. Just remember that basically almost every product or service\u00A0you buy for your daily needs has also been created, to a smaller or larger degree, on an unethical way and for this problem to go away society has to evolve trough cultural and ethical emergence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-05T13:21:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223797653\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194414\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591360816\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002291917\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n28 minutes ago, KerikBalm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E normally applies to employees, so I don\u0027t expect Nate in the \u0022Hi Everyone\u0022 thread to be able to give details.

In theory contracts exist to provide justice to the participants and Star Theory breaching is\u00A0unfair on Private Division who invested an unknown large amount of money in the game which Star Theory took saying they would make\u00A0the\u00A0game and then came back saying they ran out of money and hadn\u0027t made it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey discussed royalties and a buy out, apparently looking for ways to fund Star Theory some more to\u00A0complete the job. The talks broke down and reading between the lines I am of the opinion this was because Star Theory wanted more than Private Division were offering. As for ethics, if the Star Theory owners had given top priority to their employees\u0027 wellbeing and the game and their moral obligation to do their best for both and fulfill the\u00A0contract as best they could, they would have sold the studio for a dollar and hoped for some consultation/admin work during the handover .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMHO it sounds like Berry and Mavor\u00A0wanted more but were they justified? Star Theory did not invent KSP, it was dropped in their lap, though they did find KSP enthusiasts to do the work, who are the\u00A0bone of contention.\u00A0\u00A0In the employment business finding the right people is worth money commensurate with the task of finding them and their salaries. For example head hunting and also temping agencies have stringent contracts which prevent temps being poached without a payout to the agency. So for this reason common sense justice would allow that Private Division did owe Berry and Mavor something for the studio because it was full of the right people and that didnt happen by chance but I doubt it balances the sums involved in hiring the studio\u00A0in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like\u00A0Private Division had decided they would not reward failure and TBH I can see their point because there are examples of developers who waste huge amounts of money with little to show for it like Chris Roberts and Star Citizen. The point being it is too easy, even for experienced developers, to waste money in game\u00A0development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTTI are a big company with a lot of affiliated developers via Private Division. If \u0022indy\u0022 devs breaking contracts start to get more money not less, then you can imagine what Private Division imagine will happen, more\u00A0developers will ask for more money beyond their contract terms. This suggests that the decision by Private Division to axe Star Theory was probably not just about the one game\u00A0but about Private Division\u0027s entire portfolio and keeping\u00A0fiscal discipline. IMHO that is understandable in the uncertain circumstances of the pandemic related recession and one wonders whether panic was a factor in these stressful times. While games production is likely to make more money not less during lockdown the question is what happens next in the wider economy. Its not the time for Private Division\u00A0to be blowing wads of money on profligate producers. So it looks like they need to have rules and I can understand why they said no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you say its not OK to rehire the KSP2 devs, it is effectively saying its OK for\u00A0Star theory owners\u00A0to gamble their employees job security to get a bigger slice of pie and use the game they were trusted with as leverage to do that, again using their employees as leverage because they are the best people to do the job right now. At this point I dont know which side, if any, was taking it too far, it depends on the sums involved and the conditions attached in the negotiations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven they had just been in talks about how Star Theory was running on fumes Private Division\u00A0could predict the subsequent dissolution of Star Theory reliably. It may seem like indecent haste but it\u00A0made\u00A0sense for the sake of rescuing KSP2 ASAP to contact the key people who were enthusiastic for KSP2 to let them know they could keep working on it before they found jobs somewhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeither side come out of this looking good. It is our misfortune that the studio Private Division hired to make the game did not get their\u00A0ducks in a row but its not reasonable to blame and stigmatise Private Division when it was Star Theory\u0027s mistake.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEthical decision making is full of fine lines. For example IMHO it was ethical to remove a statue of a slave trader during the BLM protests in Bristol UK. Its illegal, but IMHO it is ethical, the perps will have to face the law but they knew that when they did it and they are heroes in my eyes because they did not hurt anyone else or do it to cause criminal damage spitefully or loot from retail businesses or private premises greedily, they did it to right a wrong. Likewise I dont see offering the KSP2 devs jobs as entirely wrong, it was motivated by a desire to get the game back in production and mitigate a disciplinary necessity in deciding against funding Star Theory some more. It was not an act of theft against Star Theory, it was a necessity because Star Theory messed up and Private Division were trying to prevent Star Theory leeching money from Private Division to cover their own mistake.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot knowing the \u00A0details, in my book the only thing Private Division are guilty of is being decisive and quick off the mark and they are paying a price for it on the PR front because people are transferring past grievances against Electronic Arts on to them without justification. Its a murky business but while I admit I dont know the whole story and vital details, on the whole I am glad they did it and if the key KSP2 devs are backing Private Division, I trust their judgement and wish them luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-14T13:17:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2020 01:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TackleMcClean","CreatedById":192825,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-14T16:10:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently I plan to buy the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what we\u0027ve seen so far I would definitely not boycott the game, especially out of respect for the developers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll these worry-posts without solid ground only serve to derail the developers, and I sincerely hope they find the peace and quiet they need to focus on their jobs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"harrisjosh2711","CreatedById":177745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-15T02:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223798284\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194414\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591451370\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197502\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Selective Genius\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/6/2020 at 9:49 AM, Selective Genius said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EYOU CAN NOT AFFORD TO BE VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU ARE POWERLESS\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust write this down and follow it, and life will not smack you in the face too hard when you walk into the bad world out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHence, why you will forever be powerless.

A deer calmly grazing grass, not hurting anyone, but minding it\u0027s own business, or a tiger ripping apart deer families by killing them for food, leaving nothing but bones behind?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe King replied, \u0022It is the Tiger.

Of course we will get the license to pat ourself on our back for a while, but that\u0027s all the change we can manage. TTI will still sell a bazillion copies of KSP2(if it\u0027s good), it will still gain a massive profit, regardless of the opinions of a few hundred people. And all we will be left with, would be the absence of a good game on our PC, and who knows, maybe a large portion of us petitioners will be swayed by the wonderful \u0027Let\u0027s play\u0027 videos, and end up buying KSP2 anyway\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EYOU CAN NOT AFFORD TO BE VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU ARE POWERLESS\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust write this down and follow it, and life will not smack you in the face too hard when you walk into the bad world out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis analogy and reasoning, IMO, are terrible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, I would say neither are virtuous.
