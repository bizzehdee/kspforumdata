The first load might have a few errors, but then it will save, leaving out the extra contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T18:24:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E0.53a has been released on KerbalStuff. Here\u0027s the changes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod already verified entries of the save game and initialized them to default values if they were missing or invalid, which would happen any time the save game was manually modified by a player or a program, or after a patch that added new things. This would prevent crashing, but not weird little glitches, which would occur until the game naturally generated new missions, or until you refreshed the board manually. Now, whenever the mod detects one of these, it will automatically refresh the board for you. This means that any active contracts will be cleared sometimes after a patch, but it also means that you will not be experiencing these glitches. \u003Cstrong\u003EPlease complete any active contracts that you care about before patching.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded new logic to control when contracts are handed out on the board. Asteroid Retrieval, Station Building, and Base Building can now only have two contracts out at any given time, and you will not receive duplicate missions to build or retrieve the same things in the same locations, to prevent contract stacking. Aerial and Rover missions can have four active and two on the board. New contract types are coming soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EState tracking has been vastly improved across the board. You should no longer have missions randomly completing on their own. This makes station and asteroid missions much more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsteroid contracts were overhauled. The tracking on \u0022new\u0022 asteroids is now much more solid, you will be asked to retrieve a specific classification of asteroid, and you will receive feedback messages every time you claw an asteroid to let you know what the agency thinks about your choice of asteroid. The classification request also applies to the rare station side objective, so you may be asked to build your station into a Class E for that Death Star look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tracking station now shows waypoints for all current contracts, including ones you have not accepted. This gives you an opportunity to check out where a contract is going to take you before accepting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaypoints were not evenly distributed over the surface of a planet, due to the geometry of a sphere, there is much less distance per latitude near the poles than there is at the equator, causing the generator to put more waypoints on the poles than intended. This has been fixed, and waypoints now spawn uniformly over the planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoved default values of infinity from any variables, as it was rarely causing terrible things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed a typo that resulted in aerial missions only spawning above land on planets with water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETightened up higher difficulty aerial waypoint ranges slightly. Rewards remain the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Navigation activated\u0022 and \u0022navigation deactivated\u0022 messages were reversed, causing some confusion as to what was happening with navigation waypoints. This has been alleviated, and our previous navigations engineer was tied to a Class D asteroid and thrown at the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERover waypoint ranges can now be reduced (or increased) by the gravity of the target planet. The ranges from last patch apply to Kerbin, and can go as low as half of what they are now depending on how low the gravity gets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsteroid Retrieval rewards were increased by a significant amount. Station and Base rewards were increased slightly, and made more malleable by their side objectives, meaning having to integrate a research lab will boost science gains, integrating a cupola will boost reputation gains, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to thank everyone that has been giving me feedback and reports. It\u0027s really helping build this into a decent mod. I will continue to listen and implement as many of your thoughts as I can, so keep on submitting them to my thread. Perhaps we can drop the \u0022a\u0022 off the version soon!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr_Marx","CreatedById":110084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T18:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mod looks very interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a question, does this mod adds contracts to put a satallite into orbit?
