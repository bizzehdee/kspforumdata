Even in the full game right now, there\u0027s only the sandbox mode and there is no cost for anything. Even when the campaign is added, though, sandbox mode will still be an option. However, the full game has MANY more parts and destinations to play with, so it\u0027s definitely worth the money.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vespasianus","CreatedById":26881,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T19:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!
