I currently have 3GB of RAM on my laptop, but am thinking of upgrading this to 8GB. Does RAM make a noticeable difference to KSP performance, such as loading times, or is it more CPU based?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I_Killed_Jeb","CreatedById":84817,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T01:23:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the main bottleneck is CPU. KSP is unfortunately a pretty poorly optimized program, and 32-bit at that, so the additional RAM is unlikely to boost performance in any significance except by increasing bandwidth if you aren\u0027t already in dual-channel mode.
