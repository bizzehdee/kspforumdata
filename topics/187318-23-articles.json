I guess in terms of what could make me into a regular player again, the number one thing would be some kind of career narrative that goes well beyond just unlocking parts by earning generic science and money, and actually\u00A0involves exploration\u00A0of\u00A0the Kerbalverse to find things that advance the game.\u00A0 The end goal should be something like setting up a base in another star system, using tech that can only be acquired both through completing the regular tree and satisfying some kind of exploration-based in-game quest, preferably one that either comes in multiple random versions or has multiple paths to fulfillment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlongside that, the dreary, boring, endlessly repetitive existing system of contracts needs to be strapped into the dustbin of history, mounted on a stack of boosters, and launched into the Sun.\u00A0 I\u0027m not exactly sure what I would want to replace it with, but for me that\u0027s the part of the game that has just never worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n....(after thinking about it a while) I guess one currency scheme that would work better for me would be to have all the money come from some kind of simulated Kerbin government appropriations process, that awards a base discretionary\u00A0budget every\u00A0game year, based on prestige \u002B/- some random factor.\u00A0 Milestones up to some maximum number at once can be selected a la carte from a comprehensive mission tree, and must be executed successfully before they can be cleared from the slate. Rather than money per se, completion will provide prestige to boost base appropriations and also science that is in one of several categories (e.g. comms, exploration, navigation, EVA, booster tech, etc.) based on what was done, each of which can be applied to only one of several separate tech trees. Developing a specific part within each tech tree will require a specific amount of the right type of science, as well as a development contract that the player awards to one of Kerbin\u0027s colorfully named aerospace companies, each of which houses one specific tech tree of related parts. This would allow a far greater degree of flexibility in terms of how a player might choose to develop their program. To make it more interesting, in addition to the base funding, players can request special appropriations, which are awarded at some probability based on cost/difficulty vs. player prestige, prior related achievements, and perhaps even patronage points due to investments in specific companies. Failure to win the appropriation would incur a penalty in both prestige and base budget, limiting the number of times the dice can be rolled. Lastly, on top of all this there will be Easter eggs all over the planets, randomly redistributed at game launch, each of which provides some kind of reward if scanned in the right way or even recovered. Some of these Easter eggs will not only do that, but will unlock a tree of clues that ultimately leads to the quest-restricted alien/future tech, which will be required to build an interstellar ship. As I said at the top, there should either be multiple quest or multiple paths to quest fulfillment, each of which requires leveraging a different type of program development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr something like that!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-10T01:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223702716\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187318\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221573335515\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022112590\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022herbal space program\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, herbal space program said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I guess in terms of what could make me into a regular player again, the number one thing would be some kind of career narrative that goes well beyond just unlocking parts by earning generic science and money, and actually\u00A0involves exploration\u00A0of\u00A0the Kerbalverse to find things that advance the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you mean that when you land on the Mun, you have Gene screaming in a popup window about how this was supposed to fail, then I am totally for it.

I was certainly not suggesting that a moment should come in the game where Gene pops up and tells you that\u0027s what you have to do right now. What I was suggesting is that to complete the overarching goal of career mode, there are going to be places you have to visit and things you have to find on\u00A0many of the bodies in the Kerbolar system, although perhaps not the same ones in every iteration of the game.\u00A0 These discoveries will unlock things you\u0027ll need to progress to key future techs for interstellar travel, but they won\u0027t stand in the way of getting any standard techs or getting new standard missions. As far as constraining people to do things in some kind of order, I think the way the current mission tree does it, i.e. not offering you the harder missions until you have completed some of the easier ones and have\u00A0 the required techs, is not so bad. I would just take the randomness out of it by letting you see the whole tree and select any available\u00A0 mission\u00A0from it that is associated with an unlocked node. Unlocking a particular node however will require that you complete certain missions first, like putting a Kerbal into orbit before you can access an orbital rendezvous mission, or landing one on the Mun/Minmus before you get offered any\u00A0 Kerballed landing missions on other bodies. I guess that\u0027s somewhat constraining, but it also stands to reason.

I was certainly not suggesting that a moment should come in the game where Gene pops up and tells you that\u0027s what you have to do right now. What I was suggesting is that to complete the overarching goal of career mode, there are going to be places you have to visit and things you have to find on\u00A0many of the bodies in the Kerbolar system, although perhaps not the same ones in every iteration of the game.\u00A0 These discoveries will unlock things you\u0027ll need to progress to key future techs for interstellar travel, but they won\u0027t stand in the way of getting any standard techs or getting new standard missions. As far as constraining people to do things in some kind of order, I think the way the current mission tree does it, i.e. not offering you the harder missions until you have completed some of the easier ones and have\u00A0 the required techs, is not so bad. I would just take the randomness out of it by letting you see the whole tree and select any available\u00A0 mission\u00A0from it that is associated with an unlocked node. Unlocking a particular node however will require that you complete certain missions first, like putting a Kerbal into orbit before you can access an orbital rendezvous mission, or landing one on the Mun/Minmus before you get offered any\u00A0 Kerballed landing missions on other bodies. I guess that\u0027s somewhat constraining, but it also stands to reason. Anyway, the main thing I was getting at is the I want to have a \u003Cem\u003Ereason \u003C/em\u003Efor going all these different places, preferably one that involves finding something cool/rewarding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been saying put certain resources on planets that are hard to get to essentially acting as gatekeepers to tech.
