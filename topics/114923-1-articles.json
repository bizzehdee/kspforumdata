The latter did not come true, except KSP does not randomize the the order of the joysticks at each start as it did in Windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X and two Thrustmaster T.16000M connected. The Hotas works as expected, the problem is with the two T.16000M; KSP is not able to tell their axes apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInput-setup reacts to both T.16000M\u0027s axes when in assign mode. But the game itself reacts only to the axes of one of the two T.16000M. This is true for both Windows-32bit and Linux-64bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Windows version there was one additional issue with the joystick-buttons where the input-setup seemed to be able to diffrentiate the buttons on the two identical joysticks, but in-game a function mapped to button1 of the first T.16000M would also trigger when pressing button1 of the second T.16000M. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while I\u0027m at it; TrackIR and 6dof can control the camera in the Space Center scene, joysticks can not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd joysticks axis assignment are limited to camera pitch/jaw; technically not a bug but I had to mention it as relevant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T06:00:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 06:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HagbardCeline\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T15:02:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like the 2 T.16000M\u0027s might have the same ID in their USB-protocol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I remember correctly, according to the USB-standard, USB-pheripherals should present unique ID\u0027s even when they are of the same model, in order for them to be told apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes Windows see 2 separate joysticks?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T15:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a known issue.

I have a thrustmaster warthog HOTAS. JoyID shows that the two devices have different names.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought I\u0027d try setting up the controls for KSP 1.04 without autohotkey to see if it would work. Prior to now I have always used autohotkey to fix KSP\u0027s joystick recognition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn this occasion the controls appear to be registered correctly in the input setup. Buttons on the stick, for example, register as \u0022Joystick1ButtonX\u0022, whereas on the throttle it lists them as \u0022Joystick2ButtonX\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it doesn\u0027t work in game. Some joystick buttons are doing things I have mapped to the throttle, others just don\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems unity just sucks for anything other than keyboard and mouse. Although a while back I believe there was a mod that fixed everything for KSP, not sure if it\u0027s up to date. In any case, maybe it\u0027s not a unity problem after all.

There are lots to choose from, ppjoy, vjoy, autohotkey, glovePIE/freePIE, etc. I\u0027ve generally found autohotkey to be the most reliable since everything gets turned into keyboard input, and just about everything works correctly with keyboard input, plus you can write the code yourself so it\u0027s very powerful. For this reason I haven\u0027t checked whether ppjoy/vjoy etc work with KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I can add, which might be useful, is that switching the ID\u0027s of the devices using JoyID does not change the behaviour when launched in KSP.
