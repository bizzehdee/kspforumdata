That might be a tougher challenge than actually terraforming Mars, but it MIGHT be realizable with space-based manufacturing (especially if a lot of AI and robotics and asteroid mining are involved).

The child-rearing desire is almost certainly at least slightly inheritable. How quickly evolution will win out over birth control will depend on how inheritable this desire is, and how strong the selection pressure towards this trait is. Since humans first became smart enough to time their sexual activities to avoid having children, perform abortions, and create birth control devices, there has been a selection pressure towards the desire to have children just for the sake of having children. Maybe that\u0027s even a part of what caused monogamy (a VERY rare trait in mammals) to evolve in humans (it doesn\u0027t look like monogamy evolved ALL the way though, and how much of our monogamy is mandated by genetics and how much is mandated by social pressures is debatable). Maybe it\u0027s part of what helped the perception of \u0022cuteness\u0022 to evolve (though, you have to wonder then why humans often find animals cuter than babies and children). Today though, the selection pressure for child-rearing desire is becoming even stronger, with modern birth control and the specifics of today\u0027s societies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, even if the desire to have children is fairly strongly inheritable, you would expect a decline in birth rates after a sudden decrease in the overall desire to have children or increase in the effectiveness of birth control. Evolution toward a strong child-rearing desire cannot be INSTANT; those persons who have very strong child-rearing desires only make up a fraction of the overall population. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, besides potential evolution towards an increased child-rearing desire, your worry about whether or not we\u0027d eventually go extinct misses some other key points that makes it, to me, something silly to worry about-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Much of the reason we don\u0027t want to have as many children anymore is because of overpopulation- if the population starts decreasing a lot, then people will want to have more kids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) People are smart enough to worry about whether the human race will go extinct if they don\u0027t have enough kids. People are likely to view having kids as their \u0022duty\u0022 if the population were to drop to a low enough level. The government(s) could even mandate that everyone has at least a certain number of children.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s really not something I think anyone should be worried about. Right now, fewer kids is probably a good thing, though, I worry about potential economic impacts down the road when you have a lot of retirees and old and decrepit people, and fewer young people to take care of them. (Our medical technology needs to be able to HEAL old people and return them to some level of self-sufficiency, not just keep them alive to be a drain on our resources.) This is a BIG problem that China is beginning to face, because of its one-child policy (retiring \u0022Baby-Boomers\u0022 are putting a much less extreme, but similar pressure on us here in the US). How China is able to deal with this problem will be extremely interesting to observe over the coming decades, as it looks increasingly likely the entire world may have to eventually, one day, enact population controls (granted though, increases in farming technology, energy efficiency, and \u0022green\u0022 or renewable energy sources could delay these problems for quite some time). But if population controls do become necessary, China is a sort of a test bed for the rest of us.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-19T18:10:32Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2013 06:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aladran","CreatedById":2055,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T18:08:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOur democracy, if you don\u0027t want it, you are either a communist or a terrorist, therefore you are going to be assimilated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResistance is futile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikewalker11","CreatedById":17280,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T20:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egolden syrup?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfinityArch","CreatedById":66832,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T23:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely nothing, and honestly, any \u0022contact\u0022 with interstellar civilizations would probably consist of them picking up radio waves from a nearby star system, and sending a relativistic kill vehicle our way to wipe us out.

We do this to protect the weak from domination by the strong. Yet it was these very inequalities between men that used to be one of the main driving forces behind human evolution. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s controversial, but some scientists believe that humans have stopped evolving, or even, have begun to devolve. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a known fact that in modern western civilization, smarter individuals on average have fewer children than less intelligent persons.

While a glance at news headlines that are usually dominated by infantile, banal stuff like Hollywood celebrities will strongly suggest this is the case, any de-evolution, if it has in fact occurred already, would probably not yet be big enough to have noticeable effects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut our civilization is certainly a rebellion against Darwin. We do not want to live under the laws of nature. We do not want our men raping every woman they can find and overpower so as to best spread their genes.

We want to give everyone an equal chance, and even in failure, guarantee that those people continue to at least LIVE. We humans are telling Darwin to take a hike, and are imposing our compassion, empathy, and love in his place. Some minor deleterious effects aside (such as potentially, a slow de-evolution of the species, and the curtailing of certain freedoms by society and governments), it is a VAST improvement to the natural order, at least for the everyday life of individual humans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this doesn\u0027t say nearly as much as alien civilizations; they are alien, after all, and it\u0027s hard enough predicting where our OWN civilization is going.

It\u0027s not really logical that the most violent societies would reach an advanced tech level. Conflict does drive innovation, but too much conflict stifles it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s arguable that an advanced alien society would be (like us) apex predators, since prey species on Earth don\u0027t seem to select for intelligence, while predators do. So it\u0027s reasonable to assume that an alien civilisation would be capable of great violence, but also reasonable to assume that it wouldn\u0027t be their default response. We are, after all, absolutely no threat to anybody that remote from us. I\u0027m sceptical that interstellar space flight at relativistic speeds is practical with any tech we can develop in the foreseeable future, which should keep us safe for a good long while.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dudefinal","CreatedById":150168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T04:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think interstellar beings would have probably far transcended biological comprehension replacing themselves with superintelligent robots.
