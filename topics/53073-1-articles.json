Unfortunately, my orbit is inclined by about 85\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E, with a periapse of 450 km and an apoapse of 19,531 km. I am almost out of fuel on the main LV-N drive stage, so I will have to do most of my burns with a 48-7s with 360 fuel, and 6 ion engines with about 10,000 units of xenon. The basic craft is a 1 man lander can with a bunch of engines, Gigantor panels and science equipment strapped on. What would be the most fuel efficient burn to get into an orbit from which to tour the Joolian moons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ravener","CreatedById":44766,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T07:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse the little fuel you have to re enter and land that sucker, Rename the ship and make it the first manned comunications satellite around jool Or send a rescue craft and save him, the choice is yours.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neutron95","CreatedById":85697,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T07:58:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am pretty sure that with the Ion engines at least, I could return. Right now I am thinking of first burning to place my apoapse and periapse in the plane, and then performing a series of burns until I can aerocapture at Laythe and get a halfway decent orbit. Would it be a good idea to transfer fuel for the 48-7s into the transfer stage for the LV-N\u0027s, or to finish off the stage and ditch the extra weight?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T08:29:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should post a picture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T09:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022neutron95\u0022 data-cite=\u0022neutron95\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI apologize for the lack of screenshots, I am on a Mac and have yet to figure out all of the key bindings.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Controls\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Controls\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miro","CreatedById":58492,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T09:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could try to get an intercept with a moon.

That\u0027s a lot of velocity to try to \u0022steer\u0022 onto a new plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up just playing with maneuver nodes at apoapsis and burning directly for a moon intercept. The intersepts will mess with your course; so you may have to correct it in order to stay out of jool\u0027s atmosphere. If you play with it a bit you could direct your intercepts to helf fix your inclination. Once you\u0027re in the plane it is surprisingly easy to use maneuver nodes to get encounters with the moons in your plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can hit laythe you could use it for aerobrake to orbit and/or land as a future target for a \u0022rescue\u0022 mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope it helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, while doing \u0022fly-by\u0022s of the moons try to get a low periapsis. Low orbit counts as a seperate biome for maximum science. Low periapsis also increases the pull the moon exerts on your trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-15T01:01:55Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2013 01:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Alistone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
