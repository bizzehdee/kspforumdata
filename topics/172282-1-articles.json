What troubles me is the fact,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat the craft explodes pretty late,\u00A0after the reentry heat effects and ablator usage is down again. At this state most of the velocity reduction is already done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI end up thinking it was a succesfull re-entry and the suddenly the craft explodes. Sometimes for heating and sometimes because of g-forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne time it happened\u00A0at 12 kms altitude and 140 m/s velocity (I was just waiting for the parachute to open). The log said MK1 exploded because of g-forces, but how can that happen if the craft is traveling at 140m/s?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually agressive re-entrys with\u00A0EP\u0027s of around 35-45 km seem to work better than softer ones around 70 km. Although\u00A0I experience very high g-forces here\u00A0(around 13g\u0027s), the craft doesn\u0027t explode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the craft itself is quite simple (just an MK1 pod with an MK16 parachute on top) I don\u0027t think the problems is a wrong design. MK1 description sais it has an integrated LEO-heatshield, and I activated \u0022descent mode\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this some kind of a bug or am I missing something essential here?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(For my general understanding: reentering at lower EPs\u00A0(and therefore steeper angles) will increases g-loads and maximum heating. Reentering at higher EPs (and therefore shallower\u00A0angles) will reduce maximum temperatures and g-loads by extending the atmospheric breaking and bleeding off the orbital velocity slower.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
