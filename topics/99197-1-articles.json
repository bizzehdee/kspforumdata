In particular, I wonder if there could be a (or many?) repeatable research subject that would give a boost to a stat of a part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: You research \u0022Upgrade Part\u0022 for, lets say 2000 pts and then you can choose an engine, select a stat ... specific impulse for example, and the chosen engine receives a boost of 1% ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, not only for engines, preferably every aspect of all parts. Compression of Fuels in tanks, so they can hold more fuel, effectiveness of solar cell panels, RTG efficiency, Popcorn added to command pods, science lab point boost, antenna packet size, lower energy consumption...you get the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"C1maCat","CreatedById":121247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T18:41:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would love a mod like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
