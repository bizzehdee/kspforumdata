Any developer has to balance the difficulty in their game. Any parts, income, control schemes, etc. available to the player have to be counter-balanced with problems to solve that are\u00A0sufficiently challenging for a player with those tools. Ergo, any time you introduce an outside advantage\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eto a player, perhaps through mods, you unbalance\u00A0the game in some way. However, the point of a game is to have fun, and the game won\u0027t be fun if it is either too hard or too easy, and\u00A0modding is kind of like setting a personal difficulty level to maximize fun. I wouldn\u0027t say clicking \u0022easy\u0022 on career mode means you\u0027re cheating... just that you\u0027re playing career on \u0022easy\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome say that it is not possible to cheat in a single-player game.

I wouldn\u0027t say someone who completed an Eve surface-sample return mission in KSP vanilla had to face the same design challenges that a person with a modded 1000 Isp (atm) engine faced, for example.
