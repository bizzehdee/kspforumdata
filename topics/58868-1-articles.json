Here is what I did for anyone else with a similar problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I launched into orbit, and circularised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I set my target as one of the two ships I wanted to rendezvous with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. At the descending node I burned normal to match the orbital inclination. I also burned prograde at this point to intersect the paths. I couldn\u0027t do it any later because I would have missed my time sensitive window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. At the intersect point I burned Radial-in to match my course. I did this instead of burning prograde as I needed to be travelling slower than the ships behind me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. As the ships approached me I burned to match speed as close as possible, at the nearest point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. At this point it was a normal rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. I switched to the other ship and EVA\u0027d the crew member over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. I did the same as 5-7 to get my other crew member.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. I then burned retrograde until I would be caught by kerbin, I then continued burning retrograde until my periapsis would be at 30km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter accomplishing that final burn I still had about 20% fuel remaining in my big orange \u0022service module\u0022.
