All i can say, is that for teh carbo bay, make sure there is nothing clipping between the vessel yopu are launching, and the mothership. Once the game detaches the 2 craft, if theres any clipping, itll send the entire thing into oblivion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T23:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the problems originates from the docking port being connected to the cargo bay\u0027s node instead of the fuel tanks (or the other way around, idk).
