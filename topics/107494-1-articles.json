Low Mun orbit.\n\nThe parameters cannot be met, and any attemp does not qualify. I went ahead and gave myself the credit in debug but the mission won\u0027t go away. \n\nCannot delete it in debug, either by trying to \u0022complete\u0022 or \u0022cancel\u0022\n\nIf you cancel it in the mission building, it comes back on reboot.\n\nSuggestions?\n\nIf you need info, let me know.\n\n----\n\nOh by the way. I don\u0027t remember what it did the first time I cancelled in the building, but when I cancel, it does not penalize me.\n\nAdditionally, it permanently takes a contract spot out of the allotment. I can only have 7 right now. When I click cancel, it goes away, but it still says I have 7 when there are visibly only 6 contracts.\n\n---\n\nI think I removed it successfully from the persistent file.\n\nJust heads up.
