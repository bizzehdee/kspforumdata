This overheating problem with sounding rockets is actually a useful lesson for later, orbital launches - each altitude has a certain speed above which you burn up. The acceptable speed rises with altitude. Therefore the higher your acceleration, the faster you want you altitude to rise and consequently the more vertical you want to fly to avoid burning up. \u003Cstrong\u003EBut\u003C/strong\u003E in orbital launches generally the flatter your trajectory (the sooner and sharper the gravity turn), the better it is in terms of efficiency. So in practice, especially in the case of early satellite launches where you have little margin of error, you basically want to fly as flat a trajectory as you can afford to without overheating. You also want to design your launchers in such a way that you avoid reaching too high acceleration rates (max stage TWR in Mechjeb readings equals peak acceleration in G\u0027s). There are also other reasons for this, such as crew safety and ease of control (flying a rocket with a peak TWR of \u0026gt;10 feels like a rodeo).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the data recorder issue, that\u0027s a bummer. I think this is related to the .24 compability problem people were reporting on previous pages, try reading them, they might contain the answer/fix. I personally wouldn\u0027t know, since I\u0027m still using my 23.5 installation for RSS/RO (given how many separate mods it takes to synchronize to make this work, I\u0027ve learned to appreciate it when it works stablishly and developed a \u0022if it ain\u0027t broken, don\u0027t fix it\u0022 attitude to my RSS/RO installations).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rohanguard1","CreatedById":118303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T01:11:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould someone put karbonite in the tech tree?
