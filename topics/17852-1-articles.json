I was figuring you\u0027d start with basic parts and simple goals mirroring the RL space programme; launch unmanned rocket into space, launch a satellite into a stable orbit, launch a kerbal into space, launch a kerbal into orbit, launch two kerbals at once, make a spacecraft rendezvous, land on the mun, mun sample return, etc etc etc. Get lots of money for passing these \u0022main quest objectives\u0022, and more normal amounts of money for randomly generated side quests (deliver this comms satellite to this orbit, perform this experiment [read: launch cargo, have kerbal interact with it by a minigame] in space). Allocate scientists and funds to research projects, build new launch sites and recovery sites (save money by reusing parts, the more you use a part the less reliable it is), train kerbonauts a l\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1 X-COM. Research progress reaches plateaus till you test the prototype on mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnd-game is when you\u0027ve completed all the main quest goals (explore every planet etc), but you can still continue. Players might compete to reach the end-game in the minimum number of years, or missions, or money spent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one of those games where the future potential really occupies my mind. I am going to have to be careful not to over-play the early versions so I can still enjoy the final product. I played the early versions of minecraft too much and I can\u0027t enjoy it anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"simplemunrockets","CreatedById":22495,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-26T22:05:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuzz Aldrin\u0027s Race into Space has always been an inspiration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
