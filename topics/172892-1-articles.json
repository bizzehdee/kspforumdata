I turn the rocket mode right before I start losing speed (at around 24 km of altitude). Sometimes I keep at\u00A020 degrees, sometimes go to 25.\u00A0Never got any luck trying to increase this number, like in animations from the Skylon, that it seems to go at around 45 degrees to avoid the atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen returning I like to do long reentry burns, at around 600 m/s, so I can reentry on prograde, with more stability and precision, making the landing on the runway easy and routine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI managed to make combos with nukes that got me high amounts of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E after archiving orbit, but it\u0027s not worth it, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is too low.
