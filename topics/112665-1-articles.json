It\u0027s just not worth the hassle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your rover scenario, why not just use a docking port? Put one on top of the rover, and one beneath the lander. To pick up the rover, just drive it under the lander. It shouldn\u0027t be too hard to design things so that it comes close enough to engage the docking field, and pulling the rover up should be OK in Duna\u0027s gravity, as long as the rover isn\u0027t too heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T13:56:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried docking ports on Mun, and I found it very difficult to dock that way.

Build your lander as a rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat good is a craft that gets you to surface but can\u0027t really do anything or move you about without using a lot of fuel and performing dangerous surface hops? Make the whole thing a rover first, then figure out how to position engines so that it can function as an orbiter, THEN work on getting the whole thing balanced on top of a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineering difficulty is in having to solve two diffrent sets of problems with the same vehicle. Orbting and generally behaving as a space craft is one thing. Driving on the surface is obviously another (Then factor in wings for a spaceplane design and you\u0027re in KSP hell. Or heaven). An all-in-one solution is not going to be as efficient as a dedicated lander nor rover but it doesn\u0027t have to be. Nothing is perfect, though it could perfectly suit your needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have dirtside bases that feature engines and tanks so they can land themselves. They would be more efficient if they were delivered via skycrane, but do i allways feel like bothering with a skycrane? Or would i rather pilot them down to where they need to be then shutoff the engine and forget it exists? The anwser is that i regret not having built them as rovers because now i\u0027m unhappy about where i landed them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, i find that in the long run, things without wheels feel badly lacking and as a result i try to build bases/landers as rovers with a secondary purpose. Ground vehicles generally don\u0027t care much about CoM position, but when orbiting, it\u0027s crucial. Fuel lines can be used to ensure fuel is depleted evenly, and building craft symetricaly helps. If you forego symmetry, then use parts as balast to ensure CoM is as fixed as possible. And never use tanks as ballast. Never do that!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will be frustrating, but owning a nice land based vehicle with rocket engines that can propel it through space and takeoff-land feels like one of KSPs achievements. If it\u0027s accidentally also the lander you\u0027re looking for, even better!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit] On the subject of re-docking a rover on the surface with a mother craft. I wouldn\u0027t bother. Docking is way to fiddly on the surface, and the claw only works when you claw into things. When things drive into the claw, the game crashes. Not that it can\u0027t be done with docks, but if you\u0027re going to invest that much time and energy into it, you might as well try what i originally suggested instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T16:00:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by georgTF\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:14:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022georgTF\u0022 data-cite=\u0022georgTF\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell the answer is obvious but not very easy to engineer.
