View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a few notes if you go to the Imgur album.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did lose some parts along the way, but thankfully had some redundancy. For electric generation I started with 2 RTGs, 12 OX-STATs, 4 Gigantors, plus of course the 4 jet engines also produce electricity while running. Along the way I managed to lose both RTGs (very early) and 6 of the OX-STATs. The RTGs were mounted in the cargo bay, which I suspect doesn\u0027t completely protect it\u0027s occupants like I expected. The loss of the 6 OX-STATS came at a particularly bad time- right before crossing the land bridge. The land bridge is a ways north of the equator, so solar efficiency isn\u0027t great. I still had the Gigantors, but they can\u0027t be used while in motion of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make up for the loss of the RTGs and OX-STATs, I ran the jet engines at low thrust while going across the land bridge. Worked out OK. A further help was the fact that I had finally figured out that the vessel was much more durable without full fuel tanks (duh).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this doesn\u0027t disqualify me, but I did mount one aerodynamic surface, a rudder, on the back of the ship. This was because there aren\u0027t any water rudders in stock KSP, and I needed something to help keep the ship pointed forwards at \u0027high\u0027 speeds. \u0027High\u0027 meaning a whopping 38m/s. I can assure you that this vessel is in no way even remotely capable of flight. Even catching a little air going over hills almost always resulted in broken wheels at best, often followed by explosions and a debris field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne lesson I learned is that redundancy is a good thing- I was lucky I had so many sources of electric generation since I lost so many. The first thing I would change on a rebuild is to add batteries. Amphib2 only had a single giant battery, if I had lost that I don\u0027t think I could have completed the trip. So next time (Laythe, here I come..) I\u0027ll put at least two batteries on board, maybe more. They don\u0027t weigh much, and it\u0027s hard to operate without them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest concern by far during this journey was having a crew member accidentally fall into the cargo bay. I didn\u0027t include any ladders to get out, so that would have been a big problem. I decided to have a rule of nobody moving on the roof while the cargo doors were open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, almost all of the travel was over water. I did cut across the continent south of KSC to test out the rover capabilities before I got too far into the journey, but otherwise I stuck to the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, the whole journey took about 48 days, but a lot of that was spent refilling the fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-08T01:55:27Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2015 01:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RexKramer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HighExplosives12","CreatedById":150336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T06:36:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceplaneAddict\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpaceplaneAddict\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I\u0027m guessing no hyper edit to the object you\u0027d circumnavigate?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell there goes my plans of circumnavigating Minmus in a rather large tank, complete with 203mm naval guns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nigelvn","CreatedById":143368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T07:50:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot neccesarily, just keep adding boosters until you get there.

There are some large stretches of open water on Laythe, and I\u0027m finding that just \u0027eyeballing\u0027 distances on the map may not be sufficient.

(I\u0027m still \u0027eyeballing\u0027 the headings..) You just need to know the Lat/Long coordinates of your waypoints, and let a spreadsheet do the math (or do it by hand if you\u0027re a sadist).

Phew!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, one the drill reached the surface, I was informed there was no ore, because I was in Laythe\u0027s Sagen Sea biome. Uh oh, I landed with just enough fuel to sputter to this hunk of land and refuel. I headed inland, and after about 2km finally found a spot the game would allow me to drill (with landing gear retracted of course).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T02:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceplaneAddict\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpaceplaneAddict\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor water circumnavigations, can we use Better Buoyancy?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bubbadevlin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bubbadevlin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027times new roman\u0027;\u0022\u003EThis is not edited, this rover is just that freaking fast, and stable!

This is a ground circumnavigation and from the looks of your screenshots, you spent half the time in the air. Plus, you\u0027ve got two control surfaces that are at 45 degree angles.

I did at least replace the rover wheels with aircraft landing gear, but that was more of an effort to increase efficiency, I still miss having rover wheels that can go in reverse. I did manage to increase the range to about 750km.
