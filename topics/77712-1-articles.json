It\u0027s currently only set for use on a windows machine but version 1.1 is slated to function on Linux and Mac. The GUI allows for push button control of all server functions and currently has in addition a player list and push button backup and backup retrieval functionality. If you have any questions please let me either here or on the sins gaming website forum.

I\u0027m a power user when it comes to this sort of thing, so I would love to see hotkeys for the buttons (put \u0027\u0026amp;\u0027 in front of the letter you want to use as an Alt\u002BLetter hotkey in the button properties). Also don\u0027t forget the tabstops!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Less common tasks would be better served on a file menu. Make admin/remove admin for example probably won\u0027t happen all that often. Another option would be to use a toolbar with icons, this leads to #3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Try to squeeze out the dead space. Server desktops are often running a lot of utilities and screen real estate is often a premium. With a proper toolbar you could have nothing there but the player list, the history, and the chat line allowing a much more flexible window resizing ability. You have a lot of border space as well. The logo could be moved to an \u0027About\u0027 screen that is activated by a single toolbar button and could also serve to give important version/build date information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a very good start though, these are just suggestions take them or leave them.
