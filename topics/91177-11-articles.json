Postulating any new discovery should make the author of the scenario chase down the repercussions as well as they can. Look at drives with huge Isp and decent thrust alone, that makes creating world-killers (extinction level events) pretty easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVASIMR\u0027s are really the more promising options, but those are non-existent as of now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-24T13:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, assume a near future with VASIMR. That means you\u0027ve also solved fission power at X W/kg power density (can\u0027t remember what VASIMR needs to make sense, but it\u0027s a lot of power per kg reactor/radiator).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis gets you pretty idealized travel to other nearby planets like Mars.

Why are people in the places they are? The only possible combatants must be 100% self-reliant, BTW, or Mars declares war, and Earth says, \u0022OK, no more food or spare parts.

Ever notice how in Star Wars, the big, bad ship can\u2019t ever hit the fighters, and how the Death Star probably takes 3 hours to rotate and change it\u2019s target? Well big space warships, if it ever comes to warfare in space, big capital ships are just... bad. First they would have a very low maneuverability. Also, space battleships would be very large, making them an easier target. Third, mainly because of the low maneuverability, and massive surface space, the ship\u2019s surface would block the dorsal turrets from firing at ships below, therefore needing more weapons, more engines, more fuel, and more money to make and launch. While with a small fighter, they\u2019re fast, cheap(er), maneuverable, and it can easily turn itself to fire it\u2019s weapon, instead of relying on stupid little turrets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
