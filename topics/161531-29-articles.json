Not that I don\u0027t sympathize with yafeshan\u0027s desire to keep the game interesting, but I\u0027m a huge advocate of having access to better-than-chemical rockets for this game (after a hefty science and funding curve, of course, to climb the various eras to space!) that enable the potential travel times and power that we\u0027d need in real-life to do anything of consequence in a human timeframe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal gameplay preference (and role play preference) is to use those high delta-v engines to get places \u003Cem\u003Efaster\u003C/em\u003E, not to explore the entire system in one go (in 50 years). I like the idea of a riding fire for a Duna rendezvous in 2 weeks followed by 180 spin, hard braking, and a docking/refuel mission. The VISTA\u0027s were great for that! As long as you remember to put other engines on too for minor maneuvers in close quarters (oops...). I will compromise and say I don\u0027t mind some kind of simplistic \u0022depth\u0022 mechanism to put some long-term limitations on certain parts, as long as they aren\u0027t so restrictive/realistic that they ruin the fun of the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best parts of KSP to me are the initial missions, the first lander, the first NERVA drive, the first nuclear turbojet, the first NTJ SSTO, and then the first fusion SSTO that can make it to Minimus (or Duna). Once I get past the NERVA/ion, I\u0027m ready for more.

They seemed to be able to generate enough power for ignition, *sometimes*, but once in flight they would slowly run out of thermalpower, then megajoules, and stall in sub-orbital. Or during warping. Or sometimes would not ignite at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you ever consider a different mechanism for powering reactors and generators? Like if a generator (and a rocket or turbojet nozzle) is attached to a fusion reactor, there\u0027s a check involved and instead of having the thermal power resource compete between the turbojet and the generator, it simply reduces the thermal output of the reactor by 25% (or some value) but keeps it running without having to run into wierd thermal power demand juggling issues? (Did that mess make any sense?) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just found the more recent versions hard to consistently use without some kind of weird \u0022flame-out\u0022 happening, or without some strange operating rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could also be using them wrong, but I don\u0027t recall Fractal\u0027s version of them having this problem. Just plug a generator on, and they never bleed themselves dry of thermalpower while under thrust. (Not a criticism, I just don\u0027t know how you made all the new stuff work behind the scenes..)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
