Since it took me so long to motivate myself to finish the Jupiter (DIRECT) and Altair Lander parts, and seeing the progress of a lot of other mods I decided that the mod as a whole could use a facelift.  With the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 I was inspired to finally finish the Jupiter and Altair, and complete a near total overhaul of the mod.  Nearly every part has been remodeled and retextured, and I have made use of the stock Part Variant module for mesh and texture switching, throttle-based animations to animate the extending nozzle of the RL10B, and the new mapped specular shaders to provide a mirrored Orion capsule.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\n\n\u003Cfont size=\u00223\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI have also gone through and properly given most (if not all) parts an alias taken from the ancient Egyptian pantheon.

This mod started as simply making an External Tank and SRBs that were in scale with the Mk3 Spaceplane parts, which necessitated a 5m External Tank and 2.25m SRBs. Because of this the SLS must start at 5m since it is derived from the External Tank. Then to keep the ICPS and Orion in scale with the 5m Core Stage, they fall in the 3.125m size range.\n\nThank you for your feedback, it\u0027s much appreciated.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is a lovely mod, works nice in 1.02 ( I know its designed for 1.04, but idc). the capsule aerodynamics are lovely, it flights straight,\n\nThanks!

My flight profile was a roll to heads down and pitch to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA after clearing the launch clamps. After SRB separation I pitch almost to horizontal. I can get to an initial parking orbit of about 120km barely using the ICPS and have over 800m/s of delta-v remaining. There was barely any propellant remaining in the ICPS after I completed the burn. I was trying to get it to that point in my initial balancing because a couple of my initial values were leaving too much propellant in the ICPS after the TMI burn.

I did find all the thrust and Isp values for the RL-10B-2, RS-25D, and SRBs as they were much more readily available and I considered them essential to my initial config setups for those parts.\n\nI know that Isp is a measure of the engine\u0027s efficiency and can be mathematically defined either as the ratio of effective exhaust velocity to standard acceleration due to gravity (v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E/g\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E) or thrust to the product of standard acceleration due to gravity and propellant mass consumption rate (F\u003Csub\u003Ethrust\u003C/sub\u003E/(m\\_dot\\*g\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E)). You could use the real-world Isp values for the engines in KSP, but doing so would mean that you have to either adjust the thrust or the mass of what that engine has to lift. As as example, when I changed the available \u2206v in the MPCV, if I wanted to keep the thrust and mass values the same, the Isp would have ben about 1250 seconds. If I wanted to keep the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, however, the propellant mass would have to increase, and to keep TWR as it was I would have to decrease the dry mass accordingly. I would actually have had to have a negative dry mass to keep I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E where it was before, which led to a combined increase in I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E and propellant load and a decrease in dry mass.\n\nThe rocket equation is a good way to explain why I didn\u0027t use the real-world Isp values. It takes about 9700 m/s of \u2206v to get to LEO, but it only takes about 4300 m/s of \u2206v to get to LKO, so when scaling down a real-world launcher to KSP, you must scale the amount of \u2206v. The LKO \u2206v is about 44% that of LEO, so for scaling we could set up an equation thusly:\n\n\u2206v\u003Csub\u003ELKO\u003C/sub\u003E = 0.44\\*\u2206v\u003Csub\u003ELEO\u003C/sub\u003E = v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E\\*ln(M\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E/m\u003Csub\u003Ef\u003C/sub\u003E)\n\nNow, if we appropriately scale the masses such that the ratio of M\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E/m\u003Csub\u003Ef\u003C/sub\u003E is the same in KSP as it is in real-life, then the only thing we can change to lower the \u2206v is v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E. V\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E is the effective exhaust velocity and is equal to the product of specific impulse and standard acceleration due to gravity (I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E\\*g\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E), and since g\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E must be constant we must alter the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E to scale down the \u2206v.\n\nWhat I did to start balancing was to start with the mass of the orbiter I built in KSP, compared that to the real orbiter\u0027s mass, then using the total mass of the real STS stack was able to determine the scaled down mass of the combined ET and SRBs. From there I was able to get the gross mass of the ET and the individual SRBs. Then, to get an appropriate thrust-to-weight ratio at liftoff I determined the total thrust that was needed and divided it among the SSMEs and SRBs. This provided a good TWR that didn\u0027t tear the orbiter apart and didn\u0027t cause too much heating. The issue this raised was that there was too much propellant remaining in the ET, which further caused a slight issue with TWR after SRB separation. The only ways to correct this would be to alter the masses of the ET and SRBs and adjust the thrusts accordingly, or adjust the SSME I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E to be less efficient. The latter was a much simpler thing to do, so I decreased the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E to consume more propellant.\n\nThis then necessarily informed the balancing of the SLS, since it uses Shuttle derived hardware and I would have to use the SSMEs I balanced for the STS to power the Core Stage f the SLS. So, the masses of the SRBs and Core Stage were based on the masses of the ET and Shuttle SRBs to start and then lowered a bit to get the performance needed (getting to a sub-orbital trajectory such that the ICPS only needed to perform the insertion and TMI instead of completing the ascent. I started the RL-10B off with the same I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E I gave the SSMEs and gave the ICPS a mass in scale with the Core Stage (based on the real-world ratio). This gave the ICPS too much \u2206v; it could perform TMI, Munar orbit insertion, and TKI. So, again, ti maintain TWR for the ascent I had to adjust the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E of the RL-10B to decrease the amount of \u2206v and bring its performance more in line with the actual rocket. I think 2273.45 m/s is rather excessive for TMI. I don\u0027t remember ever using anywhere near 1000 m/s to perform TMI. In fact, in my tests with the SLS I never had to use more than 855 m/s to perform the TMI burn for a free-return trajectory.\n\nAre you still having difficulty performing the TMI burn with the ICPS as it is currently? If so I can always bump up the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E a little more.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T02:03:28Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 02:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138**"},{"CreatedByName":"AppleDavidJeans","CreatedById":84275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T18:35:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No problem. I understand we have to accommodate the way the program works, so I can correct that quickly enough and get a hot fix out soon. Thanks for telling me about all this, I have no experience with CKAN whatsoever.\n\u003E The RL-10B-2 on the ICPS will only operate in vacuum as it will perform the orbital insertion burn and then the TLI burn, so a sea-level Isp rating would be irrelevant. That\u0027s probably why neither you, nor I could find the sea-level Isp.\n\u003E \n\u003E When I said I was guessing, I was referring specifically to the Orion SM thrust and Isp values. I did find all the thrust and Isp values for the RL-10B-2, RS-25D, and SRBs as they were much more readily available and I considered them essential to my initial config setups for those parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E I know that Isp is a measure of the engine\u0027s efficiency and can be mathematically defined either as the ratio of effective exhaust velocity to standard acceleration due to gravity (v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E/g\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E) or thrust to the product of standard acceleration due to gravity and propellant mass consumption rate (F\u003Csub\u003Ethrust\u003C/sub\u003E/(m\\_dot\\*g\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E)). You could use the real-world Isp values for the engines in KSP, but doing so would mean that you have to either adjust the thrust or the mass of what that engine has to lift. As as example, when I changed the available \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v in the MPCV, if I wanted to keep the thrust and mass values the same, the Isp would have ben about 1250 seconds. If I wanted to keep the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, however, the propellant mass would have to increase, and to keep TWR as it was I would have to decrease the dry mass accordingly. I would actually have had to have a negative dry mass to keep I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E where it was before, which led to a combined increase in I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E and propellant load and a decrease in dry mass.\n\u003E \n\u003E The rocket equation is a good way to explain why I didn\u0027t use the real-world Isp values. It takes about 9700 m/s of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v to get to LEO, but it only takes about 4300 m/s of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v to get to LKO, so when scaling down a real-world launcher to KSP, you must scale the amount of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v. The LKO \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v is about 44% that of LEO, so for scaling we could set up an equation thusly:\n\u003E \n\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v\u003Csub\u003ELKO\u003C/sub\u003E = 0.44\\*\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v\u003Csub\u003ELEO\u003C/sub\u003E = v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E\\*ln(M\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E/m\u003Csub\u003Ef\u003C/sub\u003E)\n\u003E \n\u003E Now, if we appropriately scale the masses such that the ratio of M\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E/m\u003Csub\u003Ef\u003C/sub\u003E is the same in KSP as it is in real-life, then the only thing we can change to lower the \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v is v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E. V\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E is the effective exhaust velocity and is equal to the product of specific impulse and standard acceleration due to gravity (I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E\\*g\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E), and since g\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E must be constant we must alter the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E to scale down the \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v.\n\u003E \n\u003E What I did to start balancing was to start with the mass of the orbiter I built in KSP, compared that to the real orbiter\u0027s mass, then using the total mass of the real STS stack was able to determine the scaled down mass of the combined ET and SRBs. From there I was able to get the gross mass of the ET and the individual SRBs. Then, to get an appropriate thrust-to-weight ratio at liftoff I determined the total thrust that was needed and divided it among the SSMEs and SRBs. This provided a good TWR that didn\u0027t tear the orbiter apart and didn\u0027t cause too much heating. The issue this raised was that there was too much propellant remaining in the ET, which further caused a slight issue with TWR after SRB separation. The only ways to correct this would be to alter the masses of the ET and SRBs and adjust the thrusts accordingly, or adjust the SSME I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E to be less efficient. The latter was a much simpler thing to do, so I decreased the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E to consume more propellant.\n\u003E \n\u003E This then necessarily informed the balancing of the SLS, since it uses Shuttle derived hardware and I would have to use the SSMEs I balanced for the STS to power the Core Stage f the SLS.

I haven\u0027t used MechJeb in a game for a while now, though I did use it when I was developing the Ariane and Vega rockets for Bacon Labs to try and balance them, and I used it in my initial testing of my Space Shuttle parts, but it couldn\u0027t control it well enough after SRB separation. I considered that not everyone would be using MechJeb and so believed that it would be best to make sure it was flyable without MechJeb believing (apparently erroneously) that if it was flyable by-hand that MechJeb would be able to handle it without checking to see if it could handle either the Shuttle or the SLS.\n\nWhat altitude do you start your turn? When I fly it manually I pitch over to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA beginning around 1000m, after rolling to heads-down. I\u0027ll install MechJeb again and play around with some values.\n\nI checked the download and it does have the most recent OrionSM.cfg with the changes. To check your install, see if your OrionSM.cfg has the following values:\n\n    mass = 0.03atmosphereCurve{  key = 0 495  key = 1 315}RESOURCE{ name = LiquidFuel amount = 150 maxAmount = 150}RESOURCE{ name = Oxidizer amount = 184 maxAmount = 184}\n\nThese numbers were obtained through calculations and so should be correct, unless I made a mistake somewhere, which is possible. I\u0027ll double check this to make sure I didn\u0027t make a mistake.\n\nI\u0027ll bump the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E of the RL-10B back to the value I started it in my testing.
