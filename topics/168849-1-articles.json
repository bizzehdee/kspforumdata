Pretty awesome at fist, but it got boring after 3 flights or so because there was no way of staying in the air without descending. So I started thinking: \u0022What if weather, wind, turbulences and thermics was added into the game?\u0022 This is basically what this suggestion is. Weather, wind and thermics. This would give gliders a sence and make the game more chalenging, for example when you want to land on Duna or Eve, but there\u0027s a storm underneath you or if you want to launch a rocket. Would you like to see a feature like this in the game? (And yes, I know that there is a mod that adds wind, but it\u0027s pretty Basic.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-24T13:40:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a lot of extra calculations added on top of what is already one of the most taxing parts of the game;\u00A0atmospheric flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be cool yeah, but it is worth the effort just so we can have IRL equivalent gliders?
