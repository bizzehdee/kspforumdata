My potato for example bogs down at iirc 150 parts \u0026lt;might be off on the exact # but 150 will do for now\u0026gt; \u00A0and yours may be humming along until say 500. How do we work if your stuff could break my fp seconds to fp year? Sure it could disable physics calculations on my side for your stuff but the instant we dock? Now we are 1 vessel and I get broken by parts count. KSP was designed as a single player game. Was that because of Unity limitations or simple design choice by Harvester so many years ago? Honestly I don\u0027t know. Maybe in KSP 2 where it can be designed in at the start, just not here. I think DMP may be the thing you need but I can only suggest. I hope I made sense.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-20T19:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis suggestion for the game\u0027s development has been moved to Suggestions \u0026amp; Development, where you will find that many other people would like the same thing. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
