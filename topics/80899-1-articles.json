What this means is that you are traveling straight towards the targeted docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Once you\u0027re within 10m of target, ignore the navball. You will be too close for it to help you anymore and will find yourself drifting (even with the prograde marker on top of the target marker). Go from eye here on out and you\u0027ll be much better off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Lastly, and it goes without saying, learn the RCS keys. To make docking even easier, after \u0022controlling from here,\u0022 press V until your camera is in \u0022chase mode\u0022 and center it directly behind your craft. Try controlling it with RCS now.
