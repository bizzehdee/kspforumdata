When I did, i think that fixed the problem, but when I timewarped, the monopropellant went and it said in the bottom that the crew was crazy, so what is the mod that did that, or a hack, OR SOMETHING\n\nPLEASE HELP!\n\nHere is a picture for my proof:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/pq39l4mvh7fg7sj/BROKEN.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pq39l4mvh7fg7sj/BROKEN.png?dl=0)\n\nplease, please HALP!"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T00:45:51Z","Content":"Ummmm... how are we supposed to help you if we don\u0027t know what mods you\u0027re using?\n\nIt\u0022s Ampyear.
