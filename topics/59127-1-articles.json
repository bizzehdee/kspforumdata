I got a pretty cool view of it, even though I was pretty far away, and I decided to warp time some more to get an even better view, and possibly get into orbit around it. Unexpectedly, while I was looking at map view, Jeb\u0027s ship appeared to get extremely close to the moon. The orbit outline turned yellow, and somehow Jeb survived the crashed and was rocketed into orbit around Kerbol, sharing a similar orbit to Kerbin, probably due to collide one day. I warped time, but it didn\u0027t look like it would happen any time soon, so I had to terminate the mission. I sent another rocket up into orbit around Kerbin again to get a better view of Minmus. The exact same thing happened, but instead of crashing into the moon, I made the orbit too far. Luckily, I had a working communicom on this one, with some magical Mystery Goo, and I got some science from that. The end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Jeb really is invincible if he can survive crashing on the Mun at full speed... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
