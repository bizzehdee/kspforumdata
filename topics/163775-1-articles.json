You can land individual modules and then move them around with a rover to connect them together, or you can land the whole thing in one piece. Ask yourself what you need the station to do. If you just want to complete the contract, give them the bare minimum, while also trying to make it useful to you. Remember that if it has to \u0022support six Kerbals\u0022, you just need six seats on the base. You don\u0027t need six Kerbals. At the very least, if I\u0027m going to set up a base, I send an engineer and a couple scientists.

are a lot of ways you can potentially do it. \u00A0Some general concepts are below. \u00A0Some are potentially easier/faster/cheaper, but all of these should be doable in some form if they sound interesting. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. \u00A0Treat the base as a big lander. \u00A0Launch in one piece, and land on legs like a you would a lander. \u00A0This is probably the easiest way for most base contracts if you just want to keep things simple.\u00A0 If the contract requires a lot of parts, and your lander would be too tall and narrow if built in a single stack, you can always have a couple stacks attached radially. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. \u00A0Launch on one piece, but have the base land on its side. \u00A0I call this the \u0022log\u0022 approach, and it\u0027s pretty common approach for bases that need to be wheeled. \u00A0Two particular challenges: first, if you have wheels or landing legs on one side only, that may create aerodynamic / center of mass issues on launch. \u00A0Second, you may need to have some engines pointing toward the \u0022bottom\u0022\u00A0\u00A0of the base, which is perpendicular to the direction you launch from. \u00A0This also requires making sure those landing engines match the center of mass, which can be a little tricky. \u00A0On lower-gravity bodies, you may be able to get around this by having the thing land in the normal fashion, and then tip over on its side using reaction wheels, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. \u00A0Launch components into orbit, assemble in orbit, then land together. \u00A0This might be useful if you want a very wide base, which would be un-aerodynamic to launch on its own. \u00A0But there are a couple potential complications. \u00A0 First, you have to go through the regular rigmarole of docking each module.\u00A0 Second, you may need to do some fine docking work to sure parts are lined up correctly (i.e., rotated the right way when they land). \u00A0Third, you may need to make sure the engines of your completed base line up with its center of mass. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. \u00A0Land base modules separately but near each other, and use a mod like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0to join them. \u00A0This works fairly well once you\u0027ve gotten the hang of precision landings (which can be pretty tough at first). \u00A0And it works nicely if you want a \u0022village\u0022 look to your base, with a bunch of individual structures. \u00A0But it requires modding, and the little pipes \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E uses are not the prettiest. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. \u00A0Land base modules separately but near each other, and use Alt-F12 to complete the contract once you have all the parts. \u00A0This could be considered cheating, but might get the job done if you want one of those \u0022village\u0022 bases without using mods. \u00A0However, such a base won\u0027t be able to share resources.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. \u00A0Land base modules separately, then use Klaws to join. \u00A0Aside from the precision landing issue, this should not be too tricky. \u00A0But the Klaws look kind of ugly in my opinion. \u00A0And you may need wheels on your components to get them where they need to be. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. \u00A0Land base modules separately, then use docking ports to join. \u00A0This can make very nice looking modular bases, but it can be extremely difficult to get those docking ports aligned perfectly. \u00A0This is somewhat feasible if you\u0027re operating on the Minmus flats, but might be near impossible in rocky

I knew what the problem was by then, but I had built new modules and forgot to test them with the rover. They were way too short. I very nearly gave up. Instead, I pushed them to a hill and then did the retract and extend thing again. This time, though, I had to quickly switch to the rover (while the module\u00A0was still raising up or lowering down) and push the other module forward to connect them. It finally worked, but it was so tedious I said I wouldn\u0027t do it again.
