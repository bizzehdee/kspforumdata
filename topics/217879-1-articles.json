I believe it even sends a log behind the scenes for the team to debug. I think this would really improve the feedback you guys get without users needing to post on the forums.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://external-preview.redd.it/zwYK5nZ5PC2rmbggIqtm2L56Fx876kQjp1qps1-Cnk8.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;s=c4ebfcec9bd1bf14f749d11cb141ec6984a6069b\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EExmaple\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-23T06:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP has the same thing in the launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattihase","CreatedById":73161,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-24T22:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you use the launcher.
