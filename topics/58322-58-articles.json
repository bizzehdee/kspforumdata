I have been since it came out and I\u0027ve been struggling with all kinds of crashes. I installed 32bit last night and it\u0027s smooth sailing again. Not moving back to 64 until it\u0027s sorted out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlways remember that control needs to be true on that gun/turret for it to function at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few announcements:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I\u0027m adding mouse aiming to the ball turrets, I\u0027ve had a bunch of requests for it. I thought about it before but thought it would be too arcade like for Skillful - which I didn\u0027t want. But after implementing a simple solution I realized that it doesn\u0027t really make it too easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMouse aiming will benefit from the guardian mode\u0027s shot lead calculation, so all you need to do is aim the cursor right on the target and it will calculate the lead which should help hitting while the turret is on your moving vehicle/chopper/aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ball turrets will now have 3 firing modes, 1) automatic guardian, 2) auto track by selecting a target and 3) mouse aiming with the left mouse button being the trigger. I\u0027ll release a video showing the basic implementation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, the other turrets like the 14\u0022 tank coaxial 30cal and Turbo Laser will soon have guardian mode. This will be a little more difficult to implement since the larger guns can hit out to nearly 9km maybe more.

I\u0027m finding that it is impossible to reload any guns. (it is possible to reload the missile pods) I\u0027m getting almost frustrated. I cannot do it... I\u0027ll go through step by step what I\u0027m doing. 1. Fire the gun and use a bunch of ammo. 2. Get out of the vehicle (in this case it\u0027s a pod with a Metal support beam attached with the gun and an ammo box right beside it) and right click on the gun and press the \u0022reload from nearby\u0022 button. 3. Get back into vehicle to find that the ammo has not changed at all. 4. get back out and press the \u0022transfer ammo button\u0022 5. Alt click the ammo box and press the \u0022transfer ammo\u0022 button. nothing works. I even tried alt clicking the ammo box inside the pod and then \u0022transfering\u0022 the ammo the way you transfer fuel. Nothing. It just simply refuses to reload. I don\u0027t understand! Is it just broken because of the new version? Before I had multiple different mods on but I removed all of them except for module manager and this mod and I still cannot reload the guns. I don\u0027t know how to reload anyways.. I thought it would be straightforward haha. If there is some unusual way of reloading the ammo can someone tell me? Like I said, no mods installed. Just skillful. I\u0027m trying every button I see to no avail. What is going wrong?
