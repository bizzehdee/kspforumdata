I will start the marathon with a good old fashioned tabletop RPG (Shadowrun to be exact) and then when the friends that just want to have fun but don\u0027t want to do the marathon get tired I will be moving with a friend or two over to KSP for the remainder of the time. We will not be playing MP as there are too many issues associated with that, but we will be in the same room and will set up a scoring system so we can keep it competitive, we will be using mods, but to keep it fair we will be using the same ones. I will be streaming the entire time (RPG and KSP), my twitch profile name is the same as my name here on these forums \u0022jab136\u0022. If you would like to donate, here is a link to my donation page.
