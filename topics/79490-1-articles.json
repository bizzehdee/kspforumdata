The reason I ask this is that I find I need to remember to toggle SAS off before using the launch escape tower, or my capsule will simply go straight and smack right back into the rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinor quality of life thing, and not a big deal, but perhaps it wouldn\u0027t be too much trouble to chuck into one of the upcoming updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/72373744805457931/1C19208EDED36018451C782BDCA101504DA9A86C/\u0022 alt=\u00221C19208EDED36018451C782BDCA101504DA9A86C\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T18:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe adding the ability to toggle SAS and RCS in the action group menu? so you could toggle them together or one at a time etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xrayfishx","CreatedById":76147,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T21:03:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you can do right now is to toggle/disable the reaction wheels/RCS. You can do that with most cockpits. As for making it automatically turn them off, that would make a lot of people angry, including me. What if sometimes I want to have SAS and RCS turned on when I abort? Or what if I use Abort as the 11th action group?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of my spaceplanes have cockpit ejection systems, which decouple and boost the cockpit away from the rest of the aircraft. It works better when SAS is turned on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the suggestion, in itself, is rubbish, however the ability to switch SAS and RCS on/off, as suggested in the post above, would be really good.
