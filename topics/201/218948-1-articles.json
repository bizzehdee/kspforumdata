When clicking on the double-line, the one selected is that from\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the encounter, rather than that from before. As such, attempting to \u0022warp here\u0022 results in a missed encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore detail:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve attached a zip file with two screenshots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy craft is on a \u003Cem\u003Every slight\u003C/em\u003E intercept course with the Mun. This will perturb my orbit of Kerbin by some small amount, and thus results in my trajectory being shown as two blue lines (from where I am to Mun encounter, followed by the whole of the next orbit of Kerbin after the minor deviation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA natural thing to want to do is to warp\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecloser\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to the encounter, possibly to adjust ones approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, when I click on the trajectory line before the Mun encounter, it shows I\u0027ll reach that point in 5d, 1h, 43m (one screenshot), while if I select a point just after the Mun encounter, it shows only 4h 33m. Indeed, if I try to warp to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the encounter, it sends me through the Mun encounter, then all the way around Kerbin, and back to the selected point on the post-perturbation trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it would make more sense if, when I click on a place where there are two trajectories (pre and post perturbation), the game should default to selecting the earlier-occurring of the two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the case of the Mun encounter one only loses a few days; I\u0027ve had this happen to me with a Dres encounter though, which cost me a few years, and by the time the thing stopped timewarping Dres was entirely on the other side of the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncluded Attachments:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/applications/core/interface/file/cfield.php?storage=form_Fields\u0026amp;path=Screenshots.zip\u0026amp;fileKey=%5B!AES128GCM%5BEld2YdxJ5DeXDc6h3eT%2BmK6WlykniZ9EBHlH1Db3ZtJBkw5TCzDj8HYA7FzXzZ2V3bUQLEbvTfKv%2BDkY3EWr%2BA==%5D%5B932f4cd03fb4173b34c194b8%5D%5Ba665f39a0ea4dbda3d3d71b1ff5d1917%5D%5D\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EScreenshots.zip\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-20T20:48:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2023 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 20\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Anth12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vortygont","CreatedById":223549,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-22T05:48:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also encountered this issue, I think the problem is just as solvable as the solved problem of accidentally pointing at a satellite rather than the planet itself.
