However, after a few iterations of attempted launch/modifications the aerodynamic forces as shown by \u0022center of pressure\u0022 gimbals become skewed to one side, with no way to change that. This could be seen in the screenshot, with pressure force shown to be directed to the left, while the stabilizer is straight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncluded Attachments:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220231029224053_1.jpg.578af42607031eb1d6ea3fc5f9266459.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/uploads/monthly_2023_10/20231029224053_1.jpg.578af42607031eb1d6ea3fc5f9266459.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-10-31T05:52:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2023 05:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Oct 31\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by The Space Peacock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechieV","CreatedById":229200,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-31T06:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, this bug happens to me a lot.

It applies lift orthogonal in one direction (asymetric profile). Displayed is the lift the surface would produce at 0\u00B0 angle of attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo some lift pointing sideways is to expected if you place just a single wing without radial symmetry. The curious part is that the lift from the main wings has gone missing in the preview, that lift vector is now only from your rudder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe actual issue appears to be that lift for wings is displayed incorrectly at seemingly random for axis-aligned wings - it\u0027s off 180\u00B0 when that happens, potentially negating the lift vectors from symmetric parts. If you tilt the entire craft just slightly off-axis, all wings which are no longer axis-aligned now have the lift previewed correctly again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEasy way to reproduce this? Take just a single wing and mount it horizontally, then rotate it up-side down. Increase the thickness of the wing so you can clearly see the profile, to make sure you got it right (curved side should be on the bottom now!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow as long as the wing is exactly horizontal (even though already upside down!), it will preview lift as if the lift vector was pointing straight up. Tilt the wing just by 5\u00B0 in either direction, and suddenly the lift vector flips upside down as it should.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you add more wings, you will then find that it\u0027s the individual wings components vectors which have their signs incorrectly flipped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-11-11T14:23:25Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2023 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Nov 11\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Ext3h\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
