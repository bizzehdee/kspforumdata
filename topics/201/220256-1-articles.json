Stacked 30 small short fuel tanks with a large command pod at the top and a large engine at the bottom, then hit launch. The game went to the loading screen, then never loaded into game and stopped responding.\u00A0 I waited over 5 minutes just to make sure it wasn\u0027t just loading slow but it never recovered. I\u0027ll include the craft file which reproes it 100% on my computer, though really just build a tall stack of small fuel tanks and this seems to occur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncluded Attachments:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/applications/core/interface/file/cfield.php?storage=form_Fields\u0026amp;path=IKnowThisIsABadDesign.json\u0026amp;fileKey=%5B!AES128GCM%5BDbWulg5nfhhy2KdkJdE6XVcGIDJWLyYdDxbrZWqQWpFrttwWGKFCvMCAfpqEHAnfUnH7BbXtoZvYB3hgx%2B03HRHhGbvef6AQPX5S%5D%5B2ea52d831a8558ea7452f958%5D%5B76f83f72bf7bf044a6d73d70661d1945%5D%5D\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EIKnowThisIsABadDesign.json\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cstyle type=\u0022text/css\u0022\u003E\r\n.ipsImage {\r\nwidth: 900px !important;\r\n}\u003C/style\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abelinoss","CreatedById":222638,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-26T10:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously that shouldn\u0027t happen, but the wobble fix is coming in For Science! not this patch\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
