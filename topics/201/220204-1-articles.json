Afterward, i decided to try an earlier save, but, to my dismay, the issue still persisted. eventually, after becoming incredibly frustrated, i closed the game and relaunched it. After reloading my save, it appeared to be fixed, but then it simply exploded out of nowhere and paige told me that a structural linkage failure had occured between poodle engine and fuel tank. Note that the craft was incredibly stable before ceasing to exist prior to relaunch (it didnt even wobble whilst being launched!) and every save with the craft in it had the same issue. I became quite upset after that and decided to do some\u00A0 light digging. I noticed that either the craft from the loading screen or an extremely buggy version of my craft kept appearing and yeeting itself into the horizon. I have also noted down that my craft appeared to have collision between its parts as if they were separate craft even though they were part of the same craft! I am unaware as to the precise cause of the issue and am also not sure if anyone has reported this before, but i do hope it gets fixed soon, as it upset me quite a bit and would probably be detrimental to gameplay and overall game enjoyment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncluded Attachments:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cstyle type=\u0022text/css\u0022\u003E\r\n.ipsImage {\r\nwidth: 900px !important;\r\n}\u003C/style\u003E\n"}]}
