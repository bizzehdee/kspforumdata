In the original game this could be done by switching the navball into target mode and moving the retrograde marker around till you were on top of your target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the sequel, the target-relative retrograde marker and the target relative velocity both give misleading readings while your craft is rotating. If your actual center-of-mass relative velocity is 0.8 towards the target, but your cockpit\u0027s rotation gives it a relative velocity of 1.5 m/s, that can be shown as anything from -0.7 to 2.3 m/s, and the marker moves all around based on the movement of the cockpit rather than reflecting the movement of the overall craft. Both values temporarily reset to \u0022true\u0022 if you press \u0022./\u0022 to start and stop time warp, then drift away again as you rotate to perform the maneuvers needed for rendezvous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis adds a layer of UI/UX frustration to the challenge of docking, since the player must now guess what the actual relative velocities are and/or attempt to remember precisely where the markers were the last time time warp was engaged. The target-relative velocity should be calculated relative to the craft\u0027s center of mass, and rotating should not affect it at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-11-19T00:33:24Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2023 12:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Nov 19\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by HebaruSan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
