Also, the longer you mess around with this, the less stable the delta V calculations seem to get as during testing I managed to get to a point where I had a vessel consisting of a probe, fuel tank and engine only with no delta v, simply because a cargo bay had previously been attached to the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncluded is a craft file of the craft I built to work out whether or not cargo bays were causing my problems. It has 0 Delta V but goes pretty far despite that. The best way to scope out this bug however just seems to be messing around in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E with engines and cargo bays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncluded Attachments:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/applications/core/interface/file/cfield.php?storage=form_Fields\u0026amp;path=LookMaNoDeltaV.zip\u0026amp;fileKey=%5B!AES128GCM%5BLaf469NPJ1g3XnqHEw8mT4lIcZ1Or%2BrzbIWFseowejvZJT0%2B34FbURNouE4fJrRCQoEk3oxOQ3yCyt3OrS20l1Zy%2Bw==%5D%5B1d276d186201d5b4d7ab7b77%5D%5B9791fcf5a0f4e103d4b8fdbb4659dd37%5D%5D\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ELookMaNoDeltaV.zip\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-11-10T03:56:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2023 03:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Nov 10\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by The Space Peacock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
