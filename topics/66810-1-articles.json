The only tool they had working without response from the station was the distance measurement laser. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen approaching the station close enough for visual confirmation, the crew saw that they are approaching it from the wrong side - here was the active docking port.

No automatic control systems either. It\u0027s broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* No navball target mode - the navigation is not working without response from the station. Just close the navball when approaching the target. Also don\u0027t use the map when closer than 2 km to the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* No other docking navigation or autopilots!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The rescue craft must be manned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You can use the map to arrange the rendezvous, but don\u0027t get it below 500m. Bonus points if not used the targeting on the map or closest arranged approach is above 2km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus objective - docking port on another side (more than 90 dergees from your original approach direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* If the station has multiple docking ports, select the furthest from you initial approach\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You must get direct approach from the wrong side (let\u0027s say less approach less that 250 m) before starting the flying around the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe leaderboard objective: Soyuz-T still had peroxide RCS with fairly limited amount of monopropellant. Complete the bonus objective with least RCS spent!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Only monopropellant RCS. Don\u0027t use small liquid-fueled engines oriented differently than your main engine instead of liner RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Also don\u0027t use RCS with higher than stock ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Your score is RCS spent (screenshot with resource tab just before docking) per mass of your spacecraft (screenshot from map mode with craft info open when you achieve orbit) - lowest score wins!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional bonus (separate leaderboard): do this with no torque-producing parts!

With older ones (Including Soyuz-T, despite it being the first of the new series), however, it was the usual procedure to use 90 degree turns and small pulses from main engine during approach to stay on target, the linear RCS were used only during last minutes. Peroxide RCS never had enough delta v for any extensive maneuvering. Of course, you wouldn\u0027t point your main engine to the station, but other than that... \u0022\u00C3\u2018\u00C2\u00C3\u00C2\u00B1\u00C3\u00C2\u00BB\u00C3\u00C2\u00B8\u00C3\u00C2\u00B6\u00C3\u00C2\u00B0\u00C3\u2018\u00C5\u00BD\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5-\u00C3\u00C2\u00BA\u00C3\u00C2\u00BE\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u00C2\u00BA\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u00C2\u00B8\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C3\u2018\u00C6\u2019\u00C3\u2018\u00C5\u00BD\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C3\u00C2\u00B8\u00C3\u00C2\u00B9 \u00C3\u00C2\u00B4\u00C3\u00C2\u00B2\u00C3\u00C2\u00B8\u00C3\u00C2\u00B3\u00C3\u00C2\u00B0\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u00C2\u00BB\u00C3\u2018\u00C5\u2019\u0022 means that it was not only for orbit corrections, but also for maneuvering when approaching the station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T22:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI still think some kind of common starting point would make this challenge better because it would allow more reliable comparison of results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway: here is my attempt, using adapted Kerbal X (with docking port instead of chute) and no monopropellant used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI switched to visual steering 14 km away from the station.
