I also noticed some severe framerate drops in map mode that can crash the game, that go away if you delete the manuver node, if present. But i dont understand why the graphics are worse than PS4. Its kinda why i bought the PS5 and a real big let down. I was hoping for equal or better graphics and less crashes but that is not the case. Is the PS5 update an older one than PC and other consoles?
