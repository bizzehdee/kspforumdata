Another benefit of this approach is that Ackermann steering happens as a consequence.\n\nFor most applications, I\u0027m sure Ackerman steering would suffice. However, I\u0027d also like to propose crab steering as an additional option, to allow for rovers that can drive sideways directly:\n\n![chariot01.jpg](http://collectspace.com/review/chariot01.jpg)\n\n![mrv-parallel-jpg.jpg?w=600](http://images.techtimes.com/data/images/full/81720/mrv-parallel-jpg.jpg?w=600)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-VUHdmjytM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T06:50:21Z","Content":"Good idea. This would give us three different types of steering: tank steering, car steering and crab steering. Pressing the left key would produce the following actions on the various wheels:\n\n**Front-left quadrant:**\n\nTank: orient clockwise, drive backwards\n\nCar: orient anticlockwise\n\nCrab: orient anticlockwise, drive forwards\n\n**Front-right quadrant:**\n\nTank: orient anticlockwise, drive forwards\n\nCar: orient anticlockwise\n\nCrab: orient anticlockwise, drive forwards\n\n**Back-left quadrant:**\n\nTank: orient anticlockwise, drive backwards\n\nCar: orient clockwise\n\nCrab: orient anticlockwise, drive forwards\n\n**Back-right quadrant:**\n\nTank: orient clockwise, drive forwards\n\nCar: orient clockwise\n\nCrab: orient anticlockwise, drive forwards\n\n...and then let us toggle between each form of steering. A wheel like the XL-3 that cannot orient itself can only perform tank steering, but any wheel that can orient itself could be used for tank steering, car steering or crab steering (at least to a point - a wheel that can only turn 20 degrees left and right could only crab steer at a 20 degree angle forwards and backwards, zig-zagging its way sideways instead of just driving sideways)."},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T13:35:17Z","Content":"While I like the whole idea of having crab steering wheels in KSP, I\u0027d be happy for a long time if our current rover wheels actually worked as they were supposed to."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T16:23:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E While I like the whole idea of having crab steering wheels in KSP, I\u0027d be happy for a long time if our current rover wheels actually worked as they were supposed to.\n\nSeems that Unity 5 is about to bring the change we both desire so much.\n\nI like the idea.
