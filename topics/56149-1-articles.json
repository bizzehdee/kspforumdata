I once (accidentally) replaced the parts folders with a plugins parts instead of merging them, and it deleted all the stock parts so nothing worked. If the regular parts aren\u0027t showing up in the VAB, that\u0027s probably what happened. Otherwise I don\u0027t know, but I\u0027d bet it was something to do with the way you installed the mod making the parts not usable somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMatt\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AZGrove","CreatedById":96721,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T21:17:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually all of the parts are showing up.
