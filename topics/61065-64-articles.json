Today I noticed I lost all my ribbons again like back in 0.90. I unfortunately do not have a backup to compare savefiles and the current log doesn\u0027t have any information. I did have a couple of crashes last night when playing, but I\u0027ve been focused on probes and didn\u0027t notice exactly at what point the ribbons were gone. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry to hear that. But it I have the suspicion that crashes are causing this. Maybe the crashes are themself caused by out of memory situations. If this is the case there is nothing I can do about it. Out of memory errors are unpredictable and can cause everything with or without traces in the log.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESp please take a look of the memory usage of KSP after launching a mission. If it gets over 3 GB we are approaching trouble here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately KSP overwrites the logfile, if KSP gets started and ribbons are lost after the restart. But without a log at the point in time when this happens, I can\u0027t nothing do to get any clue what is happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve played KSP for about 6 hours yesterday (a career) and I reverted a lot. Nothing happened, all is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have checked the loading/saving methods too and found nothing special (they are in Persistence.cs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems that the bug gets introduced with using the persistence file for saving the ribbon data. We had a few problems before this, but AFAIR all were solved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I have two choices now: keeping it in the persistence file and maybe reworking it (with unpredictable results) or I can switch back to my own saving scheme again (this time its unfortunately more complicated). Or some kind of fallback saving, if the persistence file won\u0027t load anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment I don\u0027t anymore think this bug is caused by FF. Maybe by some \u0022strange\u0022 behavior of KSP, maybe crashes. The method other mods were using was not working for me in the previous releases of FF. Maybe this restriction is eased now and I can try it again. But the core of it would be quite similar and I would expect exactly the same problems. Again: If the ribbons gets lost because of a crash, I can\u0027t do anything that will solve this completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I have tested a bit: KSP loads an unfinished save file without any visible signs in the game. If the part of FF is not saved, because KSP crashes just before, we will get the save with ribbons (and maybe other things missing). At the time FF can detect that all ribbons were lost, it\u0027s to late to do anything. I can display a warning message (and maybe I will add this in the near future). But what should we do then? The logs are gone, the save is lost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is: I have never faced this so far. But ok, I\u0027m not playing KSP often for hours, just sometimes in between. And I have absolutely no crashes with KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to help me: Use some kind of log rotation, so that the log is renamed before KSP starts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stevehead\u0022 data-cite=\u0022stevehead\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have no experience in handling information being saved in SFS files (neither of my mods handles persistence), so I apologize if I say something that is not correct, but I\u0027ve noticed that all the mods (KCT, KAC, USI Life Support, Waypoint Manager, etc.) that do not have this problem, AFAIK, are storing their persistence in SCENARIO nodes under the main GAME node. I just wonder if Final Frontier\u0027s problems are related to the fact that its persistence is stored under a custom FinalFrontierHallOfFameRoot node as opposed to SCENARIO; it just seems to me that if I were to design a plugin that stores persistence in the save file, I would conform to what others are doing and save that information under SCENARIO. Again I could be completely wrong in what I have said, but I\u0027m trying to help.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I have tried ScenorioModules at first. But because FF was starting that often in previous releases, I was facing several problems which I was unable to solve. I have learned quite a bit in programming for KSP since then, so maybe I will succeed this time. If its only the part of the SFS file, we can try to move the data; that\u0027s easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I will give it a try tomorrow.
