Work on the new wheels is progressing, but not as quickly as I would like. I got the steering module working last week, and had to step back to work on the suspension again. It required a few more days of investigating and moving things around, but they are now much more stable than before, and their internal logic is much simpler. Yesterday I wrote the new extend/retract module, which is about as interesting as a two-state animation controller can be\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 which admittedly isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t much. The wheels can deploy and retract again though, which is a good thing. \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also fixed the way wheels respond to being aligned to ground at launch. When you hit Launch in the editor, the game figures out where the bottom-most bits of your ship are, and uses that to place it flush with the launchpad or runway surface, so if you had your ship hovering 5m up in the air in the editor, it won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fall and smash itself to bits on starting flight. This lowest-point-on-ship system relies on collider bounds to figure out where the ship is, but wheel colliders are special cases, because they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not actual solid objects, but rather just a physics behaviour component, so they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t figure in for the bounds detection, and as a result, ships would tend to spawn with their wheels below ground.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow, wheels use the same system launch clamps use (and had it developed for, in fact) to override this ground alignment. Wheels don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do anything as dramatic as the clamps do, but they add the height of the wheels at full extension, so when you spawn, the tires are flush against the tarmac.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s about all I have so far, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve evidently not had the most exciting week. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m also .going through different ideas here to split the project into multiple DLLs, because this slowness is mainly being caused by the time it takes to compile and run the game after making changes. The time it takes between saving your latest tweak to the code, switching to unity, waiting for the project to compile, then launching the game and waiting for it to load, even with all the development tools we have to speed up this process, is still taking several minutes, which is more than enough time to lose focus, forget what you were doing, fire up a browser and ADHD yourself into total disconnection.

Visually R\u0026amp;D is going to look the same as it did before, that is the goal at least. The back end driving the GUI has changed tremendously though: the tech tree. itself which had to be redone from scratch. Luckily this time around half of its logic is handled by the Unity 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00B2s GUI system so I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to write the code to update the scrollbars, snap the grid area to the edges, etcetera. Another advantage is that this GUI system has proper clipping implemented, so the tech tree area is no longer visible through a hole in the rest of the GUI. \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMax (Maxmaps)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFinally back from my break.
