Funds are implemented to an essential level, which means they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re far from complete, but the game does already calculate the cost of vessels and charges you for it, or prevents you from launching altogether if you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t foot the bill. Figuring the cost of a vessel was an interesting thing to work on. Initially, the idea was that the cost of vessels would just be the sum of the cost of every part, but it seemed much more interesting to factor in the cost of the resources contained in each part as well. So for instance, the 10.0 units of Monopropellant on a mk1 pod make up for 12.00 of its 600.00 total cost. On an SRB, on the other hand, the cost of the fuel is a much more significant percentage of the total. Also, this does mean that if you set the amount of fuel in the Editors to less than full, you can make the part slightly cheaper (or a lot in case of SRBs). This system was a lot more tricky to put together than just adding up fixed costs, but it should be much more interesting to play with. I had to go over the cfg values for a lot of parts, to make sure their costs weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t set to anything less than the cost of the resources they contained (that would have been awkward). Several parts have had some stats tweaked, but most importantly, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve tweaked the costs and Isp values on the Mainsail and the Kerbodyne LF Booster. The Mainsail is now the more efficient one, so it should be a more appealing option now, when comparing the two. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Alex (aLeXmOrA): \u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;I left everything ready to do the upgrade of the KSP Forums last Thursday, but due to some last minute issues we had to postpone it for today. As you can see, the Forums are now in maintenance mode while I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m running the upgrade script. This process should be completed for this Thursday\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s afternoon and then the Forums will be running in the last vBulletin 5.1.1 version. After that, I will start implementing the project I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working with Bob and Miguel (more about that later).\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Mike (Mu):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt; Well it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a week of changes and improvements to the contract systems and adding some new features to really push the game towards having an actual career mode! Have also created some new controls which add colour and variety to our text. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re finally moving towards a much more consolidated UI which feels a lot better.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Daniel (danRosas)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Going through the polishing of the animation.

Many people find FAR hard to use because they don\u0027t understand the numbers, so they fall back on trial and error.

Think ahead to KSP v1.0 going on general sale: that is when all the big reviews come out. Think how many copies will sell if every tutorial talks about a vertical learning curve and endless frustration trying to understand all the numbers? Game reviewers are game enthusiasts with a skill for expressing themselves by the written word, and they aren\u0027t necessarily at all academic. If the game gives them the impression you must understand the numbers then they will warn potential players of this, and only the geeks and nerds will rise to the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the numbers are unnecessary for basic gameplay and we CAN play by trial and error (via the magic of roll-back), then why put effort into providing the numbers? Any extra feature takes man-hours and calendar hours to implement, and delays the release and increases the cost. The numbers won\u0027t be a big selling point (indeed the opposite), so there is, from the point of view of a developer, no clear rationale for expending that effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI, like other advanced players, love using MechJeb for the dV calculations.
