So for a certain amount of propellant, the faster you burn fuel, the higher the thrust generated at the expense of burn time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simple way to think of how fast something burns is based on its surface area being burned. Liquid engines you can think of as having a fixed surface area for combustion, so no matter how much fuel you have, the rate of burning is the same, and therefore thrust doesn\u0027t change. Solid rockets burn fuel all the way to the top of the stage through a hollow channel in the segments. This means that adding another segment and making a booster taller increases the surface area being burned, creating a higher thrust level, but because the segment you\u0027ve added also contains more fuel, the burn time is unaffected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022White Owl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022White Owl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENope. SRBs are hollow in the middle, so they burn from the center outward. Longer = more surface area burning = more thrust. Wider = more fuel = longer burn time. Extremely simplified explanation, but that\u0027s pretty much how they work.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, wait, wait. I can\u0027t really agree with you, if you just make a SRB longer it wouldn\u0027t affect only thrust, it would increase the Isp, and, as a disadvantage, its internal pressure (ie chance to explode).
