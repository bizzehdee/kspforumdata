Btw im working on my own parts pack and was hoping for some pointers regarding the tris count from someone as experienced as you. Whats your tris count targets you are working with for the different parts?. They seem quite detailed, im guessing the 3x engine has a tris count of atleast around 12k? Perhaps you are thinking of using them as high poly bases for normalmap generation on a low poly model?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just dont know how high i can go without breaking framerates for most users. For reference most of my models weigh in at around 6k. But the most complicated ones are somewhat higher (im mostly worried about a really complex animated docking port that has just over 10k and an also really complex landing leg with 5k tris each and this is without any of the truss bars. With simple cubic truss bars the tris count goes up to 8k, originally i used 6 sided cylinders for a really high total. Tho i am thinking i could use an alpha channel transparency for them as suggested by nertea. Most other small details can easily be done with normalmaps) my colliders are really simple tho. Usually only totaling around 30-100 tris(can i go much higher?)

I may be working with too high amounts of sides too.. currently using 24 sides for 3.75m parts. 32 sides for 5m parts and clamped it at 48 sides for the rest (mainly because i havent decided on scale yet)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-20T01:56:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2014 01:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
