I use kOS to handle things like landings and launches, and the flight computer for more mundane tasks. In 0.23.5 I played in IVA only and required all unmanned craft to be controlled entirely with the flight computer (plus manual throttle). I had to disable signal delay when I stupidly used RCS based probes around Eve, but did manage to complete a docking with a one second delay (in a polar orbit that only had connection half the time and would also lose it for several days each week). Back then the flight computer didn\u0027t save scheduled commands, executed nodes at the node instead of half before, and couldn\u0027t point toward a target if you targeted a docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESignal delay is certainly doable, but not always fun.
