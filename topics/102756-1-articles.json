I use kOS to handle things like landings and launches, and the flight computer for more mundane tasks. In 0.23.5 I played in IVA only and required all unmanned craft to be controlled entirely with the flight computer (plus manual throttle). I had to disable signal delay when I stupidly used RCS based probes around Eve, but did manage to complete a docking with a one second delay (in a polar orbit that only had connection half the time and would also lose it for several days each week). Back then the flight computer didn\u0027t save scheduled commands, executed nodes at the node instead of half before, and couldn\u0027t point toward a target if you targeted a docking port.\n\nSignal delay is certainly doable, but not always fun. I\u0027d say to do whatever is actually fun for you."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T14:47:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks guys!\n\u003E I understand why he did (I\u0027m almost doing the same, maybe not for the same reasons).\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m about to exit Kerbin SOI and I wanted to see how experienced players deal with signal delay (Flight Computer falls short and kOS is too hard for someone who has little free time to play).\n\u003E \n\u003E So, how do YOU deal with signal delay? ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI disable the delay simy because I don\u0027t want to have to learn how to use KOS.
