That may put a few people off.\n\nWell, if I was new, I\u0027d rather know the truth than a marketing lie. If I was doing a video series on KSP, I\u0027d rather let people know it\u0027s hard so that they don\u0027t go spend their money and think it\u0027s gonna be easy. People who want a hard game might also be turned away thinking it\u0027s easy. Also, showing that it\u0027s hard keeps the riff-raff out of the forums. N0ot the new guys who are genuinely interested and want to learn, but the trolls and the 9-10 year olds who just want people to do everything for them so that they don\u0027t have to learn."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T15:17:05Z","Content":"His progress seems to be too slow.

KSP videos by him, Robbaz, and other rare uploaders I tend to like, but videos from channels that are dedicated to or upload a majority of KSP videos I don\u0027t like very much. Of course, that\u0027s just my opinion, but I think he\u0027s doing a pretty good job of keeping a good mix of things so that everybody has something that they watch and like on a regular basis."},{"CreatedByName":"Candlelight","CreatedById":203979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T21:33:00Z","Content":"The list of my top 5 KSP players on Youtube:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
