It is the non-scientifically minded that are most vulnerable to this, and since the actually-scientifically-minded do not appear to get a larger say in these matters, teaching these things to otherwise-skilled people is incredibly important if we want to live in a science-enabled world, and not one of arbitrary, emotional choices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe above should not be taken as derogatory to those mentioned that are not-scientifically-minded, equal merit goes to people of all types of intelligence.
