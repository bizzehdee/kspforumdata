Someone wanted to distribute compressed versions of my part textures, but since I was overhauling the parts to use a common texture map (and UVs would get updated/moved around/reworked on an irregular basis), I privately told him to wait until I\u0027ve finalized my overhaul. He agreed to do so privately, but then announced publicly the very next day that he was going to do it anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I pointed this out to him, he claimed that my licence permitted him to do so with or without my permission, and that he was \u0022saving me the effort\u0022. My counterpoint was that the major changes I was implementing would render his optimizations completely useless and outdated. As it happened, he went ahead anyway, just as I released a dev build of my overhaul, and indeed, his \u0022optimizations\u0022 became obsolete almost immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day, it\u0027s better to ask nicely and honor the decisions of the original add-ons\u0027 authors, instead of re-interpreting/exploiting permissive licenses to one\u0027s personal advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems that the redistributor in question got what he had coming for not heeding your sound advice.

This comes with a caveat though- As a mod author, if you would like to require people do that, choose a license that protects your rights and projects your requirements. If you do not(utilize a restrictive license), and you still wish for people to ask permission, you are doing yourself a great disservice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally would be using a permissive license if/when I decide to create mods, but I will be doing so knowing full well what said license permits, and being fully okay with anything that it does allow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the open source/permissive licenses of mods in KSP is a great thing that should be held in high regard; Although, the way people were/are talking about the use/abuse of their mods and licenses just doesn\u0027t make sense to me. It is, after all, your mod and you are responsible for selecting a license that represents what you wish fully, so why get bent out of shape when someone follows the license to the letter? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly, to address the last sentence quoted: I can not agree more.

The KSP modding community is built around modders helping each other, sharing code, and using existing codebases to show new modders how it\u0027s done.

As a result of this, most modders are more than willing to make their mods very open source, to allay any licence issues and provide a good, open resource. When issues arise due to inconsiderate abuse of these licences, modders are forced to either ignore it and do nothing, or lock the licence down so that nobody can access it, which turns it into a legal swordfight and makes everything become more hostile, which in the end hurts the community.
