(I enjoyed \u0027renegotiating\u0027 a contract when I realized landing 6000 units of liquid fuel on the Mun is less fun than the 6000 kg I though I had agreed to, simply by editing the entry in the savefile.) \u00A0I came here to see how people make the technology tree work for them. \u00A0My favorite idea now is a variant of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139376-thought-4411572-or-rd-actually-rd/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eactual\u00A0R\u0026amp;D\u003C/a\u003E but with _recently-unlocked_ nodes being considered the prototypes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am requiring myself to sufficiently use parts on each node of the tree before I unlock the next node. \u00A0Each science point, reputation star, and each 1000 funds, gives a point of experience to the nodes containing parts on the vessel that returned the data or completed the contract. \u00A0When the points add to the science points designated for that node (or, honestly, whatever I feel sufficient) I consider that technology \u0027established\u0027\u00A0and can cheat-unlock the following node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I was building a mechanism into the game to do the accounting, I might divide the science \u002B reputation \u002B money/1000 equally among the part-types on the craft completing the contract, or recovered with the science, plus those on the launch vessel with the mission-completing craft\u0027s launchID. \u00A0Earning 20 science points on a craft involving an engine from a non-established node, one fuel tank, one capsule, four decouplers, and four boosters, would give 4 points of experience to the node of that engine, and probably waste the other 16 points on nodes that are probably already established; that dilution of experience to\u00A0each node as craft get complex might allow all nodes to have the same cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow instead of taxiing an aircraft and touching its wheel to each KSC building, I am figuring out how to incorporate survey-scanners on rescue trips and get them to survive to landing---slightly less silly, and more fun for me. \u00A0 This gives me the logical way of earning the next technology that the thread-starter wants, where the unlocking experiments mentioned at the start of this thread can be anything of perceived value (reputation or funds or science) that I choose to do using parts from the nodes prerequisite to the one I am researching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course it would be nicer if choosing science as my perceived-value activity required fewer mouse-clicks (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/141235-making-science-more-fun/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Emaking science more fun\u003C/a\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: paying for technology with time and money, I could try increasing buy-in cost for new parts, and giving myself free\u00A0science, but I suspect that will remove the sense of earning the new parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: the value of Kerbin calendar time, accomplishing stuff in a reasonable amount of Kerbin time feels to me like it _should_ be a goal, so now I am building more bases while my mapping probe (ScanSat is my first mod) is on its way to Duna. \u00A0 I do think a mechanism requiring me to complete enough contracts to support KSC and pay salaries, would give a natural game-reward for giving consideration to Kerbin-time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-18T18:33:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2016 06:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by OHara\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
