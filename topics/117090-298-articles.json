They are all resizable and have various adapter options.\n\nThere should be:\n\nMFT-A (Kerolox, Hydrolox, Cryo, Framed) (4 variants, 16 lengths each = 64 fuel tanks)  \n\nMFT-D (Soyuz) (1 variant, 4 lengths = 4 fuel tanks)  \n\nMFT-S (Spherical/Framed) (2 variants, 4 lengths each = 8 fuel tanks)  \n\nMFT-R (Radial, stock models) (3 variants, 1 length each = 3 fuel tanks)  \n\nMFT-LV (Octagonal, lander tank) (8 variants, 5 lengths each = 40 fuel tanks)\n\nSo that should give ~119 fuel tank models *for each possible diameter* (of which there are several hundred options).  They should all also have multiple texture set options, most with recoloring support.  All told, SSTU probably has *thousands* of possible fuel tank configurations with just the main model\u002Btop\u002Bbottom adapter support.  Include the multiple diameters, and nearly limitless recoloring capability, and I would guess the possible permutations easily range into the **b**illions (256 colors x 4 channels x 3 sections = 201,326,592 possible color variations *per recolorable model*, and some parts have ~3\u002B recolorable models in them).\n\n(I would dare anyone to try and find another mod that has as much configurability and options with its parts... go ahead and look...  I\u0027ll wait........\\*crickets\\*)  \n\nQuick PBR pass over the docking ports... nothing fancy, almost a direct conversion of existing assets.\n\n![yffdmSO.png](https://i.imgur.com/yffdmSO.png)\n\n\u0027fixed\u0027 the coloring on the red heat-shield.  Still not entirely happy with it, likely going to adjust the honeycomb mesh a bit to be a bit darker.  Apparently SP decided it wanted to keep reverting the colors on me every time I was updating the material out of SD.\n\n![rW3TDlW.png](https://i.imgur.com/rW3TDlW.png)\n\nNote that I\u0027m still working on the base materials for these.  There will be some small bits of wear/damage/etc added to them before I call the fully finished.\n\nHoping to push out an updated release later today with the weeks\u0027 progress in it.  Lots of cleanup, a few fixes, and updated solar-panel shaders.  Just have a couple of bugs to try and track down and squash in TexturesUnlimited before it is all ready.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 minutes ago, jdub3350 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [https://imgur.com/a/2z7Nu](https://imgur.com/a/2z7Nu)....includes pics of my gamedata, and the assets folder I downloaded from the github releases for .144 and .145.  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Edit- I downloaded the master and am gonna copy the assets folder into my install.
