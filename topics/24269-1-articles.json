So are the Kerbal Space Center mission planners finally going to retrieve Desdin from the surface of Eve? Well...no. Although the Kerbal Press occasionally runs stories abou the \u0022poor astronaut left stranded on an alien world,\u0022 the KSC administrators just roll out one of the interviews where Desdin explains that he is quite happy living the life of an interplanetary hermit, especially on a planet free of nosy reporters. And when the Press ran articles suggesting that KSC planners and engineers are simply incapable of building a ship that could escape from Eve, they shrugged those off as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what DID get the KSC mission planners\u0027 attention were some measurements by Desdin that showed that the thick soup in Eve\u0027s seas is unusually rich in the fissile element blutonium, which is necessary for making nuclear rocket engines. Apparently, simple chemical extraction processes can separate the blutonium from the sea \u0022water.\u0022 Happily, the seas are also rich in cadmiumium and boronate (known neutron absorbers), so there is no danger of the seas becoming natural nuclear bombs. Below we see Desdin, our happy colonist on Eve, with the base habitat that was dropped to him in an earlier mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/200UKXS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022200UKXS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot everyone is convinced by Desdin\u0027s reports, of course... Kerbal scientists are still hotly debating Desdin\u0027s claims that the purple chemical staining the surface of Eve is an organic compound that he says must have been deposited as tiny particles excreted from microbes inhabiting an upper region of Eve\u0027s atmosphere. But KSC officials ARE convinced about the blutonium resource, so the mission to build an Eve ascent vehicle was approved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen Scott Manley\u0027s video where he flew a vehicle that landed on Eve and returned to orbit. But his ship depended on launching from a high elevation, and the 10,000-meter plateau he used no longer exists. And, anyway, Desdin and all those seas full of valuable blutonium are at sea level. So I wanted to build a vehicle that could ascend from low elevations...but I also wanted to keep it to a reasonable size (say 100 tons or so) to make it manageable to launch and fly to Eve. But I did use the concept of a massively-asparagused rocket. My basic lander design is shown below (after one of many suborbital test flights over the KSC).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dTQUYFr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dTQUYFr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a stock ship (other than a little MechJeb controller on board), many asparagus stages, and uses mainly aerospike engines. I had not used aerospikes much before because I only started playing KSP after the Great Nerfing Of The Aerospikes. But if you want an engine that can perform well from pressures of five atmospheres to vacuum, the aerospike is a natural choice. More practically, in KSP the aerospikes have lower drag than other engines. The picture below is another test prototype. The side pod (and another on the opposite side) is where all the parachutes are mounted, and one set of landing gear. I intended the fuel in those side tanks to be used for final landing targeting and final braking just before touchdown--and they could be discarded just after liftoff from Eve (or even before if they have no fuel left...the lander can stand on its four remaining legs if it is on a fairly level surface). Dilger Kerman is testing out the ladder system, which requires some tricky navigation, such as using the d key to flip the kerbal\u0027s direction, and having to let go in a couple places so the kerbal can walk on the rungs a little before grabbing another part of the ladder. But none of the ladder parts are connected to the central core stages, where I wanted to minimize weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oIKdFYs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oIKdFYs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran some \u0022computer simulations\u0022 of landing and launching my lander from Eve sea level, only to find out that it was dismally far from being able to make orbit. And then I fell victim to one of the classic blunders (the most famous of which is \u0022never get involved in a land war in Kasia\u0022) of just adding MOAR FUEL, which just made the ship heavier and improved the performance not at all. So by the time I finally gave up on launching from sea level and tried higher launch sites, I was still failing and getting frustrated. The stock aerospike engine really shouldn\u0027t be asked to lift much more than a stack of about 1200 liters of propellant above it. But it turned out that if I went back to my basic design and launched from 4,000 meters elevation, the capsule could reach low Eve orbit. So I needed a 4K-meter launch site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it just so happened that my friend George Gassaway was working on an Eve-return mission, and the lakeshore landing site he chose (with nearby high elevation) happened to be on the opposite shore of the small lake that I had landed Desdin by long ago. So I didn\u0027t even have to scout out a good landing/liftoff site. The highland site is 56 km from Desdin, so we\u0027re not getting him at this time... but KSC Engineering Group Alpha 19 assures mission planners that they will soon have rovers in stock that can easily travel that distance on Eve. So the current mission will just be to test the Eve lander-ascent ship, and to also resupply Desdin with some more consumables, equipment, and an experimental blutonium extraction apparatus. The images below show two different views of the area around Desdin\u0027s base on Eve:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Yk5ZTA1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Yk5ZTA1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gjrnUfI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gjrnUfI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the computer simulations of Eve landings/liftoffs, the KSC planners flew several missions of prototype Eve landers above the KSC to be sure that the parachute system was strong enough -- these involved Milski and Dilger and Rodmy flying suborbital hops with boosted-landers, then ramming them back downward fast and opening the chutes at high speeds in the thick air at 500 meters. Surprisingly, the parachute systems worked perfectly, although we did find out that landing in the ocean is a Bad Thing, since even a ship that lands safely on land can disintegrate when landing in water (although the pilot can survive).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was also determined that the ship gets unstable quickly at even moderate angles of attack. The lack of thrust vectoring on the aerospikes is the problem. The central aerospike was replaced with an LV-T45 engine to give minimal thrust vectoring control, and detachable fins were added to help control the ship during intial boost phase on Kerbin (but it\u0027s still necessary to make the gravity turn VERY gradually or the ship can tumble out of control). The plan was to boost the lander into Kerbin orbit under its own power, then refuel it and push it to Eve...so it had to be stable on boost from Kerbin. I was hoping that boosting from Eve would not have the same control problem because by the time the ship reached turnover altitude at Eve, it would have lost most of it aparagus stalks and would be controllable using the vectoring LV-T45. As we will see, this is not QUITE the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, tests were conducted in Kerbin orbit to see if the fully-fueled lander could be pushed by the interplanetary transfer stage with just the small Junior docking port connecting them. As you see from the GIF below, the results were not pretty. I suppose it COULD have been done, but the constant coning and wobbling was certainly not fuel efficient. Pushing was also tested with the lander empty...but the results were about the same. A stronger connection was needed...so a tricoupler with three full-sized docking ports would be used to link the lander to the transfer stage. (KSP could greatly benefit from a large Rockomax-sized docking ring for connecting large spacecraft pieces in space.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ThooNk4.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022ThooNk4.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK! With all the final equipment assembled, it was time to start the official mission flights. The \u0022Sacagawea Eve\u0022 lander would be boosted into Kerbin orbit with the help of some some jettisonable fins and small aerospike booster stages. As the fuel was used up in each of the asparagas stages, they would NOT be dropped, of course, but would be carried intact to orbit for refueling. The intrepid Milski Kerman was chosen as the pilot for the Sacagawea Eve lander, and below we see the liftoff...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WhYDNKy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WhYDNKy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and then we see the ship tumbling out of control (after the boosters have separated, and the turnover was started at about 10 kilometers. Milski could not regain control of the ship, and it looked like he was going to drop it into the drink, but by firing the engines only when the tumbling/spinning ship was oriented with its nose toward land, Milski managed to get the ship back over kerba firma before popping out all the chutes at low altitude, and landed it on the beach, so it could potentially be refurbished for a future mission. Possibly the addition of the tricoupler docking adapter made the ship more unstable than the earlier test vehicles. Or possibly I just turned too fast even after going on about how important it was NOT to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MEwYeeu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MEwYeeu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zL9v8AL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zL9v8AL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it fell to Adly Kerman to pilot the backup Sacagawea Eve 2 lander on this historic mission. Below we see it boosting on its glowing-hot aerospikes (including the six booster stage aerospikes). I suppose standard SRBs would be cheaper for this purpose, but the KSC engineers got a great deal on a bulk order of aerospikes. And some of the engineers just really LIKED how the aerospikes looked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9crHzVW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229crHzVW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the small booster stages we empty, they were jettisoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ELzNOme.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ELzNOme.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the Sacagawea Eve 2 got above most of the atmosphere, the fins were jettisoned as well. By this time only three of the engines (two aerospikes and the LV-T45) were still firing. The Sacagawea has an ASAS unit attached to the top of one of its tank stacks by a decoupler, since I thought it would help control the fins during the boost, and it can be jettisoned along with its coupler after this point as well...but I didn\u0027t remember to do this until later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i8rPtIt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i8rPtIt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship easily made it into a 120 km orbit with most of the fuel of the central core stage left. Look at those nice, shiny aerospikes. Very nice. Very shiny. Very spiky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i17psBO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i17psBO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up, we need the Mark Zero Interpanetary Transfer Stage (or \u0022IPTS\u0022 for short), which will have the job of pushing the massive (once it\u0027s refueled) Sacagawea E2 to the planet Eve. The ship is made of four nuclear engine side-pods and lots of tanks. There is also a two-kerbal cabin to give Adly a more spacious place to stay during his trip to Eve (assume he moves back and forth between the Sacagawea capsule and the cabin if it alleviates any claustrophobic feelings you have). It will also serve as an emergency backup vehicle for returning Adly to Kerbin orbit, but that is not its intended future disposition. Below, the IPTS is being launched on my standard Mark Twain launch vehicle (since it is debugged and doesn\u0027t explode--although I have come to realize that it is not the most efficient launcher possible...but what did I know a couple months ago when I first designed it?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NotkySQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NotkySQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen came the triple-port docking. I had never done one of those before, but I had seen videos where people described how difficult it was to do because often all three of the ports will not latch on at the same time, so even though it looks like you have a good triple-docking, one or more of the ports will NOT have latched on. So I made this docking VERY carefully. I aligned the Sacagawea to point its docking ports straight north so that I could align the IPTS pointing straight south. I switched back and forth as needed to get the ships rotated around their longitudinal axes to exactly the same angle. I very slowly nudged the IPTS left, right, up, and down a short distance away until I had cancelled all relative motion. And then I slowly slid the ships together. Very slowly. Then they clicked together with nary a wobble. \u0022Like a glove!\u0022 as kurtjmac would say...assuming you have three fingers. And all three of the ports had solid dockings (you can tell by right-clicking on the ports to see if they have the \u0022undock\u0022 option available). Whew. I did use over half of the RCS fuel in the Interplanetary Transfer Stage to do this docking... I probably should have given it a bigger RCS load, but that would not be a problem because of the next step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1oKdF7e.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221oKdF7e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext we need to refuel the Sacagawea. I had recently built an improved asparagus-staged tanker rocket (my previous tankers had used the not-very-efficient Mark Twain launcher). Each of these \u0022Tanker 7\u0022 ships carries 8000 liters of fuel/oxidizer, and 1500 liters of monopropellant. I had intended smaller ships to rendezvous and dock with the Tanker, but in this case the Tankers were the smaller ships, so they did the rendezvous and docking. Each Tanker has four Rockomax 24-77 radial engines to nudge it around in orbit, and the central core of its booster rocket typically has fuel left to do the preliminary rendezvous maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lXWTkDG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lXWTkDG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took two Tanker 7 ships to refuel the very thirsty Sacagawea E2 ship, and the fuel tanks and RCS tanks of the IPTS were also topped off (but a lot of unused RCS fuel was wasted when I deorbited the expended Tankers).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DxKW0v3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DxKW0v3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/va8bkjK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022va8bkjK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final ship for this mission was the Mark Twain Eve 2, a modified version of my standard interplanetary exploration spacecraft. On board are Commander Kurt Kerman, Lewis Lander pilot Rodmy Kerman, and placeholder Rondorf Kerman. This version of the Mark Twain had two nuclear side-pods, and carried only one standard lander (the Lewis lander on the right side in the picture below). It also carried a non-standard lander (on the left below) that would be dropped to Desdin on Eve. This \u0022Eve Base 2\u0022 lander contained (or so I imagine) more consumables and replacement parts for Desdin\u0027s Eve Base environmenal recycling systems, as well as a prototype blutonium separation apparatus. There was also a greater variety of seeds for Desdin\u0027s small hydroponic garden since the only things that grew well from his first batch of seeds were the beans and onions, and he was getting tired of those being a major portion of his diet. (When asked by reporters why he would not be visiting Desdin on Eve, Adly pointed out that while Eve\u0027s atmosphere may or may not be toxic, he was pretty sure that the air inside Desdin\u0027s habitat was unbreathable by now because of his diet.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lI343KX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lI343KX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have noticed the goofy-looking single-kerbal capsule sitting on top of the Mark Twain\u0027s docking port. Sadly, this had to be included because of the odd astronauts\u0027 union rules that require that all kerballed 3-kerbal capsules MUST be launched with a full crew compliment. Hopefully this rule will be changed in the future. I suppose it\u0027s there to ensure that the kerbalnauts get more mission time. Anyway...below we see Rondorf transferring from the main capsule of the Mark Twain to the small capsule on top...once he got done playing around flying his rocket pack all over, that is. Come on, guy, we have a mission to do here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QeQdvCP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QeQdvCP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce on board the single-kerbal capsule, Rondorf separated the capsule and used the RCS system to do a retrograde burn to deorbit the capsule and return to Kerbin, thereby enhancing the mission by his lack of presence, leaving an empty seat for Adly to be carried home in. There *is* a station in orbit with single-kerbal return capsules that could have been used to return Rondorf, but I was lazy and wanted to avoid another rendezvous and docking, so I used the little add-on escape capsule of the front of the Mark Twain instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BYlCjyW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BYlCjyW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k94v0MC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k94v0MC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut let\u0027s get cracking here! Below is the Eve-transfer orbit I plotted for the Sacagawea/IPTS. Don\u0027t be concerned about the lack of an Eve encounter on the left side of the plot -- this is because of the difference in orbital inclinations of Kerbin and Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RFScgZU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RFScgZU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with four nukes pushing the massive collection of fuel, tanks, and engines, the trans-Eve injection burn (requiring a 994 m/s change in velocity) took a little over 13 minutes. But the triple-docking connection was nice and steady. Steady like a glove! Or whatever. In the picture below, the IPTS has already expended and dropped its rear fuel tank. Oh, and here\u0027s an important point I learned in the early orbital tests of the prototype landers: Remember to deactivate all of the engines on the Sacagawea before you start this burn. If you are smart, you\u0027ll set up an action group to toggle all of those engines on and off. If you are like me and really meant to get around to doing that, but never quite remembered to do so when you were in the VAB, you can right-click on all of the motors individually to deactivate them. Because it\u0027s more fun that way. Yeah...that\u0027s my excuse. In addition to depleting the fuel in the rear tank, the IPTS also used 71% of the fuel in the two X200-16 side tanks. It takes a lot of fuel to move around all that fuel in the Sacagawea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yUaFdkO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yUaFdkO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than waiting a couple days before sending off the Mark Twain, I performed its trans-Eve injection almost immediately, trusting to the likelihood that differences in trajectory would result in them arriving at Eve a couple days apart. The Mark Twain had only two nukes, but because of its considerably lower mass its 998 m/s burn took only 9 minutes 30 seconds, and only used up 60% of the fuel in its rear tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vMzMJcZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vMzMJcZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe slightly faster trajectory of the Mark Twain meant that it reached the descending node of its orbit (relative to Eve\u0027s) first, and below we see the midcourse plane-shift/correction burn that Commander Kurt plotted. And, with a little help from the RCS afterwards, Kurt adjusted the Eve encounter for a perfectly fitting 69 km periapsis. Like a glove. The burn required 371 m/s of delta-V and took just over 3 minutes, leaving the rear tank 23% full. An interesting thing to note about this plot is the dotted line showing the trajectory that the Mark Twain would follow if it did not brake at Eve, which passes quite close to Moho\u0027s orbit. But timing such a gravity assist to arrive when Moho was actually there would be tricky. The midcourse correction for the Sacagawea/IPTS was similar (370 m/s, taking a little over 4 minutes, and expending the remaining fuel in the two side tanks and 18% of the fuel in the main tank).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sKDh4cX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sKDh4cX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy very sneakily sneaking up on the Sphere of Influence change point as I entered the Eve system, and sneaking across the boundary at 1x time warp, the 69 km periapsis point remained intact. A small burn was required to make the incoming trajectory within a couple degrees of equatorial. The aerobraking at 69 km captured the Mark Twain into an orbit with apoapsis of around 6,500 km. Once the Twain got out to that apoapsis, Kurt did a little burn to raise the periapsis to 110 km, out of Eve\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U0dgtoc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022U0dgtoc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Sacagawea/IPTS entered the Eve system 18 days later, and was coming in retrograde, so a burn was required to shift that to a prograde equatorial trajectory. I wishthere was an easy way to see if an encounter is going to result in a prograde, retrograde, or whatever inclination, from far out. I often can\u0027t tell by looking at the plot.Anyway, that burn used another 19% of the fuel in the IPTS\u0027s main tank. The first aerobraking pass captured the Sacagawea/IPTS into an orbit with apoapsis of 6,800km. A second aerobraking pass resulted in an apoapsis of 1,700 km. A third pass gave 375 km. After a final aerobraking pass and an engine burn, the Sacagawea/IPTSwas in a 130 km x 110 km low Eve orbit, with 57% of the fuel remaining in the main tank of the IPTS. Things were looking good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6j5ESbT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226j5ESbT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4ryWkz7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224ryWkz7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the Sacagawea was safely in orbit, the Eve Base 2 lander was separated from the Mark Twain. Below we see the lander being separated during a near pass to Eve, and Kurt firing the RCS to back away quickly because the imbalance of the lander on the decoupler threatened to rotate its front into the the side of the Mark Twain\u0027s capsule. A couple aerobrakings were used to drop the lander into low Eve orbit, and then it was deorbited to come in over Desdin\u0027s base area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d3uYY1o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022d3uYY1o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe deorbit targeting resulted in the base lander coming in about a kilometer offshore in the lake, but there was still fuel left in the deorbiting stage, so a quick sideways burn at 12 km shifted its landing point to dry land.

Here we see Desdin getting a sample of Eve soup to pour into the experimental separation apparatus back in the base (I\u0027m sure he has a bucket where you can\u0027t see it under the surface). The base module is only powered by an RTG, so the separation will be slow...but it should prove or disprove the concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/omQchVW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022omQchVW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the main show. I was originally going to use the Interplanetary Transfer Stage to deorbit the Sacagawea and put it on a course to land (I figured nobody would mind if I dropped nuclear engines onto a planet with radioactive seas), but instead I added a tank to the design that could be used to hold the necessary deorbiting fuel. Below we see that the Sacagawea has separated from the central standard docking port of the IPTS, taking the tricoupler docking nodes and the retro-burn fuel tank with it. And vanishing all of the struts that braced the IPTS main body to the docking node and tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jkhi6I3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Jkhi6I3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the deorbiting burn. The retro-burn fuel tank is not actually feeding the engines (which were all methodically activated one-by-one before the start of the burn, because action groups are for lazy people...right), but after the retro burn and landing trajectory tweaking, the fuel from the tank was transferred into the two FL-T800 side-pod tanks of the Sacagawea (which had nearly been depleted by the burns).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JQKPixN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JQKPixN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the docking node and retro-fuel tank were discarded, and the Sacagawea was ready for landing.

There are 16 regular chutes in addition to the two drogue chutes. The chutes are arranged to be deployed in pairs in stages to minimize the opening shock, and the side pods that the chutes are mounted on are heavily-strutted to the adjoining fuel tanks to withstand the shocks. No engine firings were used to brake the ship before the parachute openings. At sea level, this many chutes will safely land the fully-fueled ship, but at the 4,000-meter elevation of this landing site, a short blast from the engines was needed just before touchdown to slow the Sacagawea to a landing speed of a couple meters per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gYj35I6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gYj35I6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was a bit worried about Adly being able to navigate the ladder system (since even a short fall under Eve\u0027s 1.7g gravity could be fatal), but he managed them well.

This places it 55.6 kilometers from Desdin\u0027s Eve Base. I suppose I could have had Adly walk that distance to visit Desdin if I wanted to kill some hours in tedium, but any such visits will have to wait until we have proper stock rovers (my RCS-powered Fidos would be woefully inadequate for the task in Eve\u0027s high gravity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yf2xGFF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yf2xGFF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have noticed that the Sacagawea has a QBE probe body mounted on top of one of its fuel tanks. This was included so that the lander could be sent down without a pilot to be able to retrieve a kerbal from the surface. It would not be needed, and would be useless weight during the liftoff, so it was separated from the Sacagawea. The little decoupler did not have enough force to actually blow the probe body away from the ship, but I switched to the probe and used its torque to \u0027walk\u0027 and roll it to the edge of the tank so it could fall to the surface. I expected it to explode upon hitting the surface, but it managed to survive. It will remain operational (during the day time) to mark the landing spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sbuHzHE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sbuHzHE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdly inspects the aerospike engines that he is trusting will return him safely to orbit.

Liftoff with the side-pods (which have no engines) is quite slow, and the first order of business is to make sure the ship is pointed straight up, because you don\u0027t want to start an accidental gravity turn too low in Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere. Sadly, I was unable to fly the ascent without help from MechJeb because I could not react fast enough to keep the ship pointed straight upward while also watching the staging to be sure that the asparagus stages get dropped immediately as they burn out. But with MechJeb\u0027s \u0022Kill Rotation\u0022 function to keep the ship steady (once I got it pointed upward), I was able to fly the ascent. I\u0027m not sure why MechJeb has such an easy job controlling the ship on ascent than I can manage. I understand that it can react faster and anticipate and correct for deviations faster than I can... but it also seems to be able to tap into some hidden wellspring of control authority that I can\u0027t (the ship simply does not respond as quickly for me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ThdTjId.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ThdTjId.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a shockingly brief time the voracious cluster of aerospikes and central engine have sucked the side-pod tanks dry, and the side pods (with the deadweight of all the parachutes and a couple landing legs) are dropped. If I really cared about drag, I would also have retracted the ladders and the landing legs here. None of the parts survived the fall from even this relatively low altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gBeQgQB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gBeQgQB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also isn\u0027t long before the first set of aerospike tank-stacks are dropped, removing some additional landing leg dead weight. And a while after that, the other set of outer tanks is dropped with the last of the legs. We are now down to a vehicle with six aerospikes and the central core, and only some remaining ladder parts as dead weight. Each of the asparagus stages are lasting longer and longer as fewer engines remain to suck fuel from the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Wfub4mx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Wfub4mx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, two more stagings and we get to what I call the \u0022Titan IIIC\u0022 configuration, and the stages are starting to burn for a reassuringly long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zvXBLzc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zvXBLzc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last two aerospikes are dropped at around 31,000 meters.

As a backup, Rodmy was ready to come down with the Lewis Lander from the Mark Twain to rescue Adly if needed (he would dock to the capsule and push it back up to the Twain). As it turned out, the IPTS was able to easily rendezvous with the capsule, although Adly insisted on doing the final docking with the tiny amount of fuel (and no RCS) left in the Sacagawea... which took a little longer than expected, and involved a little unplanned bumping, but which he managed to do in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3ivASCW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223ivASCW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdly transferred from the Sacagawea capsule to the IPTS cabin, and cast off the Sacagewea to remain in it low Eve orbit.

The IPTS probably had enough fuel to return to Kerbin at this point, and certainly would have had enough fuel if Adly docked with one of the two fuel tanks left in an 8,000 km orbit by an earlier Retriever mission... but it would be better to go home with the guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FdiwQf7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FdiwQf7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mark Twain still had plenty of fuel at this point (it even still had fuel in its rear drop tank), so some of that fuel was transferred to the IPTS, which would remain in Eve orbit as a general-purpose space tug. Below we see the Twain separated from the IPTS and jettisoning its now-empty rear fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/it0EmIG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022it0EmIG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as they were in the neighborhood, and since the Lewis Lander hadn\u0027t been required for its role as backup rescue ship, the boys decided to visit Gilly. In the orbit plot below, the innermost ellipse is the 110 x 6,500 km orbit that the Mark Twain came from (and where the IPTS Eve Tug remains for now). The roughly circular orbit tangential to that inner ellipse is the 6,500 x 7,500 km orbit that Kurt put the Twain into so that he could do a plane shift maneuver (which take much less fuel when done from a large orbit). The circular orbit beyond that is the 8,000 km orbit where the two fuel tanks were deposited by the earlier Retriever mission. The dashed line shows the Gilly trasfer orbit, requiring 307.3 m/s of delta-V. All of this delta-V goes toward getting the Mark Twain away from Eve in preparation for its return to Kerbin, so this isn\u0027t just fuel wasted on a side junket. Once the Twain got into a 48 km circular orbit around Gilly, it still had 61% of its main tank fuel remaining. We probably should have left even more with the IPTS tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jGv5TTk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jGv5TTk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith only the Lewis Lander attached to one side (and out on the longer-than-normal decoupler that was required to balance the Eve Base 2 Lander\u0027s attachment), the Mark Twain can only thrust at half power as it burns for Gilly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wZlGe1W.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wZlGe1W.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERodmy hopped into the Lewis Lander to take a trip down to Gilly\u0027s surface.

Here we see him posing on top of the Lewis on the surface of Gilly. He also made some measurements: Surface gravity 00.03 m/s^2...so low it doesn\u0027t even register on the other g meter...temperature -071.84, and, of course, no atmospheric pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HgXrJdI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HgXrJdI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Adly returns and docks the Lewis to the Mark Twain so that it can be refueled (especially with RCS monopropellant) before being left in Gilly orbit.

Desdin LIKED being a space hermit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve itself changed quite a bit during Desdin\u0027s stay on the surface. The image below shows what Desdin\u0027s landing site looked like originally: a nice basin with lots of large lakes. You can see his lander\u0027s marker by one of the lakes.

The lake alongside his landing site (1) had dried up almost completely. So when his second Base Upgrade was sent to him, it was landed by one of the lake remnants (2), and Desdin went there in his rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t6LFj5Y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022t6LFj5Y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven worse for the future chances of rescuing Desdin, the large landing location used in the first Exiting Eve episode (3 on the map above), which had been at over 4,100 meters, had shifted down to 2,000-something meters...which would require a much larger ascent vehicle. A new landing site would be needed (4 on the map...but more about that later).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, just to add insult to injury, when Desdin woke up from hibernation after Beta Storm 0.90 had hit, he found his Base was awash in the lake (which had apparently shifted a little), and his rover was floating in the lake:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xA9ULZk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xA9ULZk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was a serious problem. The wheels of the Base were still touching botom, so it could be driven out of the lake (see below). But the rover was floating, with no purchase for its wheels to allow driving to shore. Desdin needed that rover if he ever wanted to get to an Eve Ascent Vehicle landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R1GzFsK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022R1GzFsK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, the rover that had been sent to Desdin was a version of the Fido K that had been tested on Duna, M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, and Minmus...so it was equipped with RCS. The RCS system was basically useless for driving around on Eve, so it\u0027s monopropellant had never been used. This allowed Desdin to remotely move the rover to shore using the RCS jets until its wheels could touch bottom to drive out the rest of the way.

Eve apparently just didn\u0027t want him there, and was kindly suggesting that he leave. If he ignored the hint, would he one day find that his Base had been totally submerged...or dropped into a chasm? Besides...the whole Blutonium resource processing scheme had turned out to be a bust anyway. So Desdin contacted KSC about returning home to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EEve Express\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineers at KSC hadn\u0027t been idle all the years since the first Eve Ascent mission. They had designed a new, lighter and more capable Eve ascent vehicle using the amazing Rockomax 48-7S engines instead of aerospike engines. This ship, dubbed the Eve Express, had been built and held in storage in case Desdin needed to be rescued. But recently, Rockomax warned the KSC staff that its 48-7S engines MIGHT be having a problem -- some of the alloys used were not aging well, and it might not be advisable to run them at full power beyond what they cryptically named \u0022Date 1.0\u0022 ...so it also happened to be a question of \u0022use it now or never\u0022 that aligned with Desdin wanting to return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1Hx7X7h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221Hx7X7h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oOK93zB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oOK93zB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah Kerman, senior kerbalnaut, seized the opportunity of the \u0022need to rescue Desdin\u0022 to put together a mission plan (which Jeb, of course, would command). The problem was, the KSC launch pad had been booked up up for the next ten months with back to back launches for the Developing Duna project, so there wouldn\u0027t be time to fit in all the launches for Jeb\u0027s mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappily, before the infighting got out of hand, the Duna mission engineers came up with an alternate plan for Jeb\u0027s mission. For example, the Eve Express is designed to operate as a free-standing vehicle...so instead of using the main launch pad, the Eve Express could be serviced in the SPH and carted out to the runway for launch. Below, we see the liftoff of the Eve Express:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/l5uHRvN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022l5uHRvN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb piloted the Eve Express to Kerbin orbit himself. His single-kerbal lander cabin is located deep in the center of the ship, but it was deemed safe enough (for Jeb anyway) to fly it manned because it had a simple abort scheme: Just cut the engines and pop out the two dozen parachutes to land the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Eve Express has 65 Rockomax 48-7S engines firing at liftoff. This required a little throttling back to keep the ship below terminal velocity during the first phase of the boost.

This would require about 2.25 \u0022Orange Tanks\u0022 worth of fuel. Normally I would do this with launches of my standard Reusable Rockets carrying Reusable Refueler craft...but the launch pad was booked, so an alternative was needed. Happily, there were stores of propellant in Kerbin orbit (untouched for many years), so those would be used in this pinch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the on-orbit fuel stores was at Space Station Alpha. Unfortunately, that station was constructed before the invention of Senior Docking Ports, so it was only equipped with Standard ports. An adapter was needed so that the Eve Express could dock with the Station. This job was handled by a Passenger Pigeon SSTO spaceplane. The adapter, consisting of a Senior port, a probe core, a Standard port, and a couple solar panels, was attached to the top of the spaceplane\u0027s fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2cuDFpM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222cuDFpM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Passenger Pigeon has two Turbojets and four 48-7S engines.

There were some high elevations north of Desdin\u0027s Base (the Base location is marked 2 on the map below), but most of those were small areas surrounded by slopes. The landing site chosen is marked on the map with an X. The site is very close to the equator and has a good-sized east-west extent with elevations above 3,200 meters.

We\u0027ll be heading over soon, so a launch window to intercept is coming up.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesdin: \u0022Yes. Ready.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022OK, good buddy. We\u0027ll be waiting for you. The checklist says to remind you to open the sampling vents and activate the air sample filter system.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesdin: \u0022Done. Launching.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt liftoff, with all 65 engines firing, the Eve Express lumbered into the air. Desdin pointed the vehicle straight up and retracted the gear. At about 500 meters above the surface (the surface here is at 3286 meters elevation) the first set of tanks was expended and dropped, taking away the excess weight of two landing legs and the two Advanced Inline Stabilizer reaction wheels (which were included for extra torque to make sure the ship could be pointed quickly to vertical at launch). The next set of tanks was expended and jettisoned at an altitude of 1160 meters above the surface, taking away another set of landing legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KWb5VKA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KWb5VKA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third set of tanks was jettisoned a little over 2100 meters above the surface. The fourth set dropped at about 3420 AGL, taking away the final set of landing legs. The fifth set of tanks left the party at 5304 meters above the surface (8590 above sea level). The ship had gone through a distressingly large amount of fuel by this point, but you\u0027ll notice that the atmospheric pressure indicator is still pegged at the far right:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O7t2Dqm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022O7t2Dqm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next set of tanks dropped at over 8.2 km AGL (11.5 km above sea level). The ship was down to just four side booster tanks, and the air pressure indicator finally began to creep off the Kerbin Sea Level mark, and the stages were beginning to last a reassuringly longer time each. The seventh set of tanks was dropped between 18 and 19 km above sea level. In the last pic of the set of three below, the view was rotated to look South in the direction of Desdin\u0027s Base area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ODXXDb8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ODXXDb8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPitch-over began at 30 km above sea level. The final set of side boosters was expended and jettisoned between around 67 kilometers, and the Eve Express was down to its last stage, a single Rockomax 48-7S engine on an FL-T200 tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b1gr27i.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b1gr27i.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the ship\u0027s trajectory reached an apoapsis of 110 km, the engine was cut. A circularization burn of about 115 m/s was required at apoapsis...and Desdin was safely in orbit! In fact, the remnant of the Eve Express had over 1000 m/s of delta-V remaining. That being the case, Desdin handled the rendezvous maneuvers to meet up with the Jeb\u0027s ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U9ns8is.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022U9ns8is.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022Yo, Des. That\u0027s a nice little ship you have there. It was a lot bigger the last time I saw it. Do you want me to handle the docking, since I have RCS and you don\u0027t?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesdin: \u0022No. Point at me.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with Jeb helping by simply keeping the nose of his ship pointed at the Eve Express, Desdin brought his ship in for docking. After 24 years, Desdin was back with friends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2dDvSyK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222dDvSyK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X58GMNV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022X58GMNV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuccess! And unlike my previous Eve Ascent Vehicle, which I couldn\u0027t fly to orbit without some help from MechJeb to keep the ship vertical during the initial boost, I was able to get the Eve Express into orbit unaided. Part of this was due to the fact that we now have the Z key for instant-full-thrust (the old ship could pick up a lot of deadly sideways motion during the gradual throttle-up of the old days). Also, the 48-7S motors have thrust vectoring that the aerospikes of the old version did not. Plus, with a couple proper torque wheels to help, and it was easy to get the ship going in the correct vertical direction without lots of wasted delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I checked back at the liftoff site, there were some debris explosions...but when those settled down the only remaining debris from the fallen boosters was a landing leg and a 48-7S engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lMLfFpP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lMLfFpP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesdin transferred over to the Interplanetary Habitat ship with his decades of samples and data, and the Eve Express was cast off to remain in Eve orbit. As long as Jeb, Dilger, and Desdin were going to have to wait around several hundred days for the next transfer window to return to Kerbin, they went to visit Gilly. This required a burn of 1111 m/s to push their apoapsis out to Gilly\u0027s orbit, a 55 m/s burn to match planes with Gilly\u0027s orbit, a 347 m/s burn to arrange an intercept by raising their periapsis the correct amount, and a 355 m/s burn to match orbital velocity of Gilly and get into a slow orbit around the tiny moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HpOOGcG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HpOOGcG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey then separated the habitat modules (the bottom part of which was the old Vall lander) and took that part of the ship down to the surface of Gilly. Some of their vacation photos are shown below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GQpwUE6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GQpwUE6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RGtrT5z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RGtrT5z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/67lV5yO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002267lV5yO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JmxWmqc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JmxWmqc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DurMgJ4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DurMgJ4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s where I\u0027ll leave our intrepid explorers for now, since I have a lot of things to do in my Developing Duna mission before the transfer window arrives for the return trip from Gilly to Kerbin.
