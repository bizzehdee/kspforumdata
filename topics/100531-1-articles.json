You need to install either the MapResourceOverlay to see it in map view, like Kethane does.\n\nYou may also install ScanSat along side MRO or in place of it. In this case you must send up satellites to map the moon/planet first so you can see where it is. MRO has an option to \u0022enable ScanSat\u0022 so it only shows you what has been mapped already."},{"CreatedByName":"88tpm","CreatedById":134609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T18:52:32Z","Content":"Thanks for the help ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) You need to install MRO mod to even see the hot spots via the orange spheres off the KA-100 scanner?
