I still want this to happen. But I was thinking adding a new stat like Brake and Authority limiter could be added to all wing parts. It would allow max sweep. By default it would be 0. B adding more you can use hotkeys to sweep the wings.. Maybe even hold the hotkey to sweep how much you want. It would have a sweep forward and backwards button/keycombo. It could also be an action group option if needed. I would think a gui with keyboard shortcut keys like CTRL-Z and CTRL-Y would work though. This is so the undo/redo button combos have use in flight. You could use Action group to set it to full sweep forward or back and hold the other buttons to sweep it partially. Also preset sweep ammounts could be used to have mid sweep values with accuraly. Maybe a gui thing with \u002B/- button and a value you can enter. This could take any value up to your max setting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe implement the sweeping they could add a new joint.
