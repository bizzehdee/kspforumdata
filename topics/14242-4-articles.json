I guess that works, but then you have to adjust the liquid fuel capacity since you\u0027ll be overfueled if you don\u0027t and either won\u0027t make orbit or will be able to way out perform what you want. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the \u0022unsure if can ignite in space\u0022 I know that\u0027s what was given officially, but the guys at LMCO said that the records didn\u0027t support that to the point that the original X-11 models and several X-12\u0027s were launched without the sustainer engine into stable orbits (using the boost engines alone). They felt the system could have easily launched SSTO without the booster engines and instead using a second sustainer (much as the Atlas III and Atlas V do) to carry out the entire launch and throttling back the engines to produce the same acceleration curve as they would have with the boost engines or using an expanding nozzle (which had already been done on several Solid-fueled rockets) to provide maximum thrust efficiency throughout launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrPwner","CreatedById":23671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T22:01:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I was under the impression that the booster stage engines were solid fueled \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I\u0027ve checked Encyclopedia Astronautica before, but only looked for measurements and picture material \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Good thing you brought it to my attention!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be a liquid fuel though, give both engines their own fueltank and it won\u0027t cause problems.

It provided a much simplified system which was thought to enhance reliability (which it did, but not as much as they thought it would). However, what it really did was provide 2 different nozzles. The boost engines (actually 1 engine with 2 combustion chambers and nozzles) provided thrust optimized for lower atmospheric flight while the sustainer engine provided thrust through a much larger divergent bell designed for upper atmospheric and vacuum flight. However early on this caused a problem as the turbopumps failed on a regular basis and then manifolds iced up, causing failures because the cause wasn\u0027t fully understood.
