Being an engineer and \u0022creatively lazy\u0022 I tend to make modular ships from common sub-components and assemble in orbit. One of my design components is a Drive / Service section using a 3.75m thermal nozzle, 3.75m basic nuke reactor, 3.75m generator, 3.75m x 8m NP LFO tank, 3.75-2.5m LFO adapter tank, 2.5m probe core and 2.5m docking port. This has appropriate RCS, monoprop, radiators, etc appended to the side. I dock this to whatever \u0022payload module\u0022 I\u0027m using.

Does the resource manager balance DUF6 across all available \u0022tanks\u0022? This isn\u0027t a problem for my 3 lab orbital stations which are permanently docked to their drive sections, but I fear it might cause problems for my lander modules which take the Kiwi full of UF6 and half full of DUF6 with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T01:27:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022localSol\u0022 data-cite=\u0022localSol\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFractal_UK : Great plugin, I reduced most of the textures in this pack and converted any pngs to tga, and also resized any existing tgas.
