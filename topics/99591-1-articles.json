We discovered these masscons when we first started lunar exploration and found that low orbits around the Moon are not stable.

Why? Because it takes a massive change in velocity to significantly affect the orbital plane, but only a tiny change is required to switch a low orbit into an orbit that intersects the surface. Thus, you could narrow your search down to within a narrow strip centered on the last known orbital plane, ruling out almost all of the impacts since 1969. It\u0027s probably near-to-certain that there were no natural impacts as large as the LM would have been, within that narrow strip since 1969. ADDITIONALLY, you could rule at all impacts that appeared to have come in from a high angle. The impact the LM would have made would have been a grazing impact.
