Okay, so it\u0027s not exactly what you\u0027d see in the real world \u003Cem\u003Eall the time\u003C/em\u003E but considering that the ground is likely very rocky and quite solid considering all the abuse we put it though and it still looks perfect, sparks kinda make sense there. I think it\u0027s all fake grass anyway. The KSC would be a complete and utter mess of a bog by now if it were real. My theory is that all the grassy terrain on Kerbin is actually a false surface that hides Kerbin\u0027s subterranean population. Rather than try to house them all in true subterranean dwellings, the administration of population control (of which the KSC is a major member of, if you consider all the kerbals being removed from the over-population statistics on the hourly basis in horrible aircraft and spacecraft related experiments) decided to encase the entire surface of the planet (at least the habitable parts) in an artificial sphere made to resemble an untouched and perfect planetary surface. This could also explain how such alrge parts can be built and assembled at the KSC without any perceivable assembly plants and other production systems in place to prepare the materials. The solution is that the entire production system is actually underground... which means that the part of the VAB that we can see is really the very tip of a huge building where only the very top is poking through the shroud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot prove any of this though... so I\u0027ll just have to shoot any one of you who disagrees with me.
