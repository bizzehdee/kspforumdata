I could manage to figure out the modeling but the coding is what\u0027s gonna hurt me so I would like to get some assistance. I know kerbolquest already does something like this but i was thinking of a whole RPG-ish experience. of course some exclusive, yet expeimental gear, will be given to the three originals. I\u0027ll post models here anyway once i get some drawn up for your consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
