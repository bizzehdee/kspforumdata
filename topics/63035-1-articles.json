Cmon guys doesnt that sound sexy a nice clean mod forum thread. I know most of the major mods are named like its those bunch of others driving my OCD mad, sometimes I wish I had the l33t h@x0r skills to break into the forum and fix this. jk lol.

Basically the header and the footer. They could really be in any order, its just hard when you dont know the last update date, expecially with the mods that are in heavy development with frequent releases. Leave you with the problem was my last update 1.3.4.5 or 1.3.4.6. I need to go find my mods folder, find the version number buried in the changelog which could be anywhere in the mods folder structure. I know first world problems, now Im off to fight world hunger... with roundhouse kicks. Also thank you for Kethane Majiir, also for your continued development of KAS.
