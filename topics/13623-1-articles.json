By planning your Munar Insertion properly, it is possible to use even less fuel. But those details will be for another time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce a rough landing site has been chosen, wait until your orbit has taken you to the opposite side of the Mun from it. Burn retrograde to bring your Periapsis (Pe) as low as you feel comfortable while still above the terrain (this will likely be a guess so don\\\u0027t worry too much about precision here). Flip back to prograde then wait until Pe, watching the terrain ahead of your craft to avoid an unscheduled (and destructive) landing and to locate a desirable landing site. Nearing Pe, you should be almost pointed retrograde. Find your landing site and be ready to finish turning retrograde (if you haven\\\u0027t already) and burn off your horizontal velocity. Since each lander design will require different burn times to eliminate horizontal velocity, you\\\u0027re going to have to make a best guess about when to begin. Toward the end of the burn, when most of your horizontal velocity has been reduced, the retrograde marker on the NavBall will begin to climb toward \u002B90\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E vertical. At this point you may want to reduce throttle and pitch over to keep up with the retrograde marker, making sure to reduce thrust enough that you are still losing altitude. Ideally, this \u0027reverse gravity turn\u0027 will have you pointed vertical by the time you\\\u0027re just about to land. From here, simply control your descent rate to suit the limits of your lander and you should be on the ground with plenty of fuel left (asuming you brought enough in the first place \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EWhere Do We Go From Here?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\\\u0027ve been reading the posts in this challenge, you should already be aware that the discussion has shifted toward the Insertion phase of Mun missions.
