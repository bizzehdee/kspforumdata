I was watching Scott Manley\u0027s vids and he was playing some old space game called Sundog and it rang a bell, along with being an atmospheric phenomenon. Anyway, I\u0027m just making this post since I have a bit of work to actually show and almost have what I need for the groundwork of the parts completely laid out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did some work on converting NovaPunch to .16 standards before I knew Tiberion was going to be doing it, and it got me interested in making my own parts pack that was more in line with the stock parts from both an aesthetic and functional standpoint. I also have some ideas in mind for specialized engines and capsule combos for .17 in getting to specific planets/return trips without being OP for generic missions. For now I\u0027m just going to put up some images of stuff I\u0027ve worked on, although almost all of the models for the engines are different and some of the textures have been changed. I\u0027ll post some small changes below each image of the engines and I should have updated ones tomorrow since I need to reshape some parts and rework the UV maps to accommodate the changes made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are all 1M engines at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aPcIq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aPcIq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPardon the paragraph below, but it summarizes basically everything that needs to be worked on with the textures. For this engine I still have a few bracing bars and \u0022joint\u0022 bits to add in, but overall I\u0027m pleased with the concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a triple-nozzle engine that has the best versions of the textures applied to it so far. I took screenshots of the parts from this angle to show the bit of work I need to do on them to make the blending at the edges more seamless. It\u0027s a pretty simple fix that I have already worked out how to do, but just haven\u0027t gotten around to doing it yet: copy and flip from one side, apply it to the opposite and blend it at the new seam where I don\u0027t have to worry about edges. The \u0022caution tape\u0022 is the other major part that needs work, but I mostly threw that together quickly just to see how it would look with the engines so they look similar to the stock parts. The pack is going to be using an orange/white/grey scheme and the tanks (I may do a single 3m engine and tank as a heavy lift module, but for now I\u0027m going to stick with 1m and 2m) will be colored to differentiate stages as is done IRL. There will be at least 2, and possibly 3 different sizes for each tank, except for larger than 2m which will have the one meant for heavy lifting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E66bF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022E66bF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the first engine I worked on that I applied the textures to. I was happy with the way the outside and inside of the nozzle looked, but dissatisfied with the fuel lines and yellow ball part that really serves no purpose other than breaking the part up a bit. I worked on some more metal-colored textures (3 or 4 different values) and radial versions of them to apply to circular parts so they blend better with the parts around them while differing enough to differentiate them. I expanded the joints where the fuel lines connect and have to apply the new metal colors to them as seen in the first image. I also lightened the texture of the fuel line and played with the scaling on it and unwrapping of it so it looked better/similar to the stock parts and that difference can also be seen in the first image. The nozzle on this engine has also been reshaped and the new version of the model isn\u0027t shown because I have to reshape the other parts around it, which I haven\u0027t done yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xwNuT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xwNuT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis engine has a smaller vertical profile and is intended as an additional lander engine. As I said, these parts are intended to run alongside, but not replace the stock parts and I feel an additional lander engine would be useful for heavier payloads. The changes made to this that are not seen are a nozzle reshaping (I showed the untextured images on reddit and it was suggested to reshape some of them so they abide by our guidelines IRL more, so I obliged since I was asking for feedback) and extrusion of the fuel line and bracing joints so they have a more physical feel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LGTAC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LGTAC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust another engine. I might nix this as a 1m engine and bump it up to 2m since I don\u0027t want to crowd the parts as packs like NovaPunch have sort of done. It\u0027s great to have variety, but you really only need so much for each stage and I want to provide variety, but keep utility in mind so parts do not become unnecessary or unused. Each engine will have a specific purpose and I\u0027ve worked enough with configs and testing when I converted the NP to .16 values that I feel I can achieve this. Again, this engine has had its nozzles slightly reshaped and the joint extruded to give it more character.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qKTFB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qKTFB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal engine I\u0027ll be showing in this first post. I need to add a few fuel lines/connectors and the joints have been extruded for aesthetics. Nothing special to note here besides it needs a few small touches to finish it off, and the nozzles have been reshaped as on all of the other engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s it for this first post, even if it\u0027s a lot of text. I still have a bit of small work to do on each engine in regards to tweaks and have yet to decide upon a texture for the tops where they will connect to the tanks. I\u0027ve yet to import any of these into unity, though I have downloaded it but not the KSP part tools. I\u0027ve seen some stuff on doing that and it doesn\u0027t seem overly complex, but any help would be much appreciated. I\u0027m also going to be doing some small radial engines, adapters and SRBs, but the modeling for them will be cake compared to the engines with the experience I\u0027ve gained in my short time. The biggest hurdle is getting the textures sorted out so I can just copy/paste everything onto the UV files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I\u0027m happy with what I\u0027ve gotten so far and will have fun making the pack. I\u0027d be interested in working with a coder for some purpose-built stuff for the interplanetary missions we will undoubtedly be carrying out if anyone out there is looking for a willing modeler/texturer. I know what I have here is pretty preliminary, but better and more complete stuff should be finished by tomorrow night and I\u0027ll post the updated images of the parts tomorrow night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers and all that and if you can give me some guidance on getting these things into unity it would be much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-16T05:05:58Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2012 05:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by wildkittyv1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dishycourier","CreatedById":35171,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-16T05:25:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESaw your post on reddit a few days ago.

Nothing crazy got done today as I was busy watching some football. Engines are in the same order sans the one I posted first in the initial post since that didn\u0027t change. Just wanted to get these up so people can get a better idea of what the engines look like. The same problems with seams apply and some colors of textures will change. In regards to fuel lines that circle all the engine nozzles, I will likely taper them off on the side opposite where they connect so they mirror real life a bit better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qlrL5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qlrL5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing much to say about this one other than I need to move the orange stripe - put it in the wrong place. I was undecided on whether I wanted the joints/connectors for the fuel lines to be dark or light colored, so I tried both and I think I like the lighter color better, so it shows up more in the next images.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rOgLh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rOgLh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForgot to extend the bottoms of the fuel lines on this one, but it\u0027s no biggie. I\u0027ll probably add a circling fuel line to this since it\u0027s the only one lacking it at the moment. You can see the reshaped nozzle, which caused the short lines in that one spot. Experimented with a dark brown to break up the color a bit and I generally am pleased, but something weird is going on with the support braces there so I\u0027ll probably have to remodel the parts because I just can\u0027t get them to take the texture for some reason regardless of what I do. Will likely change the color of the 2nd \u0022tier\u0022 so it\u0027s a bit darker for contrast, and will probably change the color of the joints on the vertical piece to the right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4J6PT.png\u0022 alt=\u00224J6PT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty happy with this one so far, but the braces will likely be reshaped and connected in some way as they look a little frail to me at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LaZUU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LaZUU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally happy with this one, too, but I\u0027ll be fiddling with the textures on the little ball parts on the right side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z12DR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022z12DR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick example of a tank I threw together. It looks squatty and I wouldn\u0027t use as many vertical (if any) stripes on a tank this size (1m x 1m) - those will likely be reserved for the longer tanks. I\u0027m considering making the 1m tanks have an orange base with grey/white accents and having the 2m tanks use the white base with orange and grey accents. I plan on this because if I do indeed add a 3m heavy-lift stage, I plan on making it entirely orange with small white/grey accents to give it some color and a lot of rockets I\u0027ve seen images of have solid color initial stages and I like the way it looks over a mostly white/black color scheme. I\u0027ll probably add some accent pieces to each tank to give them some character so they\u0027re not just bland cylinders; these are what will likely take the grey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, just some image updates tonight. I\u0027ll probably model some SRBs tomorrow since they\u0027re much simpler than engines. I\u0027ve got some ideas in mind for some stuff I can do pretty quickly and I\u0027ll hammer out a color scheme for the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cby","CreatedById":26505,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-17T06:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehmm, I\u0027m bookmarking this page.

I\u0027m fairly happy with how they turned out, but all of them will be updated with small details like bolts/seams and panels to give them a bit of character because they look quite boring at the moment. The reason I\u0027m tossing these up is to get some feedback on the color scheme as I have it at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m looking for from anyone who cares to comment is if you think the caps on the top of the SRBs should stay or go. I want the pack to work alongside the stock parts, so they\u0027re not going to be super powerful or anything (the tank capacities and weights are going to mirror stock stuff and engine ISPs will be based on stock ISPs as wel and follow the same pattern), but I want a standard style rocket to be possible (large first stage with two SRBs, then taper off to smaller upper stages), so they will be more powerful (but much heavier) than the stock stuff. I don\u0027t think SRBs should have stuff stacked on top of them, but if you guys seem to want them without caps (and I can model caps that can be placed on top of them if the user chooses), then let me know. I just don\u0027t want to clutter the parts folders like large parts packs like NovaPunch have done. This is why I\u0027m uploading them with very basic textures. I may also add small pipes the way I have with the engines, but as of right now the SRBs are all one contiguous piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked up what I could regarding real life SRBs and used some blueprint style photos as background images and I did my best matching the angles of the caps to them. They still seem a little off to me, but that might just be because it\u0027s in Blender and not the game where I have other parts to compare it to for scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, time for the images. Measurements listed are width (diameter) by height (NOT counting the engine nozzle - all nozzles on the SRBs will be smaller in height than the engine nozzles I roughly think they should be used with).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6LcAv.png\u0022 alt=\u00226LcAv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a 1m by 5.5m SRB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe detail image is to show that the orange/grey stripes at the bottom do have a profile and are not just random strips of color, and that the dark metal bands that appear on the SRB also have height to them. I may lessen the vertical length of them, but keep their protrusion size so that it seems more dramatic and shows up better - I\u0027ll have to get the parts into the game first and see how they look with the lighting engine. I didn\u0027t see any SRBs with the rounded cap, but I like the way it looks and I want the SRBs to vary at least a small bit from each other. This model also has the light grey rounded by beneath the orange/grey peaks as I saw that feature on the interior of the SRB skirt on a few images I Googled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s86cV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022s86cV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis SRB is .75m by 4m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one would be slightly more powerful than the new, larger stock SRB added in .16. The detail shows that the stripes and bands on the part do have a profile and aren\u0027t just strips of color. This model used the more common skirt I saw, just receding into the part and then having the nozzle protrude from that. I\u0027m not sure on the shape of the cone, but I modeled it after a blueprint of another SRB and fit it as closely as possible. It might just be the contrast, but it\u0027s something I\u0027ll have to see in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cm9jA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cm9jA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA .5m by 3.5m SRB. I think this would be used on upper stages, or could possibly be used as a take along for interplanetary missions to planets/moons with higher gravity to give a bit of extra boost during launch from their surface while saving fuel. It would increase the amount of fuel needed to descend, but I have a few ideas with parachutes for planets with a thick enough atmosphere. Again, not sure on the shape of the cone but it looks better than the previous model. I don\u0027t know where there is a seam in the texture on the cone, but it is not there when zoomed in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cwmu3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cwmu3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ywrNX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ywrNX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 1.5m by 8m SRB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cone is 1.5m in height and the skirt is approximately .5m with the nozzle extending 1m beyond its lowest edge. The detail shows the tapering tip which was modeled after the SRBs used on the European Ariane 5. Those SRBs did not have an angled nozzle, but I did it for aesthetics. I will be fiddling with its angle and edges, but overall I feel it looks alright for my first go at that shape. I might round off the tip to have it look more like the Ariane\u0027s SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s it for this post. I might go back and update the original post with the latest images of the parts and their textures. For now, I\u0027m just looking for some feedback on the general design and color scheme of the parts. I\u0027m always open for constructive criticism and I\u0027ll listen to you guys since I would like for people to use the parts in game. I\u0027m working on a logo and will probably stick with the Sundog name, though I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll call it Labs, Mechanics, Aeronautics or something along those lines. If anyone out there has experience with logo design and would like to help me with logo design, just shoot me a PM. I have some ideas in mind but have no tablet and my photoshop skills are a little rusty for that sort of work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that the models and textures aren\u0027t finalized, I\u0027ll be adding small parts to give the SRBs a bit of life and altering the textures with accent bits. Let me know what you think of the general design of the pack so far, or comment on individual parts. Do you like the cones, or would you rather have flat tops? Do you think the orange skirts work, or should I leave the skirts to be only grey or white? What about the grey bits below the dark bands?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance, and hopefully I can sort out exporting these things to unity and get them in game.

Would you mind telling me what you would use a larger SRB for and how often? Since we\u0027re going to have NERVA-esque engines (or at least one), I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll need to construct massive launch vehicles like how people have been assuming and trying to prepare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is now, that SRB is about 9m in length total (nozzle included), which is approximately the same length as 3 of the large 2m tanks stacked together (the SRB is 1.5m diameter, so it shouldn\u0027t be used with 1m tanks on the same stage). I think most people stop stacking them at around that point, but I was considering making a 2m diameter SRB with a longer length, probably 10m without the nozzle, so about 11m total length.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not trying to shoot the idea down, but there is a problem that has to be dealt with right now which is that there is no working cost system in the game. When I was converting the NovaPunch stuff to .16 values, I came across the same hurdle. There is no way to arbitrarily make parts cost more because they are better or more powerful because there\u0027s no budget for the player. There\u0027s nothing stopping anyone from just strapping the most powerful SRBs onto the side of their ship and just go at it, because there is no real penality for dumping extra fuel or using stuff more powerful than necessary. This is my biggest hangup with making larger and more powerful/efficient parts. So again, I may add one more larger size SRB, but I\u0027m hesitant because it would be really powerful and I wouldn\u0027t want people strapping it to the sides of craft that don\u0027t necessarily need it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, I\u0027m all ears for stuff that people would like to see in a parts pack. If you have any other ideas or comments, feel free to let me know.

I\u0027ll be posting my own critiques below each picture and would appreciate any constructive criticism you may have, suggestions for parts you\u0027d like to see, or anything of that nature. I\u0027ve got a bunch of ideas to work on and implement, but I just wanted to get the process of getting some parts in the game, so I\u0027m throwing these up here. A quick note: I have yet to put the parts through unity, so the UV Mapping seams are very apparent on the engines - that will hopefully be solved once I go through that step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6BjEX.png\u0022 alt=\u00226BjEX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a shot of my tanks stacked up on each other and a stack of the stock stuff right beside it. The small and large variants of my tanks when stacked equals 4 of the large variations of the stock tanks. I feel this is a solid amount. I generally am happy with the design, I want it to look somewhat like how stages are painted in real life to differentiate them, but I will likely be doing some minor tweaking on them and also tweaking the \u0022lips\u0022 at the top of each tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SRB needs a big model and texture overhaul. The nozzle needs to shrink, the individual sections need to be less \u0022bold\u0022 or distinguished, and I\u0027ll probably be redoing the textures. I am torn on whether or not to keep the caps, as I feel nothing ever really needs to be stacked on top of SRBs, but I have heard people like to put additional SAS modules on top of theirs.

I may widen the nozzle so it looks more like the stock one, but I\u0027m not sure. I was guessing as I did the models. I will probably increase the thickness of the fuel line so it\u0027s similar in size to the stock one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second photo is a twin-nozzle engine next to the smaller of the 1m stock engines. I will likely redo the bracing around the engine as it looks a bit fragile, and I might play with the nozzle a bit as well, shortening it and making the angle more sheer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KPOHH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KPOHH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA potential lander engine next to the stock 1m lander engine. I will be fiddling with this one a bit, most likely omitting the protrusion at the top of my engine, or at least shortening it\u0027s vertical profile a bit alongside shortening the nozzle and decreasing the size of its mouth so it\u0027s more friendly to landing legs. I\u0027m not trying to replace the stock lander engine, but I would like a more powerful variant that will sacrifice some weight and efficiency when dealing with larger payloads. This is what I\u0027m aiming for with these parts - functionally parallel while not trying to fill in gaps that don\u0027t exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second engine is a tri-nozzle design that needs some work done on its model still and would likely be an intermediary or potentially more powerful in-atmosphere 1m engine. I was thinking maybe 300 or 320 thrust with appropriate ISP after dropping the 2m tanks and SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading, and I\u0027ll be continuing to work on these.
