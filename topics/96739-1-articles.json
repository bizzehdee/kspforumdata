If another water particle is formed, the energy released will break apart one that\u0027s already formed. This means that in the end, this fuel type actually gets almost the same Ve across a large range, from 3-4 times excess hydrogen as is typically used, down to theoretically perfect ratio. The actual reasons for running hydrogen-rich are that it means you have unreacted hydrogen in the engine, rather than both hydrogen and oxygen, and it means that the engine operates at a lower temperature than if you tried to push it to its true limit, helping with material limits.

In other words, the higher the temperature and the lower the molecular weight, the higher the exhaust velocity. Maximum temperature occurs when the mixture is stoichiometric, that is, there is just enough oxygen present to react with all the fuel. Unfortunately this also results in a high molecular weight. Reducing the proportion of oxygen to fuel lowers both temperature and molecular weight. Initially the molecular weight decreases faster than temperature, so exhaust velocity goes up. Eventually the trend reverses and temperature decreases more rapidly than molecular weight, so exhaust velocity goes down. Maximizing exhaust velocity, thus ISP, involves finding the optimum point where there is the right balance between temperature and molecular weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T18:58:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo better illustrate the point I made in my previous post, below is a table showing the temperature and average molecular weight resulting from the combustion of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen at different mixture ratios.

As Iskierka explained, the reason the temperature is lower is because some of the heat generated by the reacted particles must heat up the unreacted particles. As the mixture ratio decreases there are fewer reacted particles and more unreacted particles. The reason the molecular weight goes down is because, as the propellant becomes more fuel rich, there is a greater abundance of lightweight unreacted hydrogen molecules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also note that at a mixture ratio of 8 you might expect the molecular weight to be 18, i.e. that of water. What is happening is the high heat of combustion is causing some of the large molecules to break down into smaller ones in a process known as dissociation. Although water is most abundant, there is also some H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, HO, H, O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E and O present in the mixture, thus lowering the average molecular weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we look at the value of (T/M)\u003Csup\u003E1/2 \u003C/sup\u003Ewe see that it\u0027s greatest when the mixture ratio is 3. This means that the exhaust velocity, thereby the specific impulse, will be greatest at about this mixture ratio. (I say \u0022about\u0022 because the \u003Cem\u003Especific heat ratio\u003C/em\u003E is also a factor in the exhaust velocity equation and has not been considered here.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practice we see that no LOX/LH2 engines actually use mixture ratios that are this fuel rich. Most LOX/LH2 engines operate at mixture ratios in the range of 5 to 6. The reason for this is because of hydrogen\u0027s extremely low density. At a mixture ratio of 3, the combined propellant density is very low, resulting in the need for very large propellant tanks. Increasing the proportion of oxygen to hydrogen significantly increases the density and lowers the propellant volume. Having smaller propellant tanks provides benefits such as lower mass and less drag. These benefits offset the decrease in ISP that results from operating at a less than optimal mixture ratio. In engineering practice it is found that mixture ratios of 5 to 6 strike the optimum balance between ISP and propellant density.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-18T19:19:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2015 07:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
