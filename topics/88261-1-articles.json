From the screenshot you posted, I see you\u0027re using a Mod utility of sorts. I\u0027ve never used one of these myself and while they are supposed to make things easier, I\u0027d advise against using it : it\u0027s not hard at all to install a mod in KSP, all you have to do is unzip the file downloaded from here on the forum and place the folder inside the GameData directory. Just make sure you\u0027re actually copying the right folder since it depends on the original .zip file folder structure (you should however always find a GameData in each .zip file, so you just have to drag and drop the contents to your KSP/GameData folder).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, if some mod doesn\u0027t work perfectly, the usual troubleshoot method is to isolate the issue by removing every other and attempting to run the game with the only troublesome one. Ferram and MechJeb should add an icon to the toolbar you see on the upper right corner (only in flight for MechJeb, and you have to install the MechJeb part on your ship before launch). If they appear, it should mean they work properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Deadly Reentry, the last update made things a little bit more tricky : basically, the rule of thumb as NathanKell puts it, is that you should never attempt to deploy your chutes at a subsonic velocity (330 m/s). As long as you\u0027re below 330 m/s, you\u0027re fine, otherwise the chutes will be ripped off and bad things will happen to our little green friends. Under normal conditions (a reentry with just a pod), chutes can be deployed from about 12-10 km, but that depends on other factors so you\u0027re better off just checking that speed in your navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use the LifeSupport mod (I prefer TAC Life Support over the one you quoted) and I switched from Kethane to Karbonite so I can\u0027t help you with these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should at least resolve some of your issues : be sure to come back with the other ones and I\u0027ll try to help you the best I can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T01:54:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, wI have yet to see a mod manager be of real use in KSP, and often had broken RSS installs based on that program...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway: if you post a log, per the guidelines, we can help.

They differ in some details, such as how you scan a planet for ressources and the way ressources are scattered (in Kethane, a planet is divided in multiple hexagons, each containing either 0 fuel or a definite amount of it ; in Karbonite however, there is always fuel everywhere, albeit the concentration greatly varies depending on the location and fuel can never be depleted). It\u0027s up to you to choose one among these two, I\u0027d say Karbonite has a greater number of new parts to use however (new airplane/spaceplane engines, rocket engines, landing legs for your fuel platforms, etc.) hence my own preference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed in your first post that you\u0027re using ATM or Active Texture Management : the current version seems to behave oddly for some users due to new bugs in the way KSP loads textures. If the game launches fine without it now, you should probably just remove it until a more reliable version comes out, right now it\u0027s a bit wonky. If KSP crashes during loading (mods consume a great deal of RAM, and KSP cannot use more than 3.6 GB), a common trick is to force the game to use without using DirectX : all you have to do is create a shortcut of KSP.exe, right-click on the shortcut and add at the end of the target field -force-opengl. That will replace DirectX by the OpenGL process, which uses way less RAM (don\u0027t ask me why though !) : on my install, I\u0027ve seen a 1 GB gain from that little trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T20:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFiesesAlien: I must have missed the link before then, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed a *lot* of exceptions in your log, but the first thing to check:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have, anywhere under GameData, more than 1 Module Manager dll ?
