It also is that they indeed do bend physics to let the player eventually escape any loss of control, and pay for it with time and/or altitude.

If you don\u0027t want to have anything like this, then you\u0027re still very much on hardcore realism terrain, simply because just the most basic physical laws in a fluid, have very heavyhanded consequences - as you explained so well in your previous post, there is no escape from the mentioned effects, unless one understands almost as much, as a skilled designer and player using FAR, save perhaps mach effects and similiar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, pun intended, NEAR and FAR are quite close, as is.
