hence it always happens at nine seconds.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAs to the thrust, I noticed that you reached a maximum gee force\u00A0of 6.0 gees.\u00A0 That may be because of the way the rocket was destroyed (blasting the root part away at high speed will often trick the accelerometer) but it also says that you reached a speed of 213 m/s and at least an altitude of 1,120 metres.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you could do that in nine seconds, then I think you have too much rocket.\u00A0 Extremely high thrust will also stress the connections between parts and try to break your rocket apart.\u00A0 If the connection is even a little flexible, then the tip of the rocket (which, if well-designed, has most of the mass) will deviate from the thrust direction.\u00A0 Add the distance to the engine and you get a lot of torque on the joint; add extreme thrust and you multiply that torque to the point of breakage.\u00A0 Torque, for the lay physicist, is force times lever arm times the sine of the angle between them; in KSP, this is roughly related to thrust times rocket length times the sine of deflection.\u00A0 Given that the last item in your crash report is a linkage failure between a fairing and\u00A0the base ring, I suspect very much that this is your issue--torque-related destruction is about the only way to get a base-fairing linkage failure in Procedural Fairings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how TweakScale deals with connection strength, but it\u0027s possible that when you take a small part and make it into a large part, it will not scale the strength enough, or it scales the mass or thrust too much, or what-have-you.\u00A0 If nothing else works, try a scaled-down version of your rocket and see what that does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-02T12:26:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2018 12:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-01T16:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to join others in pointing to the Strut Connector colliding with the tank being the first failure.\u00A0 Assuming the 7200 tank is the second stage tank/structure, I think one of your boosters is shifting inward, destroying the second stage tank, which then allows everything else to collapse in a fraction of a second (\u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E those failures are listed at 9 seconds MET).\u00A0 Checking your staging is a sensible thing in any failure analysis, but in this case, I suspect you have struts that weren\u0027t applied in symmetry (even though the SRBs presumably were), leading to at least one that didn\u0027t get connected correctly; your nine seconds is the point at which something (likely aero forces) adds up enough to let the decoupler flex the strut connector into the tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peteletroll","CreatedById":144573,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-01T16:43:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you press F3 just after the explosion, you should see a flight report that can help you point out what happened exactly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-02T11:15:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223307668\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171500\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221519922610\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022144573\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022peteletroll\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, peteletroll said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you press F3 just after the explosion, you should see a flight report that can help you point out what happened exactly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
