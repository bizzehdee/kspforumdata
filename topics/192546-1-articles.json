I\u0027m an OG from 0.13, bought the game after 0.15 came out in July of 2013. So, I can\u0027t transfer my game to steam. I currently have the base game plus making history. I really want to give breaking ground a go and am excited to spend the money on it, BUT\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCan I buy the expansion on steam, and use it despite having the base game and making history through the KSP store? So many features have steam integration (especially making history) and I\u0027d love to be able to do the things that integration makes possible, most notably playing peoples missions. Just wondering guys.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso this is my first post in a while, if this in the wrong place take it easy on me\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbolExplorer","CreatedById":177191,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-21T21:55:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteam won\u0027t let you buy a DLC for a game you don\u0027t own on Steam\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
