But I assume you want to land near a mun/minmus base. A good simple method is to do this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Go into a low orbit. The less excentric,\u00A0 the better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Use normal or antinormal burns to get your orbit to pass directly above your target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Plan a retrograde maneuver node. Watch as its predicted path hits the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Move the node, foward or backwards so that it lands directly above your target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Execute? Well,\u00A0 not yet. The tricky business is to counter the movement of your target,\u00A0 since it is in the surface of a moving planet or moon. So place the end of the orbit beyond your target (how much is a matter of experience).\u00A0Then execute the maneuver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Watch as you descend, and monitor your path and your target\u0027s position, as both you move and the target\u00A0moves foward on the ground. Then tweak it little by little with more short retro burns. Your target moves a little,\u00A0 you burn a little and so on. This will work if you left room to maneuver ahead of you,\u00A0 viz,\u00A0 your end path lying further from your target (because burning retrograde will always shorten the distance of your orbit\u0027s end).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. When you pass directly above your target,\u00A0 point retro in relation to the SURFACE (and not \u0027orbit\u0027) and kill your speed completelly. You will then hover slowly towards your destination,\u00A0 just control your descent speed. But only do this when close enough:\u00A0do it prematurelly,\u00A0 and the target will keep moving foward as you slowly fall towards the surface.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, also consider this:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. You under-shot and now your orbit ends on the ground short of the target?\u00A0 Burn RADIAL. It will throw your orbit end further,\u00A0 without changing speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Is your target a little to the side of your path?\u00A0 Tweak with small\u00A0 normal or antinormal burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.

I will agree though that KSP is somewhat permissive in that area and its not hard to design craft with a lot of surplus delta-v, as compared to what would probably be a delta-v budget in our real-life moon, for instance. Doing a polar-oriented station\u002Boutpost system is not impossible, neither particularly\u00A0difficult. Just, not how I would do it.

An orbit on the order of 100 km is ideal. You don\u0027t want to be too low as this makes it hard to burn off lateral velocity. Too high makes it expensive to burn off vertical velocity. Wait until you are approaching your target installation and burn retrograde as hard as you can. You want to come to a near complete stop relative to your target installation with the installation just very slightly ahead of you. Burn until your orbital predictor shows you will impact the mun just about a km or so short of your installation. Now remember that you cannot control lateral and vertical speed. You can only trade one for the other. This is why you needed to come as close as you could to a dead stop. As you burn\u00A0 to kill your horizontal speed you will gain lateral speed relative to your installation and will therefore tend to begin to overshoot it. This is why you needed to apply some lead at the beginning. Now, depending on the performance characteristics of your lander, this next bit can vary but the principle is to fall as far as you dare until you get to the point where you have just enough thrust to burn continuously\u00A0 until your vertical speed drops to about 5 m/sec within a couple of tens of meters of the surface. this will minimize the amount of time you spend picking up horizontal speed. If you\u0027ve done all of this right you should land within a couple of hundred meters of your target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kesa","CreatedById":130333,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-04T03:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223409736\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022175958\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221530653498\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022185394\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ironcladsix\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Ironcladsix said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2)\u00A0 Landing with 100 meters consistently is probably not possible.
