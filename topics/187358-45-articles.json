Some fraction of this might be helpful, but that\u0027s what the play testers are for and the rest of the feedback is just people misunderstanding that everything is changing. If I don\u0027t release anything, some people might assume that I don\u0027t have the jumping mechanics implemented, but the truth is I\u0027m trying to figure out if I want it to look more like Mario or Celeste jumping.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want some reassurance that systems have been developed (and are being balanced instead of being conceptualized, look at the interview with Shadowzone (I think?) There is mention that the code had to be designed from the ground up with Multiplayer in mind, and that was back in 2019.
