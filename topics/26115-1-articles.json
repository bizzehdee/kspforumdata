Oddly enough, unlike all of my other escape trajectory ships it doesn\u0027t seem to be decelerating at all. I\u0027m kind of tempted to just leave it and see if I can eventually get it a full light year out. That thought however, just makes me wish I had left it accelerating for another week.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
