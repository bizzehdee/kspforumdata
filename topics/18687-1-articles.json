With this, I went from the Surface of kerbin, to a 4k orbit of the mun, to a 5k slingshot around mimnus and then back to land on the runway - all in one trip with 8 Tanks of Jet fuel to spare.

Rear wheels act as trolleys behind main undercarriage. Try not to put all the weight of the aircraft on them, they are only there to prevent damage. Be careful pitching up too much after take-off. It was designed for easy re-entry, which has made climbing almost impossible without the SAS. Activate rockets at about 9000m. Keep the pitch at around 60 degrees. Never boost in space whilst rotating. Ensure you have no rotation and lined up for re-entry and -use the stage to drop the rocket boosters-. Should be fine with that because they are the usual rules of space flight \u0026gt;.\u0026lt;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/1137412906639919753/E35089E6E82CE9A048EFCE97CEC503DD346DF5CF/\u0022 alt=\u0022E35089E6E82CE9A048EFCE97CEC503DD346DF5CF\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/1137412906639921165/60C33A32197841344C27789282F0803E0115352D/\u0022 alt=\u002260C33A32197841344C27789282F0803E0115352D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI hope you Enjoy these.
