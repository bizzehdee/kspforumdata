It seems there is something amiss when dealing with a Command pod that also has KIS storage. When you have a craft with 2 command modules (say after docking) and use the KSP gui to transfer a kerbal from one command pod to another, the kerbals personal inventory wipes out the command pod\u0027s main inventory.\n\nHere is what I did to reproduce the issue.\n\n1. Took a stock KSP installation. Added KIS and KAS.\n\n2. Made a new part cfg based off the Mk1 lander can, and added 1000 KIS storage to it using ModuleKISInventory.\n\n3. Made a basic setup with essentially the Lander can, probe core wheels and a KAS pipe end. I put various items into the kis inventory only. I drove one unmanned off the launchpad. I made a second craft with the same setup, except this time i put some different items in inventory just so I could tell teh difference. I also added Bill to this one.\n\n4. I drove the second craft over to the first. EVA\u0027d bill, grabbed a drill out of the lander can and equipped on bill. Connected the 2 crafts via the KAS pip. Got bill back into the command pod he had been in originally.\n\n5. I then checked the inventory of both command pods to verify they had not changed. All looked good.\n\n6. I then transferred bill to the other command module using the transfer button.\n\n7. I then checked the KIS inventory again. This time the inventory of the command pod I had transferred bill to, only had bills Drill. All of the other items previously in inventory was gone."},{"CreatedByName":"Snarfster","CreatedById":80347,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T17:46:40Z","Content":"Since I really, really like this mod, and would love for more parts to be stackable, I wrote the following module manager file to make most stuff stackable.\n\nBasically if it doesn\u0027t have any resources and isn\u0027t already a KIS item, it becomes stackable.\n\n    // Module Manager Config to make all parts, that do not contain a resource,// stackable in Kerbal Inventory System.// stackable = true -\u003E speaks for itself // editorItemsCategory = false -\u003E makes sure it doesn\u0027t end up in the EVA// category in the VAB/SPH.@PART[*]:HAS[!RESOURCE[*],!MODULE[ModuleKISItem]]{\tMODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleKISItem\t\tstackable = true\t\teditorItemsCategory = false\t}}\n\nI have tested it and haven\u0027t found any weirdness so far.\n\nJust put it in a myKIS.cfg file in your GameData directory.\n\nThe reason that I didn\u0027t include items with a resource, as far as I know, KIS preserves the amount, I expect weirdness or free resources if stacking is allowed for those."},{"CreatedByName":"Shattermage","CreatedById":145452,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T17:51:15Z","Content":"So I just updated KIS and now my load screen hangs up at this...\n\n![o736EQ2](http://imgur.com/o736EQ2)\n\nThe words still change \u0022Adding more boosters; biding time; Adding K to every word; etc\u0022, but the load bar is stuck and ModuleManager is still sitting at 1140 patches loaded.

It would complete this mod in my opinion with that feature. Being able to grab onto parts and move them around in space and on the ground would be awesome. Also it would allow you to hook on multiple kerbals to help \u0022lift\u0022 heavier parts on the ground. It would also be neat if multiple kerbals were \u0022grappled\u0022 on the same object that in space it would combine their EVA jets to moving parts around easier in space (they\u0027d work together).
