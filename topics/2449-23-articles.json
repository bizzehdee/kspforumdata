I downloaded the PLF set initially because I needed something slightly larger than the 3m bulkhead/fairing system in the NP pack to encapsulate a slightly larger payload. The 4.2m set worked beautifully and I decided to give the engine and fuel tank set a go. I tried building a rocket using a combination of parts and was having issues making some adapters from NP work with your engines, but I\u0027ve managed ways around that and I\u0027m using them as much as I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this isn\u0027t about my successes with the packs, it\u0027s about a problem I\u0027ve recently discovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was building a rather large rocket to deliver a lander via a skycrane system (involves a decoupler on the top of the command module) and used your 3m to 4x3m Soyuz-style adapter. When I would go to the launch pad, the thing would spin wildly out of control after the physics system and break apart. The first failure listed in the flight record was between the decoupler and command pod, so I figured it was some weird issue going on. I then thought it was maybe the fairing adapter because the wheels of the rover vehicle were just barely clipping into the widest part of the funnel. Then I thought it might\u0027ve been the 2m to 3m decoupler shroud from NP interacting badly with your 3-4x3 adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter dismantling the craft and sequentially trying each part on the launchpad with other parts attached to it, I\u0027ve diagnosed the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s something wrong with the collisions on your engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t use the engine set prior to you installing the ISP numbers instead of straight burn rates, but when I attach any of your engines to the bottom of the 3 to 4x3 adapter, the thing spins around and tears apart my rocket as soon as the physics kick in on the launch pad. The adapter will sit on the pad fine without the engines, even with all of the stuff on top of it stacked on. I tried attaching 2m engines to the nodes at the bottom of the adapter and they spin just the same. I then went and put some NP 3m engines on the bottom of the adapter and they work with it fine - launch goes off without an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d have to get a mediafire account, but I could upload the .craft file (a working version w/o your engines and a failing version with them) so you could have a look and diagnose it. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s causing it, it might be the 3m adapter, or it might be the engines or something. I\u0027ve attached the 2m adapter directly to the 2m command pod with your 2m engines and it settles fine, but whenever I use your 3m adapter with your 3m engines, the engines act as though they are made of rubber and bounce erratically. I\u0027ve tried to fix the problem with the launchpad clamps, but it does the same thing - works fine without your engines and with NP engines, doesn\u0027t work with your engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, love your work regardless of this issue, but it\u0027s something you may want to look into.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Festivefire","CreatedById":9808,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T19:07:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ea temp solution is to use the launch clamps to hold your rocket a bit above the pad, and to use struts to keep the engines from wobbling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wildkittyv1","CreatedById":30893,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T19:13:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETried that stuff - doesn\u0027t work. And actually, after trying a bit with the NP engines and letting it sit there, the same problem occurs, it just takes longer. I\u0027m thinking it might be a weight issue or something because I\u0027ve stacked all kinds of junk on the NP 3m engines and never experienced something like this. The 2m adapters work fine with all the 2m engines and the 3m engines work fine without the adapter, so it\u0027s something to do with that. I\u0027ve solved it by just using the NP engines and launching quickly, but it shouldn\u0027t be happening in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your problem with having NP and KW installed at the same time, I\u0027ve no issues with it so it\u0027s gotta be something on your side, but I have no clue as to what it could be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Festivefire","CreatedById":9808,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T20:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eneither do i, as I\u0027ve tried a clean install about five times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deviantdigi","CreatedById":37362,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-06T23:20:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECeres MPCV 0.1 (for V0.16) I can\u0027t get the parts to snap together properly.
