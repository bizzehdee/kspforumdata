You want to go driving a Bigtrak around \u003Cem\u003Ecertain places\u003C/em\u003E on Kerbin, but don\u0027t feel like doing the 10,000\u002BKm road trip? We\u0027ve got you covered!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img11/3295/screenshot4gh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot4gh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOperation is simple: do everything you possibly can to make KSP run smoothly, up to and including sacrificing a chicken to the dark gods of overclocking - set the throttle to 2/3rds power and fire off the JATO rockets. After a few seconds \u003Cem\u003Egently\u003C/em\u003E pull back on the stick and you\u0027ll be airborne! Eject the empty rocket bottles and set the throttle to 90-95% and gently climb to 10-12K. If it\u0027s night-time, you should turn on the BBG\u0027s headlights before takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore flight it is vitally important that the tie-downs on the Bigtrak be secure. Otherwise it rocks back and forth in an annoying fashion, and sometimes the transporter unit snaps clean in half when you try and turn. It is delivered secure, just make sure that if you change anything, that the Bigtrak is secured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img820/7161/screenshot7hj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot7hj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test pilots have noted that while the BBG is basically two busses lashed to an RV it handles fairly well. However, they do note that if you attempt to climb too sharply it will begin to flip end over end. If this happens, immediately pull back the throttle to about 1/2 - 1/3 power until you\u0027ve sorta regained control. It is because of this little ... difficulty the operational ceiling and top speed of the BBG are not currently known. Do not attempt a barrel roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the fuel drains from the drop tanks, drop them. There are only two pair of drop tanks, so don\u0027t fire too many stages or you\u0027ll drop the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ISA module is provided for navigation purposes only, attempting to fill in the map using the BBG would be tedious at best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe BBG is capable of landing, however due to the terrain around the \u003Cem\u003Ecertain places\u003C/em\u003E the BBG also supports hot-dropping the Bigtrak. The staging is set to drop the engines, then trigger the drag chutes on the transporter unit, then drop the Bigtrak, then deploy the Bigtrak parachute. It is advisable to let the Bigtrak coast for a few moments to make sure it is well clear of the BBG, which tends to lawn-dart into the terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img688/7923/screenshot0m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t want to be under that scrap pile when it lands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have reached an exciting place to look around you can deploy the ladder on the nose of the Bigtrak so that your brave Kerbals can actually get back inside again afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf flown carefully the BBG has enough fuel to reach either of Kerbin\u0027s main tourist destinations, although it is a one-way trip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to know what the acronyms \u0022BBG\u0022 and \u0022O,TAB\u0022 mean, check here.

As for the other suggestions, they all require more mods, and I was working with what I had. I don\u0027t really use mods unless they\u0027re filling in a specific need. I wanted maps, got ISA. Wanted rovers, and wanted a Bigtrak as a kid, got Bigtrak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, the chutes on the sled unit yank it out from under the Bigtrak without any trouble, and if you \u0022land\u0022 the whole thing you can usually just drive off the front of what\u0027s left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve visited the \u003Cem\u003ECertain Places\u003C/em\u003E so won\u0027t be doing much else with this. Feel free to tinker and post the results - whether they be successful designs or humorous screenshots of things snapping in half and falling to the ground in bits (that central bridge really likes doing that...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aescwulf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aescwulf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat looks amazing I was expecting a bigtrak with SRB strapped to the sides\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! The build was kind of a pain: since the Bigtrak is the \u0022control pod\u0022 everything had to be built outwards from there. The reason there are technically two fuel tanks on each side (ignoring the drop tanks) is that I just could not get the builder to attach them properly as one long tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBB Alpha snapped in half sitting on the runway - fuel tank cross struts added. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBB Beta snapped in half in mid air - fuselage -\u0026gt; central bridge struts added. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBB Charlie had only two engines instead four of since four seemed overpowered. It also snapped in half in mid-air, fuselage - Bigtrak struts added. If you look at the runway picture you may notice that the end is obscured by a cloud of grey indicators. This thing really liked snapping in half. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBB Delta was when I figured out the aerospike engines were rockets not air breathers. It had \u0022Aero\u0022 in the name - of course it was an air-breather! Range massively increased.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBB Echo was skipped due to forgetfulness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBB Foxtrot added those strange canard extenders and rearranged the wings to try and correct for the flipping end over end issues. First trip to a \u003Cem\u003ECertain Place\u003C/em\u003E made. Ran out of fuel, crashed in the dark and snapped the ISA dish off, killing the map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBB Golf added the JATO (partly to avoid having to redline the throttles on launch, and partly for giggles), headlights, backup ISA dish and drop tanks after the experience of Foxtrot. The drop tanks also help control the flipping issue by making the forward half heavier. First location visited successfully. Primary ISA dish was removed after it was revealed to be blocking the crew hatch. Second location visited successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-30T19:14:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2012 07:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Unistrut\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
