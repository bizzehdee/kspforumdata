They absolutely should be shown there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that, I don\u0027t see any problem in the scenario you describe, at least on normal difficulty. Rescuing someone from Mun orbit costs me about 25\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015330k, using the small pod on a 1.25m launcher with a probe core to get it out there. The taxi contracts pay at least 100\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153150k from the Mun, if memory serves (I\u0027ve not had one for a while). Seems just fine to me, doesn\u0027t require doubling up to make it viable or worthwhile. It\u0027s one of the more profitable contracts either singly or doubly. You can also try to add on a science survey contract or something, for yet more profit from single launch cost. I normally don\u0027t wait to double up with other contracts for Mun and Minimus, but will double up when the opportunity is at hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, take some extra fuel and you can still do both in one trip, even with a 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination difference between the orbits. After picking the first up, raise Ap to something suitably high (but still inside Mun\u0027s SoI). Change orbit at Ap for fairly low cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI.e. what you describe is no big deal in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN.B.
