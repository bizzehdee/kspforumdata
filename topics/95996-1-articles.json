So without leaving the Kerbin system, you can get one point value for Kerbin, one for the Mun, and one for Minmus. For Kerbin, the highest value is orbiting, for the Mun and Minmus, the highest is landing. So if you send a new kerbal from Kerbin orbit to a Moho landing and back, you will get points for orbiting Kerbin, orbiting the Sun to get there, and landing on Moho when you get back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: As another player in the forums pointed out, the best way to level up Kerbals in a single mission is to get a trip together that takes them from Kerbin orbit to Mun orbit to a landing on Minmus, then from Minmus, burn out to briefly exit Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence and enter Solar orbit, before returning to Kerbin. This method will level all Kerbals up to the highest level that actually does anything. Higher levels exist but as of now have no benefits or bonuses to the Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-08T19:37:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2015 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The Yellow Dart\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bdito","CreatedById":112760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T20:34:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll get all of the intermediate step experience for going straight to the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T14:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vladthemad\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vladthemad\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, tell me if I have this right.

You do NOT get the sum of all the different things you can do there. So like at Kerbin, the highest single award is 2 points for orbit, which is the most you can get at Kerbin. Everywhere else (except Kerbol and Jool), the highest award is for planting a flag (like 5 points at Mun). That\u0027s the most you can get at any of those places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, a Kerbal on his 1st trip to Mun who lands and plants a flag directly from the transfer trajectory without stopping in a Munar orbit first, will get 5 points. A Kerbal who goes to Mun, stops in orbit, then lands and plants a flag will get 5 points. A Kerbal who does a Munar flyby on his 1st trip, an orbit on his 2nd trip, and a flag plant on his 3 trip will get a total of 5 points in the end, NOT the 10 that each of these add up to separately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this rules, the maximum KXP a Kerbal can get within the Kerbin system is 13 (2 for Kerbin orbit, 5 for flag on Mun, 6 for flag on Minmus). If you go outside of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, you get 6 more for being in Kerbol orbit. So that\u0027s a max of 19 you can have prior to going on an interplanetary trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wrote a tutorial on this subject you can find here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104239-Leveling-Up-Kerbals-The-Training-Program\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104239-Leveling-Up-Kerbals-The-Training-Program\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vladthemad","CreatedById":100533,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T02:01:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, got it, the way the wiki read was a bit confusing.
