It revolves around the issue of interstellar travel, and whether such journeys can be completed in a human life time. My personal belief is that, in the far future, our descendants may be able to create ships that can reach 10% light speed or so (a delta v of 30,000 km/s). Some people scoff at the mere suggestion that this may be so. One example would be this video:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6H1TxRGLUc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn it, the narrator takes a look at the movie avatar, and critiques the venture stars design (starting at 5:25). He does some estimates on the joules and watts expended over the course of its journey, but then makes the strange claim that any craft attempting to accelerate at greater than 1 g will vaporise itself! He didn\u0027t actually say that, but this is the essence of what his argument boils down to: Even if you scale the engine down, the heat it emits will exceed the crafts specific heat.

For one thing 100,000 tons wet mass seems way too high, interstellar rockets are not built like aircraft carriers. My guess would be less than 10,000 tons wet mass. He also gives 99.99% efficient as a reducto ad absurdum, but an antimatter rocket would be open-cycle, the main sources of heat transfer would be absorbed gamma radiation in the radiation shield from the matter-antimatter reactions and the inefficiency of the magnet used in the nozzle. I think 99% efficient might actually be plausible in this case. If you\u0027re running a radiator at 1500K, which is plausible if the radiation shield is made out of tungsten, and with an emissivity of .9 you\u0027d need 540 km^2 of radiator panels to get rid of the waste heat. This is a lot bigger than what is pictured in the movie, I\u0027d guess that the ISV Venture Star has maybe a tenth of a square kilometer of radiator area; perhaps its radiator runs hotter than 1500K or the efficiency of the rocket is greater than 99%. If the rocket was 99.99% efficient the radiator area would only need to be 5.4 km^2 to discharge the waste heat. At any rate 540 km^2 seems like a lot but it\u0027s not at all impossible, especially if you\u0027re using something like a droplet radiator, certainly more plausible than his 1000 year Noah\u0027s Arc idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, nhnifong, if you\u0027re the same PSU system science grad student, we\u0027ve met.

At best, you are getting 25% of the total impulse, while absorbing 50% of total energy. There are no materials that can withstand that sort of energy output while still giving you anything like a decent thrust. For every 1N of thrust you gain with such a drive, you\u0027d have to dissipate 600 megawatts of heat. If you were to build your pusher plate out of Tungsten, it would only radiate 8.5 megawatts per square meter. So you\u0027d have to have a pusher plate that\u0027s at least 70m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 per 1N of thrust. And that plate would have to be at least 10cm thick to actually absorb the radiation.

How you manage to get a nearly 100% efficient reactor that\u0027s light and produces enough power to drive a photon drive like that, I have no idea.
