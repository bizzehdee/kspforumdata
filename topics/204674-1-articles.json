Even trying to \u0027trick\u0027 the game into letting me put an octo on a stage and try to recover it was a lot of work - that often interfered with my ability to Neanderthal my way into orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever the (currently) highest profile space company (weird to not say \u0027agency\u0027) is routinely landing and reusing stages.

In an adjacent thread we\u2019ve been talking about the pros and cons of autopilot functions but that could be one one way to have boosters land themselves while you power on with a second stage. There are also mods for ksp1 that assume that stages that hit 25k with chutes are recovered. Thats less satisfying and less space-x-ey but Im sure much easier to implement.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TROPtastic","CreatedById":211826,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-05T02:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis thread asks a great question, and I hope the answer is \u0022You will have the ability to land first stages in game while the rest of your mission completes.\u0022 That would be a fun addition to gameplay and to KSP\u0027s education aspects as well, since it will help demystify how reusable rockets work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully because KSP2 is already being designed with multiplayer in mind, it may be easier to have two independent craft carry out actions simultaneously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-06T08:52:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThinking out loud, I did try\u00A0this in KSP1 and encountered that problem that you cannot control two craft at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got as far as needing to make the first stage a high enough lob and second stage a high enough thrust to mass ratio so it could quickly make a burn and give me enough time to land the first stage before I had to circularise the second stage orbit. It worked and was doable for fun\u00A0but was time consuming micro so I reverted to disposable stages, so I could focus on other aspects of the missions and optimise the second stage for flight instead of reusability of the first stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0In terms of how this\u00A0could work in game play, splashdown\u00A0with chutes or touchdown with chutes assisted by landing legs and last second\u00A0burn were\u00A0the ways I did it.\u00A0Either way you had to engage the full physics sim to get a recoverable landing, since otherwise\u00A0KSP1 just approximates a collision and you lose the stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt strikes me that it would be nice to see a recovery option. You could just set it to recover anything with a chute on it in place of collision which would be OK though thinking like a \u003Cs\u003Ecriminal I mean\u003C/s\u003E gamer this is\u00A0easily cheesed since you\u00A0could just slap a smallest chute on and would also miss out on the challenge to actually do it for real.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis implies there ought to be some kind of test for reusability. One way would be a simple one off physics calculation for landing velocity, involving the mass of the craft and its total drag with\u00A0chutes deployed, atmosphere and altitude of impact/touchdown. Powered landers could factor in a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E deduction at the point of \u0022landing\u0022\u00A0related to the amount of fuel remaining and engine properties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother approach would be certification of a specific craft design by an actual mission flight, meaning you could certify a stage as reusable by actually flying it and landing it, Thereafter it could be treated as recoverable so you could just allow it to reenter and it would be recovered instead of\u00A0collided.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason this might be worth doing is it raises the prospect of a social aspect, \u00A0using steam workshop to share\u00A0certified designs, so others can use the design in their own game, meaning the design would carry its certification with it and be useful to others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCertification is also open to cheesing because e.g. you could expend fuel in later flights you held in reserve for landing in the certification flight.\u00A0 So there would still need to be a test for viable undamaged chutes and\u00A0landing legs and remaining \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E for a certified reusable stage to be treated as recovered. It could also be cheesed by reducing payload mass or reducing separation altitude for certification so this would also need to be tested and both recorded at certification and then applied at relaunch and recovery failed if either parameter exceeded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2c\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-06T08:57:59Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2021 08:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-06T09:32:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get around the \u0022controlling 2 craft\u0022 problem, i have been doing such launches from the desert runway launch site.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-\u00A0Start there with a falcon 9 type of rocket, launch east (maybe slightly to the north, heading 85 degrees about)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Thrust until the trajectory is a little past the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, with an AP around 100km\u003Cbr\u003E\n- By the time you exit the atmosphere, you can decouple the payload an get that into orbit for about \u002B400m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 -
