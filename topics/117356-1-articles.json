As long as you don\u0027t switch vessels, change time warp rate, or quicksave/load just before you take the screenshot, it will usually be okay. No mods required. If you look for the messages, you can usually tell when they would appear on a screenshot. I don\u0027t know of anything which hides that text though, but it\u0027s certainly a good idea. I\u0027d be tempted to write that as a bug report actually; on-screen messages not hidden with \u003Cspan style=\u0022padding:2px 5px;background:#ffffff;border:1px solid #000000;\u0022\u003EF2\u003C/span\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T01:19:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd regarding your signature, you miss .9? 4 years ago KSP was pretty rough.
