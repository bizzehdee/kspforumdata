I wanted it to give me the number of points shown in the dialog boxes. Instead, it simply reduced the number of points shown in the dialog boxes to match the number of points that I\u0027d actually receive if I retrieved the spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince these science items are so high on the technology tree, I believe that the multipliers in sciencedefs.cfg were actually *intended* by the designers, and that a code bug is preventing those multipliers from actually being applied. In other words, I believe the designers intended for these science devices to give you high points, and the bug is preventing the high points from being applied. Changing the multipliers to 1 in sciencedefs.cfg doesn\u0027t fix the bug, it just displays the (unintended) low point value in the dialog boxes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way, via editing existing game files, to work around the bug and allow the high point values to actually be applied? Perhaps by editing some other value other than the multipliers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I\u0027m asking is because I\u0027m mid-way through playing the career mode, having a lot of fun, and I just bought these items and thus hit this bug. This is a show-stopper for me: unless I can earn the intended amount of science points from these devices, I don\u0027t want to play career mode any more. I want to keep playing, but the amount of science required to buy the other items high in the technology tree is prohibitive unless I can earn more points from these devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tfabris","CreatedById":82885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T19:42:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom looking at the sciencedefs.cfg file, it looks like I could work around it by editing the baseValue and perhaps the scienceCap value. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone explain the difference between and the relationship between those values?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, the dataScale for the Atmosphere Analysis was 10 (if I recall correctly before I changed it to 1), with a baseValue of 20 and a scienceCap of 24. When I first ran an atmosphere analysis, the dialog box said I\u0027d get a ton of points. I don\u0027t remember how much but maybe it was 240? I don\u0027t recall. The actual amount of points applied was miniscule though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m wondering, whatever the original dataScale value was, should I multiply that by the baseValue and plug that in there?

Basically, one of the attributes (dataScale, I think), increases the amount of data that the experiment will generate, but it\u0027s not supposed to increase the science reward. The popup that shows the results and lets you keep/transmit/discard the results isn\u0027t taking this into consideration, so is thinking that all that data would return more science than it should.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tfabris","CreatedById":82885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T20:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see your point about how I\u0027m making an assumption about the nature of the bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut without the multiplier, those particular science items generate a paltry reward.

First mission, Polar orbit (you get more EVA reports that way) and at least one orbit with a \u0022high orbit\u0022 apoapsis, maybe a swing by the Mun/Minmus or even the solar SoI if I\u0027m feeling aggressive. Second mission, a Minmus landing. Third mission, a Munar landing with EVA reports over at least 8 biomes and surface samples/EVA reports from at least two biomes (three is pretty easy). Fourth mission is Duna or Eve plus the corresponding moon. Then maybe the other one, maybe a trip to Jool and one or more moons there. If I push the first mission hard enough, I might combine the 2nd/3rd missions, but I usually don\u0027t do that because a first-node-only ship that can go that far tends to be a pain to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
