Unfortunately, in classical KSP style, the \u0027landing\u0027 involved my ship tipping over at the last moment, hitting the surface, and breaking apart, leaving my little command pod to roll down a hill into a crater. But he still lives! Since then I\\\u0027ve been trying to send mission after mission to save him. Id rather leave a substitute Kerbal on the moon, then leave the all mighty Jeb there all alone! Unfortunately, I haven\\\u0027t figure out a way to swap the Kerbals out, so that Jeb can fly home, but I\\\u0027m sure I\\\u0027ll come up with something! Till then, I\\\u0027ve been sending him out on little spacewalks to explore the crater (its not very exciting. Just a big dark hole, really.) Though I did make an expedition to the crater\\\u0027s lip to take a peek out. not a whole lot to see. I look forward to an update that will give me something like a Mun rover to drive around in! Would make exploring MUCH more interesting :] Though With all this talk of EVA\\\u0027s and Mun landing starting to feel like real Mun LANDINGS, as opposed to Mun sitting-on-it-till-you-get-bored-ings. Also, I never figured out how you are supposed to extend those attached ladders. They all show up as \u0027\u003Cstrong\u003E?\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027 in my staging list. Do they have to be activated from outside the ship? In any case, I hope that this advancement in Kerbal Space Technology will soon lead to ways for us to leave Kerbals on the Mun/ Minmus more permanently! (some sort of base part that we could disconnect from the main ship wouldn\\\u0027t go astray, or at least a cargo-part that would let us carry things like a Mun rover or a building part without having to have it placed as a full part in the staging process) I haven\\\u0027t made a working rocket with the huge fuel tanks yet though. They seem a little unbalanced, and its a shame that they are the only thing wide enough to carry the three-man team into space. (well, that and the Space-plane one, but I haven\\\u0027t even tried using those yet. They are too hard for me to design.) But in any case, I sincerely am overjoyed with all the stuff you guys worked into this update, and I\\\u0027m excited to see what comes next! Hopefully something to expand on the stuff you can do in space/on other surfaces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETill then, Good luck and thank you for all the hard work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Have you guys worked out a way to create unmanned rockets yet? They would be more then welcome to lots of people, I would think. Partly for practice runs to things like the Mun and Minmus, or to do work that would basically either leave a pilot stranded or force you to make the ship even more complex then it needs to be to get the Kerbonaut back to Kerbin. Things like making \u0027Satellites\u0027 (even though there are no actual Kerbal-made satellites in the game yet) and transporting supplies or other interesting things like a rover or a section of moon base! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, just thought I would throw that in!
