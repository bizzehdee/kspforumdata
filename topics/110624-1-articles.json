This occurs on the following system version:\n\nuser@computername:~$ lsb\\_release -a\n\nNo LSB modules are available.\n\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\n\nDescription: Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS\n\nRelease: 14.04\n\nCodename: trusty\n\nI attached the KSP.log file and the savegame in which I encounter this error. Follow the following recipe to encounter the error:\n\n1) Load the savegame\n\n2) Enter the VAB and\n\n3) Start with a small cockpit (the first one that you get, if that matters)\n\n4) Find the \u0022Structural Fuselage\u0022 part and buy it for 2500\n\n5) Add the Structural Fuselage to the ship\n\n6) Press \u0022Launch\u0022/\u0022Go to launch site\u0022\n\n7) Recover the ship \n\n8) Go to the VAB\n\n-\u003E Notice that now one has to rebuy access to the Structural Fuselage\n\nThis also happens with one of the large boosters available in the savegame.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nDownload the bug related resources from here: [http://www.craftware.nl/rebuy-issue.zip](http://www.craftware.nl/rebuy-issue.zip)"},{"CreatedByName":"TheRealISA","CreatedById":15862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T12:14:41Z","Content":"Aaah crap... not a bug from your side but one introduced by me by improperly installing KSP over an old Alpha(Beta?) installation of KSP. This way parts were duplicated and the program did not know which part was unlocked or so... do not quite know why, but the log file actually was very helpful!\n\nFuthermore, another example where structured searching solved the issue :-)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nPS: Can somebody set this to solved or something?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T12:31:19Z","Content":"Set to solved ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
