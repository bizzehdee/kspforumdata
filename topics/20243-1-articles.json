I\u0027m back on a laptop so I can explain my suggestion. It works because when you hit apoapsis of your transfer orbit, your craft moves slower around that point in its orbit then jool so it would be logical to position your craft infront of jool so as to allow it to catch up and take you. However, depending on the distance and how fast jool\u0027s closes, sometimes you end up dropping too far down in your orbit and jool will sail pass above you. To counter this, burning up will keep you from falling down to a lower orbit. Evidence is seen when you actually perform it: apoapsis will start moving to the front of your craft indicating that you will be climbing again. Do this enough times (may be 1 or 100 depending on how inaccurate you are) and patch conics will eventually tell you of an intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei would perform the plane change after you\u0027ve done your transfer burn. Just lay the map view horizontal so that your tranfer orbit looks like a flat line. Pivot your camera left or right until jool\u0027s orbit looks like a single straight line that intersect yours. At that point where they intersect is where you would perform the plane change so wait till your ship gets there. If jools orbit is heading down, burn on the 180 line at the equator of the navball. if jools orbit is up, burn on reverse side of the navball. It should be the N longitude at the equator. If you can\u0027t tell which direction jools orbit is heading, flip a coin and decide. Its easy to see the orbit change so you would know if you chose right or if you need to burn the opposite way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ghery88","CreatedById":32827,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T10:51:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Extemporary\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Extemporary\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI managed to get to Jool without even a protractor, just eyeballing it.
