Why is this and how can I get more maneuverability to probe guided crafts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackground:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have built a probe guided lander carrier that packs punch to do interplanetary transfers carrying a lander, which has a command pod, at the same time. When a lander is docked to the carrier, maneuverability is fine. But when I detach the two crafts from each other, the lander retains the good maneuverability and the carrier loses it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daveboy2000","CreatedById":61206,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T13:04:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse SAS modules and RCS thrusters to increase the maneuverability of a probe. Probes don\u0027t have a lot of torque because they\u0027re well, probes. Kerbal command pods probably have the kerbins moving about to control it, or atleast there is room for a larger gyroscope in such pod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smorfty","CreatedById":59234,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T13:06:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eevery command module has different \u0022rotation power\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can see them here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts#Pods\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts#Pods\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebig crewed command modules have values like 15 or 20\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhile the tiny probes only have 0.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you want larger probe command modules, I recommend the KSPX Parts Expansion mod:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-4-kspx-parts-expansion/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-4-kspx-parts-expansion/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T13:07:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe maneuverability seems to depend on the \u0027rotation power\u0027 AND mass of the command pod/probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nyksy","CreatedById":63698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T13:13:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk.
