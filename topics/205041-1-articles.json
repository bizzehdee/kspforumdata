The parts themselves still seem to work, it\u0027s just that they look like they\u0027ve got onto the manufacturing floor after they got their primer coat. And not all of the IXS parts in the inventory have that same effect. Any ideas as to what files are missing and where they might be?\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RLP8pCx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/RLP8pCx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
