They all comprise an interplanetary ship system that can handle utility modules, additional fuel, additional landers, et cetera.

The ship is, in all, composed of two utility vessels, one crew module, one core module, two landers, and two player-built utility modules, which should be built with clamp-o-tron juniors on either side, one for manipulation by the utility vessel, and one for attachment to the core module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E All the systems are based on a common inline launcher architecture, and are easily modifiable as needed. The entire system was designed to teach new players the most possible about RCS alignment, docking, station architecture, and the use of proper mission planning for interplanetary missions. The framework is extensible, with optional fuel modules for different mission profiles. For example, the core\u002Bcrew module is suitable for munar transfer and, with the optional addition of a lander and a counterweight, munar landing. With the substitution of the nuclear propulsion module for the conventional propulsion module, the system can reach Duna. The addition of a fuel module (Launched empty alongside the core module and fueled by the leftover fuel in the component tanks) should allow the system to traverse the entire Kerbin system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe album showing a partial system can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/1Wqpy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E and the craft files for a complete system are \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.4shared.com/zip/tzmnT9uJ/Omega_Interplanetary_System.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/4hmgtx76tcqyszy/Omega%20Interplanetary%20System.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere, on an alternative file host.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-28T17:33:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2013 05:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tripcode\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hellion13","CreatedById":66719,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T15:46:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/srXRREi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022srXRREi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy saturn V made with parts from KW, NP2, and procedural fairings, flies wonderfully, actually i think the only part i used from KW was the black 3m 3rd stage tank, unless the escape tower is from KW, i cant remember where all my parts come from LOL\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-28T16:45:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2013 04:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by hellion13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eto make picture\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T16:33:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etripcode: looks cool.
