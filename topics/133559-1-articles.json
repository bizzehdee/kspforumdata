After my first successful return mission from the Mun, it increased my love for KSP by a billion times.

I was introduced to KSP recently; I\u0027ve never played a previous version before 1.0.5, by the way.\u00A0So I tried building a more advanced rocket with bigger engines and more fuel tanks. I made a rocket with ~10k delta V, far more than I need for a simple Mun return trip, but it generally can\u0027t make it through the ascent. Tips on how to fix this specific rocket are great (I\u0027ll include a picture or two of it, as well as the successful rocket that could use just a little more delta V), but I\u0027m looking for more tips and guidelines in general for building rockets, and how I can specifically start increasing the delta V of rockets so they can travel farther and do more, without turning the rocket into something that will be unstable when flying and can\u0027t even make it through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. I can\u0027t even begin how to fathom how I would get a mobile processing lab into orbit around the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help is greatly appreciated.

If I remove all fins from the upper stage of my rocket, I won\u0027t have difficulty piloting it? Is this because it will only be piloted in space, where there is no atmosphere? Indeed, this rocket likes to flip over during ascent and then point to the ground, and will absolutely refuse to point anywhere but.

I think part of my problem is the difficulty I have finding specific tutorials I am looking for on these forums. Maybe I just need to keep practicing with the search feature. Remove fins: check. Struts: check. I watched a video of someone making a rocket, and he insisted lots and lots of struts, especially between, for example, fuel tanks and engines, and other places, were absolutely vital. Maybe this was a much older version of KSP and that isn\u0027t necessary anymore? Maybe that potentially older version also didn\u0027t have the struts creating drag...I don\u0027t know.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, I think what might be a huge problem of mine Foxster is that I don\u0027t understand at all how TWR works, other than what it stands for.

I thought it\u0027d be better that way, it wouldn\u0027t take so long to perform burns...and in a vacuum it wouldn\u0027t matter? Also, I would almost always use the shorter radial decouplers, but I just couldn\u0027t fit the landing struts, fins, decouplers, ladder, struts, and fuel lines all on it without doing what I did.

I know that every asparagus setup I\u0027ve\u00A0done works just fine, and the tanks empty in the order they should and everything. No, as new and uninformed as I am, I know that would be massively overkill. It is setup how you\u0027ve suggested: a Mainsail in the center, with all the engines on the sides being Skippers. The bottom stage TWR is 1.78 (2.25 max). As I said earlier, I don\u0027t really understand what that means, just what the acronym stands for.

Non-active vessels just follow their last known trajectory, and if that\u0027s a sub-orbital trajectory then they\u0027ll crash into Kerbin or wherever and be removed from the game. They won\u0027t slow down even if their parachutes are open because drag is a physics engine calculation and the physics isn\u0027t run when the vessel is not loaded.

Landing slower (more/bigger chutes)and closer to Kerbin returns a bigger percentage of the booster\u0027s value. You just get a little message saying here are the funds recovered from vessel XYZ. So if the booster engine is in stage 5 and the decoupler in stage 4, then put the booster parachute in stage 3. Decouple nice and high (not worth a parachute for the smallest SRBs) so the rocket is 25km away by the time the booster would hit the ground.

There was just a small reference to saving the expensive SRBs and putting chutes on them. Essentially though, that mod will make it a lot simpler to recover stages? I don\u0027t understand what physics range really is, and don\u0027t exactly know what you mean. I was just under the impression you didn\u0027t need a mod to recover stages. But I think I\u0027ll try that mod, if it makes it a little easier. I\u0027ll also check out his video; a video dedicated just to how to recover stages would be nice, because I was just gleaming information from a video that wasn\u0027t specifically about this subject.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you mind giving me a general rundown of how to properly use StageRecovery to recover stages? I need chutes on my disposed engines/fueltanks/stages I want to recover obviously, I put the decouplers and the parachutes in the same stage so they deploy at the same time, and I have to switch my view to the debris for a period of time until my main ship that\u0027\u0027s still accelerating is out of physics range of the debris? ...wat? lol. What altitudes on Kerbin is it safe to do this? How is it that the chutes don\u0027t just instantly deploy at this high ltitude that they\u0027ll likely be at, and end up burning up the chutes? That\u0027s the biggest thing I don\u0027t understand. If it\u0027s debris, you can\u0027t control it anymore..so how do you make sure the chutes don\u0027t deploy until they\u0027re at a safe velocity? I tried this twice a while back and they always immediately deployed, usually around 10-15km, and obviously they were going too fast and the chutes burned up.

The time that it takes for a booster to drop to the ground on a parachute (bearing in mind that you really must have the parachute stage at the same time as the decoupler for the booster, or add yet another probe core to the booster and switch between it and your main vessel - not a good idea unless the ship is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eextremely\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E stable) is just far too long. Your main vessel will in all likelihood be 25km away by the time the booster touches down, so it\u0027ll go \u0022poof\u0022 and be wiped from the game before it hits the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could spend hours working out and trying different parachute settings so that the boosters drop almost to the ground before the chutes open, which might let you recover your very first stage in stock, but you should probably ask yourself if it is worthwhile...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t tried the mod. I wholeheartedly agree with the principle of the thing - we absolutely should be encouraged to go the SpaceX way and recover all that precious hardware - but KSP stock isn\u0027t geared for it and I felt that it wasn\u0027t really worth it. There are a few engines that feel an utter waste to abandon - the Vector particularly - but when your build cost doubles when you finally add science instruments to it then you know where the game is pushing you to make savings on recovery. And it isn\u0027t first-stage boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T00:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and as to the \u0022what is physics range really?\u0022: when you are not in control of a ship, it is \u0022on rails\u0022. The orbit is defined as a mathematical function, and your ship follows that line. If that line impacts terrain, the ship disappears. If it goes below a certain level in the atmosphere, it disappears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you are within the physics bubble (like when you approach another vessel in orbit and it comes within 2.3km) then the actual craft is loaded. It \u0022exists\u0022 as an entity rather than just an orbit. In the atmosphere, this bubble is larger than 2.3km (otherwise things would be weird, like flaming discarded engines just disappearing on reentry): 22.5km apparently. The bigger the bubble, the more potential work your processor has to do and the more possiblity for lag, and also the more potential problems when a craft you really weren\u0027t involved with at all gets loaded into physics even if you had no reason to reconsider it at all (e.g. your monstrous LKO 300-part space station happens to fly overhead). We\u0027ll see if this changes with 1.1 (and which might make recovery of boosters a no-brainer in stock).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-08T00:14:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2016 12:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
