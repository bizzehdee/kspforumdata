Problem is, I have to get the stuff from one truck to the other, so I made both the same height and stuck a docking port on the back of each. I tried testing it, and even with the ports perfectly aligned, pushed together with both trucks having handbrakes holding them there (or with the truck I\u0027m in having no brakes on to see if that was the issue) they won\u0027t connect or look like they try connecting.

There is nothing special you have to do to get ground vehicles to dock properly, and these vehicles look perfectly aligned. By chance did you build them stuck together then decouple to test? If so, switch away to the space center then back using the tracking station. That will reload the vessels into physics and reactivate their docking ports. The only other thing I can think of is that there might be a small, nearly invisible part obstructing one or both ports (like a strut buried inside one of them.)
