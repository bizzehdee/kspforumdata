No, probably not. Mathematically? Sure. Assuming you know the appropriate formulae. Have I done this? Nope. Definitely too lazy for all that math to give me no more than close approximations. The water is a lie! Displacement isn\u0027t a factor in KSP so there\u0027s definitely no easy way, but I\u0027m sure a savvy (more willing) mathematician could find those approximate values by starting with the mass and dimensions of each part used on your craft, define their independent volumes and total them up for the whole thing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m very curious how knowing your craft volume makes it easier to build submersibles in KSP though. I\u0027m not certain it\u0027s even relevant unless displacement is a thing. It seems very much tied to a predetermined \u0022bouyancy factor\u0022 for each part instead. For instance: why do wheels which have no internal pressure float? Just how dense is Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ewater\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eif something strong enough to hold up serious weight on land isn\u0027t going straight to the bottom?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI hope it really is easier...

There\u0027s no water displacement in KSP, and KSP\u0027s water is ridiculously dense. Instead, if you want to make a submarine, then you have to overcome bouyancy factor. Each part in KSP have their own buoyancy factor. So far, the easiest method to build submarine in stock play is by using ore tanks. If you fill ore tanks, it\u0027ll have negative buoyancy, which makes the tank (and anything attached to it sinks). Balancing the amount of ore in ore tanks to find neutral buoyancy allows you to build a submarine, with jet engine as propulsion. Bigger ship need more ore tanks to make it sink\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
