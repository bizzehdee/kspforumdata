It didn\u0027t escape anyone\u0027s notice that both these companies offer TV service, and the television service, which consumes digital bandwidth from essentially the same pool as internet bandwidth, is not limited, but if you had Hulu or Netflix TV service, the viewings would count against the cap. I think it\u0027s unmistakably an abuse of monopoly power and a perfect example why internet service ultimately must be regulated like a utility, the same as water or electricity. TLDR, internet is now an essential service just as important as having electricity, and these data caps are not rooted in actual ISP costs - it would be like the power company selling you the first 1000 kilowatt hours for 10 cents each, then charging $1/kwh for the next 100. Totally arbitrary and in no way related to the production of energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, prefetching webpages won\u0027t consume enough bandwidth to matter, but binge watching Netflix 4k shows might...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T19:23:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not so much that it\u0027s wasting bandwidth (although it is, \u003Cem\u003Edepending on how you view it\u003C/em\u003E), but it\u0027s the time and resources spent loading those pages background - it\u0027s chewing up some of the available bandwidth which interferes with the content I sought for to load.
