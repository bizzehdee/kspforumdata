Your vertical speed will be extremely low, especially in the beginning, meaning you spend a long, long time inside the atmosphere at orbital speeds. This is the \u0022Mars atmosphere dilemma\u0022: not enough air to slow you, more than enough air to cook you alive. And yes, this is modeled in KSP now. If you turn on the thermal debug display and observe the skin temperature of your parts exposed to the airstream, you\u0027ll notice them very quickly spiking upwards as soon as you enter the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting a higher vertical speed will, ironically, result in less g-forces and shorter exposure to atmospheric heating. Additionally, you will much sooner encounter the thick parts of the atmosphere, where cold stratospheric air will actually help cool your craft. This is precisely why people find that they can do a direct reentry from Minmus without a heat shield! Because your orbit is so eccentric, the angle at which you enter the atmosphere is much steeper, you blitz through the hot but useless upper reaches of the atmosphere and very quickly get to the useful middle regions where you actually start bleeding off speed. But at the same time, the surface of the planet curves away from your vector of reentry, automatically working to make the angle shallower and keeping you in that middle range longer than you think you would be, letting you slow down safely and gradually without burning up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to observe this happening, I recommend the Trajectories mod. Unfortunately, since stock KSP\u0027s atmospheric calculation code is not publicly available, Trajectories doesn\u0027t work with it in 1.0\u002B. But it does work with Ferram Aerospace Research. It\u0027s a slightly different atmosphere model, but it\u0027s close enough to stock KSP in this regard. You\u0027ll find that, counterintuitively, having a higher apoapsis can oftentimes result in a much gentler reentry path. Trajectories shows your maximum expected G-load while predicting your reentry trajectory; I\u0027ve never been below 4 G on a return from low Kerbin orbit, but I\u0027ve been as low as 3.3 G on a direct reentry from the Mun. (Disclaimer: I play with doubled planet sizes, so your G-loads my vary.) You can then try the same situations with stock aerodynamics and find a similar result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo note that yes, in some respects a high apoapsis is still dangerous. Your parts will blow up if they reach the maximum temp on \u003Cem\u003Eeither\u003C/em\u003E skin \u003Cem\u003Eor\u003C/em\u003E internals. Long, slow reentries from low Kerbin orbit tend to overload your internal temperature limits (this especially happens to spaceplanes); quick, fast reentries from high apoapses tend to overload your skin temperature limits (this is what happens to ships trying to aerobrake at Jool and exploding in a split second, because Jool\u0027s atmosphere is set up wrong). If you have sensitive equipment on board, then a direct Munar reentry will absolutely fry them. However, rocket engines, service bays and pods in particular have such high heat tolerances that they will not fall prey to skin heating at the speeds you encounter anywhere in the Kerbin system. So if you have one of these parts at the bottom of your craft (where it will occlude the more vulnerable parts further up), you will generally be safe on a high apoapsis reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T12:37:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 12:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoodDayMyFriend","CreatedById":148395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T18:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice post.
