I thought a challenge would be the best way to get the most capable/economical design, so here goes:\n\nRequirements:\n\n-6 kerbal capacity\n\n-Space (on hardpoints or in cargo bays) for droppable science packages/extra fuel/other accessories (bonus if you design these)\n\n-Low maintenance costs, so only basic jet engines\n\n-Good handling without tendencies to spin or excessive instability, since this a plane for training kerbals.\n\n-(Preferably) under 30 parts and 18 tonnes so it can be launched without a Runway/SPH upgrade.\n\n-This needs to be an efficient, economical plane since my space program has a low budget, so the lower the purchase cost, the better.\n\n-Also, low fuel burn (in km/unit or units/second) is preferred."},{"CreatedByName":"Andiron","CreatedById":141782,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T16:48:57Z","Content":"[https://www.dropbox.com/s/acwn429qq03nac7/Penghu.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/acwn429qq03nac7/Penghu.craft?dl=0)\n\n![kuMD3rR.png](http://i.imgur.com/kuMD3rR.png)\n\n![jKanW77.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jKanW77.jpg)\n\nHi !\n\nThis is the Penghu, a simple plane which fulfill all the requirements :\n\n6 Kerbal capacity\n\nShort cargo space with a little science dropship inside\n\nOne basic engine, so a very low fuel burn with only 0.122 Uf/s\n\n30 parts and only a 12.8t weight\n\nCorrect purchase cost (27,346) and you can re-use most of it\n\nAndiron"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T17:49:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is the Penghu, a simple plane which fulfill all the requirements :\n\nNice!"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb42","CreatedById":131106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T18:33:12Z","Content":"Hey ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThis is my craft- specs below\n\nParts: 21\n\nMass: 13.1t\n\nHeight: 3.1m\n\nWidth: 10m\n\nLength: 13.2m\n\nCost: 22,460\n\nIt\u0027s pretty efficient, not quite as good as Andirons though!\n\n![j6X83By.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/j6X83By.jpg)\n\n![9QGAM9m.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9QGAM9m.jpg)\n\n![llQmCOv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/llQmCOv.jpg)\n\nI normally stay away from building craft like this, so I appreciate it won\u0027t be brilliant.
