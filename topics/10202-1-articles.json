A couple of weeks ago the comp shut down randomly from time to time, I eventually found that a component on the board had blown up and burnt. It was a hard time finding an AM2 board, and when I did I found one online which cost about 70\u00E2\u201A\u00AC incl. shipping etc, which is a bit much considering the age of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\\\u0027t send you a board, but I can direct you to a shop located in Sweden where I got my board from.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"comradephil","CreatedById":2791,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T10:59:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeh, I don\\\u0027t really have that much to spend in shipping, but PM me the link anyway, maybe it\\\u0027ll be cheaper for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boyercam","CreatedById":21178,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T16:13:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think my motherboard has gone so if anyone would like to perhaps \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003Edonate\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E a motherboard :-[\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo please don\\\u0027t I\\\u0027m going to buy one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"comradephil","CreatedById":2791,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T16:58:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027d have upgraded my entire system, had I had the money, since that\\\u0027s the only way other than an ancient motherboard that my rig is ever going to be up and running again.
