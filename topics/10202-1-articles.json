Then I finally got a Gigabyte board as replacement along with a replacement for the CPU (to the AM2 version), a SATA 2 HD and new RAM . It lasted for years. A couple of weeks ago the comp shut down randomly from time to time, I eventually found that a component on the board had blown up and burnt. It was a hard time finding an AM2 board, and when I did I found one online which cost about 70\u00E2\u201A\u00AC incl. shipping etc, which is a bit much considering the age of it.\n\nI can\\\u0027t send you a board, but I can direct you to a shop located in Sweden where I got my board from."},{"CreatedByName":"comradephil","CreatedById":2791,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T10:59:25Z","Content":"Heh, I don\\\u0027t really have that much to spend in shipping, but PM me the link anyway, maybe it\\\u0027ll be cheaper for me.\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"boyercam","CreatedById":21178,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T16:13:45Z","Content":"I think my motherboard has gone so if anyone would like to perhaps **donate** a motherboard :-[\n\nNo please don\\\u0027t I\\\u0027m going to buy one."},{"CreatedByName":"comradephil","CreatedById":2791,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T16:58:05Z","Content":"I\\\u0027d have upgraded my entire system, had I had the money, since that\\\u0027s the only way other than an ancient motherboard that my rig is ever going to be up and running again.
