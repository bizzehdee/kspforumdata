I launch 2 mission : one for the station with fuel and one for the landers/return/satellites...\n\nThen, I was experimenting on mining tech. I designed a miner which could reorbit 2 big ore tanks (even from Vall and moho). After refuel itself, it can fill at least 43% of an orange tank. I\u0027m smart.\n\nThe new strategy is to bring a smaller fuel tank on the station and be able to refuel it. I\u0027m smart.\n\nThen I noticed the design of the miner would fit nicely as the interstellar tug to push the station to Dres. Perfect, I\u0027m reusing the same engine block. I\u0027m smart.\n\nThen I get that I don\u0027t need Oxydiser (the miner is LVN powered), I could get it from Dres when I get there. Same for the monoprop. Even the return vehicle fuel will be used to get there. I\u0027m smart.\n\nSo all the fuel I bring along will be used for the travel. I\u0027m smart.\n\nThe full station is much lighter than my previous missions (Duna/Eve). I\u0027m smart.\n\nLaunch goes perfectly. I get the node set, I do a nice triple burn (low TWR) and get a perfect intercept, after a mid course correction burn. I\u0027m smart.\n\nI\u0027m circularize at Dres periaps, with even dV left (the margin I took). Calculation were nearly 100% exact. I\u0027m smart.\n\nUntil... I notice I forgot to account for the fuel to land the miner on Dres and get back with it\u0027s load of ore... \n\nNot smart enough though... ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nWarning : failure inbound !\n\n[![9b59bca4-7da8-47cd-ba03-870f826f4504.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview2/9b59bca4-7da8-47cd-ba03-870f826f4504.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/9b59bca4-7da8-47cd-ba03-870f826f4504.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T10:18:35Z","Content":"Time to find a Dresteroid? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T12:05:44Z","Content":"Bring the refinery with you...\n\nThey made the refinery so small and light, I don\u0027t understand why people insist on bringing only ore up to an orbital refinery.\n\nBasically, Any time you\u0027d need more than 4 tons of fuel for the ascent, it is better to bring a refinery with your down to the surface."},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T12:08:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Bring the refinery with you...\n\u003E They made the refinery so small and light, I don\u0027t understand why people insist on bringing only ore up to an orbital refinery.\n\u003E \n\u003E Basically, Any time you\u0027d need more than 4 tons of fuel for the ascent, it is better to bring a refinery with your down to the surface.\n\nit\u0027s only light because Squad misplaced the decimal point in the cfg, expect it to get heavier in the next patch."},{"CreatedByName":"Champ","CreatedById":96425,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T13:32:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E it\u0027s only light because Squad misplaced the decimal point in the cfg, expect it to get heavier in the next patch.\n\nSource ?"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T13:57:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E it\u0027s only light because Squad misplaced the decimal point in the cfg, expect it to get heavier in the next patch.\n\nWhy would you do that to us, ignorance is blis. lol.

You refine the ore into LF for the nukes, until your fuel tanks are full. Then you fill up your Ore tanks.\n\nWhat mass of fuel do you need to take with you for the ascent? If it is over 4.25 tons, you are better off taking a refinery, and producing the ascent fuel on the ground.\n\nIt really is as simple as that.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I tried various configuration and the most efficient was only to return ore and refine in space.\n\nThis is only true if you use less than 4.25 tons of fuel on the ascent. Obviously, as the lander gets bigger, you will quickly exceed that by a lot. To move large quantities of stuff, you want big landers, and the refinery will quickly weigh less than the amount fo fuel you need for the ascent."},{"CreatedByName":"strigon","CreatedById":123021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T16:35:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So... only a bit more heavy than a Mk 1-2 command pod? for what it does for you? yea... that is light.\n\u003E Its somewhere in size between a Rockomax X200-16 Fuel Tank and a Rockomax X200-32 Fuel Tank, which mass 9/18 tons....\n\u003E \n\u003E So its not very dense.\n\nAm I the only one who thinks the Mk 1-2 is ridiculously overweight?\n\nActually, screw that; that all of the command pods, save for the Mk 1 and 1-man lander are ridiculously overweight, or at least that those two are underweight?

Part count for the win!\n\nMaybe it\u0027s still overweight, but it\u0027s certainly not useless.\n\nEDIT: What about the new asteroid-day advanced HECS probe core? Only twice the weight of a regular HECS (0.2T vs 0.1T), 100 times the battery and the most powerful non-dedicated reaction wheels of any command part. I love it as a part and I think it needs severe nerfing.\n\nEDIT 2: Well, did some research. The Mk 1-2 has three times the battery, reaction control and monoprop as it should. Other than the crash tolerance (45 m/s vs 14 m/s for the smaller pod), it\u0027s pretty sensical. However, this still leaves it 1.5 or so tons heavier than it really should be. If you put a \u0022hardened shell\u0022 tax on it, I think around 3 tons for this part would be fair.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T17:14:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 05:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by moogoob**\n  \nresearch"}]}
