I launch 2 mission : one for the station with fuel and one for the landers/return/satellites...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, I was experimenting on mining tech. I designed a miner which could reorbit 2 big ore tanks (even from Vall and moho). After refuel itself, it can fill at least 43% of an orange tank. I\u0027m smart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new strategy is to bring a smaller fuel tank on the station and be able to refuel it.
