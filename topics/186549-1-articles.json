Issue is as soon as I leave Kerbal orbit all my controls except esc to menu and right clicking the fuel tanks have stopped working. I have tried 12 times with several builds and read up on several pages on the net. Tried alt f12 and my debug menu does not come up at all, has this changed in the PC version? Also Does this have something to do with new maneuver menus? \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#1a1a1b\u0022\u003EDeleted all my saves,\u00A0 and started fresh and tried several different ship builds.\u00A0 No matter what I do as soon as I leave Kerbal orbit I have no control of my ship.\u00A0 \u00A0Tried in both sandbox and science mode.\u00A0\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#1a1a1b\u0022\u003EShould I uninstall the game and trying reinstalling?\u00A0 \u00A0Rather frustrating at this point,\u00A0 if anyone could help or has any ideas - at this point I can not play the game.\u00A0 \u00A0 Thank you!\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#1a1a1b\u0022\u003EPS the only mod I have installed in MechJeb which I tried removing and still doesn\u0027t\u00A0work.\u00A0 \u00A0I have all the DLCs installed and the game is up to date.\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anth","CreatedById":161238,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-20T23:12:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndo you have solar panels?
