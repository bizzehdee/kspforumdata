I need to make one correction: I was never an airline pilot, and do not have anywhere close to that much flight experience. I hold a Commercial Pilot certificate and thus could in theory be paid to fly airplanes, however that has never been my job. I spent a whole lot more time turning wrenches, inspecting and repairing airplanes, than I did piloting them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a suggestion, if I may.
