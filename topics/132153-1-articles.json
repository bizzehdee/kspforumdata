Often multiple if 1 doesnt get me enough TWR on that stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeriving from the fact that you keep asking for either throttable or multiple ignitions engines, it appears to me that the problem does not lie with choosing wrong engines or rocket design, but with the way you ascend into orbit. If you want multiple ignitions, it seems to me that you first raise your AP to out of the atmosphere, then switch of your engines, wait untill AP, and then circulize. Thats (not the most effective) but a possible way to gain orbit in stock, in RO its really a very bad way though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you want to do is pitch a few degrees east pretty much straight from the launchpad (I usually do this when I reach a speed op 40 m/s). Then keep following your prograde marker. You will slowly increase your AP while you gain alot of horizontal speed. I often make orbit after reaching my AP (which is usually 200km or so).
