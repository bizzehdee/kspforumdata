When switching to other vessel, the game stucks in the black screen. If I press ESC at that point, I can see the vessel I\u0027m switching to behind the menu, but in odd textures and parts missing, and the game crashes there. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s related to any mod I\u0027ve installed recently (only new one is Kerbal Inventory For All - KIFA, but removing it didn\u0027t solve the issue), or to the new 1.11.2 update, but downgrade to 1.11.1 also didn\u0027t work. I also decomissioned a lot of old crafts, guessing if it was an overload of vessels in game, but it was of no help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t know what to do. I don\u0027t wanna lose all space exploration kerbals took so long to build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be very appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-13T09:34:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe actions you\u2019ve tried are the best solutions so it might be the persistent save file has got\u00A0corrupted.
