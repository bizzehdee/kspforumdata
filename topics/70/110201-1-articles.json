Once it is disabled, go into Kerbal Space Program and go to \u0027Settings\u0027. Set your anti aliasing to be off and make certain that \u0027fullscreen\u0027 is enabled. Once you\u0027ve done this, exit out, re-enable OPENGL, except this time do not include the popwindow command. Just do -force-opengl\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t work,\n\n**Method 2:**\n\nDisable whatever you did to enable OPENGL. In the Launch Options (I\u0027m assuming you have the steam version of KSP) instead of -force-opengl try typing -force-d3d11 and see if that changes anything for you.\n\nJust a shot in the dark; good luck man.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T15:27:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 03:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OddFunction**"},{"CreatedByName":"razanon","CreatedById":94540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T17:46:22Z","Content":"ill try it thx master"},{"CreatedByName":"LividPumpkin","CreatedById":133424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T11:20:45Z","Content":"When I run ksp on opengl mode i get a high fps drop i have tried to use d3d11 but the same maybe not the d3d11 is better but still have some fps drops so what to do ? and yeah iam playing with full res and with tons of mods i get aroud 3.5 or 3.6 GB ram and then the game crashes (this is original not opengl) when i put it on half res i get 2.5 or 2.8 GB ram that\u0027s great but the quality then will be lower so should i play on full res or half res ?"},{"CreatedByName":"sshadowwraith","CreatedById":142601,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T18:11:27Z","Content":"I have what may be the same issue as razanon. Whenever I try to launch a vessel, either from the runway or the launchpad, the screen goes black. When I try to revert, or return to the KSC, the solar system is gone and the starry background is the only thing visible. I have been using the -force-opengl, but am considering just playing without it.
