The pause menu also doesn\u0027t show for some reason when this happens, and nothing works, so\u00A0game restart is required. Upon reopening the game, and loading the craft in question, the load menu doesn\u0027t disappear, and needs to be told to cancel, even though it has already loaded the craft (this only happens when I\u0027m having these issues). The craft size, weight and cost are all set to unknown, and the craft refuses to launch. Also, it appears to be unedditable. This issue is repeatable, and consistent with ALL large craft with SXT pods, and doesn\u0027t happen without the SXT pods. Any help would be greatly appreciated, as I really like the SXT pods!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalBuzzsaw","CreatedById":158329,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-25T16:55:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow large?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
