I can\u0027t really see any of these being game breaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there anything I can tweak in the save file to fool the game? Or is there something about this release that is too big to save my progress?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be nice if they automatically put the last version up on Steam as a beta to roll back to, but that hasn\u0027t happened....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dafni","CreatedById":149636,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-30T13:02:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s good advice to never mod your steam install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust copy your KSP to another directory, play and mod it as you like, keep old installs etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet steam update its version of the game. Copy the new versions to your own KSP folders. Play whatever you want, at any time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany players keep playing old versions of the game. And most seasoned players stay away from x.x.0 releases too, always wait for a hotfix or two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou save yourself a lot of headache this way. It\u0027s nice that KSP is not buond to Steam and we should take advantage of that for as long as we can. Who knows how KSP2 will handle this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for recovering your old save file, I dont see why it shouldn\u0027t work? Maybe because the mods are missing? Wait for the mods to update and try again maybe? Best advice I can give you is to proceed as I described above from now on. Maybe steam makes 1.11.0\u00A0 available?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Danger2007","CreatedById":71663,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-30T14:32:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I should have just copied the whole lot to a separate folder to draw a line in the sand.\u00A0 I love KSP, but I\u0027m getting a bit bored of starting again over and over to experience the latest features. I\u0027d rather wait for a year or something and get a large \u0022final update\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I didn\u0027t expect the hotfix to break things quite this much. Last time it updated it would let me open my save and carry on. I think I\u0027ll wait for now and update my mods to see if that will fix it, or hope for a steam beta for the last version.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m hoping with KSP 2 and all the delays that it\u0027ll be just one main release with all the features that just works lol . Perhaps that\u0027s just me being old school though!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there\u0027s nothing in the code of my save file that could be tweaked or deleted to try to fool the game? Potentially that makes things unstable, but I\u0027ll try it with a copy to see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany thanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HansAcker","CreatedById":195534,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-31T10:11:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223917273\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199944\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221612017167\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002271663\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Danger2007\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, Danger2007 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I didn\u0027t expect the hotfix to break things quite this much.
