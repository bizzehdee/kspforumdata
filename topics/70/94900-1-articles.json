I use Jumbo32 (3.2xScale) so it was a little higher. every time you warp from inside a planetary SOI, go over the limit and drop out in interplanetary space this bug occurs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing to fix it (at least I found nothing yet) but a workaround: Don\u0027t use faster than 100.000 X Warp from inside an planets SOI and make a quicksave everytime you enter Interplanetary. that seems to work around it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now excuse me, I have to gather Seismic Data from Duna with a Rover for Moving Parts Inc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
