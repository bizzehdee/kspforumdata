As I was loading KSP, it gave me a list of out of date mods and as of now, out of the five outdated mods I had, I have not been able to find FireSpitter. The versions I do find on Curse and Kerbalstuff are for .24.2 and is version 6.3.5. KSP-AVC-1 says I need version 7.

In the case of Firespitter, that file is located \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/snjo/Firespitter/blob/master/For%20release/Firespitter/Firespitter.version\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. As you can see, the version listed in there is version 7 - this is why AVC is telling you you need it. The problem is, the last proper \u0027release\u0027 of Firespitter included the 6.3.5 .version file which AVC is checking against that link and reporting it\u0027s out of date. This won\u0027t change unless your local .version file is changed - either manually or downloading the updated one. The quickest way to do is to download the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/snjo/Firespitter/archive/master.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGithub master here\u003C/a\u003E and copy across the Firespitter-master.zip\\Firespitter-master\\For release\\Firespitter folder to your KSP install like any other (i.e pretend that \u0027Firespitter-master.zip\\Firespitter-master\\For release\u0027 means \u0027Gamedata\u0027. Do not copy across Firespitter-master/Firespitter as that is the source code and not used by KSP. You want the Firespitter folder inside \u0027For release\u0027). This has the bonus of getting the updated plugin as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
