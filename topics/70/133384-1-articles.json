So, let\u0027s say I was landing on the Mun, I pause the game to get something to eat. When I get back, I\u0027m a pile of debris on the surface. Even the mission report menu thing doesn\u0027t pause time. Any suggestions or ideas on what to do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSidenote: it may have something to do with Stock Extension conflicting with KSP\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
