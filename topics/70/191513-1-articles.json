So I tried uninstalling mods and reinstalling them to see which one was the culprit and apparently it was ReStock and Restock\u002B. I don\u0027t know what causes this problem maybe a patch from Module Manager I don\u0027t know. If anyone has any input or any ideas so I can have all of these mods work together please let me know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rukongai","CreatedById":200936,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-09T15:17:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I figured it out leaving this here if anyone has the same problem some day. Apparently the way ReStock works is it prevent the stock parts from loading at all so that it can save up memory(which is really cool if you ask me xD). This means that parts of mods that are dependent on this such as the drills from MKS won\u0027t be able to load since they can\u0027t find the model. Only thing I had to do was whitelist the specific part that the drills needed(which was the TribitDrill). ReStock has an excellent wiki entry on this take a look\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/PorktoberRevolution/ReStocked/wiki/Asset-Blacklist-and-Whitelist\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E if you are interested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
