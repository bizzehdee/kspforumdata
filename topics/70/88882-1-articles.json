In fact this is the first game I have bought since I bought AoE II in the 20th century. I got Steam just to play KSP because I loved the demo so much (found a KSP post on imgur late one night, and was hooked there after). This is the first game I have ever owned that can be modded, so I am sure I messed it up some where. I have tried to do self help from the forum, but I am giving up, I need help from some one that knows what they are doing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have sending in a Monk or two, but they were unable to heal fast enough. I have uninstalled every mod, and that did not fix it. I was running it on Windows 64 before I knew that it would crash because it was running on 64.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T20:11:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMonk!
