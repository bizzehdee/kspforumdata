I have pretty good idea what might have caused this, but I am not sure HOW exactly. I have checked and it is definetly caused by those parts. One thing that those 2 parts have in common is the fact, that the part switch menu allows switching between different models of the part (i.e. rover and lander versions of the Mk2 lander can). I have now checked and it is, in fact, caused by the switching module of the part (in the Mk4-1 pod\u0027s case at least, verified by removing the module and the sunflares working properly after that). I am now wondering what has the switching part to do with sunflare disappearance... any suggestions welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: How do you duplicate parts to compensate for this switching problem, will copying the .cfg file and replacing the referenced model for it work just fine or do I have to do something more complicated?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor42","CreatedById":179819,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-26T21:46:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, issue solved, it was a problem with scatterer, updating to latest version of scatterer fixed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
