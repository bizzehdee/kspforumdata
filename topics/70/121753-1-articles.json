I experience crashes frequently when switching from a vessel to the Space Center or to another Vessel. I do not know if it could be related, but I typically maintain a habit of saving before switching just because I expect these crashes. I was going to report this issue here, but recently came across (in my opinion) a slightly more serious bug where I can not hire kerbals in the Astronaut Complex any longer. The value to hire is 0 and if I click the green button to hire, nothing happens. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a lot of research in this and understand it comes from a corrupted save, more specific a Kerbal is typically assigned with an idx value of -1. Related, I had a contract to rescue a Kerbal stranded on Minmus. I went to complete this (some time after having accepted the contract) and the kerbal and his debris were not available. I cancelled the contract and moved on. This was some time ago and I spent a lot of time after that doing a lot of stuff that did not require me hiring more kerbals. I can not for the life of me remember the stranded kerbal\u0027s name. I assume that he is the issue here. If someone could help me find which one is causing my problem, I would greatly appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: Looking through the roster in the persistent file, it seems that there are several kerbals that are duplicate names and have state = Assigned with idx = -1 and flight = 0. I am not sure if they are also issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/4e4rpqh7e6ax2h7/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPersistent file\u003C/a\u003E and my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/azq7bzt2w935ryw/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOutput Log\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can provide anything else requested including my huge list of addons if needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe astronaut complex is more dire to me as it removes functionality, but if someone could also figure out my crashing issues which are more just annoying, that would be wonderful too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RGBPeter","CreatedById":62128,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T19:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have almost 40 kerbals who have \u0022state = Unowned\u0022 ( who are in need of rescue because of a contract).

Also you savefile stats that your AC level = 1, I\u0027m assuming you are running Kerbal Konstruction Time or somthing else that changes how the KSC works.

I attempted to fix this by removing the unowned kerbals except Disan and loading up the game to recover Disan. Upon loading, I had no active contracts. After this (with a copy of the original persistent file) I removed those unowned including Disan and removed the contract too. I loaded the game and still no active contracts showed in my contract window. I used yet another copy of the original persistent, loaded the game and before entering the save noticed that the description of the save under the list showed my values for science, flights, etc, but 0 for contracts. So I lose the contracts upon load of the game before entering my save. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I did have KCT installed at one point and removed it immediately. I have no other addons that change KSC functionality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if because of the combination of addons that I have that this may be getting complicated with potential conflicts of addons, but could one alternative to being able to hire new kerbals with this save be to just add them in the roster? I could simply copy and paste other kerbals that I have in the roster as available but not assigned and just change their names and values to what I want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cornholio","CreatedById":94349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T19:11:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo slightly a bump but also wanted to say that I just added a bunch of kerbals to my roster and will copy them when I need more.
