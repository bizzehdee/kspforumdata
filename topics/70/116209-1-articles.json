Indirectly. Just reading your back-and-forth has helped me find and fix numerous conflicts.\n\nHowever, I am stumped this time. I have a comm sat which I imported from a previous game, which loads under local control every time I build and launch it. I have tried replacing the OKTO control module, but I simply don\u0027t have it in me to reconstruct the 150 part beauty and launcher from scratch. Is there a variable in the .craft file that I can change to enable linked control (and by default, the flight computer?)\n\nThanks kindly!"}]}
