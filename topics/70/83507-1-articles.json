Since I already have some Snacks on ships the game seems to crash when loading up without Snacks. I really want to play with Snacks but I can\u0027t figure out how to solve this problem. I have no idea what could be causing this since I don\u0027t know how to tell when somethings not working in the output_log. I do realize 64-bit has problems and stuff but it was working for me before. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/99tbgd87oxr1eec/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOutput_Log\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone could point out some conflict of a mod in the output_log or tell me how to fix this bug that would be great! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Buttons that don\u0027t work are stock toolbar ones that are mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-01T06:00:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2014 06:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tygoo7\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T03:01:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease follow the guidelines in the stickied thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T05:49:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPlease follow the guidelines in the stickied thread.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks Nathan, didn\u0027t see that.
