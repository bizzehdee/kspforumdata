This has happend a few times now this week and it never happend before! i havent even installed more mods.\n\nI\u0027ve researced a little, and i think this \u0022thing\u0022 happening, is called the \u0022kraken\u0022. but thats supposed to be fixed a long time ago right?? And yes, i tried reinstalling the game\n\nif u guys want me to upload a video, so u guys can see how it happens exacly, just tell in the comments.\n\nMods installed: Interstellar 0.90, B9 aerospace, SCANsat, Near future Solar.\n\nPlease help if any1 can ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) i really dont have play KSP untill this is fixed, since i basicly cant progress safely."},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T17:40:12Z","Content":"This happened to me before, I was in low Mun orbit and I quicksaved a couple kilometres up. I screwed up my landing so I reloaded the save and when everything loaded, it just spontaneously exploded. I don\u0027t think I had any mods installed at that point so it\u0027s a bug in the stock game.\n\nI fixed it by editing the save file in Notepad, I increased the altitude of the ship by a few metres."},{"CreatedByName":"Nutter","CreatedById":1225,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T18:29:44Z","Content":"Do you happen to clip certain parts inside of your ships, perhaps?\n\nI\u0027ve had a whole boatload of problems like that loading ships from a save or from the tracking station until about a week ago.
