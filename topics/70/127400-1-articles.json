I know that lasers would be a better option for shooting down projectiles, but they aren\u0027t as good of an AA weapon as the goalkeepers, and I already know that in guard mode, the weapon manager selects only one weapon to use against a target.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know if there is a way I can set up my plane so it uses lasers against projectiles, but the goalkeepers against aircraft? Could I get it to use both against a single target?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, when I replaced those goalkeepers with 35mm oerlikon millenium CIWS, I found them able to shoot down small, fast missiles more often\u00A0than the goalkeepers. This completely surprised me because I expected the opposite to occur. Does anyone know of\u00A0whether oerlikons are more effective CIWS than goalkeepers? Because if I can\u0027t set up my plane to fire multiple weapons on multiple targets, then I may end up replacing the goalkeepers with oerlikons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAns lastly, does more gun equate to a higher chance of shooting down missiles? If I were to add another four goalkeepers, would my chances of shooting down small, fast missiles go up a significant amount?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-09T21:28:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2015 09:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by drtricky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"idriveaTARDIS","CreatedById":154794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T04:35:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\njust a question, how did you fit 4 rotary naval turrets on a plane?meanwhile in soviet russia, it\u0027s a russian tank turned into a plane, or possibly vice versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/AntonovA40.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AntonovA40.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drtricky","CreatedById":154647,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T07:56:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222316079\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127400\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449722154\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154794\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022idriveaTARDIS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, idriveaTARDIS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\njust a question, how did you fit 4 rotary naval turrets on a plane?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022782_zpsgqludlh7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n633/drt-ricky/782_zpsgqludlh7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-10T08:04:13Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2015 08:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by drtricky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
