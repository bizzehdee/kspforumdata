I did some pretty extensive testing to boot. The \u0022OTP J inline docking port\u0022 is the culprit. Something with it\u0027s extending mechanism triggers the game to think your vessel is penetrating the ground at spawn and proceeds to move spawn location 1km above. I believe this is so the game will not crash when physics are activated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-10T21:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, this has all been talked about extensively throughout the OPT threads.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKnown issue with, yes, several of the parts with deployable doors/ramps/docking ports.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA temporary fix, is to install the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/169206-131-18x-worldstabilizer-bugfix-for-vessels-bouncing-on-scene-load/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EWorld Stabilizer\u00A0 \u003C/a\u003Emod till OPT gets fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
