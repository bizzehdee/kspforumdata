With the help of a file recovery program, I was able to recover my persistent.sfs and a few of my quicksave backups, but when I try to load them I get an error stating that my KSP version is wrong. I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ve reinstalled the exact same mods, and there have not been any KSP updates in the last couple days. Does anyone have any suggestions? I was running a Lets Play series, and would really like to not have to start over.

You could open it and see if there is something wrong, perhaps compare it to a new save game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also try creating a new career save and then copying sections of your old file into the new save. Do the contracts, then the ships, etc... Maybe your recovered files got corrupted and restoring it by sections might give you a clue where the problem is and eventually fix it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are guesses thought, I never edited a savefile but I know you can open and read them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kalil","CreatedById":151135,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T22:57:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, thanks much for that info. It looks like the files I recovered are in fact corrupted - lots of chunks missing and gibberish inserted. I could reconstruct bits and pieces, but that looks like more effort than it\u0027d be worth. Oh well.
