Since I had to create a new save file to get the spawns to occur, I went ahead and added a few mods. Before the mods and update I could easily land my planes in the water by flying over and then deploying chutes. I was landing with a vertical speed of -5 m/s. For some reason now under identical circumstances when I land, certain parts seem to explode and my cockpit goes shooting up into the air several hundred feet. I\u0027ve had planes break apart before when landing on water, but nothing so violent as now. It seems the explosion might be coming from my Materials Lab. Is there a log somewhere that I can access to see the parts destroyed, possibly in the order they were destroyed so that I can further analyze my failed landings? I did have RealChutes installed, but removed it due to instability and lack of parachute control. Currently I think I just have mods that affect the visuals and sound (like Chatterer), but nothing which should affect the actual physics. Is it possible that it could be temperature related since after long flights the Wheezley engine is glowing hot and the rest of the craft is hot due to flying at Mach 1 for half an hour and contact with water is causing the destruction? I know that is a stretch, but at this point I\u0027m just tossing out ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxPeck","CreatedById":145248,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-18T22:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis happened to me too. \u00A0I flew a science drone west from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E out over the water and then attempted to parachute recover it. \u00A0It hit the water ~5m/s and exploded like it was made out of TNT. \u00A0I mean, it was a straight Michael Bay moment. \u00A0I\u0027m not sure why, I\u0027ve had other stuff land in the water just fine returning from orbit, and I\u0027ve water launched vessels, so I don\u0027t know what could\u0027ve caused it on that specific instance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-18T23:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223621246\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185608\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221560890821\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022196515\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r3_141592654\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, r3_141592654 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a log somewhere that I can access to see the parts destroyed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can press F3 to bring up the flight log (gotta do it just after or during the crash, once you\u0027ve switched back to the space centre I don\u0027t think you can get that info).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027ll show you what impacted with what and what exploded. on a whole craft Katastrophe it\u0027s a bit of a mess, but scroll to the top and that should show the first things to go Kerboom.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would suggest taking all mods out and making a fresh stock save to determine if it\u0027s mod or core game related.
