The saves and persistent files are text based and only in the kilobit range. My guess is that you are getting real close or at the 32 bit memory limit for RAM (about 3.5 gigs). THAT causes more crashes than anything.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDepending on your OS, you might want to consider the 64 bit hack that\u0027s available. A search here will bring up a few threads. I\u0027ve done the Mac OSX 64 bit hack and it was well worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
