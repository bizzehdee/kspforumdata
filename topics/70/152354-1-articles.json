It will not drive to the north. If I try to turn to the north, it will not stay on course, and steers away. The closer to \u0022north\u0022 I get, the slower it goes, and it simply won\u0027t drive to the north.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only mods I have installed are \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, a light pack (which is not used on this rover) and the expanded parts mod that Kerbal supplies, although no non-standard parts are on the rover, other than the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can supply a save if you like. It should work without the other mods, but you probably need \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E due to the module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nETA: OK, I\u0027ve got to modify this. It will drive to the north. The problem was I was on a gentle incline that faced north. The real problem seems to be that it won\u0027t accelerate up even small inclines. It uses the smallest rover wheels, and it just won\u0027t go up a hill that seems to be less than a 5 degree incline. Once you get to more level ground, it works fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-21T12:29:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2016 12:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RocketBlam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-21T17:40:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222858938\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152354\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221479730346\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103420\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketBlam\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, RocketBlam said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat seems to be less than a 5 degree incline\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, check out the Slope readout in the Surface panel, it should tell you exactly what the slope is (and the heading of the downhill direction)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-22T09:43:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould it be because you placed a command pod facing upward instead of forward?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-22T10:07:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and reaction wheels off.
