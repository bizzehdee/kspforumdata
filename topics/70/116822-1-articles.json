I tried to install some mods on the 1.0.4 version of KSP, and when I went to the VAB to check out my new parts, it was broken. Scince I had this issue with an earlier version of KSP, I was pretty pissed.\n\nSo the problem:\n\nstep 1: install some mods\n\n open KSP, open a world go to VAB, check out parts, go out of VAB and world and shut down the game.\n\n add another mod (or change, I got the problem to when I was deleting parts from MRS once)\n\nstep 2: do this several times\n\nthen somewhere in this cycle th VAB would become unplayable. N o parts would be shown, texts were written through each other and the flag menu was blurred.\n\n The only thing you can then do is exit the VAB. \n\nThe sad thing is that deleting the mod does not help. Going with a complete vanilla game would still have this broken VAB thing.\n\nI would need to reinstall KSP to actually get it working again. (luckily I didn\u0027t do anything before this happened)\n\nDoes anyone know whats happening here, and how to fix it."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T17:59:47Z","Content":"Not without [more information](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29), no.\n\nIf it remains broken after \u0022deleting the mod\u0022 (which one?) then I suspect something is corrupting the save file.
