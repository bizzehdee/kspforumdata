I am currently trying to install some mods to make my game look amazing, and there are some strange things going on.\u00A0 I download Scatterer, A.V.P. and E.V.E. etc, etc and put them and their required dependencies into the GameData folder. Then, I unzip the zip files and load KSP. The first time I did this, Scatterer and Module Manager loaded perfectly, but the others did not. I looked into it, and apparently there\u00A0 is some sort of GameData folder inside of the mod folder that you have to remove or something like that. I have watched lots of tutorials, but I still can\u0027t get it. Thanks so much!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-07T00:41:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E for mod installs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tony Duhon","CreatedById":230056,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-10T01:37:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I recommend \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0as well.
