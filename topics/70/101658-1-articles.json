Once I load into the game (after like 20 minutes), I am confronted with a horrific sight; Kerbin is all pink with a red haze. I did all I could to try and remove this, including deleting EVE/AVP-Interstellar, but it doesn\u0027t work!\n\nI would love it if someone could help me here... That is, unless the Kraken were to blame for this."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceExplorer","CreatedById":138160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T22:51:54Z","Content":"First off, please post more information as seen [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29). From what you have currently posted it seems to me that you may have installed EVE incorrectly, (putting files into the wrong place.... I\u0027ve done that before too) thus meaning the core files for the game were overwritten. It could also be a incompatibility issue between mods, but since you have removed those mods, there should be no conflict. My best suggestion would be to uninstall and reinstall KSP, allowing you to require the overwritten core files. I hope this helps, it is always scary to boot up your game and see something totally unexpected."}]}
