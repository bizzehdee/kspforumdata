Module mMnager is an example of a mod that a lot of other mods require, and mod makers are generally allowed to include Module Manager in their files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you open your gamedata folder inside your KSP folder and the one in the mod download folder you\u0027ll likely see a few folders and perhaps a few .dll files. Your system is likely warning you about overwriting these when it gave you that error.
