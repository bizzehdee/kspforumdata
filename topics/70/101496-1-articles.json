I have several Dragon V2 pods docked on it from Lazteks Space X mod, and everything was great until I decided to delete some mod files from the FASA mod. After realizing that that option wiped the station, I re-downloaded the whole mod and everything seemed to work again, that is until I tried to undock one of my pods. Nothing happened. \n\nI can dock and undock newer crafts that I put on the station, the offending pods are the pods that I docked before I had to re-install the mod. Is there a way that I can fix the pods to make them undock from the station correctly?"},{"CreatedByName":"JAFO","CreatedById":132901,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T02:02:12Z","Content":"Having had some issues in the past with a docking port that refused all docking attempts with it\\*, I\u0027d suggest checking in your game-save\u0027s *persistent.sfs* file for mismatched uid numbers.\n\nEach docking port on the station will have a uid number assigned to it, as will the docking port on each pod. The docking ports of docked vessels should have matching dockUId numbers of the other vessel associated with them.\n\nMy guess is that when you un and re-installed FASA, possibly some of the uid numbers got out of whack. Depending on how many docking ports and docked modules you have, it may be a bit of a chore to figure out which ports are which. If/when you are sure you\u0027ve found a problem, you\u0027ll need to edit the uid numbers to match. If you can identify a pair of ports which **are** functioning properly, it should provide you with an example for setting things right. Odds are it would take quite a bit of detective work, so I\u0027d suggest you back up the *persistent.sfs* file, undock one (working) pod, save and back up again, then compare the two backed up files to see what\u0027s changed. You may need to do this a few times to get a clear picture of which ports are which. Be sure to only edit the backups. When you think you\u0027ve got it fixed, swap the edited backup in, in place of the original *persistent.sfs*, and see if it works.\n\nIt really can be a bit of a PITA to sort out, especially if you have lots of ports to check, so good luck with it.\n\n\\* In my case, somehow the dockUId number on my station did not get reset to 0 when I\u0027d undocked earlier. The result was that the docking port thought it was still docked with, so it ignored all attempts to dock with it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T02:07:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 02:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JAFO**\n  \nedited for clarity"},{"CreatedByName":"alexman142","CreatedById":134322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T02:53:05Z","Content":"Thanks.\n\nThankfully, there are only two ports that I have to deal with.
