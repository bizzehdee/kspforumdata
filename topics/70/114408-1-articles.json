The build is going fine, the Workshop sped up production greatly once I connected it to the EL Station lander with a winch. But when I took one of my Engineers and entered the Workshop, they no longer show up in the lower-right of the screen. Right-clicking on the Workshop doesn\u0027t show an option to view their inventory either, like I can with other pods (have KIS installed too, obviously). Production Value went way up though when the Engineer entered, so it registered. I just have no way to get the poor guy out.\n\nI would hope a last-ditch effort would be to land the Workshop back at Kerbin, but I wasn\u0027t planning on having him go back for a while. Is there any other way to exit the Workshop? Is this normal until the ship-build is complete? Any input would be greatly appreciated."}]}
