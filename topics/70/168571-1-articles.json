Using thermal turbojets seemed like a decent option for an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E meant to go to and from anywhere since it can use the atmosphere with no fuel consumption for good-ish thrust, and provde extra boost in space with different fuels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it drives me insane. When I attach it to some random node, it works just fine. But when I put it anywhere useful, like a bicoupler in the back, it totally breaks. It only allows me to select from about 5 fuels, when I launch it it goes down to just hydrogen, and then it accepts neither liquid, nor gas hydogen when I try to at least test that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I take the working jet, set it to atmospheric, then place it in the back, it will switch to hydrogen as soon as i launch, and then stay like that when i revert to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone encountered something similar or at least knows what may be causing the issue?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPs.: A fine spaceplane prototype was turned into a mess of a test bed due to this.
