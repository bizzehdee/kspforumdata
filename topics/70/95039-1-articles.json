For an hour or so, it went great: I would crash, get out, fix the tires, get rolling again. I did this a couple times. Eventually, I headed back toward an outpost. Once I got there, I attempted to fix the tires again (I like driving erraticly, okay?) my engineer seemed to have forgotten how. It would tell me that I need at least a level three engineer etc. etc. My Kerbal is still level three, so I ended up flying another level 3 out to do his job for him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR : My level 3 engineer hit his head a few times and forgot how to fix tires.
