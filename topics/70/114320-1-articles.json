I deleted the save and made a new one, but, when I loaded it, it was stuck in a camera position looking inbetween the R\u0026D and the VAB. The sun didn\u0027t mode and the clock was stuck on Year 1, Day 1, 0 hrs, 0 mins, and I could only click the bottom buttons, which means only Time Warp and exiting the game worked. I deleted and reloaded again, same thing. I didn\u0027t install anything in that period of time before it broke. I have no idea what\u0027s causing this other than it\u0027s affecting my whole game and might be a softlock.\n\nEDIT: Time Warp only works when clicking Warp To Next Morning, and the timer doesn\u0027t change.\n\nEDIT2: It works now, like most issues I post on here.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T06:10:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 06:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheJewelOfJool**\n  \nMissed a period.
