I\u0027ve noticed something extremely similar to this as well in 1.1.2. If you orient it vertically and launch on the runway, the Kraken immediately (even with the throttle cut all the way down to 0) accelerates it horizontally in a random direction in excess of 1000m/s (and stays pretty close to the ground). This only works with the command pod (I tried replicating it with the radially-mounted case, and it doesn\u0027t happen, and it also doesn\u0027t happen when just using stock parts). This works even with launch clamps on the side (and will drag the clamps along with it). I have not tried this from the VAB, so I don\u0027t know if its just a SPH/runway related thing or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grenartia","CreatedById":142469,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T21:21:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it works from the launchpad, too. And just to clarify, this does not happen when the pod is oriented horizontally. Although I have gotten it to work by orienting it horizontally and then tilting vertically after dropping it from a launch clamp, but it only seems to work in that case once the pod touches the ground. Which is weird because it didn\u0027t have to any other time I tried it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalBuzzsaw","CreatedById":158329,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T22:50:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy are you still in 1.1.0?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
