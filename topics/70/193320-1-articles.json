I upgraded my game from 1.4.5 to 1.9.1. I love the upgrade but odd thing happened. I had a fleet of 5 ships headed to Duna. After the upgrade one of them was no longer there. A quick search found the missing ship, about 90 degrees out of phase in its transfer orbit, no longer with a Duna interception. It\u0027s like it was launched 3 months later than the rest of the fleet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI played around with manuveur nodes to see what I could do with it.. intercept Duna again or return to Kerbin but it was so out of place, would have been years before an intercept would happen. I did go to the cheat menu and brought it into orbit of Duna where they\u0027ll wait until the rest of the fleet shows up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
