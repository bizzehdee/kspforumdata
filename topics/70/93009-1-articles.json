Then I tried to return to the Space Center, through the main menu, and that didn\u0027t work either. I had to quit the game to do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod installed: MechJeb 2.4.1, although I haven\u0027t researched any MJ modules or used it in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: Upon restarting and going to R\u0026amp;D, I tried to quit out of R\u0026amp;D, and this happened (see upper-right corner and lower-right corner). The message log button is now overlaid over the close button. Neither close button works. Now I can\u0027t quit from R\u0026amp;D or even quit to the main menu, so again I had to kill the app.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I removed MechJeb and it\u0027s still doing it. The game is basically unplayable at this point, as near as I can tell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA 2: In that save, clicking on the VAB or the Tracking Station does nothing, now. Clicking on the Astronaut Complex brings it up, and I can leave it, but then nothing in the game works. Nothing is clickable. The save is corrupted apparently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/edKFkHC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022edKFkHC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-16T01:31:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2014 01:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RocketBlam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T01:30:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease read the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHow to Get Support (READ FIRST)\u003C/a\u003E sticky and post the requested information.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T01:39:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1Q3CkBZDIsFVWVlUWl4UDU2Nmc/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere is a link to the log file.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t a clean install, I just removed all my old mods after installing the .90 update, so there could be an issue there.
