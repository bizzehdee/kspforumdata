Once you capture the science you have to return it to kerbin or transmit it to complete the contract.\n\n![E7Q5l82.png](http://i.imgur.com/E7Q5l82.png)\n\n![HpkCd6f.png](http://i.imgur.com/HpkCd6f.png)\n\nSo to get support:\n\n1) What version of TST are you using? Are you using the latest version from the thread (link above)?\n\n2) If you are, I will require log files, etc to diagnose your problem.

Once you find the conflict let me know. This error though indicates somewhere you have a duplicate of the science definitions file.\n\nAlso, once you have the conflict if you can go into \\GameData\\TarsierSpaceTech\\Config.cfg and change the last parameter from \u0027debugging = False\u0027 to \u0027debugging = True\u0027. Save that and restart KSP.
