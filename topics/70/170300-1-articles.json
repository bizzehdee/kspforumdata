I find it weird because I\u0027ve built lots of stations in orbit in the past and they\u0027ve presented no problem to my computer with an average fps of around 30\u002B and these can be stations with over 200 parts. However, when I started landing modules of bases on other planets, once they\u0027ve exceeded 50 parts, my computer experience extreme unplayable lag that can reach 3 to 4 fps which I find unreasonable given my PC specs and me launching rockets with over 100 parts with no issue. For example, this Europa base of mine can only be played at 4 fps when I\u0027m within 300 meters to all of the modules.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022qkscfm9nnmc01.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.redd.it/qkscfm9nnmc01.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy PC specs are: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit, Intel Core i7 4790, 16.0GB Dual-Channel DDR3 \u0026amp; GTX 970. If anyone has had similar issues in the past and found a fix for the issue or even the cause of it would be really great, thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
