Parts will randomly disappear from the parts catalog when I close the game and open it back up again. The disappearances are permanent, e. g., they don\u0027t pop back up into existence with the next reload. I used to put it down to just entropy, since the parts that disappeared were inconsequential, stuff I almost never used. Except, just this morning, the structural panels disappeared (both 1x1 and 2x2), as well as the XL struts. Given that I\u0027m attempting to create a dirigible aircraft carrier, this is a problem. \n\nConstructions using any of the disappeared parts do not seem to vanish from the parts catalog, but sub-assemblies using the ex-parts are, sadly, no more. (\\*groans\\* that aircraft carrier deck segment took forever to put together).\n\nMods I\u0027m running:\n\nMechJeb 2 (no excuse, I just like to get preposterously large objects into orbit reliably)\n\nHL Airships (squee)\n\nKerbal Aircraft Expansion\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux (duh)\n\nKerbal Inventory System (ick, merely installed as a KAS dependency)\n\nKerbal Attachment System (one of those mods I can\u0027t play well without)\n\nBlizzy\u0027s toolbar mod (HL Airships dependency)\n\nONE homebrew custom flag (minimalistic.png repainted as a drill from Gurren Lagann, I do actually know what I\u0027m doing with retexturing, so this isn\u0027t the problem)\n\nI\u0027m running 1.0.2 32-bit Windows. (Actually, to be fair, I don\u0027t know which version of the game I\u0027m running, x64 or x32. In the meantime, trying a full reinstall.)\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you\u0027re able to give.![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T16:00:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kagame**"}]}
