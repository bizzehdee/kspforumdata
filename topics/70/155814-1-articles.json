It wasn\u0027t until .23 I started modding my game. Now there are alot of nice fancy features included in ksp now but honestly it just doesn\u0027t run like it used to run. Even when I run a moderately modded game it lags and is almost unplayable. I really want play ksp like i used to but I just can\u0027t anymore because the game runs so poorly. Now I know people will undoubtedly comment about settings but I swear to you that I used to run almost 40\u00A0mods and the game performed flawlessly. Hundreds of hours of play time. As every update came my mod list got shorter and shorter because the game would crash. I figured maybe it was computer? Nope even though it wasn\u0027t I added 4 more gigs to my computer still the game just doesn\u0027t run like it used to. Now I admit I have a MacBook but again I used to play with ALOT of mods. BIG mods all together like the Soviet Pack, FASA, KW, and NOVA Punch, ASET ALCOR, laztek spacex mod, kethane, kso shuttle, chaka monkey, better atmospheres and or ksprc, \u00A0for anyone who remembers the good old days. I once over the course of a few weeks launched everything from sputnik to the space shuttle in order. Way before Bob Fitch using the soviet pack, skylab, american and soviet prob packs, fasa, iss pack, compent space shuttle and an atmosphere and texture pack. I once launched the KSO on top of the FASA Saturn V....honest...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/62135-090-kerbin-shuttle-orbiter-system-v413/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=1141529\u0026amp;embedComment=1141529\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I am saying is that these were REALLY big packs. All used together and honestly I can\u0027t imagine using any of them simultaneously anymore. My interest over the last say 3 months has diminished greatly and it was diminishing before that. It makes me sad but I just can\u0027t play the game like I used too. I know I can\u00A0get a better computer but honestly why should I \u00A0since I have played the game the way I wanted even when the game was inefficient. Plus I can\u0027t afford a new computer. I just don\u0027t understand I can\u00A0play it on 64 bit with 8gb ram and it just doesn\u0027t run right. I tried playing with just BDB and the game just runs really slow. Is there a mod like Active Texture Management out there because thats was what made me able to play with so many mods. Any way just wondering if there were any old dogs out there like me experiencing this same feeling and experience. I love the community and seeing all the wonderful creations but it makes me sad I can\u0027t use them like I would like to.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSincerely,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA KSP Veteran who learned to fly with prop planes (firespitter) and learned to dock blind\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-31T04:08:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry enabling the unsupported legacy terrain shader in your settings.cfg, that helped me with performance when I was playing on my Linux box with an onboard\u00A0Intel 4K GPU.
