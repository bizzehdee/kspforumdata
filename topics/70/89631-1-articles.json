As I was time-warping to the SOI change, the game crashed. When I restarted the game, I went to the tracking screen and selected the ship. When the ship appeared after loading, it quickly wobbled to smithereens, with the only surviving part, the Mk2 cockpit that Jeb was in, endless spinning out of control at a ridiculous speed. I figured it was a Kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched a rescue mission, rescuing Jeb, and then got into a free return orbit back to Kerbin. I had to leave at that point, so I ended the game, and I would finish it later. When I started the game up again, and went to the Tracking screen, selecting the ship, when it loaded, it did the same exact thing the other one did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I slightly suspect might have something to do with it is that both ships were equipted with one of those Vanguard parachute boxes. Not the part that allows Kerbals to eject with a parachute when hitting abort, but the actual box of parachutes that you stick on the outside of a ship. On the first mission, while Jeb was EVA, I had him grab a parachute out of the box, in case anything should go pear-shaped later on. But I\u0027m just spitballing, here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning KSP 0.23 (yeah, yeah, I know...why? Don\u0027t you worry about that.
