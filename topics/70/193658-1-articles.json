Game version updates are a good way to end up with some broken mods, so check you have the most recent versions of all mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you installed the game using Steam it\u0027s a good idea to copy the entire KSP directory out of the Steam folders and paste it somewhere else, and then add mods to that copy so that game updates don\u0027t break anything. Updating the game when you want to is harder this way, but it takes a while for mod creators to catch up when a new game version gets released so it avoids breaking anything with every game update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
