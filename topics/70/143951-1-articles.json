Long time lurker, first time poster here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve found myself in quite a special situation and I was hoping some linux users could help me out here. I have a mid range PC I\u0027m trying to run a DMP server on and the server runs well, it works fine. As of right now I use TMUX to run the server outside of the terminal window\u00A0The problem comes in when I try to run the server headless. I use putty to SSH into my server and the server ONLY allows NEW connections when putty is connected. If I or anyone else connects before I close the SSH window the connection is maintained. The specific error that DMP spits out is \u0022handshake error: invalid username\u0022. This post was kind of jumbled so if I can provide any info that might help please just ask. I hope that someone here can help. Thanks everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-18T13:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat distro is it?
