I modified it with the following:\n\nMechJeb2 (v2.4.2.0)\n\nKW Rocketry (v2.6)\n\nB9 Aerospace (don\u0027t know the version)\n\nRandomly, when switching between screens (VAB, Tracking Center, Recovering a Vessel and going back to Space Center, etc.) KSP just crashes and returns me to my Windows desktop.\n\nMy laptop details are as follows:\n\nLenovo Y70 Touch\n\nIntel Core i7-4710HQ CPU @ 2.50GHz\n\n16GB RAM\n\nWindows 8.1 64-bit OS; x64-based processor\n\nI have uploaded the crash logs to Dropbox. Can somebody take a look or let me know what more information you need to help me through this issue?\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/wy8w1q40docn4oj/KSP%20Crash%20Logs.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wy8w1q40docn4oj/KSP%20Crash%20Logs.zip?dl=0)\n\nBest regards,\n\nChris"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T19:17:15Z","Content":"Your log says you\u0027re running out of addressable memory, probably all those B9 and KW textures, there\u0027s an addon called active texture management that can help reduce your RAM use ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Cetera","CreatedById":109237,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T04:25:54Z","Content":"Chris, here\u0027s a link to Active Texture Management:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-0-90-Release-4-3-Dec-16-2014-Active-Texture-Management-Save-RAM](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-0-90-Release-4-3-Dec-16-2014-Active-Texture-Management-Save-RAM)!\n\nUse the aggressive one. Even if you get it running for a bit under the basic, there is a memory leak in KSP, and it will still eventually crash. Using aggressive will make the textures a little more blurry and indistinct, but you\u0027ll have a longer play session before you crash from lack of memory. Especially if you start installing other beautification mods or part packs."},{"CreatedByName":"ccecc85","CreatedById":139461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T16:08:32Z","Content":"Thanks guys. That seems to have fixed it, or at least made crashes mush less frequent. I haven\u0027t had a crash since installing ATM. Thanks for the quick replies!"}]}
