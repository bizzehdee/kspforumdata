It\u2019s possible that you\u2019re just running out of power for the engines as they consume A LOT\u00A0\u00A0of power, after all they\u2019re meant to be nuclear fusion tech!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution I found was a simple module manager patch to add an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E-style generator to the Ranger, Lander and Viper parts that would generate the power their engines required to function but continuously; it\u2019s a bit cheaty, but the reactors are so efficient and use so few fusion pellets anyway that it doesn\u2019t really matter as long as you don\u2019t abuse it by sticking one of them onto a station or base to power the whole thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"editor99","CreatedById":210094,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-15T13:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI read your posts, \u003Cspan\u003E@jimmymcgoochie , but I\u0027m confused on how to do it.if you have time, can you post step-by-step\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003Einstructions?
