If so, also make sure the reactor is running the D-T fusion reaction, and set the thrust limiter on the turbojet to one tick less than 100%. The turbojet will be taking as much ThermalPower as it can, so running the generator in Direct Conversion mode means it will use the 20% of the reactor\u0027s power that is in charged particles instead of trying to cut in on the ThermalPower that the turbojet is using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure that will stop your MegaJoules from disappearing, the problem then becomes making sure you have precoolers on all your intakes and that you have enough intakes in the first place. You can get your Ap out of the atmosphere on just atmospheric propulsion if you do it right, so you should only need fuel for circularization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as Antimatter goes, it\u0027s actually kind of hard to NOT make a SSTO with it. Even if you\u0027re not building a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, Anti-matter is great for spaceplanes! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a 2.5m 12-seater SST\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE (single stage to infinity) crew ferry spaceplane using B9\u0027s S2 fuselage and HL wings, 2m antimatter reactor, and thermal turbojet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also made a 1.25m 2 seat SST\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u002BW (single stage to infinity \u002B warp drive) science spaceplane. Goes from the runway to Laythe\u0027s surface and back without refueling. (that was it\u0027s shakedown cruise).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 Sabre S intakes stacked on 4 Sabre S precoolers all feeding one single 1.25m thermal turbojet powered by a 1.25m antimatter reactor \u002B generator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn space, it uses the warp drive to travel between the planets, and 4 (upgraded) plasma thrusters for main propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can level off at about 25km, set the SAS, and when the engine flames out you should have an Ap of about 650km. No, not 65.0. Six Five Zero Decimal, Kilometers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to skip the \u0022waiting 20 years to make/harvest enough antimatter to fuel anything interesting\u0022 part, I have a tip. Go to Jool! The trip out and back takes a while, but it\u0027s worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9Mm (9000km) circular equatorial orbit around Jool is where you\u0027ll find the fastest antimatter collection rates that I know of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t get to Jool, 900km circular equatorial orbit around Kerbin is another hot spot, but its about 10 times weaker than the one at Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there\u0027s antimatter around the sun, but I haven\u0027t sent a ship low enough around it to find out where the sweet spot is, and it\u0027s gravity well is generally a pain in the rear to deal with anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-28T21:11:36Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2014 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostElement","CreatedById":78368,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T19:31:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not using the thermal jet at all.
