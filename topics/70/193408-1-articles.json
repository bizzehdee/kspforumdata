However, after I built a stock space station,I tried to launch a Starship MK3 from Tundra Exploration and, using the docking port camera from HullcameraVDS, attempted to dock. However, the moment I docked and switched out of camera view, I noticed that my screen was blank, but the UI was still there. Anything to leave the current time (e.g. quickloading, quit to menu, revert flight, etc.) on the pause menu would press down like it had been clicked, but pop back up with no effect. Has anyone else has similar problems?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
