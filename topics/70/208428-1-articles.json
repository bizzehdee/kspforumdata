It wasn\u0027t too much but it was definitely noticeable, enough for me to be annoyed with it. After some testing it seems the issue is coming from the planetshine mod. Any reason as to why this would be happening, or how to fix it? I\u0027ll see if I can get some sort of video to show what I\u0027m talking about soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigFatStupidHead","CreatedById":44217,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-03T17:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm, it\u0027s been a while but isn\u0027t this a Kopernicus bug?

My vague recollection, with a fair chance I could be wrong, is that battling antialiasing settings between KSP, Scatterer, and other mods like like TUFX make the problem worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benzo Kerman","CreatedById":218403,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-04T01:17:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you running Scatterer? If so, this is from it\u0027s TAA, which can be turned off and replaced with SMAA in the spacecenter Scatterer menu. Personally, even though TAA is a little bugged, the fact of how much better it looks is a reason to leave it on. Hopefully this fixes your issue!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
