At max warp, it stops more than once per second. So it zooms along for 1.5 days, pause, 3 days, pause, 2.5 days, pause, and so on, where the pauses are maybe a little longer than the gaps between them. This becomes very painful on long interplanetary trips. On earlier versions, I would see the occasional glitch, but nothing like this. There was a thread about MJ causing lag in the map view, but it didn\u0027t appear related. Number of ship parts doesn\u0027t seem to be related, nor does the number of objects on rails. CPU is not taxed, other applications are running fine, plenty of free memory. I\u0027ve tried minor tweaks to render quality, etc., but they did not help (Thank goodness for that--there are limits below which a person must not sink!). I didn\u0027t see anything suggestive in the log. I unchecked the \u0022Suck\u0022 button and everything, so now I\u0027m stumped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny general thoughts about making high warp smoother?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips on how to troubleshoot this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev. 1.0.4, all mods up to date as far as CKAN is concerned.
