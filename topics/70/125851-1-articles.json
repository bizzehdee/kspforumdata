They must be fairly hot on afterburner though, as the back of my jet plane gets very yellow!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe second one I have reproduced twice with different saves appears to be a divide-by-zero bug when killing orbit speed above the Sun / Kerbol. Once orbit is very slow (Periapsis reads -261Mm and verticle speed less than 500mm/s) time-warp to 5x and the game breaks. For full-disclosure\u0026#39;s sake I use a periapsis of 6Gm and an apoapsis of 60Gm. Once at 60Gm I manually burn retrograde until orbit = 0.0m/s. After 5x time warp is enabled all numbers display NaN and the game GUI breaks. If one is able to open the menu and return to the space center the entire solar system will be gone. The save becomes unrecoverable even after game restart or flight revert.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T04:18:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 04:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gta3uzi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T06:14:36Z","Content":"\n[url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29[/url]\n"}]}
