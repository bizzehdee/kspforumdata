I don\u0027t use the mod, so I\u0027m not sure about this part but if you backup your savegame, reinstall KSP and then restore the backup, that would perfectly explain it. Since KSP 1.4.4, steam cloud is supported and enabled by default so the backup is created and restored by steam automatically.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can test this by creating a new sandbox savegame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you installed the crafts manually in \u0022KSP\\ships\u003Cabbr\u003E\\\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\\*\u0022 they are probably saved into the steam cloud as well...I remember some cases where people complained about crafts not getting removed from the game after a reinstall and these crafts where stored in the same directory. I don\u0027t know why SQUAD should setup the steam cloud config to backup this directory but this might be the case. Should be easy to test by removing the manually installed crafts and then start the game directly via the KSP_x64.exe and not via the steam launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the missing parts: Well, that\u0027s something the creator of the craft have to take care of. I would suggest to write a comment on KerbalX or the steam workshop and ask the creator for more information.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince KSP will tell you the names of the missing parts, you can also try the part search of KerbalX to figure out the mod it comes from: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/parts\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-12T11:20:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI took a look at the \u0022remotecache.vdf\u0022 of KSP (basically the config for the steam cloud) and apparently, the stock craft folder (~\\Kerbal Space Program\\Ships\\*) is actually backed up in the cloud.
