However, I have been unable to track it down as of late, and I would like such an ability for a sandbox save I\u0027m running.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoes anyone know what happened to this mod, or know how to write a script to achieve the same end?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks for your time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
