I\u0027m new in the forum, but I play KSP since the version 0.23. Sorry if my English be not so good, I\u0027m Brazilian.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, let\u0027s go: I have a little, but annoying issue in the game since version 1.02, simply, when I install a mod (in this case, were Stock Part Revamp, FASA or Tantares, only one of each, because the game crashes when I install every), the atmospheric drag\u00A0disappears. Yes, is in the stock aerodynamics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs like if Kerbin wouldn\u0027t have an atmosphere. Apparently, it happens totally when the craft is a Command Pod/Cockpit without a fuel tank and engine, because when I tried the reentry of an Apollo 11 style mission, the craft slowed just when the \u0022service module\u0022 was attached to the Mk1-2 Pod, without the tank and engine, the craft continued accelerating to an escape trajectory. The reentry effects are visible, but there is no deceleration. So, I uninstalled the game and deleted the game folders and reinstalled it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecently, using the 1.05 (1028) I installed the Dynamic Texture Loader and\u00A0Outer Planets, and the same issue appeared with OPM, I tested a small craft, and there was no drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCuriously, the issue seems\u00A0to happen just with a mod that uses Module Manager, because it just appeared when I installed OPM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy notebook has 4 Gb of RAM memory, 32 bit Windows 7, and don\u0027t have graphics card.\u00A0Anyone has the same problem? Or have any idea of why this issue happens?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-02T21:03:38Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2016 09:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Terr\u00E1queo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spilled Vial","CreatedById":153712,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T14:24:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe effects might be there, but if you have your graphics set really\u00A0low, they will be difficult to see, and only visible in extreme conditions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
