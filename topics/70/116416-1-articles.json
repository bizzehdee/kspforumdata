My problem is my parachutes (mk16) auto deploy during re-entry and then burn up. I can go straight up to 100km and come straight down or I can do a sub orbit across the ocean planning to land in the sea to the East. Doesn\u0027t matter the chutes pop and burn up.\n\nAny suggestions on what I can do to avoid this?\n\nMods:\n\nKerbal Engineer\n\nNavhud\n\nRemote tech\n\nScience Alert\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T17:42:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 05:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thybountyhunter**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T17:25:34Z","Content":"Right click chute you\u0027ll see \u0022safe to deploy\u0022 hint.

The last one without anything else there. I tend to wait until I am under 200m/s before I deploy them.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Straight up and down may end up being too fast too low and chute doesn\u0027t have enough time to slow you down.\n\nI did a sub orbit and the same thing. The chutes deploy and burn up themselves as I and heating up entering the atmosphere. I am not even hitting space for the staging at all."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T19:11:07Z","Content":"Why is everyone so obsessed with the safe to deploy reading? I just set minimum deploy pressure to .65 and never have any issues. That pressure is about 3 km above sea level, so you should never be supersonic there anyways.\n\nKerbin tallest peak is 6767 m so mountains could be a threat to parachute landings. I think the range to the West of KSC is strictly less than 5 km. A pressure of .45 would be more safe for mountains, but keeping supersonic speeds at 5 km isn\u0027t unheard of. Better use airbrakes out stay structures for such craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T19:15:10Z","Content":"I have never seen this in stock, so under the presumption that it\u0027s a bug related to mods, the thread has been moved to modded support."},{"CreatedByName":"SeeGreen","CreatedById":148961,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T20:51:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have never seen this in stock, so under the presumption that it\u0027s a bug related to mods, the thread has been moved to modded support.\n\nNope. Not to do with mods. Just changed so as to become fiendishly difficult if you have just started and not made orbit yet, cannot therefore modulate angle of approach etc etc etc. heat shield functions fine but mk16 gets blown off the top of the pod no matter what I do. It was fun before they changed it.
