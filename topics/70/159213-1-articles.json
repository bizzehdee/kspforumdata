I did a clean install and then installed all my chosen mods. After playing for a while I decided that I would rather have commnet instead of Remote Tech so I removed Remote Tech from my GameData folder. Now when I launch a rocket and cycle through the stages using the space bar to drop my boosters or to fire the upper stage engines, it \u0022hangs up\u0022 for a few seconds every time I stage. I can hear the sound of the decouplers firing but the screen just freezes while that happens. Then suddenly it starts playing smoothly as if nothing happened.... until I stage again...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny Ideas? The problem goes away if I re-install Remote Tech so I\u0027m not really sure what\u0027s going on. Hopefully someone a little wiser in the ways of modding KSP can point me in the right direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheJollyDodger","CreatedById":176785,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-15T14:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo not really sure why, but I removed remote tech and the Ground Construction part of the UKI Koloniztion mod and then started with a new save and everything works fine again o.O oh well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
