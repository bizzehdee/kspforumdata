I\u0027ve had an issue with BDArmory that comes and goes from time to time. Some\u00A0bullet-based weapons will occasionally not fire (or will fire one shot and not fire anymore). I\u0027ve messed around in game with this a lot and have tried to figure out what causes it but have so far been out of luck. I\u0027ve done the classic, uninstall and reinstall which has done nothing. I\u0027ve checked to make sure that my game along with BDArmory is up to date (and compatible). My only thought is the possibility of mod conflicts, however, this\u00A0is highly unlikely as I\u0027ve had this issue when BDArmory was the only mod installed. I\u0027m just curious if anyone else has encountered this problem and if people have thoughts for a way to possibly fix this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
