I was coming in to land after over-shooting and I was just thinking \u0027thank god, it\u0027s finally over!\u0027 just before it happened. First, it was just one of two tail wings. I thought it was just a small bug. Then, the unexpected happened: my plane seemed to be almost shot down out of the sky. I didn\u0027t get a screenshot of the actual explosions, but I do have some screenshots of the debris field, as well as the F3 menu. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDebris field\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xcEjV2P.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xcEjV2P.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two furthest pieces are over a kilometer apart\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e6JxWhi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e6JxWhi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt shows that I seemed to have collided with the launch pad, but it\u0027s over 2.5KM away, as well as a few hundred meters above sea level.
