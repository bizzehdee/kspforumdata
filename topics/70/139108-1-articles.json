However, when I moved everything over to 1.1.2, it quit working. I also tried Interstellar Fuel Switch in 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 and it didn\u0027t seem to work. I feel like I must be missing something simple here. What is everyone else using for fuel switching in 1.1.2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlashTen","CreatedById":150607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T03:55:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I upgraded Module Manager from 2.6.23 to 2.6.24 and everything works now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
