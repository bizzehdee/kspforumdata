The game starts, everything works fine, except for parts. Accordingly, when entering saved games, all ships evaporate because there are no parts for them... I can\u2019t give an error in most because I don\u2019t understand how and because it doesn\u2019t exist as such - the game starts and works, so i need your help in fixing the game without removing it to the root\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso a question - how to avoid such problems with mods? Do the CurseForge as a program solve it?
