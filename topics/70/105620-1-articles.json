Issue is, I\u0027m still not seeing what about it would be causing an out-of-range error. The ship\u0027s price is only 44 million, the fuel supply is only a few million units, and nothing else even comes close.\n\nThe in-game result of this weirdness is the following:\n\nAll of the parts on the left-side parts list disappear. The ship\u0027s parts become unselectable (and therefore immovable), though I can still right-click on them. The one decoupler on the ship loops its \u0022firing\u0022 animation (complete with smoke effects) in the VAB. The \u0022Action Groups\u0022 and \u0022Crew\u0022 tabs become inaccessible.\n\nI don\u0027t believe this to be mod-related, because I didn\u0027t add any new mods between when the ship worked in the editor and when it broke - I just kept building it. Issue is, I\u0027m unsure of how to reproduce it without falling afoul of some other known (though obscure in the community) Unity bugs.\n\n**KSP Version**\n\nI\u0027m running 32-bit 0.90 on Win7 x64.\n\n**MOD LIST:**\n\nHoooo, boy.
