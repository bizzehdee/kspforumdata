Sometimes, when i try to recover a landed vessel, the game just ignores any request. I can\u0027t save, go to space centre, tracking station, or even quit the game. I can\u0027t do anything to save the game, i can only load a save, revert the flight or force close. I checked the debug menu and the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ljHf84OEcMLvW5CeAfcB9hU9uDMYAuFk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eoutput log \u003C/a\u003Eand it\u0027s full of \u003Cstrong\u003Eargument out of range exceptions\u003C/strong\u003E that seem to be caused by debris near the vessel. In fact, i wasn\u0027t able to reproduce this issue voluntarily, but it happens 100% of the time with some vessels. I built a simple 5 part craft consisting of a mk1 pod, 2 radial decouplers and 2 small tanks for a test contract, but upon decoupling, there is nothing i can do. I can EVA, control the vessel, but i can\u0027t recover or save the game after the decoupling happens. It\u0027s really frustrating because i could be unable to save after a long mission and lose all my progress.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll my mods should be up to date, i made sure to have the latest 1.4.3 version of every addon and tested my pack with various mods until i found my ideal combination, but the issue appeared even when i only had a few of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-02T23:49:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like the vessel is still moving, or at least KSP thinks it is.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the issues appeared with only a few mods, then that really helps in narrowing it down.\u00A0 Pull out half of the possible culprits, and then half again, until you narrow it down to the offending mod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Standecco","CreatedById":187873,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-03T18:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo i tried removing a lot of mods, including some related to movement or vessels like bonvoyage and easyvesselswitch, all of roverdude\u0027s mods, but it didn\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll try to reinstall all my mods manually and see if that helps, since i installed some of them with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E, otherwise i\u0027ll keep removing mods, but the ones i have now are either dependencies for gpp or mods i added after the issue first apperead and that seem harmless to me.
