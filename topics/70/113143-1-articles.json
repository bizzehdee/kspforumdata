So, I finally decided to use Real Solar System 1.0.2 and it works perfectly, however after 2 failed attempts to get into orbit and an hour reading about RSS on the net (which ive found that what ive read is way too technical for me to understand) I really could do with a couple of questions answered in very simple (idiot proof) ways. BTW, I can get to other planets, land, return etc in the Kerbin system, so not a noob to the game, just RSS.\n\nFirstly, how much fuel do I need to get into a good position to set a manoeuvre node for orbit? I know on Kerbin it takes around 4550dv but when I launch from Earth, I get to about 200k, set the node then seem to run out of fuel using all stages of my rocket which is FASA\u0027s Apollo Nova. I have at least 2600m/s still to burn before I can get into orbit?\n\nSecondly, once I understand how to get into orbit, is there a dV map for RSS? I have one for the Kerbin system but not in RSS. If not, can anyone recommend an \u0022easy to understand\u0022 way to calculate dV needed in RSS or do I have to learn what ive tried to read before?\n\nSorry to sound like such a noob but the difference between stock and RSS seems huge but im loving even my failed 2 launches!\n\nAny help would be awesome, however I\u0027m going to keep trying to achieve orbit even if it takes me weeks!"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T22:29:36Z","Content":"No problem, everybody starts somewhere! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIf you\u0027re not using Realism Overhaul, or at least RF Stockalikes, you\u0027re going to have a bad time. Earth takes about 9400m/s delta V to get into orbit (more for polar orbits or low-thrust stages, less from directly on the equator or from very high TWRs). As a general rule, *assuming you\u0027re using RO,* you want a sea level starting TWR of about 1.2, about 3 minutes burn time on the first stage, a vacuum starting TWR of about .8 on the second stage, and about 5 minutes burntime.\n\nIf you\u0027re not using any part patches, then you\u0027re going to need a lot more rocket than real life.\n\nRSS \\_is\\_ the real solar system, so any \\_real\\_ dV map will work fine. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T22:34:10Z","Content":"Thanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI tried installing RO but I only had the 0.90 version and it was incompatible.
