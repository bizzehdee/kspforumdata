The ones that did open opened weird. The Crew Capsule or the probe was not in the right place and was the wrong size as the rest of the rocket. Also, when I loaded KSP, Module Manager said that there were 4 errors in the ....../Realism Overhaul/Suggested Mods/Tantares/Tantares.cfg. I\u0027m wondering should I change something in the config or download a new config? Thanks for your help\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
