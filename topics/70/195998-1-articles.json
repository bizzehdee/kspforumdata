If the little probe icon beside the signal gauge is orange and there\u2019s no signal strength, that\u2019s probably your issue.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNo power. Check you actually have electric charge in your rover, because no power = no communications and no control either. If the probe icon is red and there\u2019s no signal bar at all, this is probably your issue UNLESS you set \u2018require signal for control\u2019 in the game settings, in which case it could also indicate that you have no signal and the game correctly prevents you from controlling the rover.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nProbe core in hibernate mode. If you DO have a signal but the probe icon is still orange, that\u2019s probably the issue as the probe must be in active mode to control it. Right click the probe core and toggle \u2018hibernate\u2019 to off (active) and that should resolve it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMod interference. If you have mods installed- and you\u2019re in the modded installs section so I\u2019m guessing you do- then please provide a list of mods and your KSP version as something obvious might show itself. Log files are good too as they may reveal exceptions or errors in the KSP application that may be causing the issue. I\u2019m thinking of RemoteTech or\u00A0CommNet Constellation which both make a lot of changes to the communications systems,\u00A0and possibly Near Future Exploration which adds some new mechanics around signal power,\u00A0but there may be more I don\u2019t know of or haven\u2019t thought of.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nLack of signal can be caused by a few things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nNo connection between rover and relays. Check your rover\u2019s antenna(e) are deployed and not broken, and that you have a line of sight to the relay that isn\u2019t blocked by the ground. You may not have enough range, although this is more of an issue trying to connect back to Kerbin than between two vessels in the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E unless your rover is relying on a really weak antenna or even the built-in one from a probe core.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNo connection between the relays and Kerbin. This can happen if you only have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E ground station active and Kerbin is facing the wrong way, or because your relays are blocked by something else, or because they just don\u2019t have the range- the distance between Kerbin and Duna varies considerably as they orbit and you\u2019ll need three or four RA-2 relay dishes (with 100% DSN and antenna power settings) to get a solid connection at all times, or a single RA-15/RA-100.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWrong type of antenna used on the relays. They have to be relay dishes to be able to bounce the signals from other craft to Kerbin and vice versa, a direct antenna will not work. The stock relay dishes are HG-5, RA-2, RA-15 and RA-100, the rest are direct dishes. Every antenna, stock or from mods, will say what type it is in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E editors, so make sure you\u2019re using the right type.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
