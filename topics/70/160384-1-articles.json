Given you were in a 1000x timewarp, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E wasn\u0027t keeping the ship oriented, so the node would move away from the \u0022nose\u0022 of the ship even if you actually tracked the node (which you hadn\u0027t). The direction of the burn at the node position remains fixed in space; you see that direction move because of the relative position on the orbit of your vessel changing, but the change is relative to the body you are orbiting, while remaining fixed in space (and that goes with the Eve antitarget marker too). Do the same with a stock (unmodded) KSP install, you\u0027ll find the effect just as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsn\u0027t clear what you state with \u0022if one actually tries a transfer orbit (even to the mun), your destination mysteriously ends up at some other point in its orbit when you actually arrive.\u0022. If you set up a transfer manually so to show an encounter, executing it correctly will bring to the encounter (may require some mid-course adjustment for interplanetary transfers, certainly not for Mun). If the transfer is planned by MechJeb and doesn\u0027t fit, that is a MechJeb issue to be reported with that add-on thread (but is probably due to other add-ons interfering, MechJeb alone isn\u0027t known to make such evident errors). Bodies in the KSP universe don\u0027t move erratically, not even while using Principia: their position with time strictly follows keplerian laws, so if they \u0022mysteriously\u0022 end somewhere else is because the time of your transfer isn\u0027t the same of what was planned.
