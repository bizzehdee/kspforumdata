This appears to be quite random, sometimes the body lift value is smaller, sometimes higher. Sometimes it happens a few seconds into the flight, sometimes not at all. Sometimes it has worse, sometimes not so bad effects (but almost always leads to some parts exploding or splashing down hard, sometimes doing the same to kerbals. That is,\u00A0if I don\u0027t revert flight as soon as I\u00A0notice something strange about my plane\u0027s trajectory). Even if I somehow manage to keep flying, the problem doesn\u0027t appear to disappear after some time. The aerodynamic force created by the wheels appears to point in the opposite direction of what it should, and depends on the wheel\u0027s\u00A0angle of attack. That is, when the wheel is pointing up relative to prograde, it pushes me down.\u00A0180^ angle of attack seems to give an infinite \u0022wheel\u00A0lift\u0022\u00A0value while 0^ doesn\u0027t cause any forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
