This is true of both omni and directional antennas. This is true of a manned craft as well. Plenty of electricity is available. Sitting on the launch pad it shows no connection to Mission Control, bar graph and connection light are dark,\u00A0\u00A0though the connection seems to work fine. Away from mission control there is no communication between ships, making it impossible to set satellites or strictly automated missions. I can\u0027t help but feel there is a setting somewhere that is preventing communication, but I have been through all settings I could find, and saw nothing useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help is much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
