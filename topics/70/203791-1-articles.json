However, I can\u0027t seem to fix this one particular issue no matter what I do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDecouplers are missing from their regular hope in the \u0022coupling\u0022 menu. Only the stack decouplers, however. Engine plates, radial decouplers, and other things that decouple are showing up normally. Even weirder, if I do the advanced sorting options in the top left of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and select \u0022sort by module\u0022 and find decoupler, then they DO show up there! So they exist, but are somehow being hardcore hidden and don\u0027t show up in any of the \u0022sort by function\u0022 menus.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought it might be procedural parts, but removing that did nothing. I thought it might be Janitors Closet, but removing that did nothing. I though it might be probes before crew, but again, removing that did nothing. So regardless of what I try, I can\u0027t seem to figure out what is hiding these parts. I\u0027m not crazy far into the career save, but so far, it\u0027s ONLY the regular stack decouplers \u0026amp; separators, the ones included via Squad or squad expansion.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas would be much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCoupling menu missing regular td-06 and td-12 and the like:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/lSfCQkC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/lSfCQkC\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSearing by module coupling, you can see that they are there:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/nIjeZIi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/nIjeZIi\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am happy to provide log files but not sure of an imgur-like service for easily uploading .txt files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
