Look at the RCS. And with all of them like that, the craft simply wrangled itself apart in to pieces, current crafts in orbit spins out of control,etc. Also notice the staging bar where icon of stuff are gone. Kraken attack, for sure. Tried it with a new save as control to ensure it wasn\u0027t a corrupted save, but got the same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, I can\u0027t confirm why this happen. My KSP game is heavily modded, but I don\u0027t think they are the reason, as this happen intermittently. Sometimes it just happens, sometimes I can fly like normal, with the same mods. However, they seems to increase recently as I try to squeeze the last few mods in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible ram problem? Or something else entirely?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying KSP 0.90 32 bit. Mod list too long to list, and I don\u0027t think a specific mod is the culprit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ok, I was wrong. Tweakscale was the culprit. Took me quite a while swapping my mods around to realized it caused the problem.
