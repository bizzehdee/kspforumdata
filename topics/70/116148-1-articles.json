However, playing the game, launching one or two small ships (career, so we\u0027re talking 30 part count type ships here, nothing major), the ram usage creeps up. My last test I\u0027ve timed it for 12 min to go from 2.6gb to 3.1 gb used. At this time I just keep Task Manager open on my 2nd screen and wait till I get to about 3.2 then I save and exit and restart, and I\u0027m back to 2.6 ish\n\nNormally I\u0027d go through the process of removing all mods, and installing one at a time until the offender is found, but given that we\u0027re now in the post 1.0 days, i thought maybe there is a method out there that would allow me to track down the offending mod.\n\n(Doesn\u0027t happen on stock install, and I have my own \u0022mod pak\u0022 / list that I\u0027m working from).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: Changing to \u0022workaround\u0022 reasons outlined in below post\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T13:24:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 01:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rottielover**"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T08:50:45Z","Content":"There is no direct way of finding out how much memory each mod is using however, it is probably not caused by a mod directly, the stock game has a number of memory \u0022leaks\u0022 where the memory usage increases every time you change scene (among others) and the more mods you have installed the more significant the leaks become (and the quicker you get close to the memory limit and start having problems).\n\nWithout a list of your mods and/or an output\\_log.txt, it will be difficult to make any helpful suggestions..."},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T13:27:32Z","Content":"Thank you for the quickly reply Padishar. I was afraid that the answer was going to be something along those lines.\n\nWhen you said scene changes I tried flipping between ships by use of the map and switching from vessel to vessel rather than going back to the space center, then to tracking, then to the ship. That seems to have helped somewhat since I\u0027m not changing the scene quite so frequently.\n\nSo because of that I\u0027m going to call this as a workaround. If you want to swap between ships, try and use the map view to do so as much as possible. I would also say that you should try to find a way to monitor your memory usage, and save and restart the game once you get close to the limit."},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T13:39:54Z","Content":"[Graphic Memory Monitor](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92907) \u002B [SAVE](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105399-0-90-S-A-V-E-automatic-backup-system-0-9-9-281) is my preferred solution.

I\u0027m just thinking of the PS4 port, and how it will affect console users as well. I\u0027d like to think that in a stock game, a person should be able to switch scenes as much as they want with worrying if the game will crash."}]}
