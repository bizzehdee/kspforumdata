I have a lander in orbit around the Moon (this is with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E). I cannot control the orbiter\u0027s direction, for some reason. I hit the normal keys to rotate, and it just won\u0027t move. I have MechJeb on it, and if I use Smart A.S.S. to orient to prograde, retrograde, whatever, that works, but other than that, the keys that orient the spacecraft don\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt worked fine through several reloads, trying different landing approaches, but now it just... doesn\u0027t work any more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have two different saves for this vehicle at various stages. If I load either of them, the problem is the same. If I switch to another craft in orbit, everything works normally.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve checked that I have battery power, and the reaction wheels are turned on. But no manual control is possible of this craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have also tried restarting KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy mods include \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, MechJeb, Kerbal Engineer, and FASA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUgh, I figured it out. Now I feel stupid. The satellite I was using to bounce my signal back to Earth is on the other side of the moon, and I\u0027m on the far side. So no control. Oof.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
