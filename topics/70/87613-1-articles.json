I\u0027ve built a ship for laythe that can land in the water and return. Well on both Laythe and Kerbin, when I take off from the water the game still think\u0027s I\u0027m on the ground or \u0022splashed down\u0022. It won\u0027t let me quicksave and sometimes my kerbal blows up if he tries to get out of the ship to save the game or do anything. Anyone got any ideas how to workout this problem? I want to do the Jool 5 challenge and I Don\u0027t want to have to manipulate/hack my game to fix this in a middle of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sedativechunk","CreatedById":112761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T04:45:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry to bump this post or anything, but I wanted to update my forum post.

I built a detachable base on my ship and I leave it behind during ascent. The same still thing\u0027s I\u0027m on the ground even though I\u0027m not. I guess there\u0027s no workaround for this issue then and it\u0027s a known bug?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
