But i have found the issue, after removing the Modular Missile Guidance(Experimental) from both my plane. Everything else seem to work fine and I can staged a 5 plane battle without them exploding randomly. Just to add on, I did what you say on taking a screenshot of the report in KSP and\u00A0it did not tell me how it exploded itself. Also I can tell when the plane will explode itself when the plane suddenly changed its name to \u0022unnamed\u0022. As you can see in the video, both my plane are unnamed, when I actually named them \u0022interceptor\u0022 and \u0022Multirole\u0022 accordingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-25T05:30:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2020 05:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by CleverAx\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CleverAx","CreatedById":206954,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-25T05:35:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223843446\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196508\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221598297790\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022187168\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lisias\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Lisias said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout the KSP.log and a screenshot of the Report (where things that exploded are detailed), all we can do is to guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that, due Physics Extender being set too high, the aircraft with the Focus (and the one where the physics thinks it\u0027s the current \u0022frame of reference\u0022) it too far, and the plane that exploded was a victim of some problem due the calculations being done on floats that got being grossly rounded up or down due the frame of reference being too far away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe physics range exists due this: anything too far from the center of the current frame of reference start to misbehave due that lack of precision of the floats.
