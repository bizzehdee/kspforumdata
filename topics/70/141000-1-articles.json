I\u2019ll be doing a battle with one of my tanks or AA batteries and the game will slow waaaaaaayyy down, which normally, I can cope with (I launched many rockets with several thousand parts regularly with 1.0.5 on a laptop, so I\u2019m used to that) but then the game stops responding to my keyboard at all. The mouse still works, and can fire the guns, switch weapons, etc., but only at 1 fps or so. Also at this point, my computer is so hot that it hurts to touch it. I think that may be my computer, but after I force-quit KSP, it cools right down. Is this because BD Armory isn\u2019t yet compatible, or something else? Does anyone else have this problem? If it is the mod, can I fix it, and if so, how?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, I also have Kerbal Engineer Redux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos Rast","CreatedById":157420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T05:51:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you read through the BD Armory thread, this (the overheating) is a problem a number of people are having. BD Armory is, as you said, not compatible with 1.1.2 and for most people it seems causes serious issues. Unfortunately, it also seems BahamutoD is MIA, and the thread was locked last I checked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mycroft","CreatedById":158484,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T22:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, I know that, but I haven\u2019t seen anyone who had KSP stop responding to the keyboard.
