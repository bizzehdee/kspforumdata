So I installed all of them then went to bed. When I got up I couldn\u0027t remember exactly which mods I had installed.\n\nWhen played KSP again I found that when flying a vessel about half of the mods\u0027 toolbar buttons no longer worked. This effects both the stock app buttons and blizzy\u0027s toolbar.\n\nCan anyone give suggestion on how to isolate this problem that doesn\u0027t involve putting each of over a hundred mods onto a clean install one at a time?\n\n[output_log.cfg](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pgmg4ll0x65pwlb/app_button_bug_output_log.txt?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T09:47:07Z","Content":"Hello, I don\u0027t know if this come from these mods but you have errors with Chatterer, Clouds and DistantObject ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) I suggest you to try to uninstall or reinstall each ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Myk","CreatedById":137014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T11:17:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hello, I don\u0027t know if this come from these mods but you have errors with Chatterer, Clouds and DistantObject ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) I suggest you to try to uninstall or reinstall each ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\ndid that\n\nproblem persists, with new [output_log](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ebh0e26s8f3gvpn/app_button_bug_2_output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\nthanks for pointing it out though"},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T13:32:50Z","Content":"Perhaps, It comes from KineTechAnimation which is a dependence of B9?\n\n    ReflectionTypeLoadException: The classes in the module cannot be loaded.  at (wrapper managed-to-native) System.Reflection.Assembly:GetTypes (bool)  at System.Reflection.Assembly.GetTypes () [0x00000] in :0   at KConfigDocumentationGenerator.GenerateAssemblyDocumentation (System.Reflection.Assembly assembly) [0x00000] in :0   at KConfigDocumentationGenerator.Generate () [0x00000] in :0   at KConfigDocumentationGenerator.OnLevelWasLoaded (Int32 level) [0x00000] in :0"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Myk","CreatedById":137014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T14:08:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps, It comes from KineTechAnimation which is a dependence of B9?\n\nHow would I test that?\n\nload B9 and another mod that uses a toolbar button onto a fresh install?\n\nor copy my KSP load then remove everything except B9 and a test mod?\n\nalso, how did you divine Kinetech out of that?"},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T15:02:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How would I test that?\n\u003E load B9 and another mod that uses a toolbar button onto a fresh install?\n\u003E \n\u003E or copy my KSP load then remove everything except B9 and a test mod?\n\u003E \n\u003E also, how did you divine Kinetech out of that?\n\nYou can try to reinstall B9 and look if the bug is here and you can try to delete B9 and all these dependencies, if the bug is again here, it\u0027s not KineTechAnimation, It\u0027s how I debug my game, uninstall, look, uninstall, look ...\n\n[KConfigDocumentationGenerator](https://github.com/KineMorto/KineTechAnimationLibrary/blob/85866156e8639673f30016c54aad944623af95a9/Core/KConfigDocumentationGenerator.cs#L26) is a function of KineTechAnimation ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Myk","CreatedById":137014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T14:07:09Z","Content":"it was a chatterer issue\n\nthe plugin.cfg was corrupted\n\nI didn\u0027t realize ckan doesn\u0027t remove setting files\n\ntl;dr thought I was testing but really was changing nothing"}]}
