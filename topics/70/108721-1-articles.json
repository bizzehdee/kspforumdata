Maybe it\u0027s not adding up the physics of both parts correctly. As I understand it, each part has a front, side and rear drag value - and presumably other things are handled like this too- heat dissipation, buoyancy etc. If the game is looking for a skipper in the physics file, it finds the skipper\u0027s drag cube and all is well. If it\u0027s looking for a skipper/tank monstrosity, it finds nothing and uses default or broken values.

But it does sound like the physics config file and how the game loads it might be a culprit. \n\nMay I ask - why are you welding parts? What does that accomplish? Smaller part count? More rigid joints?

Your parts retain the stock look that we know and love, and believe it or not, welding parts can be a lot of fun...if you can handle staring at notepad and a calculator for hours on end. \n\nThey\u0027re generally quite hassle free as well, major aerodynamic overhauls notwithstanding, and .cfgs can be modified, updated, manipulated, etc. with ease by anyone who so desires.\n\nMost people think of welding as a way to reduce part counts and strengthen joints, but stacking and fusing truss segments, struts, tanks etc. is really just the tip of the iceberg. Highly detailed manipulations are possible as well...same principles, more imagination. \n\nI threw together a couple of albums of 100% stock welds to show you what I mean.\n\nWelded 3.75m capsule \u002B launch escape system: 3 parts in total, capsule has fully functioning hatch, antenna, docking port, IVA etc. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I\u0027m not sure why it was moved to the support forum for modded installs...cfg edits, while technically modifications, probably shouldn\u0027t qualify for the modded installs forum, and regardless, I\u0027m not looking for tech support. \n\nI\u0027m interested in learning about how KSP determines part buoyancy and drag, so a move elsewhere would be much appreciated."}]}
