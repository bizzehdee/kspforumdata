Inside a mods zip file, there is usually a Gamedata folder. Drag the contents of that to your KSP Gamedata folder so you end up with 3 folders - Squad, NASAmission and the mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst guess is that you\u0027re either running out of memory (those mods do eat a fair amount of RAM) or on OSX (replacing contents of Gamedata instead of merging).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stickman939","CreatedById":131481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T08:25:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, I\u0027m sorry I never replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd, the problem wasn\u0027t and install issue B9 and KW seem to hate each other.
