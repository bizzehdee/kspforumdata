It is kinda strange, this happen to me about 2 hours after I started a new career game. I just made 2 upgrades, launch pad and the VAB to get some flexibility in building. I got a contract where I have to test some part from MKS/OKS mod in orbit, those things are a bit heavy (about 6tons) and since I just have tier 1 rockets and stuff I need to put several stages and radial engines and boosters to lift the stuff up. I am getting around... hmm... maybe 40 to 50 parts more or less, cannot remember, but the clock on time warp is already yellow on launch then flips green yellow on orbit, so that means the fps are getting lower. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think this is the problem. The game gets too slow and some stuff cannot keep up. I do not have memory problems, usually never hits the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust add up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it me or 0.25 were more stable then 0.90? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever had this kind of stuff on 0.25.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
