Then I put a craft in there, but it is not showing up in game. When I check the subassembly folder on my hard drive, the craft is there. The folder isn\u0027t showing though, not sure if it needs to in my hard drive. I just have the subassembly folder with all craft in there. Including the one, I put in the custom folder in game. Not sure if anyone else is having this problem. Any help would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I just tried to save a different item and it showed up in the list. Also, I took off all the parts of the item I was trying to save and the only thing that would make the subassembly show up in the folder was the Cupola. Anything else attached to it makes the craft invisible. Actually, the folder isn\u0027t the problem. The problem occurs still in the standard folders. Apparently anywhere I save it, it is invisible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-16T22:14:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2018 10:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by TheAngryHulk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-16T22:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA subassembly cannot be saved with its root part. If you have build your crafts in the editor and just copy\u0026amp;paste them into a subassemblsy folder, they will still have their root part and don\u0027t match the requirement for a subassembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can imagine that it is possible to edit the craft file in a way to make this work but I don\u0027t know how. The easiest solution would be to load the craft in the editor, add an additional part X, re-root the whole craft so that your new, additional part X is the new root. Pick up the craft without the new root part\u00A0 and save it as a subassembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAngryHulk","CreatedById":189105,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-16T22:34:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always change the root part to a decoupler or a docking port.
