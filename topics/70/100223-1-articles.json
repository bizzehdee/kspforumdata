I\u0027ve searched the forums but i can\u0027t seem to find that specific thread... \n\nYesterday I\u0027ve launched a small ship into orbit using mechjeb 2.4.2, after reaching orbit i finetune the orbit to be more precise (align planes, inclination etc.) but when you\u0027ve set up the node and mj almost reaches it. the node starts to move all over the navball which makes it impossible to reach it and so finalizing your manouver...\n\nIs there a fix for this? Cause its quite annoying to keep adjusting it over and over again... It doesn\u0027t happen all the time, but certainly most of the times... Now i am also wondering if this is a MJ related \u0022bug\u0022 or just a \u0022bug\u0022with the game itself?\n\nIf there\u0027s a fix for this, can someone point me into the right direction in fixing this?"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T17:29:56Z","Content":"I\u0027ve noticed this when the maneuver node delta v is tiny, and is often exacerbated when you have a heavy ship. I think it may be a combination of floating point error and other things.\n\nmaybe try the latest dev version? Or dev version #401 since 402 seemed a bit unstable to me."},{"CreatedByName":"renejant","CreatedById":104304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T18:06:59Z","Content":"Might give that a try... Im using MJ 2.4.2 stable release for now.... It doesn\u0027t give me much trouble, only the above specified problem i have been encountered so far... But im still wondering if this is related to MJ or not...\n\nGoing to try and set up the manouver nodes myself and let MJ handle them... lets see what that gives me..."},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T18:16:48Z","Content":"It usually means that you have some problems with attitude-keeping. Mostly it manifests in large, non-symmetrical or overpowered ships.\n\nYou might wish to set \u0022Tolerance\u0022 parameter in maneuver planner to 3-4 m\\s. There is no tolerance option for ascent guidance, but you might wish to use throttle and\\or acceleration limiters."},{"CreatedByName":"renejant","CreatedById":104304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T19:34:34Z","Content":"I have set my tolerance parameter set to 0. as standard... might that be the case? And i usely set my throttle limit to 10 or 25% Have to try it out and see what it gives me...

Can it be done? Yes, but you\u0027ll need a really experienced driver. MJ is not an experienced driver.\n\nAdd some RCS and reaction wheels on your ship in order to keep its attitude."},{"CreatedByName":"renejant","CreatedById":104304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T00:00:03Z","Content":"I\u0027ve tried the suggestions of smjjames and biohazard15 and im using the dev version of mj 401.... All these have worked so far, my manouver node is less wobbly now i can be more accurate with my docking attemps.... \n\nIt seems that with using a tolerance of 3 m/s the ship seems to be more accurate... its still abit wobbly with the node, but alot less than it used to be... i thank you guys for guiding me into the right direction... still, i think this needs more attention as to how to pinpoint the specific problem...\n\nIt\u0027s on the manouver planner that i have found this kind of problem... dunno if im doing something wrong or that it is a specific problem with mj.... however every bit of help, helps me into the right direction into pinpointing the problem at hand..."}]}
