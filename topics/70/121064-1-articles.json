If i decide to quick search or something it just deletes them all and i cant do anything anymore, i need to go out of assembly and come back to see tabs on left and select which i need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt happens with KCT simulation but dont know the cause because i added now force d3d11 for better performance and i was switching between 32 and 64 bit of ksp (from ksp launcher menu only not community workaround) and then it basically started to happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny1 have clue what is happening or what? thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
