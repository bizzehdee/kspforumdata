Both of them seem to work while configuring the controls, but in-game only the buttons work and the sticks don\u0027t seem to do anything. They both work fine for other games. Can anyone help me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Never mind, I figured it out. I just had set the joystick for primary as well as secondary, now it works fine. If anyone has the same problem, make sure that you set BOTH parts in the joystick configuring panel section and then\u00A0see if it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-18T04:00:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2018 04:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by FellowBob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
