I was playing on my career save when my power went out. Upon power\u0027s return, the save file stopped opening. Instead, in the \u0022resume saved\u0022 section, upon attempting to open the save file, the ui acts as if the resume saved screen had been closed, yet appears to remain open without loading the save. It also lets me click on the other menu options that should be grayed out. Other saves work fine, and I\u0027ve already tried copying the save file, but that also does not work. Attached video to try and show what happens. I have a good amount of hours in the save, so I hope it should work, but at the very least I\u0027d just like to know whether it is recoverable or not. I have a short list of visual mods installed as well, but I don\u0027t think they\u0027re the problem. I can provide them if necessary. There is also a video but I am unable to figure out how to add it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
