But a symptom of coding within the stock game. You have to go and download the community foxes/patches mod. And it solves the problem with the ROCspawner. Additionally you have to delete the _Stock file from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E:R to remove the visual glitches with scatters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
