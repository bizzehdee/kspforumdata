I planned my mission and executed. Part of my mission was to land a rover on Duna. I finally did it! I was really excited. The first thing I did was check to make sure nothing broke then I saved and quit (other life duties got in the way). Now when I load that rover again one wheel breaks as soon as gravity loads. I\u0027ve tried loading again and again but every single time is the same. The wheels are perfect and the rover is on solid ground when I first load and then as soon as the game is finished loading and gravity starts one of the wheels breaks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is super frustrating after I finally got a mission successfully to another planet!! Is there anything I can do? I might try saving with the broken wheel and then modifying my save file to not have a broken wheel and see if that works but I would prefer not to do that if possible...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso I drove this rover around Kerbin\u00A0for 5 minutes before starting my launch so it should be a good enough design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T09:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIIRC wheel suspensions are fully extended when loading a craft. In your case they probably clip into the ground and are pushed up violently during physics start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are only two ways I can imagine how you can solve this:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) As you already said: Load the craft, let the wheel break, save it, edit the save. There\u0027s a possibility that the fixed craft will break again upon loading.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Edit the save file to lift the rover a few centimeters into the air. I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t help you with that because I\u0027m not sure how the game handles landed crafts. I think it tracks the position as if it is in orbit. So try to edit the orbit parameters first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T11:20:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222343205\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128909\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451555565\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103926\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022*Aqua*\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, *Aqua* said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...they probably clip into the ground and are pushed up violently during physics start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a bit of a long shot, but installing \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50911-105-kerbal-joint-reinforcement-v314-62215/\u0022\u003EKJR\u003C/a\u003E might help here.
