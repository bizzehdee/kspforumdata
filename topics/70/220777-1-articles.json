On reloading, I adjust my course and quicksave again to save effort in case I crash my ship again. When I press save after naming my quicksave, I get a pop-up window saying:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFatal error in GC\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnexpected stack overflow\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI click OK and KSP crashes. I try loading the game again only to see that my science save (the save I was playing on) says \u0022just started\u0022 instead of the normal flights, money, and science stuff. I try loading this save and I can\u0027t. Nor can I load any other saves. I try making a new save, and it loads. I go back to the menu and now I can\u0027t load that one either!
