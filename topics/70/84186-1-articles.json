It has four LV-1 engines, each at the bottom of a FL-T200 fuel tank arranged around a MK-1 can. As usual, before I did my transfer burn I deactivated each engine individually from the right-click menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the journey to Minmus the engines seem to have mostly sunk into the fuel tank. They\u0027re still listed in the staging stack, and I can see about half the nozzle. But the rest isn\u0027t visible. I can\u0027t right-click them to bring up the menu, so I can\u0027t activate them. No matter where I click I get the menu for the fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to bring up the right-click menu on parts you can\u0027t get at?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E32 bit Windows.
