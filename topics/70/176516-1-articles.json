I have seen a bunch of very interesting mods I want to try. However, Most are not up to date with the current 1.4.4 version.

If the version you are looking for is not in the list, there is another (bit more complicated) way to get them. You may want to keep your other install, so choose a different install location, \u003Cstrong\u003Ecreate a backup (at least of your savegame!)\u003C/strong\u003E or rename your current install folder like \u0027Kerbal Space Program 1.4.4\u0027 or whatever version it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I have to tell you some bad news: Savegames are not backward compatible! If you already load your savegame in 1.4.4., KSP will refuse to load it in an earlier version. You can still edit your savegame in a texteditor and change all version numbers inside to the particular version you want to play with, but there is no guaranty that this will work properly. (Maybe, if you have a quicksave which you haven\u0027t loaded in 1.4.4, you can try to rename it to \u0027persistent.sfs\u0027 but thats something I haven\u0027t tried by myself so I don\u0027t know if it is possible)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-06T03:17:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note, most mods are also not backwards compatible.\u00A0 A 1.4.x version of a mod will usually not work in a 1.3.x install.\u00A0\u00A0 For that, you have to do a little digging:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6779780931\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173371-how-to-get-old-versions-of-mods/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
