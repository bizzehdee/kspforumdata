I had to take a break from it for a few months because I got a new job and had to move to a new city and the new job had me on 3rd shift instead of 1st so it took my body a while to adjust. Anyways....I\u0027ve just got back in the loop of KSP again and installed the latest (1.04) and all my favorite mods (not really that many...FAR, Life Support, B9, Tarsier Science, TweakScale, BlizzyToolbar)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHERE\u0027S MY ISSUE:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever I\u0027m in the Hangar or the VAB or EVEN IN FLIGHT!!.....I have to Right-Click on whatever part that I want to manipulate or use about 5 or 6 TIMES before the contextual menu appears beside it! What gives???!!! This was never an issue when I played before....AND....just to prove my theory correct, I went and installed an older version of KSP, (0.18.glad I keep those old installers) and I had no problems I only had to Right-Click on the parts ONE TIME for the little menu to appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a known bug? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a fix?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs one of my mods causing it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions, workarounds, anything would be greatly appreciated.
