I\u0027ve had to switch PC following a hardware failure, and on my new PC, with the same install (I copied my GameData folder) I\u0027m having an issue with right-clicking parts while in space or landed:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- I can no longer get the right-click menu for any part belonging to a nearby ship and not the currently-activeship. Before I could not perform operations on another ship\u0027s part but the menu would show up\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- When in EVA, I can only bring up the menu of parts that are within reach of my kerbal. Before, I could load up any menu, it\u0027s just that only nearby parts would have actions (like folding solar panels for example) available\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Most annoyingly, the menu for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s joint port is no longer available, even when it\u0027s on the active ship or I\u0027m doing an EVA and my Kerbal is next to it. This means that while I can grab the hose from the resource centre on my \u0022tanker\u0022 ship, I cannot attach it to the \u0022receiving\u0022 ship\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not a save issue - on my old PC the very same save with the same two ships right next to each other works fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried reinstalling KSP and all its mods from scratch rather than using the old GameData folder but that did not help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?
