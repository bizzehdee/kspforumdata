I have deleted various mods and it crashes shortly after finishing with modulemanager every time.\u00A0I am looking for help on how to interpret this output log. I really cannot make much sense out of it, other than it crashes exactly at the same place everyime with and without Bluedog DB. \u00A0I cannot figure out the offending mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow are links to the output log and my mod list. Thank you for any assistance that can be provided. All else fails, I\u0027ll just go back to 1.2.2 and forget 1.3 even exists. haha\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_XBruXLjI9mZ0wtbkIxYkRuVGM/view?usp=sharing\u00A0(error log)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ygx5vEU5GBdsMXAxR5VFUVg2XfB2rdWwrjy4NWwxyrU/edit?usp=sharing\u00A0(mod list)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
