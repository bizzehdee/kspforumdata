Create any rocket of any design. Simulate or build vessel then launch it. Camera will stop responding, staging menu will stop responding, right clicking on vessel parts will still work. The camera will continue not responding in the VAB, and once you go back to the main space center screen it will be frozen at a low-altitude 90 degree angle between the VAB and the SPH. Happens in DMP and singleplayer, and all game modes.\n\nInstalled mods:\n\n[http://imgur.com/Qe5tTCD,KWImSSQ,M6eddg3,nFE8Zfd](http://imgur.com/Qe5tTCD,KWImSSQ,M6eddg3,nFE8Zfd)\n\nLog:\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59894637/log.txt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59894637/log.txt)"}]}
