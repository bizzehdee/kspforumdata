And yes, I am running the 64 bit client.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne significant difference I noticed is a long delay on the main menu before the EVE clouds appear and the menu becomes active. I\u0027ve also experienced objects in the map not appearing on their actual orbits which required a restart. I recently ran into a serious memory leak/overload which crippled performance and prevented quicksaving, something which has never happened before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue that prompted me to post this is a contract target orbit not appearing in the map/tracking station. Similarly maneuver nodes and orbit lines stop showing after a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-30T07:06:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2016 07:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Bobe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
