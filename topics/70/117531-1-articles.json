Thirty mods later and I never had any bugs or crashes on my career in 0.90. On 1.0.4, I just need to change the conduction factor to 1 and it\u0027s solid with the same mod list. Was even able to migrate my save game from 0.90 to 1.0.4 without issue. Maybe if you can post a mod list along with a log file, maybe people can help you sort issues out."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T21:28:12Z","Content":"Scottwasnt, if you would like to seek help with a modded KSP installation, please provide the following additional pieces of information:\n\n - Your computer\u0027s specifications\n\n - The mods you tried to install\n\n - The output log from when your modded game crashed:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [\\*] **The Logs**\n\u003E \n\u003E These are text files that the game spits out for debugging purposes as it runs; if something broke horribly in-game, there will be something in here about it.

PlanetFactory and Kopernicus, although I\u0027m not entirely sure, may be incompatible with each other. The most recent version of OPM relies on Kopernicus, and is, and always has been, a memory hog. Now don\u0027t get me wrong, OPM is an awesome that should be part of the stock game in my opinion, but it eats memory faster than I can eat bacon. The same applies to StarSystems. BoulderCo is more than likely, environment visual enhancements with some kind of texture pack such as Astronomer\u0027s Pack, another known memory hog (but very excellent mod). The others I don\u0027t have first hand experience.\n\nNow, about the memory issues. More than likely, your computer is a 64 bit system, right? And because it\u0027s a 64 bit system, it can address more than 4 GB of hardware memory. This includes both your RAM and the video memory on your graphics card(s). More than likely, your version of Windows is probably also a 64 bit operating system, meaning the OS can take advantage of the extra memory. However, Kerbal is not 64 bit software, it is 32 bit software running in a 64 bit environment. And now you see the pain in the rear. Kerbal itself can only use a max of 4 GB of memory. And guess what, approx. half a gig of that 4 GB is in video memory and is not reported by the OS. So according to Windows, Kerbal will crash at about 3.4 GB to 3.8 GB of memory usage. \n\nActive Texture Management will attempt to compress textures from mods in an attempt to bring the memory usage down. It does an extremely good job at this, within reason of course. Another thing to try is setting the texture resolution to half or quarter resolution (I visuall can\u0027t tell the different between half and full resolution with the new DDS textures, but I can tell the different in task manager).\n\nHopes this helps set things straight for you."}]}
