Lots of mods check what version of KSP they are being run in and display this message if it is not the version they expect. The mods may still work but there may be problems caused by the changes in 1.0.3 and 1.0.4 so I would recommend you go read the last few pages of the mods\u0027 threads and see what the status is of updates. If there is no mention of a new version for 1.0.4 then ask, but make sure you check first so you don\u0027t annoy anyone... ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bogeyman","CreatedById":136919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T10:33:16Z","Content":"I deeply apologize for having asked that question.
