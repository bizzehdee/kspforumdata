Problem as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* First I should say that there are NO traces of a problem in the log.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Anything attached to a docking port requires me to undock, *unload the craft* - IE go back to the tracking station/go to another craft/restart the game - and then reload the craft again, or the now seperate vehicles are stuck together but undocked. If I timewarp fast enough to stop physics, even if the craft move apart they\u0027ll snap back together once physics resumes - often amusingly welded together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I don\u0027t have tweakscale installed which was the source of practically all my 0.25 problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod list is as long as my arm, which is why I\u0027m hoping someone\u0027s solved it already or has at least stumbled across the problem \u0026amp; got it to go away by removing something.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-22T11:44:15Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2015 11:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Van Disaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T10:08:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any mods?

However if I\u0027ve triggered it in the flight scene at any time then I can\u0027t access any KSC building in the KSC scene, although I\u0027m perfectly able to go back to the start menus. This game has some very strange interactions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing a docking port as a decoupler seems to work fine in current stock, so I wonder what\u0027s getting at that.
