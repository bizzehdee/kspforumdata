This seems to occur more often with \u0022tippy\u0022 landers that have a lot of rotational forces being applied, and is more likely to occur when landing on a low-gravity body, however, I have also observed it when landing on Kerbin after a bad landing while the craft was struggling to stay upright using SAS and reaction thrusters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen this state is triggered, it persists even if I exit to the space center (which takes a long time) or switch to a different vehicle. However, if I save and quit the game (which takes several minutes) and then restart and reload the saved game, KSP goes back to a normal state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis problem was not observed in version 24.2 on the same hardware with the same drivers and mod list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EeataTREE\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T21:39:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is, quite probably, a whole slew of constant error spam in your log.
