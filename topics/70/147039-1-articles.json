When I enter Task Manager, everything looks absolutely normal. Something similar happens when I try to go to the map, but in addition to locking everything up, it also completely breaks the map and ship view, replacing the camera with a weird, Jello-like blob that vaguely resembles Kerbin - and I can\u0027t cancel the map view unless I hit Ctrl-Alt-Delete and click \u0022End Task\u0022 on the KSP process...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found a possible solution. In the KSP.log file, I found that RemoteTech2 was absolutely spamming the crap out of everything with \u0022I\u0027m connected - no wait, I\u0027m not...no wait...etc...\u0022 messages. Is there a method to disable this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-04T12:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like mods are breaking your game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemove all your mods and see if the problem persists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf getting rid of them solves your problem, you\u0027ll have to add them back in one at a time and figure out which mod or mods was causing the problem.
