It seems to happen only on my long time career save(with 30\u002B active flight). Whenever this happen, I still can click the back to main menu and Resume save again then it\u0026#39;ll usually work for me. However, sometimes the option on the resume saved page won\u0026#39;t be clickable and grayed out but I can fix that by switching my current focus window to something else, like file explorer or internet browser etc.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torgo","CreatedById":149873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T02:20:58Z","Content":"\nTry doing Alt-F12 and clearing the input locks.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bubbadevlin","CreatedById":136524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T03:03:43Z","Content":"\nI have had this issue ALOT, and i found its actually caused when you click out of KSP (when you have 2 screens) during the loading process of the save, so you either have to click out right after you load the save, or keep KSP as your window until it\u0026#39;s loaded in.
