You can read the details on interstellar\u0027s wiki, but a 2.5m fusion reactor with the same size generator set to KTEC mode will produce plenty power to run a 2.5m warp drive, but just make sure you have enough energy storage to start the reactor (~1-2k seems to be enough for the 2.5m one, but you need a fair bit more for the 3.75m one). 2-4 of the medium/huge radiators should suffice for that. It may help to click \u0022stop charging\u0022 on the warp drive though until you\u0027ve built up enough energy that the fusion reactor stops complaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll also need an engine to get it into space - you can\u0027t use the warp drive in an atmosphere (I don\u0027t recommend warping into an atmosphere either.
