I can get there fine and dandy but when I hit run experiment/scan/whatever. It registers me as clicking the button and opens say the materials bay. But it wont actually pop up the window for science, it also wont let me do any eva reports on minmus or surface samples. This is very annoying as I need that science to get past the Kerbin system. If anyone has any ideas at what might be causing this I would be grateful.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
