I am at the stage now where I have docked the 6 primary structure units together. When I went up to dock the next part (a science lab), I got no magnetic attraction between the docking ports and could not dock. I have tried several times since and am still getting no luck. The docking ports I am using are clamp-o-tron seniors. To save you time the problem isn\u0027t due to noob errors such as backwards ports etc ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif). Any suggestions?\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"Seaview123","CreatedById":130421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T17:10:54Z","Content":"Give this a try.
