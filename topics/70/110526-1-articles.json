Here\u0027s a screenshot:\n\n![crashed.png](http://www.nmichaels.org/ksp/crashed.png)\n\nThe UI looks like that, but the music keeps playing and I hear chatterer keep going. If I kill the GUI with Xkill, I still hear audio. I have to ctrl\u002Bc the terminal that launched the process (or just kill it). Here\u0027s a list of mods I have installed:\n\n- Kerbal Alarm Clock 3.3.2.1\n- Kerbal Engineer Redux 1.0.16.6\n- Chatterer 0.9.2.86\n- Kerbal Attachment System 0.5.1\n- Kerbal Inventory System 1.1.4\n\nI don\u0027t believe any of those are causing this, but it is a modded install. I\u0027ve seen this issue since before I installed KAS and KIS, and I\u0027ve updated KAC and chatterer since it started."},{"CreatedByName":"Finndibaenn","CreatedById":145700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T18:14:41Z","Content":"I witness the same behaviour, using 1.0.2 and somewhat different mods\n\nCommons ones with you are\n\n- Kerbal Alarm Clock 3.3.2.1\n- Kerbal Engineer Redux 1.0.16.6\n\nIt just happened to me and the last line of the log is \n\n[LOG 20:05:59.761] [Orbit Targeter]: Target is MinmusBase (unloaded)"}]}
