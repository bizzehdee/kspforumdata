I previously sometimes added a resource requirement to Manned Command Pods just like Unmanned Command Modules have. This way, if electricity is lost, command/control of the vessel is no longer possible. A lot of Life Support mods do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know in what version this may have changed in but...previously I would change \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E    MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        name = ModuleCommand\u003Cbr\u003E        minimumCrew = 1\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E    MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        name = ModuleCommand\u003Cbr\u003E        minimumCrew = 1\u003Cbr\u003E        RESOURCE\u003Cbr\u003E        {\u003Cbr\u003E            name = ElectricCharge\u003Cbr\u003E            rate = 0.00041667\u003Cbr\u003E        }\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the Manned Command Pod would drain ElectricCharge like the unmanned vessels. This now appears to lock up the ship on the launch pad indicating the pod does not have ClectricCharge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKinda seems like a bug that it doesn\u0027t work... or perhaps I\u0027m messing something up. But I thought it was worth reporting as a mod issue. Probably already known? My searching didn\u0027t turn it up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
