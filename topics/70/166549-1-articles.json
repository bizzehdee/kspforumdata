However I\u0027m trying to live with it as best I can. It\u0027s gotten to the point that it\u0027s crashing after about 4 or 5 transitions (change ships, go to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003Esph\u003C/abbr\u003E/tracking center/R\u0026amp;D) so it\u0027s becoming more and more annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a combination question though, as I mentioned in the title.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfirst, my mod list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommunity Tech Tree v 3.2.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Kerbal Alarm Clock v 3.8.5\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E v 1.1.3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Mechjeb2 v 2.6.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNear Future Construction v 0.8.4\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNF Electrical v 0.9.6\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNF Launch Vehicles 1.1.2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNF Propulsion 0.9.5\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNF Solar 0.8.7\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*NF Spacecraft 0.7.3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo my knowledge the ones with a * have not been updated to work with KSP v 1.3.1 yet, so it\u0027s likely one of these giving me the mono.dll exception.

I happened to peek into my gamedata directory and noted that Kopernicus was installed. As the expanded planets mod I want isn\u0027t updated to 1.3.1 yet, I decided to not install mods I\u0027m not really using. So I uninstalled it, and my rate of getting mono.dll crashes dropped to about every 12 to 18 transitions. (the above list and output files are post removal) However after a bit of playing, I jumped to a ship about to go through a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E transition and noted that the probe had 0 control. (the reasons are unimportant, but I had been jumping back and forth between this ship and my rover on the mun for about an hour real time.) It had 0 EC, and then I noted it\u0027s solar panels were no longer extended. I went through my ship list on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E and in the tracking station and all of my ships no longer had panels extended. What gives? Is that a known effect? Am I going to have to revisit all my ships every time I install or remove a mod? Nothing like that happened when I updated the NF mods. Any info that can be shared would be helpful for me to avoid dead probes. (I went back 3 game hours worth of quicksaves and found one it still had power, so I saved that probe.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-15T08:29:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223195334\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166549\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221508036186\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022139724\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starchaser\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Starchaser said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s gotten to the point that it\u0027s crashing after about 4 or 5 transitions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is the obvious sign of running out of memory.
