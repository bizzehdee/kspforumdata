It\u0027s been a while since I last posted here, but I\u0027ve been getting back into KSP lately. Anyway, I noticed that while building rather complex designs in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E that take a bit of time to craft, the \u0022Move Tool\u0022 stops snapping after a certain amount of time has passed, which is a problem since I use it all the time for aligning independently placed parts that can\u0027t be placed using symmetry. Currently, a workaround is to just restart the game, since that fixes the problem for a while, but eventually it just stops functioning. I can still use the per-pixel movement for the Move tool, snapping just doesn\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only mod I had installed while experiencing this issue is Kerbal Engineer Redux. Any potential solution would be greatly appreciated, thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHayden\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-08T02:37:55Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2018 02:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by 63Hayden\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
