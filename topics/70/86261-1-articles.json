It ow happens every 10 minutes or so. Just suddenly started the other day. I thought it might have something to do with Active texture Management as that was what I installed when it started happenning. But removing it alone changed nothing nor did reinstalling the game.

Are you using .24.2 or .25? If your using .25, several of the mods listed in your log are not updated to .25 yet. I would try removing them and see if that fixes your problem.

The .25 graphics issues happened for most of us since the settings.log was wiped though. Since you said it\u0027s still happening on a clean install with no mods (post the logs for that btw) it could be a computer itself issue.
