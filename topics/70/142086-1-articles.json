I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a while now, and I\u0027ve used mods before, but I was always very picky with my mods, and never really felt the need for more having than one or two mods at a time, if at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that I\u0027m really getting into mods, however, it\u0027s been an absolute train wreck. With as little as a few visual enhancement mods, kerbal konstructs, and a few parts packs, my game is glitching/ crashing constantly. Any more and I cannot even launch a craft. And even with the mods I have now, I pretty much have to restart the game any time I want to launch a new craft. None of the other steam games that I play have these kinds of problems when it comes to mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis cannot be normal. I\u0027ve seen/heard of plenty of KSP players and YouTubers who have way more mods than I do, with nowhere near the kinds of problems I have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also want to stress that this is definitely not a hardware issue. My computer is quite beefy; I have a very powerful graphics board, lots of RAM, a good processor, and a barely used 2 TB hard drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for software, my computer runs on 64-bit Linux Ubuntu 15.04\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there something I\u0027m doing wrong? Does the game just not work very well on this platform?
