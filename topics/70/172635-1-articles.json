I have NO aerodynamics mods what so ever, and im using Vanilla parts (dew to it being one of the career modes). Even when i make it as symmetrical as possible it STILL randomly spins. my only guess is that when i launch the plane, and it places it slightly above the run way, the bounce ends up shifting\u00A0 it slightly to the left/right. if you have any suggestions on helping combat that, i would love it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatRedMelon","CreatedById":181948,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-19T07:18:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs your plane completely symmetrical? If it is, check that your center of aerodynamics is slightly behind the center of mass. If these two don\u0027t work, turn off roll and yaw on the outer parts of the wings, the inner ones should just have yaw turned off. Eg... The bigger elevon 3s on the inside should have yaw off and the smaller elevon 2s on the outside should have roll and yaw off then finally turn pitch and roll off on the tailplane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-19T07:25:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2018 07:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by ThatRedMelon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-19T10:56:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could be caused by having the main landing gear to far in front or behind Center of Mass (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get a stable landing gear setup, you want\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nA main gear lifting the craft as close to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E as possible without tipping.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA nose gear or a tail wheel as far from the main gear as possible.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nA car type layout of the landing gear, where all the landing gears are located near the ends of the craft can create the symptoms you describe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a couple examples that are very stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YtHRIkW.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022432\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YtHRIkW.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GcfwKJU.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022432\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/GcfwKJU.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
