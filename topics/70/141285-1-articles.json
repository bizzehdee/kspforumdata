No matter how hard I try to move it even with Vessel mover and such. I have tried to reinstall and re-put the mods in but.. Eh.. the game seems to leave my craft there no matter what. Oh and I always crash in hangar while building something, like as if the game builds up ram and purposely crashes. Mods I currently have installed.
