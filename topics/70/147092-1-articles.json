I have tbe first 1/4 of my circler section parked 140m away from my station. When i when to go get my \u00A0module tug it didn\u0027t want to undock. I clicked undock in the menu for the docking port and the menu only shows enable/disable crossfeed and something else that i can\u0027t remember as i am in bed right now. The tug is still attached to the station and i can transfer crew in and out of the tug as if it were still attached to the station. I know that i can dock two spacecraft because i sent a probe with mechjeb on it to the same station. Can any of you help me? Its my first time on the forums so hello KSP forum:)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
