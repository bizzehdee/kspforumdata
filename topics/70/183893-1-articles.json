The contracts window starts offering me the basic contracts. I have installed contracts manager for historical contracts, but I only noticed the problem after installing the reliability manager and associated mods. It would be a shame to have to uninstall these because I really enjoy having the ability to fly discarded stages while still in the atmosphere. It makes the game so much better. Any ideas how to solve or negate this issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
