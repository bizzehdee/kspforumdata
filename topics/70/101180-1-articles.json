Once i get into a game and place down my command module or probe core. When i go to place one of the Engines down, once i drag the engine onto the screen it is turned on and flamming downward and to the left of the screen. It looks like it will attach, but when you do it, it just turns red and sits there.. You are unable to click on it to remove it or do anything else with the game beside Crtl-alt-Del\n\nI am running a bunch of mods, and i have moved Mechjeb out of the folder but it didn\u0027t help. My Module manager doesn\u0027t have a .cfg file.\n\nJeff"}]}
