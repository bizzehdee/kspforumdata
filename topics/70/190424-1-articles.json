Can\u0027t play the game at all due to this bug. I\u0027ll post all the things you guys need but any ideas on how to fix this? Most of the text doesn\u0027t work and is replaced by it. Time warp doesn\u0027t work. Running through the launcher doesn\u0027t work. Steam not working and even checking the files using my own eyes and Steam\u0027s find no errors. Maybe 1-2 but it goes down to 0 every time I check it. If redownloading doesn\u0027t work I\u0027m going nuclear. (Aka nuking it from space and redownloading every mod, Steam and everything KSP has ever touched.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSummary: Autoloc messing up and replacing most of the text with errors. Rechecking it doesn\u0027t work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
