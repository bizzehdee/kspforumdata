I recently downloaded a fair collection of mods to play with in 1.0.4.\n\n-MRS (Adds some very useful stock-alike parts)\n\n-Nuclear Age (Adds additional nuclear engines)\n\n-Kerbal Joint Reinforcement (Makes rockets less bendy, very useful.)\n\n-ModuleManager (Was needed for the next mod.)\n\n-KOS (Programmable Autopilot)\n\n-Tarus 3.75M (Adds some additional 3.75M parts)\n\nOne of the apparently changed around my tech tree in career mode adding a bunch of new tech nodes. Some of which are empty and I need to progress through them to access parts. I tried uninstalling every mod but the tech tree did not change back. I also tried deleting the tech tree config file I saw in my GameData folder, but somehow, ModuleManager regenerated that file, even after I uninstalled it. I want to revert to the default tech tree, even if it means uninstalling one or more mods.\n\nThese mods should be installed correctly. I haven\u0027t encountered any crashes/problems other than this:\n\nWhen playing with the Tarus mod, I noticed that two of the parts promised by the mod, a 3.75M lab and crew cabin were not present in the game, but were advertised with the mod. I tried re-installing it, restarting the game, and restarting my computer. I checked the mod files and the parts were in there. Though I think it may have something to do with the fact that this part is able to be toggled between multiple different models. I remember seeing on youtube and other mod threads that there are several mods that use this system to save memory or something. Is there some kind of support mod that I need in order to have these toggle-able parts in my game? (I also posted about this on the thread for the Tarus pack, but I haven\u0027t gotten a reply yet.)"}]}
