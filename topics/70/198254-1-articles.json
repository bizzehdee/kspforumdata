It\u0027s likely any building might trigger it and just happens that the vehicle one is the one I keep going into and triggering my crash.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m starting to go through a bunch of steps to try to correct the issue hopefully without having to sacrifice any mods but I figured I\u0027d reach out here with my logs to see if anyone could spot anything obvious to help me focus in on what I should be doing. I assume either there\u0027s an issue with one of the mods I\u0027m using or that the memory usage from my current mods is just too demanding. I figure the latter is more likely the case despite my 16gigs of ram.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, so I\u0027m currently trying out the forced commands from the sticky to see if they help, and will then be trying to adjust settings to reduce graphics as my graphics card isn\u0027t the best with only 2 gig of ram. Hopefully those steps resolve my issue, but again I figured it couldn\u0027t hurt to see if anyone saw anything in my logs that might help identify any issues.

The forced command definitely helped and I didn\u0027t have a single crash during scene transition even after several hours of play. It did have a very negative effect on appearance though and eventually did run into a stuttering crash that definitely appeared to be a lack of RAM. I went and bought 16 gig more to bring my system to a 32 gig one and hopefully that will allow me to play without further issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
