Cause I still have memory issues. I have a very solid pc (32 GB ram, excellent processor, high end GPU,etc ) but the game continues to crash when I mod it (sometimes extensively, sometimes not).

When you do this, you will be at the main folder (if you mod the game this should be familiar). There is the KSP_64.exe or whatever it looks like (I don\u0027t have 64-bit OS atm), and you will need to manually use this executable by setting a shortcut to it or adding it via the Non-Steam Games thing at the bottom of the steam games library.
