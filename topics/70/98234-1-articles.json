It has [pretty much always been fine with 2 crashes in April last year. Since I updated to 0.90.0 on the 7th of Jan this year, it has been crashing every single time I play, no matter how simple the ship. Often it will crash when a ship has not even been designed yet. Usually when I press the exit button ingame when I leave the space station, or the recruitment building, etc. I play both modded and unmodded, and it has crashed both modded and unmodded, however recently I begun using the KerbalEngineer mod so I guess I should post in this support thread page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have 13 crashes in the past month, and I have always played on Windows 32-bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am in the process of uploading the crash files to dropbox and will get a link to give to the devs when requested\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESystem specs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E2.27GHz dual core i5\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003EWindows 7 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E4Gb of RAM, however 1Gb is dedicated to graphics (supposedly)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E32-bit OS\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003EATI Mobility Radeon HD 5165 graphics card\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T04:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENew parts and other 0.90 features has added to stock memory print, bringing it to almost 2 Gb. 32-bit OS cannot address more than 2 Gb RAM to one application (without editing the boot options).

BUT every scenechange or vesselrecover the number increased. until i hit the 3.5 mark and know, the next swap to another scene will push me to my desktop. So now i downloaded the game, made a fresh install without ANY mods and i start at 1.9gb but nothing changed, its just a matter of time, until i hit the limmits. this is verry frustating and i despretly hope that someone knows a fix.
