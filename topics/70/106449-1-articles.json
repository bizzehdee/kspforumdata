If Frizzank hasn\u0027t already released a fix, go into each part file, find the line that says something like: \n\n    node_stack_bottom = 0, -0.204, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1\n\n(your numbers may vary)\n\nand change the fifth variable to -1, so it\u0027ll look something like this:\n\n    node_stack_bottom = 0, -0.204, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1\n\nYou will probably have to do this for any mod parts that haven\u0027t already been fixed, check the version numbers and change logs of mods before you download. I think Frizzank has already released a fixed version of FASA though.\n\nI don\u0027t know what\u0027s up with your tutorial, it sounds like you might have just set up the node wrong, there are a few video tutorials that can give you the basics."},{"CreatedByName":"VooDooV","CreatedById":141426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:43:32Z","Content":"gaarst, if its not a bug, then why will it not let me end scenario? thats misuse of the game? doing exactly as the instructions told me is misuse of the game? and if i am missing something, shouldnt there be a clue as to what im doing wrong? it is a walk through after all. i asked for help, not your critique of how i asked. and if you dont like how i asked, then dont help me and dont reply. and there is nothing unreadable in my post. thats you trying to find anything you can to take a shot at me with. because i \u0022bashed\u0022 your little game. and it wasnt even bashing, its exactly what is happening when i try to play. it aggravates me. is that ok with you?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T03:00:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 03:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DuoDex**\n  \nremoved cursing"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:50:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E BS gaarst, if its not a bug, then why will it not let me end scenario? thats misuse of the game? doing exactly as the instructions told me is misuse of the game? and if i am missing something, shouldnt there be a clue as to what im doing wrong? it is a walk through after all. i asked for help, not your critique of how i asked. and if you dont like how i asked, then dont help me and dont reply.\n\nGold-star attitude right there.\n\nIf you want help, try being a little more pleasant.

And I found a bug. It\u0027s hard to say if it\u0027s something the OP struggled with because they didn\u0027t really provide enough info to replicate their problem. But it\u0027s definitely something wrong with the tute. In a nutshell, the way the tutorial vessel is configured makes it difficult/impossible to rescue all Kerbals in it.\n\n**KSP version:** 1.0, on OS X Yosemite\n\n**Problem:** Docking Tutorial vessel detaches Hitchhiker Storage Container when parachutes are deployed.\n\n**Mods installed:** None.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:** I started the docking tutorial, and completed all steps. The final step suggests one way to rescue the Kerbals in the craft I\u0027ve docked to is to transfer them to my vessel, and then land. So I transferred all three from the Stranded command pod in to the Hitchhiker can on my vessel. Then I undocked, and burned retrograde to enter the atmosphere. Once within the atmosphere, I hit the stage key to deploy the parachutes. As well as the parachutes, the hitchhiker can and fuel tank and engine were decoupled. I had control of the pod, and the kerbals in the hitchhiker were lost.\n\n**What I expect:** Staging should deploy the chutes. Decoupling the engine and fuel tank is optional. I certainly did not expect to lose the hitchhiker as well.\n\nHere\u0027s a picture of the vessel at the start of the scenario. Note the position of the decoupler, and the fact that it\u0027s currently set to stage with the parachutes in stage 0. The simplest fix to me seems to be moving the decoupler down to below the hitchhiker. That way staging will result in the hitchhiker and pod descending.\n\n![zKFBAoB.png](http://i.imgur.com/zKFBAoB.png)\n\n(EDIT: Where is the best place to file bugs like this?
