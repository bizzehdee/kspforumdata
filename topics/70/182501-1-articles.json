At startup this blank central window appears, and nothing I can think of seems to dismiss it. When clicking on the toolbar button for KCT, the thin, blank window in the upper right corner appears and does nothing, but \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E window can be dismissed by clicking the button again.
