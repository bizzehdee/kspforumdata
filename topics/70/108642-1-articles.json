However after building a craft with some B9 HX and other parts (I know this is vauge) but I am sure I have seen it here on the forum where a craft has lifted off with way too much propulsion and is still showing on the launchpad with zero acceleration and not ascending in the map view. I can actually fly to an enormous altitude with very little throttle and fuel loss but in map mode the craft is at KSP with no altitude!\n\nI do not know if I have installed something in the 0.90 folder by mistake or whatever but the rest of my saved crafts fly ok.\n\nI\u0027m sure I\u0027ve seen a similar thread somewhere but have trawled to no avail.\n\nThanks in advance for any comments, good or bad.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T10:22:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 10:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by glibbo**"}]}
