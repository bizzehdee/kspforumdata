The attach nodes are also offset so there\u0027s a gap when attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a mod out there that changed the default texture and attachment node positions? I checked the obvious offenders, being KSPRC which has alternate stock textures, and Texture Replacer, but nogo as far as I can tell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is, I have a LOT of mods installed. I\u0027m guessing there\u0027s something that has a ModuleManager config that\u0027s overriding the stock config, possibly from an older mod I\u0027m using that wasn\u0027t updated to .25 compatibility. If I remove ALL folders except for Squad and NASAmission, the problem goes away.
