If it stops at \u2018expansion loading complete\u2019 there\u2019s almost always an exception crashing the game. Look in C:/users/your user/AppData/LocalLow/Squad/Kerbal Space Program for a file called Player.log or Plyer.txt, open that up and look at the end of the file for Exception, EXC, ERR or Crash; alternatively upload them to a file sharing site and link to it here so someone else can check it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see that you\u2019ve been modding\u00A0KSP inside the Steam folder- big mistake! It\u2019s a much better idea to copy KSP out of Steam\u2019s folder tree and \u003Ci\u003Ethen \u003C/i\u003Eadd mods, so that game updates can\u2019t break anything. Check your game version and if it\u2019s 1.10, you might need to roll back to an earlier version e.g. 1.9.1- right click KSP \u0026gt; properties \u0026gt; betas tab \u0026gt; select 1.9.1 in the list. Once that\u2019s downloaded, copy the entire KSP directory out of steamapps/common and put it somewhere else e.g. your desktop, then run the game from there and see if that works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you didn\u2019t already know, you can have as many copies of KSP on your PC as you like even on different versions and with different mods in each (I have 12 at the moment plus the one under Steam\u2019s control to get updates). If you don\u2019t use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, I suggest you give it a try as it makes version control and copying game instances vastly easier than doing it by hand; it\u2019s not perfect and it takes a bit of getting used to, but it\u2019s well worth the effort to get it set up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
