I assumed I was missing some part of the definition such as a certain altitude... \n\nI tried deleting everything from Game data (except Squad) and the launch pad contract functioned.\n\nNow I would rather not have to delete a mod, load, test, restore mod and saved state and repeate x 45 times. \n\nWhat rules should I follow to hit the most likely mods? \n\nSeems like those interacting with biomes, locations, and contracts would be better bets than parts kits.\n\nCactEye gives me a version warning.\n\nContractsWindow deals with Contracts\n\nAny ideas for logically proceeding. Will try to list out names of Mods (but not all are easy to ID from folder and some Mods load other Mods so I dont recognize all of them)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T19:46:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MrDude**\n  \nSolved by myself"},{"CreatedByName":"MrDude","CreatedById":134194,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T19:15:01Z","Content":"000\\_USITools - Has an agency Folder\n\nAirforceFlags\n\nBahaSP - Some animation thing related to Firespitter\n\nCactEye - REMOVED NO IMPROVEMENT - a Space Telescope Mod that triggers a Version Warning to use in 1.0 (Vs 1.0.2) but was reported to work on latest versions (functional but maybe glitchy?)\n\nCommmunityResourcePack\n\nContractWindow - TESTED - Deals with Contracts\n\nCrossFeedEnabler\n\nDMagicOrbitalScience - PROBLEM SOLVED - Adds contracts - From Curse Changes Log - Updated for KSP 1.0. - Fix contracts breaking\n\nFireSplitter - Added by other Mods\n\nFlags \u002B\n\nFuelWings\n\nKAS\n\nKerBalloons - Blimps\n\nKineTechAnimation - Unknown Suspect a support Mod animating effects used by another Mod\n\nKIS\n\nKlockheed\\_Martin\\_Gimbal - Part - suspect it is a support mod for something else (CactEye?)\n\nMechJeb2 - TESTED\n\nMK2Essentials - Parts\n\nMK2Expansion - Parts\n\nModularFuelTanks - suspect it is a support mod for something else.\n\nModuleRCSFX - Animating RCS thrusters? suspect it is a support mod for something else\n\nNavHud - Hud symbols projected out into space for orienting the visuals with the NavBall\n\nNereid - FinalFrontier - TESTED - Awards and history of accomplishments -\n\nNRAP - Variable Weight Capsule for Testing Lifters\n\nQuizTechAero - Parts \u0026 Flags\n\nScanSat - TESTED\n\nScienceAlert - TESTED Monitors Science opportunities\n\nSquad - Stock folder\n\nStageRecovery - Monitors and credits parts leaving the physics load sphere for parachutes \u0026 auto recovers.\n\nStationScience - Parts and Science expansion\n\nTarsierSpaceTech - Space Telescope Mod - Agencies, Parts, Galaxies, Resources and I assume Contracts\n\nTriggerTech - KerbalAlarmClock\n\nTweakScale - Change Part Sizes\n\nUmbraSpaceIndustries - ExpPack, Karbonite, Kolonization, SrvPack - Parts packs for Colonizing etc\n\nVerneTech - FieldScientistPack - Science Container \n\nModuleManagers: 2.5.1, 2.6.2, \u0026 2.6.3 .dll - I assume these don\u0027t conflict?\n\nAll TESTED results where individual removals. \n\nIdeally I want to be able to help which ever Mod or Combo of mods to improve.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T19:43:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 07:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MrDude**\n  \nSolved"},{"CreatedByName":"MrDude","CreatedById":134194,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T19:46:00Z","Content":"- [h=2]Found the Culprit  \nDMagic Orbital Science[/h]From the Curse Change Log  \nUpdated for KSP 1.0.2  \n\n    - Fix contracts breaking"}]}
