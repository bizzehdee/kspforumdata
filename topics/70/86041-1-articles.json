Pressing esc did pause the game after a few seconds and brought up the menu so i could go to the space center, which instantly \u0022fixed\u0022 the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried revisiting the ship, and also to visit the base directly. But in both situations the FPS problems returned whenever the colony was loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the entire colony is about 100-150 parts. Also it might be worth mentioning that the drilling platform and the colony is set a bit apart ~300m, which required 8 KAS ground pylons at close to max range distance to link up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReproduction:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe colony itself took many hours to build, and im unsure of all the parts used. so i can\u0027t reliably reproduce this bug in another save. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAll of these mods where downloaded less than 4 days ago.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModlist:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[0.24.2] TAC Life Support v0.10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[0.24.2] KSP Alternate Resource Panel v2.5.1.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[0.24.2] Universal Storage 0.8.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[0.24.2]NEAR: A Simpler Aerodynamics Model v1.1.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[0.24.2] Procedural Fairings 3.09\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[0.24.2] CoolRockets!
