I\u0027m running a 64 bit KSP 1.0.2 version on Ubuntu 14.04 and have noticed some significant difference in graphics quality in contrast to Win version.\n\nHere is some comparative pictures:\n\n[Windows](http://imgur.com/a/gAnzt#0)\n\n[Ubuntu](http://imgur.com/a/x07Wr#0)\n\nBoth games has MAX graphics settings, no graphics (textures) mods installed (nevermind the clouds, its really doesnt matter).\n\nPC specs:\n\nintel core i7 4700mq\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2Gb x2 (SLI)\n\n16 gb ram\n\nWindows: latest nvidia drivers from nvidia.com\n\nUbuntu: NVIDIA binary driver - version 331.113 from nvidia-331 (proprietary)\n\nMy question is... is it fine? I mean, linux x64\u0027s performance is great, i can use more than 3gb ram, but... is graphics supposed to be worse? Or am I just a noob who cant properly set up my Ubuntu? I would be very grateful if u can give me some answers and/or advices. \n\nThx."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:03:21Z","Content":"KSP x64 can have trouble writing to the settings.cfg depending on your system language, try deleting your settings.cfg, running KSP with \u0022LC\\_ALL=C ./KSP.x86\\_64\u0022 and setting the graphics again.\n\nYou will need to use LC\\_ALL every time, this is easier with a script like this.\n\n    #!/bin/bashcd \u0022/home/useraccountnamehere/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Kerbal Space Program/\u0022LC_ALL=C ./KSP.x86_64"},{"CreatedByName":"Miruzuki","CreatedById":117865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:10:22Z","Content":"Yes, i have read your thread about it and running exactly this shell script.

When im using nouveau driver, i have perfect, correct and smooth picture. When using nvidia ones (tried 331, 340, 346, now 349), i have this... [things](http://imgur.com/a/mDoSf#0). I dont even know how to call it... gradient stripes?! (update: just googled it, its calls \u0027colour banding\u0027). But this is terrible, i have the same effect in-game too. \n\nEverything is fine using nouveau, desktop wallpaper, steam background etc are looking good and smooth, but I cant play KSP using nouveau: it was launching and loading about ~5min (insteed of ~20sec like always) and then I got about 2 FPS in menu.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOoookay... I have just managed to solve this issue. The solution: \n\n1. Go into the nvidia-settings utility.\n2. Click on the section for your laptop display (mine was DFP-1-(LGD)).\n3. Go to the Controls tab.\n4. Under Dithering Controls there will be a Depth option. Mine was set to Auto and had two further options: 8 bpc and 6 bpc. Changing it to 6 bpc instantly solved the issue.\n\nThe laptop I\u0027m using is the Lenovo Ideapad Y510p with a dual GT750M card (SLI). I think, thread can be marked as solved for helping other people with same problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T16:25:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 04:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Miruzuki**"},{"CreatedByName":"dan2600","CreatedById":138534,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T16:26:09Z","Content":"I\u0027m having a similar problem in steamOS. I was able to get everything setup and running kerbal from the nvidia optimized script. The game runs super fast, textures look good, but I can\u0027t get aliasing to work, so everything looks crunchy."}]}
