They do not show up as missing/dead and are no longer in the ships they left in, meaning I can\u0027t finish the contracts and have to delete them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else had this issue? Is there anywhere I can see how they disappear?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-13T22:31:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have had this multiple times now, sadly its a modded save, I even tried to find where they vanished in the logs to no avail.\u00A0\u00A0 Now I just checked after just coming back to playing from a 1 month leave( I quit over constantly loosing crew/tourists) and one of my ships is missing it 20\u002B kerbals and I dont have any close saves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
