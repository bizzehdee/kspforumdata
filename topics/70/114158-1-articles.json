There is an issue with low mass parts experiencing runaway heating, and the service bays are also doing weird things with heat. In your save, everything around the service bay hits almost 700 in less than two seconds. I\u0027m not sure why that\u0027s happening or where the heat is coming from. \n\nSince I see no way around the explosion, my suggestion to you is to utilize the Alt\u002BF12 menu and select \u0022Ignore Max Temp\u0022 either before you load, or right after, then reload the quicksave. Let the runaway heating finish, then you can enter 1000x timewarp to equalize your ships heat and then turn the f12 menu option back off. This may not be an ideal solution, but it\u0027s definitely buggy behavior and there\u0027s no standard mechanic you can use to save the parts, or at least none I could figure out."},{"CreatedByName":"Finndibaenn","CreatedById":145700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T06:52:18Z","Content":"Thanks for the time you took looking at my case .\n\nI\u0027ll definitely try that, especially as, having accepted the battery loss, when I came back to the ships a few Kerbin hours later, the ship had disapeared without a trace, there aren\u0027t even a debris orbiting Minmus , i Have no idea what happened\n\nedit : just tried your suggestion, and shockingly, overheating didn\u0027t even occur ...
