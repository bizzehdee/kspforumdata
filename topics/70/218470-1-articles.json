I tried other parts and switching gamemodes, but those didn\u0027t work either. I then tried checking the Action Groups tab. I clicked on the Mystery Goo part, and in the Selection Tab one of the options was \u0022Toggle Cover\u0022 when it should\u0027ve been something like \u0022Observe Mystery Goo\u0022. Does anybody know what this could\u0027ve been caused by? I have no mods that would disable this because I tried it in Science mode (which should\u0027ve enabled it) and it still didn\u0027t work.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Screenshot_2491.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002259.50\u0022 height=\u0022670\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1101964456403157033/1130594642090533047/Screenshot_2491.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
