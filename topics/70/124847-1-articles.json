Every ship I saved and sub-assembly I made only shows 2-3 parts when I load them, basically they are all gone. The things that do load are a bunch of loose parts, not assembled/attached. Is this a bug or do I need to rebuild everything and start the game over?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit] I just noticed that every ship I had in orbit is just a single part now, so everything is gone \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E((\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T15:46:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first woes after a KSP update \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Downloaded 1.0.4 last night and am playing that until I get all my mods updated, and I see they are all coming out with 1.0.5 versions today. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat work by these guys, they make KSP into a better game imho.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"interface","CreatedById":122370,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T20:23:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eclick on the game in the list in Steam library, drop down menu click \u0027Properties\u0027, in the properties window click the \u0027Beta\u0027 tab, click opt in to betas. You don\u0027t need a code it will role KSP back to 1.0.4 automatically as the last stable release \u0022Beta\u0022. Its not a Beta test but that is how I rolled back to 1.0.4 last night after Steam broke my save updating. If you have already loaded the persistent save in 1.0.5 it will load your game with errors for ships/parts changed in 1.0.5, just use ESC or Alt F9 to load a save from the game (quicksave in 1.0.4 or a named save point in 1.0.4) and it should load that just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
