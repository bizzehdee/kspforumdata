The game shouldn\u0027t really get unstable until it is using significantly more than 2.45GB (more like 3.45GB, was that a typo?). An output_log.txt (yes, for a half hour run it will be very large, zip it and upload somewhere) and the version numbers of the mods would be very helpful. Have you tested if the same thing happens with a new save, e.g. create a new save and build and fly new vessels for half an hour? Also, does it depend on whether you actually use any of the mods, e.g. if you only use stock parts in a new save and don\u0027t use mechjeb or hyperedit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it does still crash with a new save using only stock parts then you should be able to narrow down which mod(s) are at fault by removing some and testing again as it describes in the \u0022How to get support\u0022 sticky thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Major999","CreatedById":131827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T09:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E2.45 was not a typo, and ill have the player.log up soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T21:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Major999\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Major999\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2.45 was not a typo, and ill have the player.log up soon.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor what it\u0027s worth, 0.90 under OS X seems to become unstable due to RAM usage for me right around that point too.

The log shows a null reference exception in Romfarer.Util.LightTexture, then a failure to allocate a chunk of memory of about 30 MB followed by trying to access the null pointer that results which crashes the program hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be worth checking with the author of the docking camera mod if the null reference exception is expected though I suspect it is caused by a previous failure to allocate memory that doesn\u0027t result in a hard crash because it is handled inside the mod code and then the game crashes when doing something more low-level inside the unity player itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is probably very little you can do about it at the moment though you could try changing the ATM settings to reduce memory further. As LameLefty indicates that it takes a lot longer for his game to reach the same level of memory use it may be worth trying removing one mod at a time as there could be one that is making the issue worse. I would start with the docking camera and see if that affects how long you can play, then try scansat. Alternatively, stripping out more part based mods should generally reduce the memory usage and allow you to run for longer before hitting the limit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
