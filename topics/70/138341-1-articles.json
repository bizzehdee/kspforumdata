Sometimes craft leave them behind on the ground, most of the time they just stick out of other things. Not all models have these, but a noticeable amount do. They don\u0027t all pop up under wheels either, like in the screenshot. I saw one pop out of the MK1 command pod too at a certain viewing angle. The screenshot just conveniently has a lot of them close together, so it\u0027s hard to miss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods used: EVE, Kopernicus, Module Manager, PlanetShine, Real Plume, Scatterer, SmokeScreen, SVE, Crowd Sourced Science\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/CnaNYrB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/CnaNYrB\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing 1.1 in 64 bit mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CnaNYrB.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CnaNYrB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-28T08:45:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2016 08:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tricky14\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tricky14","CreatedById":145768,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T19:10:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tricky14","CreatedById":145768,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T11:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022k7vqFk0.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k7vqFk0.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T13:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had planetshine and scatter, as well as about 60 other mods, installed and was getting the same thing.\u00A0 Once I removed those two mods, It went back to normal.
