It just happened a while ago. I had an SSTO orbiting Kerbin, when I choose it from space center its delta wing explodes saying it has exploded at launch pad!! Then I decided to quit game and return and the annoying thing started here. Now, I can not load any of my saved games in the main menu. I just started a new career and came back to load it and it didn\u0027t work also...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy career mode is so crucial because I am uploading videos on Youtube from that. It is so strange but that thing doesn\u0027t allow me play the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: Now tried and saw that I am not able to run those Scenarios also.
