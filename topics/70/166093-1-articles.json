And it works when you don\u0027t have mods installed? The answer is simple: The mods are causing the issues. Make sure all your mods are up to date when you update KSP, otherwise that can cause frequent issues. Also, it could be a memory issue. KSP can only handle so many mods, and you know you\u0027ve gone too far when you either can\u0027t even load the game, or it crashes five minutes later. Uninstall all your mods, and\u00A0then install the mods that you like the most. I know it can be tempting to install a massive amount of mods, but you need caution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zpajro","CreatedById":181820,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-04T12:41:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat I was hoping, was that someone could read the error reports that the game generates then it quits.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have only around 30 mods and using less then10Gb of ram including all the stuff running in the background, so it\u0027s not what I\u0027m running out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-04T15:35:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first thing to do when mods are causing issue is identify which mods are to blame.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstal part of the desired mods an \u00A0test.
