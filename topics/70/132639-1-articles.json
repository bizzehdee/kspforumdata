I had one spacecraft left which was at 2,300,000m. I had many things in orbit, the best was my big Space Station. \u00A0I don\u0027t mind about my small probes but i do want my Space Station back. The Station was at a normal 150,000m orbit around the equator of Kerbin and i don\u0027t know why it has gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried restarting KSP and that didn\u0027t do anything, I don\u0027t want to loose all of my spacecraft. I didn\u0027t add or remove any mods between the time of leaving for Bop and arriving at Bop so i don\u0027t know why. I have things in orbit of other planets and moon but they are still there, even ones around the Mun but all the ones at Kerbin are gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan any one help me and tell me why they are gone and how to get them back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-21T15:02:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2016 03:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MattQGamingHD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T16:11:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you try to select to show all types of ships in the map screen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MattQGamingHD","CreatedById":158748,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T17:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYea all of the types were selected and i used to have 3 Space Stations altogether but on the icons it only said 2, the Missing one being around Kerbin\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spraki","CreatedById":155616,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-23T08:48:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo idea on how to get your stations back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd i am not sure if my comment will help, but I remember having the same issue where my ships would disappear suddenly. It happened when I was on a rendevous-orbit and the ships were soon to meet in the same area (or \u0022grid\u0022, as EVE Online people would say it).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I would some day notice a \u0022BOOOOOM!\u0022. Looks like the ship I always wanted to meet went boom. IIRC, the forums mentioned that if ships have closed cargobays with monoprop tanks (or something alike), it will somehow just get this heat spike when loading into your vicinity and just blow up the ship. The fix was to leave cargo bay open. At least I did it and the disappearing stopped.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if this is the same thing.
