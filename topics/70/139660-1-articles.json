However the next step has proven trickier; I want to return some old completed vessels around the Mun etc, but copying and pasting these (also edited) into the \u0022persistent\u0022 file leads to issues where the vehicle appears correctly on the map, but I can\u0027t Fly them, and the game seems broken because I can\u0027t launch or load anything from the VAB etc.\u00A0 I tried doing it manually, as well as using the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/73990-all-osjavawip-ksp-savefile-editor-v022-241114/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbal Savefile Editor\u003C/a\u003E to try and automate it, but neither makes any difference. It\u0027s not individual parts blocking it, does any one know if there\u0027s a more up to date vehicle-importer, or what the issue might be which is blocking me? Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
