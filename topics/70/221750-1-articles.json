However, I will be getting a new pc soon and I just wanted to ask if KSP saves are saved on the cloud? I don\u2019t have a backup version on a hard drive anywhere, and the new pc will be Linux. I know that I can re-download KSP from the private division store (it\u2019s direct download) but I REALLY don\u2019t want to have to start a whole new game. Does anyone have a fix for this ? Can I somehow extract my KSP saves from my broken pc?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-22T15:13:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have the store version, then no.\u00A0 The saves are not in the cloud, that would only be with the Steam version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can try booting the Macbook into a live Linux environment (like an installer) and see if you can pull files from the onboard storage drive.\u00A0 As long as your bluescreens are an issue with the OS itself and not a hardware failure, it should be fairly straightforward if you didn\u0027t encrypt anything in Windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe saves are in \u0026lt;KSP Root Folder\u0026gt;/game/saves\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere will be a folder for each save, containing all the save files and the craft files.\u00A0 If you copy that entire folder over to a new install, you should be able to load it normally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
