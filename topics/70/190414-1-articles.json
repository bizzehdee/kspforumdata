I think I understood what the issue was. Since I\u0027m playing in career mode, a lot of functions of different mods are locked until you unlock some tech in the tech tree or upgrade some building. For example how Mechjeb requires upgrades in the tech tree. So basically after unlocking the Advanced Flight Control tech node the trajectories mod icon appeared. I think the issue here is that the mod is working even before you unlock this tech node which is kinda illogical, so maybe that needs a\u00A0fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried to look this issue up on the internet but I couldn\u0027t find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all,\u00A0I am playing on version 1.8.1 with quite a few other mods. I can give you a list of them later if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have Trajectories mod installed through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E. It works in the game as it\u0027s supposed to, shows trajectories and so on, but there\u0027s no toolbar icon. Toolbar Controller mod also doesn\u0027t recognize and show Trajectories. I tried reinstalling the mod but that doesn\u0027t help. So please help me understand how to fix this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason why I need it is to be able to only enable it when I actually need it, which is quite rare. This mod actually drops my fps to around 4, so that\u0027s almost unplayable, but it\u0027s okay I guess. If there\u0027s anything I can do to fix such a huge fps drop then please also tell me how to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for taking time to read this\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-17T02:29:40Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2019 02:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Yamiko Hikari\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESolved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
