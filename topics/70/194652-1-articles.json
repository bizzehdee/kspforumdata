After making the heads, I loaded the game and it appeared to load normally, but once I got to the black screen with the \u0022Loading\u0022 spinner, my computer started lagging until my mouse, drawing tablet, and CTRL\u002BALT\u002BDEL stopped working. All I can do is hard reboot my computer. Unmodded 1.5.1 works just fine.
