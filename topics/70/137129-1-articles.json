I\u0027ve been having some issues with the parachute for FASA\u0027s Apollo parts for some time now and it really annoys me. The chute is always fully opened when I add the part and during the whole flight. I\u0027ll add a picture. The chute always stays exactly the same as in the picture during the whole flights. How do I solve this?\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/nCKaE/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
