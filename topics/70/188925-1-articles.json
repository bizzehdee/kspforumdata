I\u0027m not sure what they mean but it must be serious enough to tell me about it in this manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027s also affected some of my mods, because ive noticed that OPT is missing several parts, some of which are integral to my SSTOs and such. It says to see KSP\u0027s log for additional details but i\u0027m not sure where to look in said logs, but\u00A0I took some screenshots of\u00A0what i\u0027m talking about, if it helps at all:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/lHtfMxW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/lHtfMxW\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust looking for some help, and to potentially restore the missing OPT parts.
