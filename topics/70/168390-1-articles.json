Is there any special technique I need to use or any mod I need to install? I do have all the community mods as well as mods by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E, but I can\u0027t find anything. I can see those ores on the map too, and it shows about 5% richness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nS1, S2 and S3 separators all show as dirt. Everything shows as inactive or nothing to harvest. My engineer can interact with the drill and attempt to change S1,2 or 3 to something else, but I\u0027m missing specialized parts and material kits - how can I get those? Would that help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-10T08:29:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2017 08:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Ekaton\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"voicey99","CreatedById":166341,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T10:26:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can cycle through their bits in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E before you launch, but you have to deploy them to do that (for whatever reason).
