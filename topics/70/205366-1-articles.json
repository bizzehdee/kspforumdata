I want to know how to figure out the Combined Rating (CR)!!\u00A0 If the CR is actually the Range or the Distance... Then I can make sense (maybe) of it.\u00A0 But when I\u0027m trying to put a SAT in orbit around the Mun with a Relay Antenna Rating of at least 5.00M... and I slam a RA-M-08 Relay Antenna Rated at 100G, then darn it, it should complete the requirement!!!\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I sit in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E with Contracts open and I add antenna after antenna after antenna, all relays and it doesn\u0027t give me a check mark stating I\u0027ve met the build requirements... Then I\u0027m lost and Frustrated. 9 hrs of trying different combinations, hours of launches getting them into orbit just right only to find I for some reason Cannot combine enough antennas to meet the requirement.\u00A0 This should not be this difficult...

Each additional relay adds (0.75^n) additional range where n is the number of extra antennae after the first (it\u2019s a zero index as anything^0 = 1). With two identical dishes that have 32M range, you\u2019ll get 32 \u002B (32^0.75) = 32 \u002B 24 = 56M total range; add a third and that one gets ((32^0.75)^0.75) = 24^0.75 = 18M additional range, and so on. You\u2019ll quickly run into some pretty steep reductions with more dishes- the second dish adds barely half the original range, the fourth is about 0.3 times- and it quickly becomes cheaper, lighter and more efficient to add one better dish e.g. an RA-2 with a rating of 2G than stacking a load of smaller ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have antennae with different ratings, I believe it starts from the most powerful before working down to the weakest.
