There are a number of \u0022Out of memory\u0022 messages in your log as well as a number of other suspect looking things. Active Texture Management is giving an exception on startup and reporting that it isn\u0027t saving you any memory, have a look if there is a newer version and make sure it is installed correctly. MechJeb is reporting a couple of out of memory messages when trying to calculate re-entry simulations and appears to be an old version. A couple of your other mods also appear to be slightly out-of-date (e.g. Infernal Robotics).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kar","CreatedById":122714,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T22:09:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll right, I\u0027m going to check them out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
