I heard about the Waterfall mod and tried downloading it, along with the WaterfallRestock mod. I opened up the downloaded folders, and each had a Gamedata folder within them. So I put the files called Gamedata into the KSP Gamedata folder. I open up the game and and I\u0027m not presented with any errors or incompatability issues. I build a rocket with a Vector engine and fly it, only to discover that there aren\u0027t any effects added. As a matter of fact, there wasn\u0027t an exhaust plume to start with.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the latest version of the base game (bought directly from the KSP website), Restock, and ModuleManager.

It\u2019ll also help if you can find your log files, put them on a file sharing site (preferably one without nasty malware popups) and post links to them, see this guide for details:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002275006\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9708099470\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83212-how-to-get-support-read-first/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck the Waterfall forum page and make sure you also downloaded any and all dependencies- if Waterfall relies on another mod to do something but you don\u2019t have said other mod, Waterfall won\u2019t work right/at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinal question- did you buy KSP on Steam, and if so did you put mods into the Steam copy of KSP? Steam has a habit of corrupting modded KSP so it\u2019s always a good idea to make a new copy of KSP (just copy the whole Kerbal Space Program directory and paste it somewhere else e.g. your desktop) and then put mods into the new copy where Steam can\u2019t meddle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AstroSean","CreatedById":223319,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-18T00:20:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlright I think I got it working now.
