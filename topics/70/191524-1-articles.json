I started a large career game a while back with a goal to fully explore the Kerbal system. All surface anomalies explored, all biomes and artifacts mined for full science. The problem is that I\u0027m having recurring issues getting the game to recognize that I\u0027ve gotten close enough to an anomaly for the achievement to pop. I planted a flag on top of a Moho Monolith and never got the achievement notice. Now I\u0027ve just had the same problem exploring the Mohole: circumnavigated the rim, then saved and jumped in: achievement never popped up to the second I smashed into the bottom of the hole. This has happened before on other bodies but I\u0027m sometimes unsure if the achievement is triggering and I\u0027m just missing it. Been watching the screen carefully as I explore Moho and convinced it\u0027s just not happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheories I think I\u0027ve ruled out:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI am using the Bon Voyage rover mod to explore the surface. It\u0027s basically a rover autopilot that will move across the surface while you\u0027re off doing something else. I discovered some time ago that you must cross a certain threshold in order for the game to recognize the achievement, so if you just Bon Voyage to the anomaly it\u00A0will not trigger until you drive away and return across the threshold. I address this by manually driving in from about 3 km out and have had this work, but repeated attempts to drive 3k away and return have been unsuccessful at times.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI have wondered if physics warping while manually driving my rover will allow the craft to skip past this threshold and not trigger the achievement. Not certain, but it seems like I\u0027ve had this happen in the past and solved it by driving in real time. Haven\u0027t used any warping within 3k of the anomaly and it\u0027s still not popping.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPotential factors:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI am running V1.7.2 because that was current when I started this career. Don\u0027t want updates to break my ships, especially the ones I spent forever designing and testing to explore Eve. Possibly something more recent had addressed a cause of my issue?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOther mods besides Bon Voyage wouldn\u0027t seem a factor to me, but are: Kerbal Alarm Clock, Kerbal Engineer, For Science, Hyperedit, Transfer Window Planner, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, Precise Maneuver, and Trajectories. The only non-stock parts on the rover in question are from Bon Voyage and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E LS.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts? The lack of achievements isn\u0027t breaking the game, but it\u0027s annoying because the whole point of the career is to thoroughly explore, so it\u0027d\u00A0be nice if the game recognized it. I plant flags at every discovery\u00A0to track my progress, but and still annoyed driving around for hours of real time trying to get achievements to pop with no dice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading and any assistance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-10T08:33:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223738675\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191524\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221581311269\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161071\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022N4CDLAW\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, N4CDLAW said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI planted a flag on top of a Moho Monolith and never got the achievement notice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I noticed that after I had the tech tree fully unlocked and got the note that I discovered \u0022nanolathing\u0022 upon visiting a green monolith, I never got any notifications that I discovered another green monolith.
