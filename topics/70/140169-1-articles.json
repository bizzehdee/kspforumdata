I\u0027ve since installed ampyear to try to find the power hungry culprit but ampyear shows me that i have over 200 electrical charge compared to consumption but yet the timer showing how long i have power left still keeps going down and batterys keep dying. My only work around is to use the power cheat but ruins immersion for me. I have tried for 2-3 days and many hours to fix this with no luck as yet. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
