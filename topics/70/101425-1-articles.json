This causes your crew to be trapped inside and your ship is no longer functional. Crew transfer is impossible using stokc, crew manifest, and ship manifest. I need to know how to get it inflated again by force, because of course, the \u0022Deploy\u0022 button is no longer visible. Ive got some code from the part in question and my save file snippit of the part on the actual vessel.
