Flight Engineer is telling me that every stage has a torque rating of \u0026gt;0kN, which I know from past experience means that my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E aren\u0027t lining up. Thinking it was the payload I try balancing out the weigh to no avail, finally I get frustrated and stick the stock Mk1-2 Command Pod on the top of the rocket in the payload section, I know\u00A0it should be balanced but I\u0027m still getting a torque of about 8kN on the first stage and the rocket still chases its tail coming off the pad. I tried moving the engines, fins, rebuilding the rocket from scratch, I have no idea what\u0027s caused this sudden imbalance in thrust and it has basically grounded me until I can figure it out (it\u0027s affecting ALL of my rockets). This rocket did not have this issue when I was playing yesterday. The most recent mod I installed was Stockalike Station Parts, but yesterday and most of today went by fine so I\u0027m not certain it\u0027s the cause of the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-30T00:25:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndoes control trim register as torque?
