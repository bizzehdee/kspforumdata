Whilst I\u0027m happy to share anything, I\u0027m really only asking if someone recognises this bug (or is it a debug feature of some mod?) out of the blue. I don\u0027t expect anyone else to actively search for it without proper information at hand. If worst comes to worst I\u0027ll just do a binary search myself, but first...\u003C/em\u003E Has anyone seen this before?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn both the SPH and VAB, straight below the center of origin of the parent part (present before the part is chosen as well) a white pill shaped object is present. It is about the size of the Mk 1 cockpit. It remains there and does nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring flying it is again present on the launch pad/runway. It then remains there as the craft is launched. During flight these objects then regularly spawn from the craft, and stay fixed at the point of spawn. I don\u0027t know if they last indefinitely or if they disappear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring timewarp it reappears at the craft origin, where it remains until end of timewarp. It then disappears immediately on stopping timewarp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all there is no noticeable hit on performance or anything else out of the ordinary. Nothing red comes up in the error log. I run a multitude of mods, and I think this is caused by one of them. I normally install them correctly, maybe this is a conflict. Or I by accident downloaded the wrong version of something and its a debug/testing thing. Either way, \u003Cstrong\u003Eany clues?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T18:38:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t a clue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T18:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s a Unity primitive. but why it is there, can\u0027t tell. your best bet is check logs for error messages and start with clean install and add mods one by one till you encounter a mod that causes it to appear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"plausse","CreatedById":64331,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T18:52:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your quick help both of you, looks like I will go on a foxhunt.
