Always happens in intervals maybe every 10 seconds.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy frame rate isn\u0027t great anyway for whatever reason. It\u0027s by far the lowest i have for any game. I run some pretty demanding games on high settings where i\u0027m usually good for 30 - 60 fps. But on this i\u0027ll get 10\u00A0- 20\u00A0frames at most. And that\u0027s when i\u0027m far away from Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn Kerbins atmosphere i\u0027ll have about 10fps, and when the dip kicks in every 10 seconds it\u0027ll drop to about 5, then back up to 10 - 15.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo any idea why my frame rate is so low and why i have these dips?
