While I had Bill add in solar panels to the Hab Module, the entire computer froze. I restarted it and went back to KSP, only to discover this:\n\n![SR4dhhs.png](http://i.imgur.com/SR4dhhs.png)\n\n**Mods installed:** All mods were working fine prior to the crash, so it\u0027s unlikely to be a mod-related issue.\n\n-Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar(0.90)\n\n-Active Texture Management(0.90)\n\n-Image Viewer(0.90)\n\n-Kerbal Engineer Redux(0.90)\n\n-Kerbal Joint Reinforcement(0.90)\n\n-Kerbal Inventory System(0.90)\n\n-NavBall Docking Aligment Indicator(unsure, but always had worked with no issues)\n\n-RealChute(0.90)\n\n-Trajectories(0.90)\n\n-Kerbal Alarm Clock(0.90)\n\n**Reproduction steps:** Can\u0027t; issue is stemmed from an after-crash effect.

I have the stretching of ground textures too on Kerbin after several loads and reverts of flight. I don\u0027t even need crashes for this to happen. I usually just restart the game and the textures go back to normal."},{"CreatedByName":"TimKerbin","CreatedById":83805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T02:50:30Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty sure I know what\u0027s causing this; I had EXACTLY the same issue recently and all I did to fix it was remove the Active Texture Management mod, which I see you have too. I know Active Texture Management takes forever to install but trust me, I\u0027m 99% certain it is to blame for this. I have never, ever seen textures stretch like this on any body, in all the versions I\u0027ve ever played (I\u0027m also running v.90) until I installed Active Texture Management.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T02:55:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 02:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TimKerbin**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceLaunchSystem","CreatedById":125698,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T17:42:43Z","Content":"I have the same problem too!
