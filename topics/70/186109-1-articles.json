I then removed the maneuvers all together while already executing one and focused view on Jool. As soon as my conic moved into an orange line within the Jool system, the crast to desktop still occurred. At this point, I\u0027m going with the notion that this is not a fault on my own, and is just a bug with the game. The developers of KSP did not start right in the beginning anyway and it was never rebuilt from the ground up to help fix all the many bugs it has but I look forward to KSP2 which is developed from scratch by more experienced developers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the workaround to my problem right now, I\u0027ll just cut engines, use the cheat to set orbit around Pol, and discard any parts that should have been tossed during the transit. The Cheat menu can be access with Left Shift\u002BAlt\u002BF12. Because the Shift is used to increase your thruster, you may need to cut engines before use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
