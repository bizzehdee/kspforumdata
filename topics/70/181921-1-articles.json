I\u0027m not sure if i\u0027ve installed some oddmod or whether KSP updated nuke engine info but look at the attached photo of the nuke engine? there\u0027s so much useless info i don\u0027t need to see, i can also switch fuel types and can fill them with things such as actinides, enriched uranium, plutonium-238 etc ... never heard of this before?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know what\u0027s going on? can i simplify the info? there\u0027s also another issue since i cannot use them in space, they don\u0027t fire, i\u0027ve done all the checks and liquid fuel tanks are in the same stage but they won\u0027t turn on. any guesses?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\u003Cbr\u003E\nNick\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-02T16:47:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like most of those fields are coming from KSP Interstellar Extended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/sswelm/KSP-Interstellar-Extended/blob/master/FNPlugin/Propulsion/ThermalNozzleController.cs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/sswelm/KSP-Interstellar-Extended/blob/master/FNPlugin/Propulsion/ThermalNozzleController.cs\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nick533a","CreatedById":174472,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-02T16:57:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthank you for the reply, will remove mod, reload and check again\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nick533a","CreatedById":174472,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-02T17:20:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks! that\u0027s part of my problem solved, much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you know what these 2 fuel sources are? \u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/vPwXuhw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/vPwXuhw\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre these another mod? i suspect they will still render my nuke engine inoperable since they are empty, haven\u0027t seen these before?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-02T17:36:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose seem to be defined in Community Resource Pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/BobPalmer/CommunityResourcePack/blob/master/FOR_RELEASE/GameData/CommunityResourcePack/CommonResources.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/BobPalmer/CommunityResourcePack/blob/master/FOR_RELEASE/GameData/CommunityResourcePack/CommonResources.cfg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
