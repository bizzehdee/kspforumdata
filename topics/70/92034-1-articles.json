So this mod comes with a lot of engines, but i cant seem to get any of them to work. Now i\u0027ve been trying the plasma thruster, which as far as i can see is an electric engine and it required liquid fuel too, so i made a simple rocket, which contained only reactor, electric engine, liquid fuel (tried with and without oxidizer and both failed) and the engine. The engineer says i have 30 000 delta V, 11000 ISP, and like 2 TWR, but when i start the engine and trottle up, the power manager says that it consumes power, but it wont thrust... it just stays there, no fuel is consumed, just power. Here is the setup (here the engine is not trotled up)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022\u0026lt;a  href=\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022\u003Ehttp://s28.postimg.org/p1vmar4cd/screenshot2.png\u0027 alt=\u0027screenshot2.png\u0027\u0026gt; \u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimage.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eimagen\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T21:33:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is that KER and Mechjeb assume maximum thrust, you are using fuel, but because the engine is so efficient you don\u0027t see it for a very long time. They are good for deep space until you get fusion reactor. I\u0027m fairly certain it also needs to be directly connected to your electric generator. You also don\u0027t appear to have a reactor, just a thermal microwave receiver which doesn\u0027t do a whole lot without a microwave transmitter pointed at it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-05T21:35:20Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2014 09:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Taki117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
