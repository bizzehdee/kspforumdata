The part that confuses me is that whenever I activate agricultural modules, start habitation in the modules or do anything like that, the total \u0022days\u0022 left for my Kerbals to live doesn\u0027t change. Ever. I tried reinstalling both UKS and USI-LS, but that didn\u0027t help. Am I just horrible at figuring out this mod, or might there be another problem?
