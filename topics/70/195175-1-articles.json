I assume it\u0027s floating point rounding errors or something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now I\u0027m playing around with ground bases to a degree that I hadn\u0027t before, thanks to MKS allowing me to have bases that don\u0027t kraken-splode. (All hail Roverdude!) And my landing site turns out to be one of the locations where the flickering and wobbling is constant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI expect the answer is \u0027no\u0027, but is there anything to be done about it? A super-secret command line argument to use higher floating point precision, or the work of some clever modder? If not, I can live with it, but it doesn\u0027t hurt to ask.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
