However, I suspect the problem is likely to return. There used to be a problem very similar to this just after one of the KSP updates changed how the size of parts was specified but I wouldn\u0027t expect any mod to still have that problem. Is that part the root part of the vessel by any chance?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-26T15:35:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2015 03:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Padishar**"}]}
