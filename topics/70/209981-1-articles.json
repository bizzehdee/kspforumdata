I\u0027m trying to figure that one out myself, happened to me after I updated kopernicus and parralax (mind you not on a fresh install).\u00A0 Buttons start duplicating after scene changes (switch to another vessel, go back to the space center) each switch gains you more buttons. The ones duplicating seem sort of random, sometimes mechjeb or wolf or the stock buttons themselves.\u00A0 Another side effect is losing right click ability in flight after so long or too many scene switches. I Get it on 1.12.0 and 1.12.3. If I go back to my 1.12.0 install pre kopernicus and parralax update I\u0027m fine...but I want the grass! Restarting does temporarily fix it but it comes back soon enough and it takes like 25 minutes to boot (too many mods) so doesnt really solve anything for me. Have replaced several mods but haven\u0027t found it, just trying to put off a clean install because I have a bad idea that\u0027s what it is. The fun part is this is the 1st thing that ever made me look for my logs to upload for help and apparently my game isn\u0027t making logs(player log yes output log no)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cebu516","CreatedById":210266,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-15T17:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have 3 times already and it\u0027s fixed but replaced with a stuck in IVA bug so, those bugs stole 12 hours of my life I will never get back\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CasualKerbal","CreatedById":200409,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-30T06:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EOK after much playing around with my install my problem ended up being Shabby a dependency of conformal decals. I don\u0027t know why this worked but I had an old version of it.\u00A0 I went to my 1.12.0 save installed new kopernicus and parralax mods. Harmony wanted me to delete a duplicate dll that showed in the shabby folder and the harmony folder. Just as it did on 1.12.3. When I first did this I deleted the one in the shabby folder and game loaded but some crafts that had decals on them were broken and the aforementioned glitch occurred.\u00A0 I worked around this by going to the old install removing the decals and then copying the craft files but game became unplayable after a few scene changes etc with duplicate icons\u00A0 on toolbar and eventually losing the ability to right click.\u00A0 Got newest version of conformal.decals, it doesn\u0027t have a harmony.dll anymore (or I put it there before somehow) anyway now all old crafts work\u00A0 no glitch!\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
