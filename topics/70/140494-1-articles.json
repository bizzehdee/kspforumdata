For some reason, when I tell a kerbal to board an EAS-1 seat, instead of setting down, (s)he is shown standing in the seat and locked in place. The craft says the seat is unoccupied, so I can\u0027t control it, but the kerbal\u0027s r-click menu just shows how much EVA prop they have, no buttons or options to exit or move. Also tried the EAS-16 Meadowlark cockpit from SXT with the same results. I haven\u0027t tried to use the EAS-1 since upgrading to 1.1.2, but I was using the EAS-16 the other day and it was working fine. I\u0027m going through now trying to identify what mods I\u0027ve installed since to see if I can identify the issue, but I wonder if anyone knows which mod might be causing this. I haven\u0027t installed any mods that would obviously cause this (none that deal directly with the command seat or kerbals, except the Texture Replacer with visor reflections fixed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Forgot to upload the log file. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-yGBr_w0lX8RzhBZXRPYnRFOVk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFind it here.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI went through some of the mods and haven\u0027t found the culprit yet. It is not TextureReplacer, Take Command, Scatterer, [X]Science, or AGExtended (since no particular mod seems an obvious suspect, I\u0027m testing every mod no matter how unlikely it is to cause this problem).\u00A0Decided to change my tactic and start with a fresh install, then try the mods one at a time, since it takes about 10 minutes to load the modded game, it was going to take forever to remove one mod and restart for each one. Time to go to work now, so I\u0027ll have to look into it more tomorrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-25T18:49:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2016 06:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kananesgi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eforgot log\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberius K","CreatedById":163867,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T03:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know an answer, sorry, but it reminds me of the 1.05 bug where a kerbal would be \u0027unresponsive\u0027 when knocked into whilst in the external command seat. \u00A0Previously the only way to fix that was to edit the save file, but I\u0027m certain that this was fixed for 1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
