I cannot enter the VAB and although I can enter the other buildings, I cannot leave them. If I hit the exit button in the upper right corner, the screen does not change, only another exit button in the lower right corner appears. Pressing that button brings up the game menu, but I cannot select exit from that menu. I needed to force close the program to exit. \n\nFollowing the instructions in the previous thread, I found there was an errant mission to rescue \u0022Ed Kerman\u0022 from orbit and another kerbal who is on my crew is not listed. I tried to make that fix but the game still crashed. I noticed that the number of Active Contracts is \u002299\u0022 with a Max of \u002200\u0022 but there are no completed contracts listed in the archive.\n\nOutput Log [http://1drv.ms/1z8ZJZP](http://1drv.ms/1z8ZJZP)\n\nPersistent.sfs [http://1drv.ms/1z8ZNIV](http://1drv.ms/1z8ZNIV)\n\nAlthough I do have MechJeb 2.4.1.0, SCANsat 8.1 and Station Science 1.3.1 installed, I posted in this forum because have no reason to believe they have any impact on the game in the building view nor have I received any contracts involving those mods.\n\nAcer Aspire V3-471G laptop\n\ni7-3610QM, 2.3 GHz\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GT640M (2 GB)\n\n8 GB DDR3\n\nWindows 7"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T19:45:58Z","Content":"Alternatively just delete the contract in the persistence file.\n\nEDIT: Why did my edit delete what I had previously put?

Windows 32-bit or windows 64-bit? Look at the version number on the main menu. If it ends with (x64), you are playing the 64-bit version, which is unstable and may be the cause.\n\nIf it\u0027s not one of those things then I have no idea."},{"CreatedByName":"seadart","CreatedById":119961,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T17:03:41Z","Content":"OK, I got it to work.
