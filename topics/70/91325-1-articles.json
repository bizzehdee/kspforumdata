First: tech tree doesnt work. I played KSP career mode for ~80 hours and then i realise there is update to the tree. After restart i realised there is no longer fusion reactors in experimental rocketry. So i checked how tree should looks like and then i realised that my tech tree is incomplete. I have only 2 extra techs: Experimental rocketry and exp. electronics. Nothing more. I have every single part that are included in earlier techs. I should have ability to research fusion power and experimental tech that have science tech as parent. Second: before tech tree gets buggy i had problem with fusion reactor. I realised that 3.75 fusion reactor consumes all my electrical power (~20k) at first 0.(0)1 sec and is only able to carry 1500 lithium and nothing more so it can fussion things. Its not possible to switch fuel in VAS nor at Launchpad. How i see in .cfg it supposed to be like that in mod. Is that right? If its needed i can send screen shots.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ESorry for my English!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
