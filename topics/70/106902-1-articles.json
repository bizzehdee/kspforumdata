The key is to move all the files in GameData called ModuleManager.#### into your new gameData directory as well as the other mods. (I only moved the subfolders before, e.g. KIS, Mechjeb2, etc)\n\nAdditionally, I moved my save game folder out of the Kerbal directory, deleted and re-installed the game, but I think the above was the step i was missing, since that didn\u0027t work by itself.\n\nIncidentally, this all happened after migrating to 1.0.3 from 1.0.2"}]}
