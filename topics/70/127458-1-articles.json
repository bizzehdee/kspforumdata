It seems that whatever engine I use, in whatever situation, and whatever level of thrust, overheats over time. The heat goes away if I switch to a different craft and then back to that craft. But this happens with any of my engines. My jets can go for about 7 minutes of full throttle, and then they explode. Less time with rockets. If i throttle down, the heat builds more slowly, but it never goes away. It\u0027s not reentry heat, I already checked that, it even happens in space. Im not sure if I\u0027m doing something wrong, or if there\u0027s some glitch in my game. I\u0027m running deadly reentry mod, but like i said, this even happens in space, so it can\u0027t be FAR either. Any ideas????\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
