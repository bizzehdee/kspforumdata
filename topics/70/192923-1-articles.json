Launched yet another rocket like so many before, and once I was getting to orbit, I hit \u0022M\u0022 and, well, nothing happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I figured something must have messed up my key binds or so (daughter played with the keyboard), so I use the Toggle Map button in the bottom left corner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe map opens, and now I can not close it anymore. Game gets completely stuck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe M key still doesn\u0027t do a thing, and if I click on the Toggle Map button again, well, the altitude indicator appears, the portraits of the 2 kerbals appear, but the ship does not. I can\u0027t zoom in or out, yet I can control the ship that I can\u0027t see. I can also still see the map with the orbits and stuff even when not in map mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I click EVA on one of them, the ship suddenly appears, but I still see the map and all. I still can\u0027t zoom in or out, nor can I use the M key.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t see an option to attach a screenshot, so trying like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/6OYUOBJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/6OYUOBJ\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is in KSP 1.8.1 with just a few mods: Interstellar, Mechjeb, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E / \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, Tweakscale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone has any idea it would be highly appreciated as this would basically kill all the efforts I\u0027ve put into this safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JajajTec","CreatedById":203514,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-05T12:47:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you maybe post also the log?:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002275006\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1758707448\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83212-how-to-get-support-read-first/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:214px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand you can post a screensot by putting it into dropbox and change the 0 at the end of the link to 1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-06T01:16:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is just a guess. Do you use \u0022rename vessel\u0022 (by right-clicking on a command part) for launched vessels? In my install (1.8.1, without Breaking Ground, with many mods), KSP loses its mind if I change vessel type to \u0022science\u0022 while renaming. The \u0022M\u0022 key stops working, the normal display zooms so far out that the vessel looks invisible, and other things go wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake a backup copy of your savefile, search for \u0022type = DeployedScienceController\u0022, and if found replace it with \u0022type = Probe\u0022. Note which ships you are editing. Restart the game and load that edited savefile and see if those ships work correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
