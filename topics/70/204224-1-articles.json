Yesterday I was building in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and after I added a Mainsail engine, the game refused to create anymore saves, so I re-launched KSP and was stuck while loading on parts/thumbs/mainsail. I went and checked the file and the png for the mainsail was missing. The file was there but there was no png in it\u0027s place. I deleted all mods and tried again, same problem occurred. I googled a png of the mainsail and simply replaced the empty file with it. The game loaded up after that no problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout 20 minutes ago, same thing happened, except this time there\u0027s 13 missing png\u0027s. I can go through and do the same thing I did last time, but it seems like there\u0027s a bigger issue\u00A0at play. I did re-install my mods after I fixed it the first time, but I haven\u0027t heard of anyone having this problem with mods installed. In fact I haven\u0027t heard of anyone else having this problem at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m at a loss here so any suggestions would be great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods Active: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, Tweakscale\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
