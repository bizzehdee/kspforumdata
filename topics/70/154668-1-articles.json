I know it is unrealistic, but without N-body gravity and continuous thrust trajectory calculators the entire family of engines is basically unusable. Do I have to try and find every engine in a .cfg file, or can I delete something which overrides them? I don\u0027t want to mess anything up too badly by trying it myself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phineas Freak","CreatedById":146521,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-10T11:15:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can use the following config:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n@PART[ionEngine]:FOR[zzzRealismOverhaul]\n{\n\t@MODULE[ModuleEngines*]\n\t{\n\t\t@minThrust *= 1000\n\t\t@maxThrust *= 1000\n\t}\n\n\t@MODULE[ModuleEngineConfigs]\n\t{\n\t\t@CONFIG[NSTAR]\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t@minThrust *= 1000\n\t\t\t@maxThrust *= 1000\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will patch only the stock ion engine though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
