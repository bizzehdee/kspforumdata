I had a pair of kerbals on the ground in the desert on Kerbin, when suddenly their temperatures started to rise and they burst into flames before exploding. As hysterical (and terrible) as this sounds and looks, it\u0027s quite off-putting. The only mods that I can think of that might cause this are Deadly Reentry and TAC Life Support, but I can\u0027t imagine why either one would happen like this. I wasn\u0027t reentering the atmosphere. Is there some other thing anyone can think of?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t31.0-8/10687394_775474145846423_5624871544157787027_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210687394_775474145846423_5624871544157787027_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it helps, I was near a particular easter egg in the desert, but I wasn\u0027t quite there yet.
