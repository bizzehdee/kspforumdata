My normal routine is, delete any crash log folders from the main KSP folder, restart computer, close any resource-hungry processes (firefox, virus checker etc.) and that usually fixes it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using CKAN: CKAN sometimes does not uninstalll mods properly, and can leave files behind, a *.dll has been left behind before, causing me some grief. Its a good idea to go through your gamedata and see if there are any folders there from mods you thought you removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea, although ModuleManager states that only the most recent version of the *.dll will be active, it can still cause problems if you have multiple copies/versions in gamedata. Search for the *.dll and delete all of them except a single copy of the latest version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat may or may not help, but this might save you some time in the future - I have never had a load get stuck, and then re-continue after a delay. If it hangs for more than 20 seconds or so on a part, you may as well close it straight away, it aint coming back. Notable exception is when it reaches the end of the loading bar, then can be a pause there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-23T09:53:49Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2015 09:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by p1t1o\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDarksword","CreatedById":145985,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T20:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt pauses at the end, but hangs there for an hour\u002B\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T20:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you start KSP it writes to a KSP.log in the game folder and an output_log.txt in GameData, these logs will say what\u0027s going on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDarksword","CreatedById":145985,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T20:55:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust tested it, worked, but BDArmory didn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Fixed thanks all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-23T22:13:52Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2015 10:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JDarksword\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sarxis","CreatedById":130923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T21:00:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sarxis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sarxis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve been having problems with stuck loads lately too.
