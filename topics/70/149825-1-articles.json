Ever since I updated to 1.2, whenever I get into orbit, the orbit\u00A0starts to decay. My periapsis is above 70km, my engines are shutdown and either \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is turned on or I don\u0027t have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters. I don\u0027t have a surefire way of reproduction, but I know that it happens whenever I place down a maneuver node. It makes it impossible to go to other bodies when it does happen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLog:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/230icyimw8662uj/output_log%20-%20Copy.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/230icyimw8662uj/output_log - Copy.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T12:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have a large number of mods installed that are not compatible with KSP 1.2. \u00A0Your log contains loads of errors about plugins failing to load and the latter parts are a continuous stream of exceptions. \u00A0I\u0027m surprised there isn\u0027t a lot more going wrong than your orbits decaying. \u00A0You will need to either remove all mods that haven\u0027t yet been updated for KSP 1.2 or update them if they have been.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen playing with mods you really shouldn\u0027t install them into your Steam copy of the game, it leads to all sorts of problems when KSP updates. \u00A0You are much better off copying the whole of the Kerbal Space Program folder somewhere else on your drive, calling it something like \u0022Modded KSP 1.2\u0022\u00A0and modding that copy. \u00A0When a new version of KSP is released you can make another copy of the whole folder called \u0022Modded KSP 1.3\u0022 and only install mods that are actually confirmed as being compatible with it. \u00A0This may mean that you won\u0027t be able to use your existing modded saves with the new version until it has been updated, but you can copy them across and try them while still leaving the original save intact in the previous version (that you can also still go back and play while waiting for the mods to be updated).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
