At that time I removed MechJeb, BUT\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe problem remained, so I decided to do a completely new fresh install, and then add all\u003Cbr\u003E\n(or most) of my mods, and start a new game to try to reproduce the issue. It took until\u003Cbr\u003E\nnow, to get to a similar point in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe situation is, I have a station circling the Mun. It has several things docked (a lander,\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nand a a crew transport ship). It has at least two more ports open. I\u0027m using shielded\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nclamp-o-tron Mr\u0027s on the station. At that time, I had stations around Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was sending a new, larger, and more capable lander up to the station, to take a crew down\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nto the Mun base. As soon as the new lander docked, something caused the radial decouplers\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had holding the outrigger \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks, engines, and landing legs, to fire, rendering the new\u003Cbr\u003E\nlander, completely worthless. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time I was sending a new fuel tank up, to increase the available fuel storage.

It had the decouplers\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nattached to the fuel tanks the legs were attached to, removed from staging. The decouplers did\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n_not_ fire when I did that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I sent up the fuel tank, and as soon as it docked, \u0022thunk\u0022, \u0022boom\u0022, \u0022scritch\u0022...\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe TD-25 decoupler immediately below the heat shield on the crew transport ship had fired,\u003Cbr\u003E\nrendering the crew transport useless.
