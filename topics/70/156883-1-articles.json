Now, I was able to miraculously save the ship by flipping it over at the last min to drop the payload and that slowed it down enough to land safely in the water, but its still really annoying my crew almost died. The only times ive lost crew is because of a situation a glitch has put me in; at least I could save them and 500k in rehiring this time.\u00A0Any ideas whats causing this? let me know if I can provide more info. Any input much appriciated\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://plays.tv/video/58af50b7cc458b863c/stupid-stupid-glitches-on-quicksave-load-landing-was-pretty-cool-didnt-think-would-work\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://plays.tv/video/58af50b7cc458b863c/stupid-stupid-glitches-on-quicksave-load-landing-was-pretty-cool-didnt-think-would-work\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/kay6r5ocnb3ohs8/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eoutput log\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-23T21:52:12Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2017 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by fireblade274\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
