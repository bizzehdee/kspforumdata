Anyway, I clicked overwrite, and nothing happened\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis happens because you are using non alphanumerical chars on the name, as dashes, slashes, etc. The explanation for this is a bit technical, I will try to simplify it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnity, the mega-uber-library that KSP uses to do things like graphics, sounds, etc, is aimed to be multiplataform, i.e., it aims to work on many kinds of computers, from Macs to Androids, iPhones, Game Consoles and, obviously, Windows. So a lot of things need to be \u0022abstracted\u0022 in a way that differences between these different computers would not get in the way of the developer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of these things is filenames. Different operating systems have different meanings for some chars: on Linux, Android, Macs, etc, the slash \u0022/\u0022 is used to separate directories on pathnames, but on Windows, a back-slash \u00A0\u0022\\\u0022 is used for it. \u00A0A double-colon \u0022:\u0022 cannot be used on filenames on Windows, but can on my Mac. And so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo Unity convert everything into a thingy called \u0022URI\u0022 (Uniform Resource Identifier\u0022), that is a stunt meant to allow naming things on every type of computer in the World on the same way. The problem is that the way Unity uses that URI stunt makes us lose track of the some characters, as they are all converted into a dot \u0022.\u0022 on the URI thing. So, \u0022KTM 1060-3.1\u0022 ends up being \u0022KTM.1060.3.1\u0022 on the URI thing, and with the URI different from the filename, KSP thinks they are two different things and so alerts you that you are going to overwrite a file that looks different, but it\u0027s the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(yeah, computers can be very messy!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223954060\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201697\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221618360664\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204948\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ben J.

When this happens, Unity gets the Exception, logs it on the log file, and promptly kills the running code that launched the Exception thing. If this happens on step 3, the steps 4 and 5 will not be executed anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course I don\u0027t now if the problem you got was really on saving the craft - it can be anything, I just used the \u0022save craft\u0022 as plausible example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a way or another, the KSP.log and the Player.log will have the problem logged.

I specialise in mod fixes, but this could be either a stock or modded bug.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you have any mods that change the space centre (custom barn kit ect\u2026)\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis may change the hitboxes of various things but not the space centres appearance (may have been installed incorrectly)\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, the only way to really find out is to remove all your mods and open a new save and see if the issue persists.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf it does not, slowly add back mods until it does and try running the game without those one.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf the issue does persist, I recommend creating a new tread in the stock bugs and errors as most\u00A0people here fix mod issues. Which tend to (but not always) be easier then stock issues.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe people there will know more about your issue and most likely be able\u00A0to fix it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHope it helps\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ben J.

I still need to download KSP and all my mods onto the new computer* , but I also need to transfer the craft. I was thinking about using the Steam cloud, but since I might not use steam (For KSP, there are other Steam games I have that I want to keep), and since the files are weird, I can\u0027t really do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to take a flashdrive, transfer all the craft files onto it, go to the new computer, put the craft files into some folder in the KSP folder, and have all the craft show up on KSP on the new computer?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Is there a single ksp.exe file that I can transfer over instead of downloading KSP from the internet? I only ask since I have slow internet.

I think all of these problems may have been started by Steam trying to update KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
