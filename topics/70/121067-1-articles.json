The biggest problem is trying to run the game. I currently have 18 crash folders from trying to play for a few hours the past two days. The KSP directory gets so full of crash folders I have to delete them because they take up so much space. It crashes constantly. It almost always crashes when I go from one area of the game to another. IE: From anywhere to the Space Center. It\u0027s always a Access Violation either with KSP.exe or mono.dll. My computer specs and a random error log is below. Would really appreciate a fix. I have a decent computer. There is really no reason this game should run so poorly. My second big gripe is the rover physics. Again, nearly makes the game unplayable when you have to spend hours trying to get two vehicles docked (and tear them both up in the process) because the tires don\u0027t track the ground, the brakes are bizarre, and the exacting tolerances on the docking ports. Docking should be a typical step in the game, not a day long project. Nothing to do about that but Big Thanks for some help on the crashing. I\u0027ve searched far and wide on this mono.dll thing and tried everything I thought might help. BTW, I have mods but the game crashes just as frequently without them and for the same reasons.

The very first load of KSP after installing ATM will be \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E long and possibly hangy. That\u0027s normal as it\u0027s converting textures. It\u0027ll get faster after that. Also, the more mods you have, the longer the game needs to load. It also tends to hang a bit when Module Manager is loading it\u0027s stuff. Just leave it in the background and it\u0027ll sort itself, it\u0027s what I do...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso what do you mean you\u0027re aligning the docking port instead of the whole ship? Ports don\u0027t really need to be in a particular alignment to mate, they just need to be close enough and reasonably parallel, except for RP/aesthetic purposes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the memory stuff, 1.1 update is coming soon and with it Unity 5 integration. That will make for better memory handling, as well as a possibly better/more stable 64-bit version...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T09:53:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...ATI FirePro 8700 on the way - just for this game...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EIf you\u0027re gonna buy something for KSP specifically, then get a GTX 900-series.
