Efficiency is handled by the Isp (specific impulse) of the engine which is found in the ModuleEngines/Key section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you like maths, you can find the answer using\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nm = F / Isp\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhere m = mass of fuel in Kg used in 1s, F = Force in Newtons (thrust for engines) and Isp is the specific impulse of the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m not sure of the context of your question \u00A0but if you are trying to change the efficiency, just change the second number of the 2 separated by a comma in section mentioned above as this is basically the Isp the game uses. Higher = more efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIe\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKey 0, 100 changed to 0, 200 makes the engine twice as efficient in a vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lemon cup","CreatedById":199693,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-06T15:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/210116-fruitgoose/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022210116\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/210116-fruitgoose/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@FruitGoose\u003C/a\u003E is correct and just to add to that, it can be a little confusing because the in-game stats for engines\u00A0do have a section that tells you what the propellant burn rate is. If I had to guess, that is so you can manually calculate fuel ratios in odd tank setups if you need to - kind of an obsolete practice now that everyone uses either stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E readouts or MechJeb/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E stats for that sort of planning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing that affects\u00A0propellant burn rate in the engine.cfg file is \u201CmaxThrust\u201D and \u201CatmosphereCurve\u201D (isp).
