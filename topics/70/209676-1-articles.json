If you go into the /JSI/RPMPodPatches/ folder, you can look at the .cfg files, and they will tell you the cockpits that have IVAs for RPM bundled *in* RPM. For any other IVAs, you have to download/install them seperately.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh, also mae sure you are installing RPM *Adopted*, and not the original RPM.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther than that, i suggest making sure everything is installed correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
