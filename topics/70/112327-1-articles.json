This can become disastrous when you\u0027re dealing with a large base, and my base is pretty big as it has lots of different modules, including a freakin\u0027 launchpad. Basically because it\u0027s so big, it gets kicked up even further, and the lighter parts get thrown further upwards than the heavier parts and the tubes connecting the entire thing snap and some things come back down so hard they explode, or they get thrown sideways and land upside-down or whatever.\n\nI haven\u0027t been able to build a single base that doesn\u0027t suffer from this problem and I\u0027ve been trying since 0.90. I know what causes it - as I attach more modules, the centre of mass changes and the tubes start to flex ever so slightly to compensate for it. However before physics are loaded, the tubes aren\u0027t bent or flexing, everything is connected perfectly, which then makes some parts sink into the ground. Then the physics kicks in and things actually collide with the ground and gets spat out of the planet\u0027s surface violently. Minmus\u0027 low gravity makes the whole thing even worse, too.\n\nI\u0027ve tried sticking landing legs on each module, I\u0027ve tried it with the legs\u0027 suspension on and off, I\u0027ve tried connecting the modules with stock girders and docking ports, nothing seems to work.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips to get around the way the game screws with ground bases? Are there mods that address this? Please help D: I just wanna make cool ground bases."},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T00:40:49Z","Content":"Hey bud,\n\nyou seem a lot more knowledgeable on your problem than I am.

It\u0027s 10x worse with the building and is normally what tears it apart. The effect here is a lot less extreme but it\u0027s clearly visible.\n\n![39s5DSL.gif](http://i.imgur.com/39s5DSL.gif)"}]}
