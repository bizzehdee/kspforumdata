Is it in a circular orbit? I wonder if its possible to approach it using a guaranteed-to-rendezvous orbit such as if its 80x80, then orbit behind at 79x79 and you\u0027ll eventually have to be within 1km. Mind you, you\u0027d need to have the inclination the same too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jbdenney","CreatedById":201835,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-18T03:45:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u00A0was close\u00A0enough to see its shape\u00A0and [ or ] would not transfer me to control of the vessel to EVA the Kerbal.
