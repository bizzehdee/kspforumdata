I wanted to start a new career now I have a better idea how the game works, and thought it would be a good opportunity to install some mods. Ive got quite a few installed but I found that I was having trouble with frame rate. I have a pretty good system that I put together myself a year or so ago,\u00A0 running an i7 overclocked to 5GHz, and had no trouble at all in the stock game. I only ever saw the clock flicker yellow at 3x speed in atmosphere. However, with the mods installed it was solid yellow on the launchpad with a 3 part craft. I had installed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and scatterer and suspected that was the issue, so I first removed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E with no improvement. Then I removed scatterer and boom, back to (almost) stock performance. I then removed all mods other than scatterer, and back to constant yellow clock, solid red at only 2x time acceleration. I\u0027d really like to have scatterer and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E installed as I\u0027m giving The World Beyond a go, and would like to experience it with all the visuals intact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few specs and things I\u0027ve tried:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntel i7-7700K running 5gHz (delidded with liquid metal thermal compound and water cooled.
