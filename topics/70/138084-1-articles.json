Landed on the mun, landed on Minmus, etc. Started this playthrough and everything went well. This was up until last night. Normally when you put them on a craft, they stick out so you need to stow them right? \u00A0This time, they\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edidn\u0027t.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EThat was my first clue something was wrong. So i launch and go to the Mun, and as i come in to land, i try to deploy my gear. They won\u0027t deploy. I have sufficient charge and they should work fine, only they don\u0027t \u00A0activate. Not with the action group, not with G, and not even right clicking them manually.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, so maybe i installed them wrong. I go to the VAB and take them off and put on a different pair of struts. Still won\u0027t \u00A0deploy. Even while I\u0027m in the VAB, I can\u0027t control them. In fact, when I go to action groups, they can be clicked on, but extend on/off and any other modes aren\u0027t \u00A0even available.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mods i have installed are Interstellar, Mechjeb, and ScanSAT incase it\u0027s \u00A0a compatibility thing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
