I installed it recently as it looked helpful, but I\u0027m having some trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy mods are: Active Texture Management (Aggressive), Deadly Reentry Continued, FAR, KAE, KAS, KJR, Kethane, Infernal Robotics, MJ2, Module Manager, Procedural Fairings, Procedural Parts, RemoteTech, SCANsat, TweakScale, TAC Life Support, and KW Rocketry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of them are fine, but there\u0027s just a couple problems. First, I decided to download Active Texture Management and TweakScale through the CKAN interface. It lists them as \u0022Installed\u0022, but not as \u0022Updated\u0022 even though it says that its KSP Version is 0.90. I\u0027m not sure if it makes a difference what category it\u0027s under it just seemed confusing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other problem is that two of my mods, TAC Life Support and KW Rocketry are \u0022Incompatible\u0022. I\u0027m not really sure what that means or how to fix it. Both Kethane and RemoteTech have not been updated to 0.90 yet but they are still listed under the \u0022Updated\u0022 category. I\u0027ve installed TAC and KW correctly into the GameData folder and they worked fine before the update. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, as of right now I am unable to play KSP, which isn\u0027t a huge problem since it is due to mods not updating, but I just want to fix the problems with CKAN as it seems like a very helpful program if I can figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ignath","CreatedById":77210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T19:16:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Beatmaster Hank\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Beatmaster Hank\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMost of them are fine, but there\u0027s just a couple problems.

If you wish to have CKAN control the mods that have been auto-detected, I would suggest uninstalling any mods that have a dependency on that (I know RPM is a dependency for many mods, so be careful...ModuleManager is also a HUGE PITA to move to CKAN from Auto-detected, because so many other mods depend on it) which have been installed w/CKAN, then remove RPM manually, then refresh your CKAN and you should be able to install RPM via CKAN (and whatever other mods that depended on RPM). If you don\u0027t do this, sometimes the local CKAN metadata gets all messed up and you\u0027ll get stuck in a loop where you can\u0027t update w/out CKAN crashing or tossing exceptions. Sometimes it is even best to remove all your mods before trying something like this (certainly would be if your mod list is fairly small), just to be sure no \u0022unintended consequences\u0022 occur.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackSoldierB","CreatedById":103414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T16:34:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106636-CKAN-plugin-Migration-Tool-v1-1-%28alpha%29-Clean-install-auto-detected-mods\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E to replace the auto detected mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"yithpistol","CreatedById":61110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T19:54:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFerram says to install FAR and modular flight integrator since CKAN doesn\u0027t handle ModularFlightIntegrator properly on a FAR install.
