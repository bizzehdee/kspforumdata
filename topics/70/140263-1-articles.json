The problems started happening for me about... A month ago? (not sure exactly :P) And this makes my 1.0.5 game unusable! The shortest definition of what happens is that the game crashes while loading saves, but this issue is likely very complex, so the explanation will be detailed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP version: Mac OS X, no Steam, v1.0.5.1028\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExplanation: At one point (at least several game startups after the last time I\u00A0installed a mod for that install)\u00A0my game started crashing during save loading and started displaying exactly this (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9s2wHdr.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/9s2wHdr.png\u003C/a\u003E)\u00A0every time I\u00A0attempted to load any of my saves. The game simply becomes unresponsive, the mouse pointer becomes a \u0022spinning rainbow wheel\u0022 indicating that an application is unresponsive, and command\u002Balt\u002Bescape becomes the only way to exit the game.\u00A0At one point, seeing that attempting to load any old save is pointless, I have created a new save, and it was actually possible to enter the save right after creating it, but after quitting the game and starting it up again, it became impossible to get into the new save. (Although I\u00A0managed to get into one of the old saves while making this thread several times, the same crash always happened when I\u00A0tried to use any of the space center buildings)\u00A0Then, I\u00A0thought up another possible solution: I have downloaded KSP again and copied the \u0022GameData\u0022 and \u0022saves\u0022 folders into the new install location, but didn\u0027t copy anything else. For a couple of game startups, everything worked without any issues on the new install, but later, the new install also got bugged in the same way too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshot(s): look above to see where the game stops, and look below to see my gamedata folder\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft/save file(s): If the issue cannot be resolved without such\u00A0files, I\u00A0could give you my entire 1.0.5 install \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0 but not now\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLogs:\u00A0\u003Ca\u003Ehttp://www.This website cannot be used on these forums/download/96ym6jl1xywfhm7/KSP.log\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0is the log for my first 1.0.5 install, and\u00A0\u003Ca\u003Ehttp://www.This website cannot be used on these forums/download/a6iggzaavkk3kga/KSP%282%29.log\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0is the log for the second install (see Explanation section for an explanation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSystem/computer specs: Mac OS X 10.9.4, MacBook Pro 13-inch Mid 2009, 2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4GB 1333MHz DDR3 memory, NVIDIA GeForce 9400M 256MB graphics, 44GB free disk space on a 128GB solid state SATA drive...

Maybe someone with more knowledge of MAC can help you out, but my approach would be to check how much memory the KSP task uses and whether or not it keeps crashing arround a smiliar ammount of it used. Everytime you do a session change like loading a vessel etc. your memory footprint grows and at some point it exceeds the limit and crashes. If that is whats happening, you might have to reduce the ammount of large mods installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other option of course is to upgrade to 1.1. which can make use of more RAM (or in your case, since you only have 4 gig, it could utilize temporary disk space).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-24T00:43:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2016 12:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by TrooperCooper\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDestroyer111","CreatedById":160216,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T16:36:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have checked the memory usage, and found some weird things.

Anyway, when I check how much memory is used by my 1.0.5 install, it uses up to just above 1,3 GB during loading, and 850 MB during the crash, so it probably isn\u0027t an out of memory issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
