They are indeed sitting in the appropriate folders but both the stock AND any downloaded craft files are not showing in the load screen. Only the craft that \u003Cem\u003EI\u0027ve\u003C/em\u003E made. And now that I realize it this had been the case from the very beginning. I started this save file not long after .24 hit and gradually built it up overtime. And when I think about it there was never a single craft in my load screen other my own. So this has been going on for awhile now. Saying if its a certain mod is hard to say.
