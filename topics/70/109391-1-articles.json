(it shake without SAS as well)\n\nbooster stage drop, still fine, and prograde vector stopped shaking\n\nfirst stage drop, mainsail correctly fire, nothing wrong\n\nsecond stage drop, but injection stage won\u0027t start (by staging, can still activate manually) and the game seem to consider i\u0027m landed at this point... (???) all the vectors on the navball seem to shake, the vessel is shaky as well\n\nI can still fly the spacecraft, but it\u0027s trajectory disappear on the map view\n\nhere some pics to show the sciences report while at 67 000m above sea level\n\nEDIT : I just did a few try with the exact same vessel, BUT, without the fairing... And it seemed the fairing to be the cause, will try different shots\n\nEDIT 2 : Yep, once the fairing is activated through staging, everything goes wrong\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
