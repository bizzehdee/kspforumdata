First, I have the first two stages in orbit, but every time I try to launch the engine itself, once I get into orbit, both using MechJeb and manually flying the parts, the game says that the ship is under acceleration, preventing me from setting up a time friendly rendezvous with the target vessel! Also, since KSP thinks the craft is under acceleration, I cannot revert or go back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E without losing the launch!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m certain this issue is with either BetterTimeWarp, the cruise control enable nuke/fusion engines from Deep Space Exploration Vehicles, or MechJeb. I\u0027ve never used engines like these in KSP so I\u0027m not 100% how to use them correctly, and I couldn\u0027t find a guide/tutorial on how they work. All of these and the other mods I have were installed and have been kept updated by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E.
