If the problem persists, those mods aren\u0027t causing the problem and can be removed from the list of suspects (don\u0027t reinstall them!); if the problem stops, those mods should be put on a new list because you know at least one of them is causing the problem. Keep trying for each different category e.g. parts packs, flight tools, contract packs etc. and you should end up with a noticeably shorter list to work with.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy this point you should have a shorter list of mods which are still causing the missing R\u0026amp;D building. Find every mod that\u0027s auto-installed as a dependency and try it with just those (plus KK and/or kerbinside if they\u0027re definitely involved) so you know either way if they\u0027re involved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSplit your list of suspect mods in half (it doesn\u0027t really matter how- alphabetically, every second one, whatever), add the first half\u00A0and see if the R\u0026amp;D building is there: if the building is still there try the other half; if it isn\u0027t then you\u0027ve eliminated half the list in one go, now split the remaining list in half again and repeat the process until you find the mods responsible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf neither half makes it disappear, it\u0027s a problem with mod interactions. Add all the suspects back in\u00A0and work backwards by removing smaller numbers of mods until you find what\u0027s causing the problem. With so many mods the load times could be horrendous, but I reckon if you\u0027re using that many mods to begin with then you\u0027ve got a pretty potent PC and it can handle it. It will be a time-consuming process to go through methodically and track down the problem, but in the end you\u0027ll know exactly what mod(s) are causing the issue and can decide if you want to remove it/them and you\u0027ll also know which mod thread(s) to post in about the issue so someone can try to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Syczek","CreatedById":163803,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-06T17:02:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose urs country ban zippyshare, i will try upload to easyupload\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://easyupload.io/b5pfos\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://easyupload.io/b5pfos\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFair warning load have alot lines despite low space capacity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeleted all mods because upgraded facilities bug plague me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGave up on playing KSP for while\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-07T16:44:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2020 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Syczek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InternalFribest","CreatedById":211355,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-26T20:03:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello I actually had the same problem... i deleted kerbinside and it worked if your still wondering\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
