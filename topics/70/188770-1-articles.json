Namely the CSM Decoupler and the LM Adapter (most probably every part that has a animation) wich play their\u00A0animation when picked from the parts menu but can\u0027t be retracted or even properly decoupled in game. There is a button in the parts dropdown menu wich is called \u0022play animation\u0022 though. I installed every mod that came with the base mod and even tried to reinstall it a few times or even use another version of the mod. The KSP.log file seems to be spammed with \u0022[EXC 15:22:36.115] TypeLoadException: Could not load type \u0027ModuleDecouplerBase\u0027 from assembly \u0027BDB\u0027.\u0022 I don\u0027t know if I installed it wrong (which seems unlikely since I installed that mod and others successfully before). It could be that it is conflicting with other mods, a screenshot of my GameData Folder can be found\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/gallery/ycA7dYG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and a picture of my KSP Log from yesterday can be found\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://t.co/CShl8FBjPR?amp=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(the KSP Log is quite big though since it is filled with error messages, I apologize for my messy install).
