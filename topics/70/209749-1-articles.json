As long as the incoming speed isn\u0027t too crazy (the upper limit is somewhere around 20-25 km/s), a craft could get captured around the Sun with a Jupiter assist. After that, a series of alternating gravity assists between Jupiter and Saturn could slow the craft down enough relative to Saturn that it would be able safely aerobrake at Titan. From there, it can simply parachute down to Titan\u0027s surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis trajectory would take decades if not centuries, but is quite safe (with enough assists, the final aerobraking speed can be as low as ~3200 m/s), and requires only minimal fuel for correction maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-17T09:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJupiter can throw probes out of the Solar system with a single gravity assist, so the reverse will also be true if the trajectory is just right. Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are also decent targets but Jupiter\u0027s sheer size means it\u0027ll give the biggest slingshots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAerobraking, on the other hand, would almost certainly\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0work due to the ludicrous speeds involved. I once sent a probe flying past Pluto at a relative speed of 30km/s; despite Pluto\u0027s negligible atmosphere the probe was instantly incinerated the moment it entered the atmosphere, and while there was no heatshield on that probe I can\u0027t see how any amount of shielding would protect against a sustained aerobraking pass in the atmosphere of one of the gas giants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
