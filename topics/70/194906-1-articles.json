The install works great except for one thing I noticed after I had flown a bunch of missions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the engines I use are from ROEngines as it removes the duplicates from some of the other mods. What I noticed was that the A4, RD series, and one other all have the same 3D model as (what I believe) is the A4\u0027s. If I use patch manager to disable duplicates,\u00A0\u00A0Ven\u0027sStockRevamp has the correct 3D model for the RD series, but not ROEngines. Is there a mod conflict I could be missing?\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
