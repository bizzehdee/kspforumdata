Its so beautiful. I absolutely love it. However, my computers hardware is not the top of the shelf. Its 8GB ram, i5-6500, and a GTX 960. Its enough to play with only SSPX, and not have any problems. When i try to play with more mods, KSP starts crashing. I know that SSPX is a high intensity mod, and am wondering whether deleting files of parts I don\u0027t need(I\u0027m going to make cinematic, therefore, I can select out what pieces i need, then delete the ones i don\u0027t.), would save the precious ram needed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you help, i am forever indebted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
