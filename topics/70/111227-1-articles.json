Or load a pre-made ship, unable to remove any parts (right click does work). When it first occurred I reloaded the game and it let me move a few parts around then stopped again. Now when loading its not working at all. I\u0027ve tried loading a couple of previous saves but its the same.***\n\n***Not sure if its related but I have on occasion had an issue clicking other items when piloting. namely unable to click another ship to set a target or create a new maneuver. This only happened a few times and going back to the KSC and returning to the ship fixed it.***\n\n**Log:**\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26687/output_log.txt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26687/output_log.txt)\n\n**Thanks**"},{"CreatedByName":"Torih","CreatedById":144304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T19:00:46Z","Content":"I have reinstalled the game and most of the mods and its still the same issue.

It is still bugged but slightly differently, I can now click the parts on the left (all are in one big list and selecting the tabs doesn\u0027t change that) but they just appear in the VAB and are not movable, and still can\u0027t click on any parts on the ships I\u0027ve already made.\n\nGuess whatever mod caused this as broke the saves -.-"}]}
