I would like to map as many of the buttons as possible and there are over 50 of them between both throttle and stick controllers. I read that KSP only supports up to 20 buttons and disregards the other ones with higher numbers. I also read that there was a mod called fly by wire for older KSP versions;\u00A0I tried it but that doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could deal with only having 20 buttons to map, but the way that Kerbal handles multiple controllers makes that impossible as well. It reads both physical controllers and the virtual controller as a single unit and I have no idea how to combat this issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m thinking that maybe setting everything up in terms of the virtual controller and then deleting the physical controller names in the settings cfg files and making that read only might help. I\u2019m at work at the moment so I will try that when I get home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo any of you KSP pros have any other suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrotech89","CreatedById":189338,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-10T12:02:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a newer version of UJR called UCR and it allowed me to completely customize everything. Everything works now! If someone is having a problem with HOTAS controls, use UCR. I mapped all of my axis to VJoy and then all of the buttons to the keyboard keys corresponding to the functions that I wanted in KSP. Creating an Excel file with the buttons mapped will also help tremendously!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
