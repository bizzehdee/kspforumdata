It started with my vessels blowing up (100% of the time) when they transitioned to the Mun \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. I \u0022fixed\u0022 that by turning on invulnerability cheats, and the transition became a mere \u0022spin my ship around wildly\u0022 instead of blowing up. When I went to land on the Mun, I was constantly be batted around by unseen phantom forces. I landed anyway. This angered the Kraken greatly, and it has increased its\u0027 fury.

I \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E just HyperEdit into orbit around Moho (which at least shows it\u0027s the transition that\u0027s the issue), but that ruins the adventure of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/bah8rri8x9xe1jw/Kraken_log.txt?dl=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere \u003C/a\u003Eis a log. I am using a fair number of mods, not all of which are updated to 1.2.1 (still 1.2 mainly), but even when they were up to date with 1.2, this still happened routinely. In the log I see a fair number of NRE\u0027s related to BasicOrbit, which is a flight info mod, but I suspect those are generated after the Kraken attack, and the mod is simply overwhelmed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the face of such primal fury, I\u0027m kind of at a loss of what to do, besides stay on the ground and build sand castles.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
