I\u0027m on 1.0.4 finally and have updated all my mods.\n\nThis is what happened on a few of my launches. A launch clamp would suddenly appear while my craft was ascending through the atmosphere, the clamp would continue to fall down from the position where it appeared. This would happen several times during the same ascent and I found one in orbit at one point. \n\nHas anyone scene of heard of a bug like this before?"},{"CreatedByName":"WeirdCulture","CreatedById":76591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T14:39:15Z","Content":"check if your craft is centered on the launch pad. see [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117344-Launchclamps-crash-into-rocket-and-follow-into-space?p=2034329\u0026viewfull=1#post2034329](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117344-Launchclamps-crash-into-rocket-and-follow-into-space?p=2034329\u0026viewfull=1#post2034329)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kiro","CreatedById":139123,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T20:36:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E check if your craft is centered on the launch pad. see [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117344-Launchclamps-crash-into-rocket-and-follow-into-space?p=2034329\u0026viewfull=1#post2034329](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117344-Launchclamps-crash-into-rocket-and-follow-into-space?p=2034329\u0026viewfull=1#post2034329)\n\nThank you, that\u0027s probably it.
