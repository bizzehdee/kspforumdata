I mean, when i do the maneuvre, after the Hohmann transfer, when i\u0027m near the closest approach, the target vessel explodes. I\u0027ve made it with or without time warp, from low or high orbit, switched vessels, hello Kraken, goodbye Salyut !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve found that this kind of Kraken is already known (wiki), but how do i send this beast back to its hole ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play with a heavily moded KSP, my parts come from Contares, Tantares, BDB... I use Mechjeb as autopilot. It\u0027s pretty sad, i\u0027ve spent 170 days in game, and i realy want to make this uggly space station... If someone can help me... And as always, thanx Squad and all modders !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-05T23:47:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes it happen with other crafts.
