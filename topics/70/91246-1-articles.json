All works perfectly, the game is a beautiful thing with many improvements. Hurrah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, in the same vein of good tidings, I have successfully installed the Engineering Redux mod and that has already put Jeb in orbit around the Mun with much celebration in ground control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever it seems that my attempt to install the enhanced navball has failed. It doesn\u0027t seem any different from the normal KSP0.25 navball. I cannot seem to find any way to slide or scale it to be larger. There is no GUI button for the Enhanced Navball feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T20:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure that it\u0027s broken in 0.25.0, and we all need to wait for an update \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wossname","CreatedById":118005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T20:34:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh. Well in that case I can probably change the GUI size setting in the config so I can actually see the icons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not even being sarcastic, it seems like the frame rate has literally quadrupled with the new KSP 0.25 release (on my fairly new hardware) and I\u0027m now running everything at 1920x1280 at some beautiful refresh rate. Problem is that all the text is really tiny on my screen and I can barely read it. I should count myself lucky I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can wait until this is solved.
