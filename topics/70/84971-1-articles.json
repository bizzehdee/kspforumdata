The game just uninitializes and I go to the desktop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running 16gb ram on an overclocked machine, so the crashes seem odd. I\u0027ve not found similar crashes purely because of the mods\u0027 use; only presumptively because of the x64 program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the log: (just read the instructions again, sorry)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/k6zcafbpnqdlx0o/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/k6zcafbpnqdlx0o/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, maybe I am running 32bit and had only assumed?

Also, steam generally defaults to the 32 bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, from your mod list, you are probably running out of memory.
