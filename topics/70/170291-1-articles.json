The initial loading screen loaded fine, but then went to a black screen with an frozen\u00A0loading symbol in the corner. The cursor does not move, and when I click with the mouse, a window pops up and says the game is not responding. Should I try fully restarting the game, or is there some way to revert the graphics settings?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
