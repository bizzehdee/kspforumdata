Set rendez vous with already orbiting spacecraft (was already in orbit in 1.0.2 but has no need for radiators, has no nukes, jet engines, wing parts or such, just a very probe with a few chutes.). Closest approach 0.0km, inclination N\u00C3\u0192\u00C2 N.\n\nI auto-timewarped (stock autowarp, not KAC) to about 1min ahead of closest approach. Dipped into the atmosphere for a minute at 68km, that stopped the auto timewarp. Then everything went smoothly until closest approach.\n\nI switched from map to flight view (while still time warping@50x); and looked towards the other spacecraft : i saw that :\n\n![859984Capturedcran88.png](http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/859984Capturedcran88.png)\n\nAnd my frames dropped to about .01, literally one every 10 seconds...\n\nIt seems that there is something next to my targeted craft (duna lander) that replicated itself many many times and created a whole lot of parts... it\u0027s probably what stressed my PC so much.\n\nI had to forcequit KSP through task manager : and that\u0027s a pretty huge amount of memory use since it happened less than 10 minutes after i first launched the game.\n\n![714200Capturedcran89.png](http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/714200Capturedcran89.png)\n\nIt\u0027s french, but pretty straight-forward : memory use is crazy after this little time playing\n\nAny ideas what happened here ? it does look like a weird kraken tentacle, or some weird space train ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nEDIT : Meanwhile, 1.0.4 came out. I wonder if that\u0027s going to fix it. Downloading....\n\n This is hotifx madness !\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T16:56:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 04:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hcube**"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:56:52Z","Content":"Well, hopefully this is another consequence of the bug that has just been fixed for KSP 1.0.4 (and you have a backup of your save).
