This might not seem a lot, but that makes me lose 300m/s of dV with that launcher (and makes it unable to orbit the payload it was designed for).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that even though I have liquid hydrogen in the \u003Cem\u003Euninsulated\u003C/em\u003E second stage tank, its boiloff rate is nowhere near the LOx\u0027s (tops at 0.17 in the last screenshot, quantity is only 3x smaller); and the LOx in the second stage is not boiling off at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the LOx excess consumption rises with the ascent speed of the rocket (total consumption stabilises around 105), it goes down when I shut down the engines, or when the rocket is falling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tanks used in the first stage are the stock Rockmax 32 and 64 redesigned using Ven\u0027s Revamp. I had the same issue, with the same numbers, using a tank from Procedural Parts (set to cryogenic) instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have yet to try this with another rocket or other engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EList of (relevant) mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal Fuels 10.7.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal Fuels Stockalike configs 2.1.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal Heat 1.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal Solar System 10.3.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceY 1.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVen\u0027s Stock Revamp 1.8 (might be 1.8.1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Parts 1.1.7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I\u0027ll add the complete modlist if asked to)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-11T21:40:23Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2015 09:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaarst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
