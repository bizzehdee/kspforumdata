I\u0027ve got stations at Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus. KSS is really basic, Mun Station is languishing, and Minmus Station is really built out. It\u0027s my orbital refinery and science lab. I\u0027ve been fulfilling contracts to pick up Kerbals from various orbits and bring them back to Kerbin, and the journey usually goes: send a launch out from the nearest station to retrieve the stranded kerbonaut to that station, then send the inter-station shuttle from wherever it\u0027s parked to that station (if we\u0027re not at KSS already), shuttle the kerbonaut to KSS, then retrieve to Kerbin with a simple pod from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. After several docking/undocking procedures, though, the save file seems to get confused. Usually it\u0027s something trivial like which is the root part of a station or a lander. But now, I\u0027ve got a contract that\u0027s corrupted. It started out being to add to KSS but now it\u0027s suddenly morphed into modifying Minmus Station -- and one of the parameters is to be in orbit around Kerbin!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I popped open persistent.sfs and took a look. It is easy enough to find the ids for the stations and to look at the contract, but it seems that the contract (in addition to calling out the vessel ID of the station) lists all the *parts* on the station. Sheesh. That\u0027s a long list, and there\u0027s only so much almost-JSON that I really want to look at. Has anyone written an app to edit the persistent file, to make this cleanup easier?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterstellarOrbit","CreatedById":168687,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-07T23:57:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, Personally I would just decline it, but thats just me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotepad\u002B\u002B Is one of the easiest Applications to use(to edit the full file), however, I am pretty sure there is no application made to edit the file specifically and organize it in that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-07T23:58:30Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2017 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by InterstellarOrbit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
