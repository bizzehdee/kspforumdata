I\u0027ve got 170 or so mods installed, ranging from the minimalist Quick Exit to Blue Dog Design Bureau and stuff. For the most part my performance handles alright, and I don\u0027t mind dropping into the teens for FPS with megaton, several-hundred parts rockets trying to dock with each other. But recently, in what seems like almost entirely random instances that I can\u0027t pin down to a single or even multiple causes, my FPS just tanks to 1 and kills even the in-game time progression to where I can\u0027t even click on stuff. Is this the fabled \u0022RAM leak\u0022 that I hear about occasionally?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m not a complete dolt with technical stuff but I\u0027m no genius either. I know the standard trial and error troubleshooting method is to isolate each mod with clean installs until I can pin down the culprit, but I\u0027m assuming there must be a better way. Are there recommended error reports, additional tools, console menus, or just general tips anyone has on hunting down specific causes of huge lag spikes? Thanks in advance everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-09T23:15:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen exactly do you suffer from a fps drop?
