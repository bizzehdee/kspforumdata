About once a second or so it stutters for a physics tick or two. I\u0027m fine on RAM, etc. but my logs are now getting spammed with information like this:\n\n    [LOG 10:31:06.728] Parsing bool[LOG 10:31:06.728] Parsing bool[LOG 10:31:06.728] Parsing int[LOG 10:31:06.728] Parsing bool[LOG 10:31:06.728] Parsing bool[LOG 10:31:07.127] Parsing int[LOG 10:31:07.127] Parsing bool[LOG 10:31:07.128] Parsing bool[LOG 10:31:07.128] Parsing bool[LOG 10:31:07.128] Parsing bool[LOG 10:31:07.128] Parsing bool[LOG 10:31:07.128] Parsing bool[LOG 10:31:07.128] Parsing bool[LOG 10:31:07.128] Parsing int\n\nWhich I suspect is related to the problem, since I never saw that in my log before. It\u0027s suspiciously unhelpful, which makes me think I accidentally hit some hotkey that means \u0027dump useless information to the log\u0027. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s mod related since there\u0027s no tag for a mod on the log entry. \n\nAny thoughts?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T19:23:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 07:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by johnsonwax**"},{"CreatedByName":"yongedevil","CreatedById":62491,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T19:23:38Z","Content":"I would guess the log writing is the cause of your performance issues. File I/O is very expensive and it looks like something is writing to the log several times a second.\n\nThe Parsing messages are what the game prints when reading from a plugin configuration file; although I don\u0027t know if that is the only case where it print those. My guess would be some mod is repeatedly fetching data from the file rather than storing it in memory.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T19:31:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 07:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yongedevil**\n  \ntypo"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T19:49:26Z","Content":"I\u0027m not sure if this is related but there are a group of us who suffer from stuttering issue that is caused by the GC, but it\u0027s not as frequent as once a second, more like once in 10-15 seconds.\n\nHave a look at [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106523-Slight-freeze-every-5-seconds-%28or-so%29) and see if any of that sounds familiar.\n\nIf you think that the stutter is caused by read/write to log files you could try and start KSP with -nolog and see if that helps."},{"CreatedByName":"johnsonwax","CreatedById":79077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T19:53:08Z","Content":"Yeah, it looks like a mod was the cause. I had installed (and forgotten I installed) ContractConfigurator-FieldResearch right before the problem started. I\u0027ll follow up directly with the author. \n\nBecause there was no mod tag on the log entries, I had assumed it was KSP core doing this. Apparently not.
