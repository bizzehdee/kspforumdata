I\u0027ve tried various altitudes on the polar orbit of Kerbin and nothing. My heading was 358 on kerbin. I have a ton of electricity stored up, 3 antenna\u0027s and solar panels. Is there any reason why both the survey\u0027s will not complete and also why I can\u0027t transmit my science from orbiting science modules? I\u0027ve even brought a few back to earth but the research done in the module doesn\u0027t get counted to my science score. I am playing in the science sandbox model, I have science alert, stage recovery, and ubioweld for my mods. My kerbals need more science!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T10:03:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScience alert is the reason you can\u0027t transmit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Cornhole","CreatedById":153601,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T16:41:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks a million, gonna remove it now then.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
