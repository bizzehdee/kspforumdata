Even under full thrust it wasn\u0027t moving, or falling, or doing anything\n\nAnybody ever seen such a thing?? Another plane just works fine in the same savegame, just seems to be this. (The other ones are all smaller though) \n\nSuggestions?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T07:45:38Z","Content":"Kraken attack?"}]}
