I ended up putting the file in the wrong folder (under downloads(?)). Anyways i ditched kethane because it \u0022wasn\u0027t compatible with the current version of KSP.\u0022 So I found Karbonite and decided to try it. i installed it in the same place on my first try (the wrong place) then looked up an online tutorial and found the correct place to put it. Then I booted up KSP and everything looked good. I opened my sandbox game. I tried to click on the rocket construction facility, but it wouldn\u0027t open. I clicked it about a million times, and it wouldn\u0027t open. Neither would the aerospace hanger. I clicked on the astronaut center and it opened, but once i exited that, nothing would respond. I couldn\u0027t open any of the facilities nor could i time warp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m totally stuck. I admit my experience with games is minimal. (I have no idea what I\u0027m doing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any idea whats going on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: I tried uninstalling KSP and re-downloading it, and nothing changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate again: I have 3 saved games: 1 regular sandbox, 1 science sandbox, and 1 career. I really only use science sandbox as thats where most of my progress and infrastructure are. This also seems to be the only one I am experiencing the problem in.
