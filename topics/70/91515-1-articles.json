All my existing rovers and any new rovers can now not go in reverse. When I press \u0027S\u0027 to reverse, the rover just speeds up going forward, if I press \u0027W\u0027 it still just goes forwards. I\u0027ve tried changing the assignments, setting up joystick control, inverting controls, but what ever I assign the \u0027Reverse\u0027 function under the rovers tab just causes the rover to go forwards. I\u0027ve also tried all different designs of rovers to see if it was the way I built them, but no luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll other controls are fine, just the damn reverse gear in Jeb\u0027s rover! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
