It\u0027s attempting to access a file that it doesn\u0027t have permission to. I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s an ownership issue, but it could be permission flags. It might be a problem with the registry.json file, or the directory that contains it. Make sure the user you\u0027re executing CKAN as has write permission to both and see if that affects anything. If this is a reproducible problem, perhaps report a bug to the CKAN team so they can catch the exception and present a human-readable error message before exiting."},{"CreatedByName":"Dazpoet","CreatedById":132380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T23:45:20Z","Content":"Note that I\u0027m not exactly linux savvy but you could try adding \u0027sudo\u0027 before the commands to see if that makes stuff more working, seeing as sudo should make you able to write just about anywhere.
