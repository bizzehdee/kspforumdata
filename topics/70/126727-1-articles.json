Had a SSTO plane. \u00A0I\u0027m on 1.1 now, and as soon as I loaded my previous game, all my stuff exploded. \u00A0I figured it was heat issues. However, many of my mods don\u0027t work in 1.1. \u00A0I had gotten most from this forum, many from Bob Fitch\u0027s videos (which I loved). I had spend many hours before prepping my install with everything I thought I\u0027d need. \u00A0I\u0027ve been off KSP for about 5 months now and want to get back in. \u00A0Can I get a shortcut to the top mods I would want to use? \u00A0I prefer sandbox, as I\u0027ll be building some new com sats, then a LKO space station, perhaps a refueling one, and then some stuff to get to Mun and beyond. \u00A0Also, I like those mods that help me filter the parts list better, as well as the ones like MechJeb, etc.. I\u0027ll be getting myself better educated soon, but I\u0027d love a helping hand to get me started! \u00A0I promise to contribute with crafts, stories, etc..!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakuzi","CreatedById":85181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T23:36:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.1 is not released yet, so hypothetically the mods wont work with it either... check out which mods of your preference are updated for KSP 1.0.5 in the mod subforum.

But\u00A0yea, a lot has changed since 0.9. Most of the big changes are in the new aerodynamics and heat models. This not only means things will overheat if you\u00A0go too fast, but you\u0027ll also have to think about drag and Mach effects. I recommend starting small at first and feel out the new system. It\u0027s challenging, but worth it! A lot of the new changes have created some really fun new dynamics.
