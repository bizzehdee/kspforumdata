I wouldn\u0027t normally do this but the game cheated me so I cheated back\n\nAlso I threw out the whole Cryogenic engines pack which contained resources mods, so I figured maybe it had something to do with the mods after all.\n\nAnyway long story short, I put the mods in the trash and Pol was no longer bugged"},{"CreatedByName":"Zucal","CreatedById":139764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T18:53:47Z","Content":"Pol and Bop are known for having very buggy collision meshes. I doubt it was the mod, and there\u0027s not much you can do to stop the bug other than be lucky while landing and don\u0027t go to fast with rovers on the surface. It\u0027s been an issue for ages."}]}
