It depends on the complexity of the base or station,\u00A0and the situation. When I landed my base on the Mun I noticed that when I turned on the lights, the framerate dropped from 30 to 15 fps. (Terrain Shader is set to High, so is the Terrain Detail). When I turned them off the fps returned to 30.\u00A0 It doesn\u0027t seem to happen on orbiting stations, only landed bases. It doesn\u0027t make any sense considering these new lights don\u0027t cast shadows, I don\u0027t know why there\u0027d be a performance drop, even with the current terrain settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAudio Muffler Redux\u003Cbr\u003E\nChatterer\u003Cbr\u003E\nDistantObject\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerboKatz\u003Cbr\u003E\nNavBallDockingAlignmentIndicatorCE\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlanetShine\u003Cbr\u003E\nRealPlume\u003Cbr\u003E\nRealPlume-Stock\u003Cbr\u003E\nscatterer\u003Cbr\u003E\nSmokeScreen\u003Cbr\u003E\nSquad\u003Cbr\u003E\nTextureReplacer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-25T17:01:32Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2021 05:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by TimKerbin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kielm","CreatedById":82247,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-25T22:05:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the issue here is the visual mods and reflective lights.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScatterer has an impact on lighting.\u00A0Planetshine has an impact on lighting.

This means that for every pixel light in the scene, the tessellation is re-calculated. With lots of lights, this can add up very quickly.
