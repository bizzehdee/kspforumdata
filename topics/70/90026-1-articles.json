I mean, it does have near, deadly reentry, procedural fearings, some enviromental mods like planet shine, chatter.. No mods that would change the jet engine. And this craft is all stock, its a simple jet with f-22 alike wings and two jet engines as seen in the photo. Strange thing is that i tried to cut the throttle, then i noticed this. Then, i tried to move it to 50%, then 100%, it didnt changed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T18:24:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a glitch/bug then.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T18:27:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFYI, NEAR changes Jet engines, but it shouldn\u0027t do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you show a better picture of the plane?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheScareCake!","CreatedById":103641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T18:57:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yecOpAL.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022yecOpAL.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts very simple.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T19:56:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheScareCake!\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheScareCake!\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yecOpAL.png?1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/yecOpAL.png?1\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts very simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should have been clearer, can I see the back of the plane?

If that craft has the same issues, than I would go about uninstalling mods and testing after an uninstall of each mod.
