Its makes the offset tool completely useless as there is no way to fix it and it seems to happen randomly. It seems that once I get this bug with a particular craft it will never go away. This is literally breaking the game for me as I cant build some ships without it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-18T16:36:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2015 04:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by montyben101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darren9","CreatedById":58062,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T17:47:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is an effect with hollow parts (fuselage and cargo bays in particular) where the offset tool snaps back to part of the structure rather than the hollow area even though the part you\u0027re attempting to move appears to be in an allowable position when you pick it up to move it slightly. Is that what you\u0027re experiencing? I haven\u0027t been able to find a fix/workaround and I\u0027d really like to have the old solid 1.25m structural fuselage back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torih","CreatedById":144304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T22:08:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither turn snapping off, or use this mod\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/108969-102may12-nooffsetlimits-removes-limits-for-part-offset-in-editor/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/108969-102may12-nooffsetlimits-removes-limits-for-part-offset-in-editor/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0It does work fine with 1.0.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
