I am on 1.12.3 with a heavily modded game (175\u002B mods) with not many issues so far until now. It mentions Real Chutes being the source of the issue, but I have tried to uninstall it just for the error to hop to the next part. I have tried downgrading Community Fixes to no avail and I would really enjoy to have the newer versions of BDA. I have already tried downgrading to BDArmory Continued and it has not fixed the issue. I would put an image here but I don\u0027t know how to attach one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
