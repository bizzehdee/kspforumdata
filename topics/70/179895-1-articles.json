If I click on them it doesn\u0027t do anything. It\u0027ll show them when I build a ship but once I launch it they\u0027re not there, and the ship won\u0027t launch. Also if I go into the AC it won\u0027t let me recruit any new Kerbals. The only way I can launch a ship is if I add a probe core. Not sure what to do. Any help would be great.
