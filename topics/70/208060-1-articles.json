I\u0027m unable to click any of the menu buttons as well as the main issue seen here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/tN3Bmlv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:rgb(127,221,255);\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/tN3Bmlv\u003C/a\u003E. My GameData is also available at that link.

My Kopernicus was a couple versions old so I updated and uninstalled those 2 mods. This did not fix it. So I reinstalled Kopernicus again and KSRSS. This also did not fix it. I\u0027ve updated Janitor\u0027s Closet \u0026amp; SpaceTux (I saw somewhere that could cause issues), I also reinstalled CD \u0026amp; Shabby as I was told that could also be impacting it, finally I tried refreshing all the log things. I seemingly haven\u0027t made any ground on it. The attached files feature all these attempted fixes and the mods that originally caused the issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:rgb(0,0,0);color:rgb(238,232,221);font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nThanks in advance for any help y\u0027all may be able to provide!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
