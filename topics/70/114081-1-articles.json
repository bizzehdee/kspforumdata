It seems my problem parts are service bays, batteries, and probe cores. In stock (unmodded 32-bit) I have a problem with un-manned space planes if they include a service bay. If the bay is closed a battery or probe core will heat up and explode, regardless of where it is on the vessel. I have tried putting them on the far side of high mass objects like fuel tanks that are littered with radiators and this doesn\u0027t seem to change anything. If I open the cargo bay during most of the re-entry I can make it home alright.\n\nThis also happened in my modded-career, I came out of a large timewarp into a new SOI, did some maneuvers and jettisoned a stage and everything was fine. I created a new manuever node and in about the 30 seconds it took me to do so a huge section of my ship had parts with red meters. I turned on the thermal overlay and the battery was blinking like a strobe until it blew up and then the newly created 2-part vessel cooled down to normal on its own.\n\nThe effect is less dramatic with the \u0022ignore max temp\u0022 flag but here is a clip showing the link between the service bay and the battery temperature (the battery changes between a temperature of 4 and 2400 again and again while the bay is closed). The only part of my ship that has this temperature fluctuation is this one battery and it is not directly connected to the service bay, it seems very odd.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/mw0PGaGlwiw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nI wanted to revert my save back to a 1.0.2 version but now I\u0027ve done a few missions it seems that may not be so easy."},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T07:41:13Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had the same problem with FAR.

You need to replace the file with one from a fresh download (or let Steam verify the installation once you have deleted it, if you run on Steam).\n\nThe other critical file, PartDatabase.cfg, can safely be deleted and regenerated.

Make sure you quick save a lot when this bug happens, basically what you need to do is go to the ship, then go back to the space center, get in any active ship or probe and after it loads go back to the space station, then go back to your ship and you should be able to make your next burn. Then quicksave and if it happens at the next burn just reapeat. After doing this the ship actually became fine, the next two burns went well, then I time accelerated through a few orbits and didn\u0027t explode. Most of my mods are visual like the city lights, clouds, distance object enhancement, and a sky box that\u0027s a hi res image of the galaxy, the only part mod I was using when it happened was DMagics Orbital Science which I love and as far as I can tell is not the cause of the problem."},{"CreatedByName":"TheOrqwithVagrant","CreatedById":39208,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T20:37:33Z","Content":"Actually this one is definitely from FAR - Ferram has said as much in the FAR release thread, and there\u0027s already a fix in the dev tree.\n\nEDIT: ...or not.

With a smaller surface area, parts radiate less heat, so when this phantom heating occurs, they build up heat quicker in FAR and explode.\n\nI think one possible solution is to increase the warp factor at which heating is calculated.
