I landed to rescue a kerbal on the surface, and saved. Went away for a bit, and came back. When I loaded the quicksave, the ship spontaneously exploded and flew apart, even though it was rested on the surface. When the quicksave loads the ship looks fine, but as soon as the physics kicks in, all hell breaks loose. No matter what I do I cannot reload this damn ship safely, I cannot resume this game unless I relaunch the entire mission (I still have 12 years to complete the contracts so it is doable, but I can\u0027t be bothered atm, I might resort to cheating from the debug menu instead!) .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust what the hell is going on, Squad? Was I stupid in thinking I would actually be able to resume a saved game and control a ship from the surface of a moon? Yes I have 33 mods installed but I really don\u0027t see why that would be a problem here. It looks more like a problem with the physics engine to me; the ship only flies apart when the message \u0022Easing in physics...\u0022 appears. I tried deselecting \u0022Ease in gravity\u0022 in the Options but I don\u0027t know what that does, and anyway it didn\u0027t seem to make any difference. And the KSP log file records NOTHING pertaining to this error, from what I can see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had this exact same problem with a manned lander on Tylo. A simple ship with landing legs\u00A0 would literally bounce into the air and fall over when loading the quicksave, and on Tylo there\u0027s no chance in hell of righting it again! And again, it only did this when it was easing in the physics.\u00A0 KSP seems to be making a habit of this, and I\u0027m pretty sure it isn\u0027t my fault.

I post a problem here then find a possible solution soon after! I increased \u0027Max Physics Delta-Time per Frame\u0027 to maximum, and reloaded the quicksave. The ship loaded correctly and continued to do so after several reloads.
