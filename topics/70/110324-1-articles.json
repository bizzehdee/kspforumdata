You would have better luck starting with any visual enhancing mods, as that would be my guess.\n\nSorry man."},{"CreatedByName":"Gfurst","CreatedById":126201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T15:44:04Z","Content":"Ok, so to be clear, I\u0027m pretty sure this also happened all the way back when first play-testing 1.0 release. So most likely no mods at all.\n\nSomething relevant too, it seems to happen later in a gameplay, when memory usage is rather large, or sooner with heavily modded game, so I think its memory related."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T07:14:24Z","Content":"I\u0027d say it\u0027s GPU/driver related (and AMDs Linux drivers are notoriously crummy), but there *are* some NREs in your log, possibly from RemoteTech but it\u0027s hard to tell... can you reproduce it in a stock install?\n\nAre you getting any noise from the GPU driver in your system logs?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T07:17:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 07:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve\\_v**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T08:09:10Z","Content":"Are you graphics card temperatures normal during gameplay?

And could be also to temperatures too, I used to check this with the open-source driver, but not with the proprietary ones.
