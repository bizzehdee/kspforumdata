Asteroid was not just flung out from Kerbin LEO but was seen accelerating. Asteroid had no attached parts; they all exploded. Asteroid was uncontrollable and not under thrust. VOID Advanced HUD was reporting acceleration starting at about 8 and decreasing with altitude. This is speculation, I know, but it looked a hell of a lot like reversed gravity. Asteroid continued to accelerate albeit at a decreasing rate and is now leaving Kerbin and, I suspect, the solar-system at an impressive speed.\n\nMy theory\n\nDocking 2 asteroids using a craft with both forward and reversed \u0022Claws\u0022 is OK and stable at the time. However following a Save-\u003EExit-\u003EReload serious craft wobble ensues. I suspect that the forces on the asteroid attached to the backwards facing Claw are reversed by the reload routine. Following craft destruction forces on asteroid remained reversed and it left Kerbin \\_REALLY\\_ fast. That is - the docking routing handles backwards Claws, the reload routing gets it wrong.\n\n(End theory)\n\nThis is what I did\n\n- Catch 2 asteroids.\n- Produce a craft with both forward and backward facing Claws (my last one had 3\u002B3)\n- Dock backwards Caws to asteroid (90 tonnes)\n- Dock forwards Claws to asteroid (240 tonnes)\n- (At this point I went and had lunch, the craft was stable for an hour at least)\n- Save-\u003EExit-\u003EReload (Because I was unable to change craft or return to the space centre - I get that a lot with Claws, no surprise.)\n- Upon reload observed wobble.\n- Attempted to dock extra craft to the asteroid craft because I hoped the additional SAS would reduce the wobble.\n- I happened to dock my extra craft into the 90t asteroid on the backwards facing Claw.\n\nWhat happened\n\n- Nothing for about 6 seconds\n- Central craft (the one with 6 Claws) seemed to bend in half. It bent into a right angle so that the big asteroid was facing Kerbin. It did this \u0022suddenly\u0022 ie no animation.\n- Nothing for 3 or 4 seconds\n- Explosions, bits every where.\n- Craft parts seemed to be falling away rapidly. Flip to map. No - I\u0027m on the 90t asteroid and \\_ITS\\_ orbit has moved. Craft parts and big asteroid are on 80k circular orbit.\n- Asteroid periapsis disappears into Kerbin. I realise that the asteroid is accelerating.\n- No parts found on asteroid and asteroid is no longer controllable.\n- Asteroid achieves escape velocity. VOID reports acceleration has dropped to \u003C2 but asteroid is still accelerating.\n\nWindows 7 64bit. 8GB RAM. Decent Nvidia GFx Card. KSP0.90\n\nNumber of mods increased during this project at a rate proportional to my frustration and exasperation.\n\nScreenshots or more info - just ask.\n\nI really wanted to get a whole load of asteroids docked together but they always go wrong after a reload. Claw \\_are\\_ buggy as hell but I\u0027m sure now that it the reload routine is getting something very wrong because my asteroids are fine until I have to reload.\n\nI read about \u0022rogue-forces\u0022 and so tried synchronous-orbit. I read that LEO was best because the rogue-forces would be proportionally less - that was why I was at 80k when this happened. I tried a single Claw each end, 4 Claws each end, then my last craft which had 3\u002B3 and was super-rigid. Then I read that more SAS and RCS \\_could\\_ control the wobble so I thought I\u0027d experiment by docking \\_everything\\_ and see what happened.\n\nThinking of trying \u0022Quantum Struts\u0022 but I\u0027m not sure anything is gonna beat antigravity and I\u0027m now convinced that is what I\u0027m seeing.\n\nTotally gutted - it was going to look \\_SO\\_ cool.

Having said that the big docking ports \\_did\\_ hold. It was the single Claws that got ripped off.\n\nDesigning a single craft with a Claw on each end took thinking about. \n\nAny how - pictures or it didn\u0027t happen...\n\n![asteroid.png](http://themoose.co.uk/ksp/asteroid.png)"}]}
