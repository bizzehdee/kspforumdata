When I rotate, it of course rotates around the new centre of mass, so it just shakes itself apart."},{"CreatedByName":"Railgunner2160","CreatedById":67181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T18:37:45Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been having this problem today as well on one of my rockets, about every 6000m or so the camera tracks a new center of mass and eventually it drops BELOW the actual rocket so much that the rocket goes into a spin around this imaginary CoM.\n\nIt\u0027s very clear somethings up, because this kind of rocket shouldn\u0027t spin around a point below the rocket like a rock on a string......\n\nAlso I doubt it\u0027s a CoM issue in the rocket itself considering the Payload is a fuel tanker bound for my minmus Sci-Station and it\u0027s lander. If it was a problem with too much mass at the top it\u0027d be spinning around the nose, not below the bottom engine.....\n\nI\u0027m on Windows so it doesn\u0027t appear to be a platform issue....\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T18:46:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Railgunner2160**"},{"CreatedByName":"TaintedLion","CreatedById":137942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T19:04:40Z","Content":"Do you have hotrockets installed?
