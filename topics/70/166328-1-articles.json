However i just got the rover and some base parts on Minmus but the rover is constantly speeding up. I can only brake it by hitting reverse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically the rover is uncontrollable. It might be something with Minmus or with the new update 1.3.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody an idea wat could be wrong, or is this a common issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW. I have full probe control (most of the time) from the radio connection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
