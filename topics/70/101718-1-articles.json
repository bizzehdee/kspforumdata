A 4-line \u0022Auto-Saved Ship.craft\u0022 file [3] is created in my \u0022saves/.../Ships/VAB\u0022 directory, and, once deleted, I can load other ships and fly them, but the situation repeats its self is I load the krane ship.\n\nI have re-built the ship multiple times, with minor variations, and sometimes I can \u0022fly\u0022 it right after I build it (I \\*almost\\* managed to use the krane to move a piece of kolony equipment once!); other times I can not fly it at all (the map centers around the sun, and all controls, including the escape menu, are gone). Loading never works again before I delete the above-mentioned file, and I can never fly it once loaded (see [2]).\n\nI am using several addons [5], but the only extra parts used on the ship are some smkoke industries moving parts.\n\nI would appreciate it if someone could help, my Duna kolonization program is totally suck!\n\n[0] [http://pastebin.com/K2wQPj9x](http://pastebin.com/K2wQPj9x)\n\n[1] [http://imgur.com/77WaXKb](http://imgur.com/77WaXKb)\n\n[2] [http://imgur.com/R3FORIN](http://imgur.com/R3FORIN)\n\n[3] [http://pastebin.com/j189tgJu](http://pastebin.com/j189tgJu)\n\n[5] [http://pastebin.com/Lhes7DCZ](http://pastebin.com/Lhes7DCZ)\n\nKind regards,\n\nentropy--"},{"CreatedByName":"entropy--","CreatedById":139306,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T20:18:24Z","Content":"What would be a good way to debug what\u0027s going on?
