Put the external command chair on and launched - or tried to. Received a warning that it would not be a controllable craft since it did not have a probe core or command pod. Can anyone help? ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\nAdditional note: I did cancel the launch and went back to SPH. Clicked on the Kerbal tab and just as KSP reported, no part with Kerbal holding capacity.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T22:20:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970**\n  \nAdditional note added"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
