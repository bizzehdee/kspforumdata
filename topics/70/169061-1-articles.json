When I am below 1km above the see and I look down, I can see some wierd white outlines around my ship. I don\u0027t understand, I looked on internet but I couldn\u0027t find any answer, do you have any idea what could do that? Those outlines seems to have the same shape as if I have\u00A0no antialiasing. Thanks for reading and helping me! And sorry for my English...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
