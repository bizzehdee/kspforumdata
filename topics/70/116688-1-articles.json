Every now and then on going back to the space center, i either won\u0027t be able to right click a building, or i won\u0027t be able to click on them at all.\n\nIt\u0027s very intermittent. But annoying. has anyone come across this and managed to trace down the fault?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T22:18:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 10:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SmashBrown**"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T22:17:49Z","Content":"Aaaand jeb just got out a plane and was flung off to somewhere high in orbit around the sun apparently.... also all i can see is the skybox now... no ksc... nothing"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T22:42:06Z","Content":"If you\u0027re using 64 Bit Install then I think even with stock, you will sometimes very rarely lose right click. Can usually be fixed by exiting to main menu. And as far as mods go... we\u0027ll there are a lot of possible offenders. Only one I know for sure causes it for me is Adjustable landing gear, but that\u0027s only in the VAB/SPH scene. And it can usually be restored by clicking around on other parts or exiting and reentering the scene."},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T22:43:32Z","Content":"oops mod list : \n\nAsteroid day\n\nAtomic age\n\nAviation lights\n\nB9 proc wings\n\nKsprc\n\nchatterer\n\nCTT\n\nContract cfg\n\nContracts packs: anomoly surveyor, scansat, field research, RT2, seti contracts, spacetux grand tours.\n\nContract window\n\nCrowd sourced science\n\nCryo engines\n\nDmagic orbital\n\nHeat control\n\nK2 pod\n\nKAS \n\nKAX\n\nEngineer\n\nKerbal Foundries wheels\n\nMSI robotics rework\n\nMark IV system\n\nMk3 mini expansion\n\nNear future (all)\n\nRealChute\n\nRT2\n\nScanSat\n\nScience Alert\n\nSeti CTT\n\nSimple Science fix\n\nSpace Y lifters\n\nstation parts expansion\n\nStation science\n\nKerbal alarm clock\n\nUSI kolonization\n\nuniversal storage\n\nVens revamp\n\nField scientist pack\n\nWaypoint manager\n\nyeah got a few....\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T18:42:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 06:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SmashBrown**"}]}
