How many mods is that? I see well over 100 plugins alone.\n\nI have one suggestion: try copying and pasting (not moving) the entire KSP folder to a new location like C:\\Games\\ that has normal permissions. If that works, you can try to fix the permissions in the current location.\n\nOtherwise, I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ll have to narrow it down by removing mods until you can reproduce the problem with just one or two. There are simply too many exceptions to get a clear picture of what\u0027s going wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"handsmahoney","CreatedById":137405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T21:34:25Z","Content":"Ok.
