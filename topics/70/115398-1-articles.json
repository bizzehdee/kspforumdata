Sadly (with or without RSS), I have the following bugs:\n\n**-Kerbal Engineer \u002B Procedural Parts:** If I place an engine under a procedural tank, the dV and TWR are calculated normally. No issues. If a tank is placed radially, there are no problems. If I place two procedural tanks in series, Kerbal Engineer only calculates dV using the fuel from the topmost tank, while using the mass of the entire assembly. \n\nFor example, if I have a 100u tank on top of a 500u tank, my dV will appear as only 400m/s. In flight, once I drain the top tank, my dV suddenly increases by 2000m/s.\n\n**-Kerbal Engineer \u002B Multiple engines:** If I place 3 engines under a fuel tank, dV, initial TWR and final TWR are calculated instantly and correctly. If I place more than 4 engines of any type, the initial TWR is unchanged. However, dV and final TWR flicker by \u002B/- 10% constantly in the VAB. This does not happen in flight.\n\n**-Heat Control \u002B Ablators:** Ablator depletion in heatshields is very weird. In a 1.0.2 RSS reentry at 7300m/s, ablator would deplete at a rate of about 0.5u/s at 90km, then at increasing rates until I reach lower speeds.\n\nIn the current version, any re-entry instantly destroys my craft at an altitude of about 100km. With Heat Control, re-entry is survivable, but weird.\n\nIt seems that ablator depletion rate is proportional to the quantity of ablator remaining. \n\nIf I have 800 units, I lose up to 18u/s of ablator despite being in very thin atmosphere (90km\u002Bs). The heatshield skin heats up incredibly quickly (278K to 1500K in the uppermost 100-85km of the atmosphere) while the part temperature only increases by 10K. I am slowing down at 0.2 gravities.\n\nAs I descend in the atmosphere, the skin temperature increases to a maximum of 2300K. HOWEVER, ablator depletion slows down to 1u/s when I have 20u left, down to 0.0.1/s when I have 0.1u left. \n\nWhen I have 0.1 units left of ablator in the heatshield, I am slowing down at 5g, my heatshield temperature is 2300K and I am travelling at a velocity of 6000m/s through the 30-40km region of the atmosphere. \n\n**While it took seconds to deplete the first 2/3 of my heatshield in the thinnest part of the atmosphere, it takes minutes to use up the final 1% of the heatshield in the thickest, hottest part of re-entry?!**\n\n* * *\n\nPlease tell me what I need to provide as information to fix these bugs."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T16:15:37Z","Content":"For the KER deltaV calculation bugs the best thing would be to start a fresh run of KSP, load a problem craft in the VAB, click the Settings button in the KER window and then click the \u0022Verbose simulation log\u0022 button.

The consumption rates and temperatures were quite normal until I tried physics warping through the exceedingly slow 140-90km descent phase. \n\nTemperatures went bonkers. Ablation rate exploded. The skin temperature of the heatshield descended to 4k, and when I left timewarp at around 20 units remaining, my temperature reading was bonkers (oscillating between 4K and 1600K at about 5 times a second). Ablation rates returned to normal, so I had no ablator from 70km altitude onwards.\n\nDespite having no ablator and still travelling at about 6500m/s, I managed to survive re-entry with a 1200K pod and 2800K heatshield.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E For the KER deltaV calculation bugs the best thing would be to start a fresh run of KSP, load a problem craft in the VAB, click the Settings button in the KER window and then click the \u0022Verbose simulation log\u0022 button.

It happened again while I was building in the VAB last night however. \n\nI think the problem is high memory consumption. When I reached 3GB and up to 3.6GB, the KER readings became increasingly buggy. Restarting the game and reloading the vessel I was working on solved all problems."}]}
