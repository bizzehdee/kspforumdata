We\u0027ll just have to wait for an updated version. Docking Autopilot no workie either. It prompts you to choose a target, and when you do, nothing happens.

Also the ascent guidance target indicator on the navball actually points DOWN, or rather I assume it does since the indicator that DOES appear is actually the anti-target indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, not sure if related, but when I launch a rocket and activate SAS all of my stabilizer fins deflect to the left, causing my rocket to spin rapidly along its axis. This may be related to having Dynamic Deflection installed though I am not 100% sure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis pisses me off because I typically use Mechjeb for all my VAB launches because manually I tend to oversteer and end up a lawn dart. I just installed IR and was going to test it on my SSTO shuttle by delivering a cargo pod to my Alculbierre Cycler in orbit. Problem is the Cycler is not done, it\u0027s a two part launch and part two is sitting on the launchpad waiting for this .... to be fixed. Looks like it\u0027s time for another month-long hiatus from KSP again...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
