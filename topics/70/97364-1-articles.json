If partitioning your disk or making a removable boot device is an option, Linux might be worth your time. Alternatively you could try and squeeze your mod load down to a 32 bit install. Look at Active Texture Management, DDSLoader \u0026amp; DDS4KSP, and forcing openGL or DirectX 11 (this one will cause some graphical issues). You can also knock down your texture res but this is gonna REALLY hurt the graphical fidelity.

Linux is a great OS, but it unfortunately comes up short in currently being able to replace Windows for many applications. I used to do the dual-boot setup before my KSP days, and I found that I was having to reboot into Windows a lot because Linux didn\u0027t have a replacement program or WINE support for something I needed to do... and then I realized that everything I was doing in Linux could be done in Windows, so why am I inconveniencing myself with constantly rebooting back and forth between the two? Today, my home computer is both my personal and work computer. My production servers are ran in the cloud, and I run my development/test servers in Linux virtual machines within my Windows operating system. I also have several scripts that run through task scheduler that require Windows. So the fact that I would only use a Linux partition for KSP 64bit and the fact that I need my Windows environment running always pretty much makes dual-booting not an option for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note.
