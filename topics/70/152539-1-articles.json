Meaning that using the arrow keys or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E preprogrammed directions the craft does not change direction. Now I know you all think that this is a gameplay thing where you can lose control if certain conditions are not met. Of course this is also the kind of threads you find when googling this problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF PROBLEM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as i can tell right now it\u0027s a real bug. The most noticable proof of this is that the craft does want to move! you see it moving very slightly in the direction it is supposed to go. In other words THE REACTION WHEELS ARE WORKING! It is like two reaction wheels that would move in opposite direction asserting equal force on the craft in different directions. So you see a slight response but the overal influence is null. This problem however occured at a random time. Not directly after a stage switch. Not during ascent. Everything was fine and nothing changed of the craft but suddenly I could not move anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSwitching to another craft dit not work. Switching to map view and back did not work, Reloading KSP did not work. Controling another craft works just fine. Moving the point of control does not have any influence. Energy is available abundant and available in the reaction wheels itself. Control is 100%. (even a pilot that is unnessasary is present). The yaw and roll indicators on the bottom left also work as intended. Trust works as intended, I can accelerate and decelerate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow a picture of my craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs of now I do not know if I can reproduce the issue. But i would like to know if anyone has the same issue and if any fix is present. I am using a modded version but i don\u0027t believe this has any influence. (Mechjeb, tweakscale,Alarm,etc). More information will follow if other recognise the problem. Otherwise I will assume this is not a real problem and i will attempt to relaunch my craft.
