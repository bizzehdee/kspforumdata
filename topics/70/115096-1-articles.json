Now I have some nodes in my tech tree that are green by default, have no icon on them, have a name but have no parts in them and are out of place as well (clipped together with another node or have no arrows going to them). I also have some nodes that look normal but are actually empty. Some of the parts are missing form the tech tree entirely such as the large parachute and the panoramic control pod. Can anyone help me fix this? Otherwise the tech tree seems to be working fine and I have no difficulties researching the nodes (though I haven\u0027t got to any of the buggy ones yet.).\n\nI also have: ScienceAlert, Kerbal Engineer Redux, Chatterer\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T08:47:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 08:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Szkeptik**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nachtwind","CreatedById":41015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T08:35:14Z","Content":"I may lean a bit far out of the window here...but this sounds like not all the mods are compatible either with each other or with KSP.\n\nFirst of all i would remove SETI as this is just a massive module manager \u0022mod\u0022-file and changes pretty much everything beyond recognition (and the name just plain and simply sucks big time). IF KER, chatter and ResearchAlert (Science Alert?) work afterwards as expected, then i would move the whole thing into the SETI thread. Why i am bashing that \u0022mod\u0022? Well, simply because it is the one which has the most variables attached.. KER, Chatterer etc wont change a lot on the Tech tree and are well tested while virtually a minor typo in that seti thing can screw up the whole \u0022mod\u0022..."},{"CreatedByName":"Szkeptik","CreatedById":40456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T08:46:10Z","Content":"Thanks for the reply.
