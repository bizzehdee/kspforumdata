I am running KSP on both my laptop with a geforce\u00A0950m and i7 processor as well as my desktop with an r9 390 and an i5. With both of these computers, I have the same issue. I have low fps, even when I have low part count craft. Using riva tuner I can see that my cpu1 utilization is barely above 30%. I know that KSP is very CPU intensive so seeing a low GPU\u00A0utilization is acceptable but why the low CPU? Anything I can do to help with this? Both of my computers are more than capable of running this game but I can\u0027t seem to get over this hurdle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheWildDefender","CreatedById":188908,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-01T01:20:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m on horrible specs (CPU: i3-3120M, 6GB RAM, integrated graphics Intel HD 4000), and I have a similar problem, though it only occurs when I look at the surface of Duna. I have very bad FPS when I look at Duna, and CPU usage is low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry turning down settings to the lowest, and try removing your mods first.
