Basically my game would either crash or when I would get into the screen with all the buildings, I would not be able to click on any of them or basically do anything and I feared that my save game was corrupt! But due to some responses on this board, I found the culprit of this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you game is acting up after removing mods (particularly, in the contract career mode) then your problem most likely is CONTRACTS. Certain mods (tiberdyne shuttle to be one as an example) create their own contracts to use their parts in different scenarios. If you delete mods that create contracts, KSP will not reset the contracts and will cause your game to act up/crash. There is a moderately simple fix to this, and this is how I went about doing it (FYI, I happen to be a programmer and game developer myself so I poke around on these issues):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Back up your game saves\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Go to you saves folder for your problematic career save\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Delete your quicksave files\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Open the \u0022persistent\u0022 file for your game save\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) In the file you will find a section of code called \u0022Contracts\u0022, and in between contracts there are the individual contracts labeled as \u0022contract\u0022 with their own bracket system of code. I use a program called \u0022Rapid PHP Editor 2014\u0022 (for my work) but in this case I used it for my KSP file. I selected all the code between the \u0022Contracts\u0022 brackets (that contains the individual contracts) and deleted all the current active contracts. If you don\u0027t have a fancy program, you can go through and individually delete contracts. Just make sure you leave the outer \u0022contracts\u0022 bracket, just delete the individual one named \u0022contract\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) This should fix your game, any KSP mods that were forcing you to use contracts should reset and new KSP contracts should come up!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, this will reset contracts available at the contract building, but this is the one sure fire way to fix this problem from what I discovered. Another forum poster told me this issue may be related to kerbals stuck in orbit that were part of a contract. The fix for me was to simply remove all the contracts related to modded parts. Anyway I hope this helps someone, if you need help respond here and I will try to assist you in fixing your KSP saves! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
