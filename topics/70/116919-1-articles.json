No response to any key.\n\nTried again, and unwisely chose \u0022Delete\u0022. It deleted EVERYTHING, not just the problem saves. It deleted the entire career and everything else I had saved, leaving me with a default saves folder (default, scenarios, training.) Didn\u0027t put it in the trash, either. I have a backup in Time Machine, but I lost two weeks worth of work (well, play...)\n\nWhat happened? \n\nIs there any recovery from this message, or is that the end of it? How can I avoid this destructive failure?\n\nMac OSX 10.7\n\nKSP version 1.0.2.842\n\nKerbal Engineer, Alarm Clock, Precise node\n\nStage recovery (not used)\n\nTrigger Tech (not used)"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T08:57:18Z","Content":"Moved to Support (modded installs).\n\nAnd that really is an awful mess-up. Honestly I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much can be done about deleted saves if even the directories with the various quicksave.sfs files have gone. As I understand it, there are automatic save-backup mods around. Hopefully someone in the support subforum has a better answer for you though."},{"CreatedByName":"peter1981","CreatedById":23895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T09:29:51Z","Content":"I had this once a couple of months ago hang up followed by CTD. When I inspected the persistent save file it was 0k\u0027s and blank nothing else there so you may have lost the data before the choice anyway.\n\nI don\u0027t think you\u0027ll be able to recover the data through KSP\n\nIf you have a back-up system then try that.\n\nI had to restart my career completely -- just leaving the Kerbin SOI now \u003E:-|"}]}
