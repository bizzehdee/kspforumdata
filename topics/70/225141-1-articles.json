It is a new issue and it hasnt happened before, or at least not in a long time. If someone could please shed some light on this, it would be immensely appreciated, since this is stalling the production of a world record i am in the midst of setting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy current theory is that the game is incorrectly drawing the ground texture in the wrong place. when i put the camera in the ground, it goes through it before colliding with it. additionally, some of the map textures are drawing on screen despite me being on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002289.92\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022image.png?ex=666f94a3\u0026amp;is=666e4323\u0026amp;hm=d89818c3f1d47440b1c2356fa29c1f0551f4c93862ab1fc03237db85ba11108e\u0026amp;\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/132503638793912320/1251713607356518570/image.png?ex=666f94a3\u0026amp;is=666e4323\u0026amp;hm=d89818c3f1d47440b1c2356fa29c1f0551f4c93862ab1fc03237db85ba11108e\u0026amp;\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanother strange aspect of this is that the black flickering only happens when i am close to the ground, close meaning within ~50 meters.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthats all the info i can give for now. please help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeDoesStuff","CreatedById":230807,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-16T04:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlright after 4.5 hours I have the answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E installed with BoulderCo as the config.
