GUI elements are still visible, including the exit button on the lower right, and funds and such at the top. Sometimes I can mouseover and see the building descriptors in the lower left, sometimes not. This makes the game pretty much unplayable when those don\u0027t show up, as I cannot even guess where the buildings are to click and continue playing. Have to entirely quit and restart to get it working again, leaving to main menu and returning and the problem still persists.\n\n**Mods installed:**\n\nModule Manager 2.6.2\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux 1.0.16.6\n\nActive Texture Management Release-5-0\n\nKerboKatz 1.2.1 - Only the DisableTempGauges mod\n\n**Reproduction steps:**\n\nFly a ship to the Mun, or Minmus. Currently I\u0027m at Minmus. Hit ESC. Switch view to KSC.\n\n**Save:**\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/53548028/Wolf-Hart%20Aerospace.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/53548028/Wolf-Hart%20Aerospace.zip)"}]}
