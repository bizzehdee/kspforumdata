I come to you today with a question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you look at the screenshots linked below (not sure why I can\u0027t insert them directly into the post) of an aircraft I made, you can see these odd grey crosses coming from the light sources for the landing gear, as well as a grey rectangular shape coming out from near the cockpit. What are these, and more importantly how do I get rid of them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/aQNPsct\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/aQNPsct\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/whnrm2P\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/whnrm2P\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods include a lot of airplane parts expansions, SVE, Scatterer, planetshine, trajectories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help you could give would be most appreciated.
