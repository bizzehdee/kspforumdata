Everything else is vanilla.\n\nI tried dumping Chatterer directly in Game Data but of course that doesn\u0027t work. (it never has, not even with other games and mods, such as Skyrim)\n\nI tried putting it in all the appropriate subfolders but Chatterer has a Textures folder that the vanilla game does not. Any idea where the Textures folder should go?\n\nI would love to use Cursed, but Cursed doesn\u0027t recognize KSP... at all. It just doesn\u0027t exist to Cursed. Yes all the mods are there and available, but when I try to use Cursed to install it just treats it as an unidentified file and does nothing.\n\nAny suggestions at all would be appreciated..."},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T15:05:50Z","Content":"Actually, just putting the extracted folder in your GameData should just work. If that hasn\u0027t, a precise description of what you did (screenshots of your GameData are helpful) and startup logs will help narrow down what\u0027s wrong. Check the sticky posts in this forum for how to get as much useful info as possible. \n\nYou might also want to check out mod managers. I use CKAN all the time, but there\u0027s a few other KSP-specific managers in the tools and applications subforum."},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T16:05:13Z","Content":"In the archive you downloaded there is a directory called GameData.\n\nMost people just drag and drop this directory into their KSP folder, where the GameData folder is kept.\n\nSo look in the main KSP directory. See the GameData directory. Open the Archive with the MOD inside and find the GameData directory. Grab it and drag it into the same directory in which KSP hold it\u0027s GameData folder.\n\nYou will be asked if you want to overwrite stuff. Be really trusting and say yes to everything.\n\nAnd you are done.\n\nStart KSP in the same way as usual.\n\nSome MODS require other MODS to be installed to function at their best so make sure that you read the blurb about the MOD.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T16:06:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Daveroski**\n  \ntypo"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T19:06:58Z","Content":"The mod structure is as follows:\n\n- GameData folder. This folder contains all mods\n\n- ModName Folder. This folder is contained in the mod (After unzipping) and is a self contained unit. All subfolders of this folder should remain as they are and do not require movement..\n\nUnzip the mod to another location besides the game. Then copy the Modname Folder and paste it into the GameData Folder.\n\nThen start up your game. should work fine.\n\nThe end result should look like this:\n\n- GameData\\Modname\\(subfolders)\n\nIf you attempt to unzip the mod in the Gamedata folder you may end up with:\n\n- GameData\\GameData\\ModName...\n\nOr even something like:\n\n- GameData\\Modnameversion\\GameData\\Modname.\n\nThese would be wrong.
