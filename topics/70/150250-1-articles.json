In the main menu the rates are a bit higher (at around 60fps), depending on various settings. (Ingame performance monitor that is)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOS is a ubuntu distribution and I do have enough RAM (16 GB), however I am using the integrated Haswell chipset and not an \u0022external\u0022 video card... I am seriously wondering, whether I should settle with these framerates or if there\u0027s some tweaking that can be done to get the fps up a bit beyond the 25fps limit, so I could get a \u0022smooth\u0022 video experience?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody having experience and or solutions/answers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-17T22:25:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I guess the most obvious advice would be to go for a graphics card. I imagine even one for 50\u20AC/$ would be a huge improvement. Integrated cards often don\u0027t only make the CPU do stuff it\u0027s not good at, they also rely on the RAM for gpu things and generally just run horribly. Don\u0027t think there is some other solution, aside from keeping graphics settings low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour CPU is almost high end measured on games performance, a bit weird you don\u0027t got a graphics card.
