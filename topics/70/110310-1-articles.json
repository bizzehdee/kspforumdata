I noted that you have multiple icons for the same mods displaying in the VAB.\n\nTrying to remember what was causing that... I know it was a mod incompatibility... I\u0027m thinking it was EVE.. but not sure.\n\nEdit: At first, I thought of Texture Replacer, but at that time I was testing mods with 1.0.2 to see what was working, so the version of Texture Replacer was an earlier one. (.90). It could have been that, but I\u0027m hesitent to blame that mod for the issue...\n\nI\u0027m thinking it had to do with multiple copies of one of the dependent plugin APIs... so there may be multiple copies of a dll somewhere...\n\nSorry I\u0027m not more clear, but I got rid of the issue by rebuilding my mods with 1.0.x complaint ones as they came out.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T19:07:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 07:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"}]}
