It will even pause the game at 85% usage.\n\n- [Temperature Gauge Killer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120731), which automatically deactivates the temperature gauges introduced in 1.0.1 and that are known to cause a memory leak. They activate each time you start a flight. Pressing F10 deactivates them but - this mod automatically deactivates them for you so you don\u0027t have to think about hitting F10 everytime. You can reactivate them by pressing F10 if you want.\n\nAlso, adding this to your launch options in Steam will dramatically reduce memory footprint (down to 40% apparently!!!!!!!!) and lets you play for much, much longer before crashes (which won\u0027t completely disappear, let\u0027s be clear on that) :\n\n*-force-opengl*\n\nAll attached and lower case, no blanks. Kudos to whoever has found that. However, it has a slightly lower fps performance and disables antialiasing - which maybe you can reactivate through your ATI control panel, but I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s possible. I run on a Nvidia card and the Nvidia control panel lets me reactivate antialisaing through opengl drivers.\n\nYou can also try this:\n\n*-force-d3d11*\n\n(check [that](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106356-Forcing-DirectX11-40-memory-reduction!)for more info on what NOT to do...)\n\nBut it is said to have a few more graphic glitches than opengl.
