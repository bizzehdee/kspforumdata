Except for 1 thing. Every time I fire the EVA jetpack, I get a total screen freeze for about 1/2 a second, then all is back to normal. Except that now I\u0027ve overshot the hatch I was trying to line up on, so I have to tap the opposite jet, and again because of that resulting overshoot. EVA thus becomes pretty much a slideshow in the last few meters of easing up to a hatch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever had this happen in previous versions.
