So I am really hoping to avoid having to deorbit what I have already built and then hyper edit a replacement back up (this feels like a\u00A0disheartening solution to me... even if it does turn out to be the simplest).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone point me in the right direction for figuring out how I can make this kind of save file edit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: KSP version 1.05\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-27T04:46:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2016 04:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Uberns\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded KSP version #\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
