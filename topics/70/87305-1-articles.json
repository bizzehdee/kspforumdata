It appears that a vessel using the super large wheel RoveMax Model XL3 will constantly flip between \u0022landed\u0022 and \u0022suborbital\u0022 on the mun or minmus. If you hit timewarp at the right time that vessel may go on rails in the suborbital state and crash through the ground destroying it. I had noticed it before but didn\u0027t pay attention to it until I tried to use it for vehicles at a base. I would timewarp during an EPL build and suddenly hear an explosion and turn around to notice one of the vehicles was gone (it was a recycling truck, noone was in it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d chalk this up as a Jeb Boson, the thing that summons the space kraken (in this case the base kraken). The wheels don\u0027t nearly have the traction that the TR2 rugged wheel has either and I think that may be related to this bug. A mobile base I had with the TR2 wheel has no problem driving right up a 30 degree slope on minmus while the XL3 i think it is has issues going up a 6 degree slope. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll test this bug when I get home today to see if it\u0027s still an issue but I wanted to post this to see if anyone else has the same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-14T18:26:59Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2014 06:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by michaelhester07\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eremembered the name of the part: RoveMax Model XL3\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T18:53:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure about the XL3 wheels but I\u0027ve recently seen someone report the same thing with an EVA kerbal on Minmus.

I have had minor success by using SAS to tilt the rover onto just the forward or back wheels. \u003Cem\u003ESometimes\u003C/em\u003E it will then be landed and you can use instruments or tools, but it\u0027s undrivable, and the moment you go back to 4 wheels down, it\u0027ll bobble between landed and flying low and not get any traction. I don\u0027t really know whether this is due to a mod, or in the stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots below demonstrate the problem using debug \u0027hacked\u0027 gravity on the KSC runway, but the same problem exists on Minmus, and presumably any low gravity body. Testing at KSC under normal gravity has no problems at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://foxwoodstudios.co.uk/kerbal/XL3-bug.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XL3-bug.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Tweakscale used to make the wheels roughly equivalent.
