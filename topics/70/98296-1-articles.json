I am using 32 bit KSP, blah blah blah all the usual fixes, but I get this problem with KSP freezing while trying to load RSS planets. Sometimes it crashes. I have read the Active texture management thread and I know that it is supposed to crash but it has done this ~20 times. Sometimes I get to loading 8/17, then it crashes, but the next time it freezes at 6/17. note that when I say freezes, I do not mean that KSP freezes, but rather the loading of the RSS textures and planetary editing freezes. The little kerbal in the corner still looks around and the planet in the top still spins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone got any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW all my mods are up to date and are installed via CKAN\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-31T02:31:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2015 02:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HexYZAsh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T00:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout a log (please see the sticky in this forum....)
