Then I exited map mode and my stages weren\u0027t there. My resources and stuff won\u0027t show up either.\n\nHere\u0027s what it looks like:\n\n![twRR5iV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/twRR5iV.jpg)\n\nAs you can see, I still have two more decouplers and some fuel tanks on my ship so these things should be showing up on the left, but it isn\u0027t.\n\nAll of the toolbars from my mods work, as Flight Engineer and KAC are open, and I can close and re-open them again. If I click Resources, they won\u0027t show up.\n\nThis flight is also manned, but the Kerbal\u0027s facecam is gone from the bottom-right corner too. If I click on the crew hatch, it\u0027ll show his name but won\u0027t give me the option to EVA.\n\nAll of the buttons on the pause menu work, I can edit my settings from the pause menu and stuff. I\u0027m assuming Revert Flight works too but I don\u0027t want to click it since, well, it\u0027ll revert my flight. F5 shows no quicksave note on the side, but for all I know it could be quicksaving without telling me. I don\u0027t want to reload my last quicksave since it was before this flight.\n\nIs there a way I can fix this without quitting the game?\n\nEDIT: This has happened in the Debug menu, dunno if it really means anything:\n\n![6sylQu5.png](http://i.imgur.com/6sylQu5.png)\n\nI assume this would have started happening just the IVA facecam disappeared, but it started glitching a bit before that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T23:10:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 11:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yorshee**"},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T23:17:05Z","Content":"Hello, perhaps with the full log file, the error will be more clear ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) you can read this [How To Get Support](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229) ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T00:42:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hello, perhaps with the full log file, the error will be more clear ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) you can read this [How To Get Support](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229) ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI ended up trying to quicksave (the debug menu made it look like it was at least doing *something*), and then reloaded the save. It must have corrupted or something because it loaded my previous quicksave which isn\u0027t surprising when you look at the screenshot below which is what the debug menu was showing while it was apparently quicksaving:\n\n![TI45lUk.png](http://i.imgur.com/TI45lUk.png)\n\nI ended up closing down the game and restarting it again so I\u0027m not too sure if the output log will still be helpful."}]}
