If you are running through Steam go to the properties of the game (by right clicking), then click on set launch options. In the space type *-force-opengl* (the - is needed) and the game will run on OpenGL. Make sure your game is in windowed mode, OpenGL doesn\u0027t like full screen (at least when I tried). If you are not running on Steam open your KSP folder, right-click KSP.exe, select \u0022Create shortcut\u0022, and put *-force-opengl* in the \u0022Target\u0022 field after the quotation marks, with a blank in-between. As for the anti-aliasing, sadly there is no way to turn it on, although I found that by turning it up in game, it did improve it a tad.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T02:04:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 02:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceExplorer**\n  \nGrammar and Spelling"},{"CreatedByName":"xptical","CreatedById":55319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T20:32:10Z","Content":"This may be what I\u0027m experiencing too. ATI video card. When I use the \u0022-force-opengl\u0022 option, AA turns off in the game. The options are still enabled, but AA is \\*clearly\\* not working.\n\nIIRC, the ATI CCC tool will not apply \u00223D Application Settings\u0022 to any OpenGL app.\n\nFYI running fullscreen here. My desktop is 720P, but I play KSP at 1080P; I don\u0027t think windowed mode is an option."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceExplorer","CreatedById":138160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T20:50:38Z","Content":"Hey xptical,\n\nAfter doing a little searching myself I found that the only form of anti-aliasing that OpenGL can work with is MSAA (muti-sample anti-aliasing). Sadly, the KSP settings do not allow for you to select MSAA from the settings, thus you have to force KSP to use them through your graphics driver. Again, this seems not to work for you. The only option that I can suggest is for you to change the settings in your graphics driver before you alter it to OpenGL and see if that works.\n\nAll the best."},{"CreatedByName":"Fizwalker","CreatedById":78337,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T05:21:37Z","Content":"Another option would be to use the dirrctx11 switch. (It\u0027s what I use, and it does support AA up to 8x) The syntax is: -forcedirectx11. As far as I can tell it saves about the same amount of memory as opengl."},{"CreatedByName":"SnakyLeVrai","CreatedById":135852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T12:45:17Z","Content":"Weird, I have -force-opengl and I did *almost* the same thing you did in nvidia control panel, and it worked.
