The issue I\u0027m having is that when all conditions are met I am unable to complete a contract for running a test on the Mk 1 Inline Cockpit, there is simply no option to do so. Am I missing something? Or is this a known issue? Thanks in advance.\n\n![D2PRtT0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/D2PRtT0.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"rbos","CreatedById":72073,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T19:06:56Z","Content":"Ditto.
