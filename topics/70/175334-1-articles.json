There are no fuel lines and I have never needed them in the past. Also fuel flows ok.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo something has recently happened to cause this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I dock a miner/refueler to it on the ground, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E says that the tank is full. Looking at the tank it says that it is 1/3 full.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then flew the same plane on Kerbin and it worked fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRunning KSP 1.4.3 (64) on PC via Steam.
