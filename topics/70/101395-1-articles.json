Is there a program I can use to convert it to a readable format? I added it to the ships folder just fyi, as I thought thats what I was supposed to do and if not where would I put it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T22:38:34Z","Content":"As long as it has the suffix .craft it should be fine, if it doesn\u0027t if it\u0027s like a .txt or something just open it in a text editor like Notepad, or Notepad\u002B\u002B and do save as, and make sure in the name field you enter whatever.craft\n\nAlso which folder are you putting it in specifically? in the root KSP directory there is a Ships folder, inside is a VAB or SPH folder, as long as it goes in one of them then you should be able to load it in any sandbox game, but not in career/science mode games, unless you clicked the little bubble allowing stock crafts. If you want to load it in one of those games then you need to open that games save file and it will have a Ships folder with VAB and SPH folders in it, you will then have to put it in one of those."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T22:39:22Z","Content":"Just a wild guess but have you turned off known file extensions and that .craft file is really a .craft.zip? The craft file itself should be easily readable with a text editor like notepad\u002B\u002B."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T22:52:26Z","Content":"It\u0027s most likely craftname.craft.txt or just craftname.txt, if you simpley rename it as craftname.craft it\u0027ll work.\n\nDon\u0027t forget to put it in either the VAB or SPH folders of your save though or KSP just won\u0027t see it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

I have no idea how it works for .craft files, but text files (which .craft files ultimately are) are saved differently in different OSs (different line ending chars). Maybe you altered the file with an editor before moving it?"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptynCron","CreatedById":138966,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T07:00:14Z","Content":"Thanks for the replies all. The file is located in my VAB under Ships, had renamed it with a .craft designation yet it didnt show up in sandbox. It does distinctively say its a TXT file so idk wth. All I did was download and add it. Didnt even look at it beforehand."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T09:15:35Z","Content":"You have to disable the option to hide unknown file extensions."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptynCron","CreatedById":138966,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T04:04:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You have to disable the option to hide unknown file extensions.\n\nThere is no option in Settings to do this"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T09:21:39Z","Content":"I meant known file extensions. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\n[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hide-file-name-extensions#show-hide-file-name-extensions=windows-7](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hide-file-name-extensions#show-hide-file-name-extensions=windows-7)"}]}
