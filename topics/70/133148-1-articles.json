The troubles start if one is masochist enough to install the AMD proprietary drivers, which sadly are still required for some games (as the AMD open source drivers currently only support OpenGL 4.1, and Intel only supports OpenGL 3.3 - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://mesamatrix.net/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esource\u003C/a\u003E -, yet the AMD proprietary drivers support OpenGL 4.5, but they tend to crash, and crash, and, did I mention that they tend to crash?), but luckily KSP is running perfectly fine with the open source drivers. By the way, most games that don\u0027t run with AMD open source drivers will not run on Intel at all, given that they have a very similar feature set, with some OpenGL extensions available only on Intel, and some only on AMD, but both open source drivers are under heavy development, and new OpenGL extensions get added every few weeks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, there is Direct3D 9 on Linux, but only for the AMD and nVidia open source drivers by using the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.ixit.cz/d3d9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGallium3D Nine state tracker\u003C/a\u003E. It\u0027s far from perfect though (graphics glitches...), and also afaik there are no native Linux games using it. Windows games can use it when being run through WINE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding Live-USB: I\u0027m pretty certain that for most Linux distributions it\u0027s not directly possible to install proprietary nVidia graphics drivers on the Live-USBs, as they typically write their system partition as a \u003Cs\u003ECDROM\u003C/s\u003E compressed read-only filesystem on the USB-drive, so said system partition is write protected... There definitely are exceptions to this, I think Linux Mint might eventually be one (I never bothered with Live-USB for anything but installation...). Anyhow, it\u0027s not too difficult to install Linux from a USB drive to another USB drive, and also Dual Boot is rather easy to set up. *buntu and Mint are indeed pretty easy to set up with very beginner friendly installer programs, but if you feel more confident with a well written handbook that actually explains what the different steps of the installation are doing, you might want to have a look at the Debian \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehandbook\u003C/a\u003E which is excellently written, and targets an audience that doesn\u0027t have too much computer knowledge (but beware: Debian und Ubuntu, as similar as they may be, use different installers).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-01T06:31:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2016 06:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by soulsource\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EReplaced CDROM by compressed read-only filesystem\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
