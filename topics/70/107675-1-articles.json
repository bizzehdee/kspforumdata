They returned safely, I saved and went to bed. I open KSP back up today and only 2 of the kerbals are showing, the scientist isn\u0027t listed anywhere and the other 2 kerbals do show their increased XP from the mission. \n\nI looked in my save .cfg and his name is actually listed as planting a flag during the mission, but that is the ONLY place his name is mentioned in the .cfg file. Not sure where to go from here.\n\nAfter searching the forums, the only other time people have mentioned this is after trying to move old saves over to a new version. This is a new save.\n\nUpdate: So I had Jeb, Bob and Bill in my space station and went to rotate them out with a new crew. All 3 were brought back to Kerbin. I even did an EVA on Kerbin with Bob just to see if I could get some extra science. He got the science and I recovered vessel. Enter the astronaut complex and sure enough, he is listed as being on the station still, and not as available. Guess I\u0027ll just go hack this save file to pieces until it breaks all the way or gets fixed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T21:20:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 09:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bsimms606**\n  \nMeant Bob, not Bill"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Cobbaut","CreatedById":132410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T09:18:02Z","Content":"Just a thought...

And wouldn\u0027t they be in the missing or assigned tab? Either way, I just hired a new scientist and made him level 3 in the save file. Don\u0027t really feel too bad about doing that seeing as that guy was level 3."}]}
