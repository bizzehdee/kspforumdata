I uninstalled it from steam, but I want to completely remove all files and windows 10 isn\u0027t letting me do it because I have no access. I have tried doing it as the administrator from the command line but still, access is denied. I found out in one of Windows 10\u0027s updates there\u0027s now a new kind of superuser called TrustedInstaller that owns everything inside Program Files (x86) and so only it can delete some of the files (not even the administrator can). I also looked for help on windows 10 forums and other support pages into how to take ownership of the files, but even when I followed those steps, windows was unable to give me permission to access some of the files, specifically many of those from mods inside GameData. Has anyone had this issue? Any way around it? I\u0027m basically unable to uninstall mods, which is extremely annoying and inconvenient, to say the least, and since I can\u0027t delete mods, I can\u0027t delete the main KSP folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheKSPBeginner","CreatedById":154786,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-16T14:38:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy would you want to?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
