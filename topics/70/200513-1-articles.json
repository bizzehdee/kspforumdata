In particular, I remember that I could depend on MJ2 getting me right to the doorstep of\u00A0 whatever ship or station I was meeting up with (seriously - one time my ship slid right between the spokes of a ring station; huge pucker factor on that one!). Now, it seems that more often than not the Hohmann Xfer burn ends up being at least 0.1 degree off the plane of the target, even when starting from a 0.0 degree orbit. Matching velocities is pretty dicey as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, I still love using it to automate the tediousness of getting the basic Maneuver Node created, and don\u0027t mind tweaking it.
