By the looks of it, Near Future Exploration is one of them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo all of your relays use a relay antenna and are they in line of sight of each other and a ground station on Kerbin? You might just be out of range, JNSQ\u2019s larger scale means you need more comms power to phone home but there\u2019s a patch to boost antenna range by 4x inside JNSQ itself- this might be getting interfered with if Near Future Exploration is installed due to the novel antenna features it includes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
