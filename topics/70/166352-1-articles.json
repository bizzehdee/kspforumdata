When I started a new campaign collected and unlocked some science, I went to trade some for funds to upgrade the R\u0026amp;D Lab. I reduced the commitment to 1%, to get ~6-800,000 funds. I think it took the science (I didn\u0027t see it happen) but failed to deliver the funds. So I did a simple contract thinking that instant just needed to be \u0022refreshed\u0022 with a modification to funds, still no 600k\u002B, I then returned and attempted a 2% trade, and again took science (saw the science drop this time) but fails to return the funds. I have attached the main menu with the mods (versions) and game client version. I don\u0027t think any of the mods I use influence that portion of the game, I will test without any mods I will update the post with the result.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ksp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022464\u0022 src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v425/SciBott/ksp.png\u0022 width=\u0022800\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-11T12:09:33Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2017 12:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by SciBott\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
