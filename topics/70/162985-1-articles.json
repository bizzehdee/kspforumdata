I\u0027ve encountered a peculiar bug which appears rather consistently when certain conditions are met:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. A vessel must be in orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. It must have a manned EAS-1 command seat\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I load a save file created in flight under these conditions, some of the vessel\u0027s parts are misaligned. Usually it\u0027s the wheels, the landing gear, the command seat or the kerbal manning it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using a number of mods: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, Throttle Controlled Avionics, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Build Aid, Atomic Age, QuizTechAero, a bunch of other part packs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the first time I encountered this bug I was flying a spaceplane only made of stock parts. Vessel mass matters a lot for a spaceplane, especially if you only have panther engines. So a command seat stowed into a 1,25m service bay seemed the best solution for a rescue mission. Naturally I saved the game when the stranded kerbal got aboard. Can\u0027t remember what made me load it, but when I was about to land at Kerbin I noticed that the fore gear is skewed about 30 degrees aside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA similar thing happened to a flying rover when I decided to take an engineer along for an orbital mission - the wheels got all screwed up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth the spaceplane and the rover are included in the following footage. The bug conditions are simulated 2 times for each vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone has an idea what might have caused this, please tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKxbHNkUcOc?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUPD: The parts get back to normal after going to space center and then back to the vessel.

It might be that stuff shifts slightly on loading, and KJR is sometimes locking stuff in place before it can get back to the right spot (not sure if that makes sense). Perhaps try the same steps with KJR uninstalled and see what happens?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you by any chance have the stock autostruts enabled on some of the parts? On occasion I\u0027ve had things end up bent into weird shapes and then locked in place due to those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
