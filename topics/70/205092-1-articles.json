Autostrut target parts can change when docking/undocking and when fuel is burnt so reloading the vessel again will cause them to recalculate and this can bend the craft out of shape.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf all else fails, use the game cheats to spawn a new, un-mangled copy of the ship beside the mangled one then return the mangled one to the launchpad and recover it; transfer crew etc. from old to new first.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
