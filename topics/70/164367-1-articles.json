This is probably some really obvious thing I glossed over, but I\u0027ve been installing a lot of mods as of late and every time I put the content of the mod\u0027s gamedata folder into my KSP install\u0027s gamedata folder. This has worked every other time, but not this one. I put BD armory\u0027s \u0022BDArmory\u0022 folder into KSP\u0027s gamedata (This folder is all that\u0027s in the mod\u0027s gamedata folder) and the game was unchanged. I tried to take the contents of THAT folder and copy it over to KSP, and it crashed upon startup. Is 1.1 no longer compatible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-13T13:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHI, cant work out from your post what exactly you are trying to do, aside from installing BDA.\u00A0 Which BDA version are you trying to install? which version of KSP are you using? A copy of your KSP.log would answer all these questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe do not recommend using any of\u00A0 the earlier BDA versions unless for some reason you are unable to upgrade. It\u0027s also a certainty that there is only one currently supported release and that is for KSP 1.3, there will be very little support for previous versions as the structure of BDA has changed massively over the past few months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current supported release for KSP1.3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/BDArmory/releases/download/v0.3.0.0/BDArmory.0.3.0.0_07282017.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/BDArmory/releases/download/v0.3.0.0/BDArmory.0.3.0.0_07282017.zip\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Triinkett","CreatedById":180587,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-23T22:57:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I actually fixed it.
