First off I would like to give a big shout-out to all you fine people on this forum. I started playing KSP about 4 hours a day, after work, for about a month now. It has been a amazing experience enhanced only by you guys since any problem I bumped into has always been solved reading something somewhere on this forum. Until now... maybe I don\u0027t type in the right words in search or I don\u0027t know but it\u0027s the first time I have a problem and did not find a solution here so... to enhance the Kerbal database of knowledge, I made this post!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get right into it, I have flown manned missions to the moon and back and right after I decided to setup my satellite network. Said and done, launched my first satellite, got it into polar orbit, extended everything and started all the scaners, transmited all the science\u00A0and then clicked \u0022return to space station\u0022, leaving my satellite functioning in orbit with lots of power and a engine and fuel that was never ignited since I didint need it to get to orbit (thought i would keep it in orbit as a relay situation. Once back to the space station I realised I have the same amount of money and science that I had before launching the mission. I suspected something so I went over to the Tracking Station and guess what...no satellite anywhere. Thought it could be a bug, restarted the game, did everything again and.... again when I get back to space center nothing is chenged, it\u0027s like it doesn\u0027t save my progress once I click \u0022back to space center\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone encountered this or could anyone help me out please? I love this game and all its potential but if I\u00A0can\u0027t have multiple flights running at the same time I\u0027m just gonna have to quit....and I don\u0027t want that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for the read and effort in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlex\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
