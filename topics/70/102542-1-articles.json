Do they appear as two separate crafts now, or a single craft? (test by trying to switch between them). If they\u0027re treated as separate crafts now, what happens if you try to thrust away using RCS? Have you tried turning off SAS?\n\nI have no experience with the 3.75m docking port you\u0027re refering to, but provided that they\u0027re the same size as the node you\u0027re docking to, it should not matter.\n\nPS: I believe i remember hearing about a known bug relating to docking ports.

Remote tech, procedural fairings, interstellar, space y lifters, all of the near future mods, mech jeb, ATM, transfer window planner, atomic age. That should be all of them. \n\nYeah, I clicked undock and the camera changes focus to the craft I want, but will act as if its part of the craft even when I turn, except I cannot control it unless I switch to the other craft. I quick saved before I undocked and tried multiple combinations of trying to RCS away, engine thrust away, both, trying all three right before I decouple, SAS on/off, RCS on off. Even tried both physical and regular time warp and regular time warp has the ship phasing right through it, only to collide once I come back to 1x and make my craft(or whatever is left) in an uncontrollable spin with both RCS and SAS unable to affect it. \n\nAnd yes, I\u0027m using the same sized docking port\n\nThe fix seems to be (look at the original post\u0027s edit) going back to the space center and coming back via tracking station, but I still have to test it out multiple times to see if that\u0027s the solution to this glitch"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T20:00:20Z","Content":"[https://github.com/ferram4/Kerbal-Joint-Reinforcement/blob/master/GameData/KerbalJointReinforcement/Plugin/KerbalJointReinforcement.dll](https://github.com/ferram4/Kerbal-Joint-Reinforcement/blob/master/GameData/KerbalJointReinforcement/Plugin/KerbalJointReinforcement.dll)\n\nDelete your old KJR.dll and use this one instead."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T20:00:25Z","Content":"If you warp time, do they slide apart?

However you say that they are still together buy there magnetic forces so they have undocked. you just need to thrust away. You could also try swiveling it and spinning it so it\u0027s no longer effected, then ditch it if you don\u0027t need. Also you say that your game crashes when the part lands, is it large or, more importantly does it have a large part count? then that could be why it crashes. i doubt it\u0027s to do with your mods as i know from past experiences crashing things with large part count doesn\u0027t help the computers mood."}]}
