They are identical to parts that I have modded and still work, except for the resource amounts and type of resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve checked the resource config files, and everything checks out there too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only Add-on I\u0027m using is mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve reloaded KSP and the problem persists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: also, the parts operate completely normally in flight, The problem is in the VAB (Didn\u0027t check the SPH because they arnt space plane parts)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
