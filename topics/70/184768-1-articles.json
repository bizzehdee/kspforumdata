So max distance from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E would still refund the player roughly 70% funds or so, instead of 30% or 40% (or whatever it is).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe above is just an example, I basically just want to change the games parameter for funds returned to player for stage recovery based on distance. So, where is the game storing the equation to turn distance \u002B stage cost in to refund?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JakeSublime","CreatedById":168107,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-31T03:49:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUMP!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still need help with this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JakeSublime","CreatedById":168107,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-02T01:39:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUMP Still need help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
