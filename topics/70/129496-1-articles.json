I install every mod individually and it works, but as soon as I add RO, it freezes when it gets to a certain point of loading. This only happens when I put the RO files into my gamedata folder, and without it works perfectly fine. I suspect it is because it is running out of ram, but I\u0027m not sure cause this macbook pro\u00A0has 8 gb of ram (i know ksp is a 32 bit game and only takes like 3 of it).

This is likely when manually installing RO which is why RO\u0027s thread strongly recommands using CKAN, to make sure you have all mods needed and the correct configs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-08T00:58:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2016 12:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Gaarst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T03:11:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake sure you\u0027re on build 1028\u002B of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manni01","CreatedById":109903,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T03:54:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what I get for not updating.
