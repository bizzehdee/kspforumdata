I built a simple lander and was unable to to convert kethane into fuel no matter what i did. i have fuel lines running from the tank to the the converter as required. i also have plenty of kethane and electricity and yet nothing happens. I tried again today with a large converter that should (as i understand) extend heat distributors and then work. Well when i tested it today the heat things are not extending and still nothing is happening. Again i have plenty of electricity and kethane on board. WHAT AM I DOING WRONG!?!? Grr such a cool mod but i cant figure this out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp please!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMo-T\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T12:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMo-t calm down!
