It does not happen often, and I think it has only actually happened to me three or four times. I am just wondering why it is happening, if it is a known bug, and if there is anything I can do to prevent it. Below is an example of one time it happened.\u00A0I removed a few panels before I took the screenshot, so this isn\u0027t exactly what happened, but it shows how the panels moved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Screenshot166.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://u.cubeupload.com/Bjh223/Screenshot166.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*sigh* KSP is an awesome game, but full of bugs and glitches.
