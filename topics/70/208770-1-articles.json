The graphics are also showing the Mun not within its own orbit during this period. I\u0027ve already restarted the game and reloaded a previous save but neither have worked. The only mods I have are Kerbal Alarm Clock and [x] Science! Continued (they don\u0027t affect gameplay, just QOL improvements).

The purple line you see floating in space nowhere near the Mun is just patched conics displaying the trajectory relative to the body you\u0027re currently orbiting (Kerbin), which can be pretty misleading until you get used to it. If you focus view on the Mun, you\u0027ll see the trajectory relative to the Mun which should be completely normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR this is fine. Really. Try changing the patched conics mode in the main menu settings and see if a different setting works better for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
