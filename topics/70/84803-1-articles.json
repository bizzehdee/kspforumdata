I\u0027m pretty new to the entire modding deal but thus far I\u0027ve installed and uninstalled these three combinations of mods and when I have Ferram Aerospace installed and I install either of the others and try to attach say a turbjet engine from Ferram\u0027s mod on just say a mk2 cockpit or fuel tank or fuselage even if I don\u0027t try to install it if I just click the part it shoots weird jets out of the top and side and can\u0027t be placed anywhere and has a few times locked up the entire game with a weird bug where you can\u0027t click on any buttons except parts to start new ships and it places those parts whereever the bug happened no matter what and you can\u0027t move them. Anyways yeah it\u0027s really killing me right now simply because I want to test out FAR I haven\u0027t even played it but I really want to do so with some of the stuff from KW rocketry at least for my rockets. So I have the newest version of KSP and I\u0027m running the 64 bit version though this bug seems to happen on the 32 bit version as well, I have these mods installed - Enhanced Navball, Mechjeb 2.0, Karbonite, Extraplanetary launchpads (with the adaptation for karbonite), KJR, KAS, FAR as I\u0027ve said, TAC Fuel balance, Procedural Fairings, Kerbal Alarm clock, editor extensions, Kerbal Engineer Redux, Tweakscale, Deadly Reentry, FS hangar extender, Asteroid Recycling Technologies, Distant Object Enhancement, Active Texture Management, and of course Chatterer... Cause we gotta have them beeps man, gotta have em.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways I realize this probably isn\u0027t exactly what you need to even help me, and am entirely willing to provide all those things if you need more. Like I said I\u0027ve tried changing from 64 to 32 bit and uninstalling and reinstalling bot of those mods and both cause the exact same glitch, which if I knew anything at all about modding might instantly tell me the problem, alas I am as ignorant about this subject as G.W Bush probably is about drawing an amplitude for a probability calculation for light to reflect off a piece of glass. Thus I find myself here in search of a potential answer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s very hard to imagine all the crazy things, that things Really are like\u0022 - R.P Feynman\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T11:17:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Romuless\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Romuless\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnyways I realize this probably isn\u0027t exactly what you need to even help me, and am entirely willing to provide all those things if you need more. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed - please read the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHow To Get Support thread\u003C/a\u003E for information on what to provide and where to find it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I think you are a little confused - Ferram Aerospace Research doesn\u0027t add in any new engines, just changes the stock ones. I know B9 has additional changes (that I personally don\u0027t agree with) as well.
