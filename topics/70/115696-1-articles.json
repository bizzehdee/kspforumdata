I also pasted in KSPRC\u0027s Texture Replacer folder, which did not replace or overwrite anything. These are the only two folders I added from KSPRC, and are the only changes I\u0027ve made since the game last worked. Upon launching the game, the mod install itself seems to have worked, as the textures have been applied to the Kerbonauts, skybox, and Kerbin itself. However, upon entering the Space Center and trying to click a building, nothing happens. The ability to highlight a building disappears after the first attempt to open one. I can hit escape to bring up the quick-menu, and those buttons can be pressed, but I cannot exit to the main menu.\n\nOnce I reach KSC scene, the game seems to lose the ability to change scenes. I\u0027ve had a similar bug before when I was very close to the RAM limit, but according to the Task Manager, that is not the case here.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\nFull list of mods:\n\n-Asteroid Day\n\n-EVE\n\n-KSPRC\u0027s BoulderCo folder\n\n-KER\n\n-Hyperedit\n\n-KJR\n\n-PlanetShine\n\n-KSPRC\u0027s Texture Replacer folder\n\n-KAC\n\nReddit thread I was taking instructions from:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/37nedh/installing_mods_to_make_ksp_look_nicer_step_by/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/37nedh/installing_mods_to_make_ksp_look_nicer_step_by/)\n\n-\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T00:31:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 12:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dizzle**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T00:15:27Z","Content":"Update: It is DEFINITELY something to do with KSPRC\u0027s Texture Replacer folder. I ran it again with no mods except for EVE (KSPRC\u0027s BoulderCo folder) and KSPRC\u0027s Texture Replacer. Still had the issue. Removing the Texture Replacer folder from that install fixed the issue, at the cost of the non-planet textures, of course. Going to keep trying.\n\nEDIT\n\nI have discovered the complicated and highly technical reason for the issue: my failure to read. As it turns out, ONLY the Default folder from KSPRC\u0027s Texture Replacer is meant to overwrite the original. I was NOT supposed to overwrite the entire Texture Replacer folder.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T00:30:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 12:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dizzle**"}]}
