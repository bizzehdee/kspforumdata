I do have Mission Control and the Tracking Station upgraded to level 2. Yet for some reason maneuver nodes are unavailable to me. For a brief time while ascending through the atmosphere I can click on my blue line flightpath and place a node, but once I get high enough and transition to space, my flightpath line turns pink and I can no longer click on it. Also, I cannot right-click on other ships, moons, or planets to make them targets. I can\u0027t rendezvous with anything, or leave Earth orbit. Essentially, I can\u0027t play the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure if this is MechJeb, Principia, or some other mod that\u0027s blocking it, or perhaps a setting I haven\u0027t found yet, or a genuine bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease help. Many thanks and appreciation to you all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
