I fit a ship with a microwave receiver and even if I set it at 1% receiving power, they still overheat and shut down. First I thought it was because my Kerbin powerstation put out 4GW and was just overkill, but even with a 350MW station I get overheats at 1% receiving power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to stop this other than adding radiators to cool it down?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stoney3K","CreatedById":139954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T20:18:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose microwave receivers look to be part of a mod (they\u0027re definitely not stock).

It lets you put satellites in orbit to transmit power. If you put up arrays within line of sight you can have power around the planet from a single power station.

Do you have any radiators on the craft at all? Assuming that Interstellar didn\u0027t change too much since 0.90, you will inevitably build up waste heat which eventually leads to a shutdown. You need at least some radiators, with a 350 MW station and 1% efficiency it doesn\u0027t have to be a large one, especially since radiators\u0027 effectiveness scales with waste heat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T15:56:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, but that defeats the purpose of getting rid of the solar panels if I now have to attach radiators, LOL.
