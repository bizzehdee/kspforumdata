I have a contract where I need to collect 50% of the surface deployed seismic sensor so I smashed a 1.3 ton spent stage both on the other side of the Moon and also 50 meters next to the sensor at ~460-500 m/s, but I\u0027m only getting a tiny bit of data (1E-29 and 1E-32 to be exact). What\u0027s going on, and how do I fix this?
