I managed to get the game to run by forcing d3d11, but I was advised before by some prominent modders (Galileo perhaps?) that the game should be run in dx9, and dx11 will cause issues with some visual mods. Right now I don\u0027t have any of those visual mods (eve, scatterer) installed because I\u0027m running KSP1.3, but I would like to get things back on an even keel so I can use those when they\u0027re updated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1589hrp7bytk63l/AAAMfts5TSESPUXQLsRSdnqla?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/1589hrp7bytk63l/AAAMfts5TSESPUXQLsRSdnqla?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
