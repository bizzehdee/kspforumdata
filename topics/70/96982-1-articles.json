I hope to reverify that now; dont ask me why I honestly think, and have shown once that NASAMission added 1.5 gigs of game RAM; ALSO there is a CACHE issue; when I removed planet factory folder it remained in some kind of memory cache; starting a new game got rid of it; I am now starting with a clean KSP90 in hopes to have a no-memory used workinf Planet Factory harr harr !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still strongly feel NasaMission is at fault in 90; using only squad and nasamission and MM2.5.8 it wont spawn asteroids; I am running a good system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZeta\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZeta\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T09:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are playing a Career-mode game, then you need to upgrade the Tracking Station to level 3 before asteroids will appear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T12:30:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell...I didnt know that...I will be running Career Mode Simulations soon to check that out...thanks !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECmdr Zeta\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
