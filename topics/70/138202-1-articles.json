Stations issue\u003C/strong\u003E -\u00A0One issue is with space stations only - and stations use some Near Future Construction 0.5.5 mod (cant upgrade because some parts are removed from 0.6 - maybe need to make new station - change central part with big docks to some alternative mod - and do savegame edit - but this is last resort). Currently sometimes station wobbles, trusses will go to infinite length, game wont allow depart from station and claim\u0027s its moving. On screenshot I noticed science lab is missing and seems to be away. Trusses are supposed to connect science lab to jet fuel tanks/engine pylons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lab-went-away.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://utoopia.eu/img/lab-went-away.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2. IVA everywhere issue\u003C/strong\u003E -\u00A0Other issue is with EVA and some satellites where IVA view is poping up behind kerbal on EVA or satelite core. Its quite disturbing - cannot see around - is Kerbal next to door already? Have to move around sideways to see more - IVA is only behind kerbal - so moving sideways allows to turn IVA to side also to take fewer space from screen. Also - kerbal portraits from right-lower corner are missing. Issue came some 2-3 days ago, probably because some mod updates arrived to CKAN.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: IVA issue seems to have been fixed a day before 1.1.1 update by some mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn prerelease game was working fine, mods were just not working (depite being there).
