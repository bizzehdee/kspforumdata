The station has a low eccentricity and inclination 225km orbit. To add new parts, I launch from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E at about 70 degree pitch\u00A0with the station a few minutes from passing overhead. With an apoapsis just over 225km I have a pass at about 3km. Once up there, I burn prograde and work toward rendezvous.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the station loads at about 2250m, I have about 80m/s closing velocity. As the station loads,\u00A0the game skips for a second\u00A0and my closing velocity is dropped to about 1.2m/s. When checking the map, my orbit is now\u00A0matched with the target, and we are both suborbital.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought that maybe the game was thinking my exhaust was impacting the station from absurdly far away, so I tried again and made sure not to point my rear at the station with the same result.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone heard of this\u00A0happening?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know more info will be requested and will get mod list and pc specs up when I get home from work. I\u0027m running this on a 6 year old laptop and know well that\u0027s a\u00A0problem, but I\u0027m not sure if it causing this particular issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
