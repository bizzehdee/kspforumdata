No amount of radiators would keep my heatshield safe. Adding more would lower the temperature of the hottest parts, but there was still enough heat to permeate the whole vessel and I found no way of stopping it. I could delay it so that the first loss would occur 15 minutes into the burn rather than 5, I could also reduce the rate of ablator loss, but I couldn\u0027t stop it completely.
