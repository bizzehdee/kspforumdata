On a brand new MacBook Pro 13\u0022 with 16GB RAM and a 3Ghz dual-core Core i7, running OSX Yosemite, I open a save file, click on any building, and then the game crashes. Looking through the reports, every time it hangs it says the error was \u0022KERN\\_UNPROTECTED\\_FAILURE,\u0022 and the crashed thread was com.apple.mainthread (I don\u0027t remember the exact name.) Player.log says nothing of any use.\n\nMods:\n\nBDArmory\n\nMechJeb\n\nModuleManager\n\nCollisionFX\n\nHotrockets"}]}
