It was in a stable orbit just below the low orbit limit (so temperature scans would work). I was able to restore it from an older save file by copying and pasting the vessel definition. I then checked to make sure no other ships had disappeared, and found that one had from around Gilly. Also a science orbiter (exact same ship design, in fact - ion drive probe weighing less than a tonne), also just below the low orbit limit. I had to go further back to find that one in a previous save, so that one disappeared first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods I have installed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToolbar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditorExtensions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnhancedNavBall\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalEngineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreciseNode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETacFuelBalancer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalAlarmClock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransferWindowPlanner\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a known intermittent bug?

There must be a huge disconnect between the visual model of Gilly in the game and it\u0027s dimensions used for calculating collisions. Despite being well above any of the apparent terrain, the log shows it colliding with the planet when switching ships. So you can\u0027t actually achieve stable low orbit of Gilly, since that figure (6km) is below the highest invisible terrain (apparently around 8km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure why the Bop orbiter disappeared, since it was already above the highest recorded terrain, but I moved that to a higher orbit as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also found my Gilly base deleted, and can only assume the game though it collided, despite being landed. I\u0027ll just have to keep an eye on that one. There seems to be no way to land stably, as the planet keeps torquing underneath the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TruePikachu","CreatedById":130749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T08:06:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Gilly, that 8km figure for invisible terrain coincides with the minimum altitude for 5x time, and Bop has 5x at 24.5km. LGO is below 6km, and LBO is below 25km. I believe that ships which reach the 1x time limit are assumed to crash, which would suggest that it is impossible to achieve \u0022stable\u0022 LGO, but LBO should be possible inside the 500m window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Gilly base destruction, I don\u0027t tend to leave things unattended on Gilly, but if you manage to 5x time accelerate, that pretty much guarentees that you are on the surface, and switching away might leave the base intact. You might want to look into using a grappling hook from KAS to \u0022dock\u0022 with Gilly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
