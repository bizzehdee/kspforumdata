The camera\u0027s\u00A0focus seems to have an error. the focus\u00A0rotates when I turn the ship, so it\u0027s position must be\u00A0retaliative to the ship/CoM?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe\u00A0there is a value of this focus\u00A0relative to CoM that gets refreshed incrementally and it\u0027s somehow picking up\u00A0error or something? we need help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince it affects saves that had been fine, I believe it\u0027s not the craft, but the\u00A0installation somehow or the mod\u0027s part that has become corrupted?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll try backing up and moving\u00A0saves to\u00A0a fresh install to see if that helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat mods are you using HardZiin03?\u00A0I\u0027ll try share\u00A0pictures or video of my\u00A0problem to see if it\u0027s the same as yours.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0Good luck \u003Cimg alt=\u0022^_^\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 title=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.
