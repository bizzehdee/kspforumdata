Since then, I\u0027ve had memory leak issues, as well as what I can only describe as an\u00A0epileptic-event inducing glitch when at high altitudes above a planetary body. To rectify this issue, or issues related to messing up the installation of a mod\u00A0in the past, I just copied my clean copy of KSP and modded the new copy. Anytime I try to delete the old file for an updated one, it will not allow it to be deleted. I do believe this might be related to my other project on this PC: X-Plane 11 in which I somehow or another corrupted 64gb of data...
