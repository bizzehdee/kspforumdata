In addition, Minmus is no longer visible - all that is left are the map markers for the various ships and flags on the surface.\n\n![vf3MSyn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vf3MSyn.jpg)\n\nThe only part that should be providing control on these ships is the Mk 1 Command Pod. Other ships that are not of this design function normally.\n\n**Mods Installed:**\n\nChatterer 0.9.5\n\nConnected Living Space 1.1.3.0\n\nKAS 0.5.1\n\nKIS 1.1.4\n\nInfernal Robotics 0.21.2\n\nSounding Rockets 0.2.0\n\nStockalike Station Parts Expansion 0.3.3\n\nTexture Replacer 2.4.3\n\nThe two broken rockets do not have any non-stock parts. Texture Replacer is only used to replace suit and head textures - I have not replaced any planet textures.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI forgot to mention, the Staging icons have also been shunted off the left side of the screen.\n\nOther people who have experienced the same bug:\n\n[http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5154](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5154)\n\n[http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5155](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5155)\n\n[http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5156](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5156)\n\n**THE FIX:**\n\nThanks to \\_Ayli\\_ on Reddit and Lodebeard, I have fixed the ships. If this happened to you, go into your persistent.sls save file and search for \u0022name = HeatShield2\u0022 to find the broken part. There are three lines:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E srfN = None, #\n\u003E  attN = bottom, #\n\u003E \n\u003E  attN = top, #\n\nAnd you need to add the line \u0022attN = None, -1\u0022 like so:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E srfN = None, #\n\u003E  attN = None, -1\n\u003E \n\u003E  attN = bottom, #\n\u003E \n\u003E  attN = top, #\n\n[More information can be found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3asi15/uncontrollable_craft_kraken_fix/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T05:55:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 05:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Grumman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crookz","CreatedById":89188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T01:27:56Z","Content":"same exact issue.

If I advance time warp above 1X and then return to time warp = 1X, most of the ship goes zooming off except for one small section (in one ship, that\u0027s orbiting Mun the only part left is a landing can; in the other ship that\u0027s orbiting Duna, the only part left is a rover that had been stored in a service large service bay).\n\nIf I speed up time warp above 1X, the whole ship appears to be intact but if I then slow the time warp back to 1X the majority of the ship goes zooming off again.\n\nIf I wait while a minute or less (for the ship that\u0027s orbiting Mun) then I\u0027ll see the rest of the ship zoom past again as though it\u0027s continuing to orbit Mun while the Landing Can is appears to be stationary.\n\n{I see that other\u0027s have reported a similar situation in the bug reports linked above)\n\nAt time time I created these saves I was using MechJeb, Chatterer, and Kerbal Alarm Clock."},{"CreatedByName":"lodebeard","CreatedById":145480,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T04:55:34Z","Content":"This worked for me.
