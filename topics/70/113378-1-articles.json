I\u0027ve noticed that too in my logs. I doubt its related to your graphical issues as I have those log entries but not the graphical glitches.

It went away when I played without using steam.\n\nFor some reason, if I had steam and chatterer at the same time, my graphics got messed up and had frequent crashes to the point where the game crashed when I tried to load a save.\n\nTook chatterer out and I could load games but my graphics were still a bit naff. Played without steam and I can use chatterer and now it\u0027s pretty stable.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T14:18:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Daveroski**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T14:44:41Z","Content":"I recently had some graphics issues also. I\u0027m on windows. so I downloaded the geforce experience tool from nvidia. It updated the video drivers and optimized settings for KSP for me. Graphics issues went away. I don\u0027t think you can get geforce experience for Linux, but, from the pictures you posted, it looks to me like either a problem with the video card drivers or hardware failure. \n\nIf this was my machine, I would try this first : [http://smallbusiness.chron.com/test-graphics-card-ubuntu-49215.html](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/test-graphics-card-ubuntu-49215.html). If GPU passes the tests, then I would create a new, separate KSP stock only install, reduce graphics settings to minimums, and verify that issue still exists. Then re-install the latest video drivers for your GPU. If possible, completely uninstall existing drivers. Then install the latest drivers from the manufacturers website. I know very little about ubuntu, but I would think troubleshooting a video card would be a similar process no matter what the OS."},{"CreatedByName":"s10w10rr1s","CreatedById":107143,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:25:21Z","Content":"bump. still no solution and i am itching to play on linux."}]}
