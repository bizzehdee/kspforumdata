So I can move some stat windows there like mechjeb, final frontier etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody know which line of code to edit or add to the settings.cfg?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"COL.R.Neville","CreatedById":168067,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-08T16:23:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you need 3 monitors to do what you are trying to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you only have two monitors which are 1920x1080 the center of 3840x1080 is right where the bezels meet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
