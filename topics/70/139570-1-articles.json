I really like it and I have high fps when I turn down the render quality, but I keep the texture quality at medium, because having all low graphics settings is just unenjoyable, but thats besides the matter. The game repeatedly\u00A0crashes; it crashes during flight or in the sph\u002Bvab. I have no experience with this sort of stuff, but I have the nudge that it is a memory crash. But it just seems so weird considering I have 8gb of ram, plus 64 bit ksp as of 1.1.\u00A0\u00A0Here\u0027s the player.log and KSP.log\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nplayer.log: \u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzxHcRlvkLMQQ1VKUFM1SW00WkU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzxHcRlvkLMQQ1VKUFM1SW00WkU\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nksp.log: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzxHcRlvkLMQYktydXdkeDJNVjg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzxHcRlvkLMQYktydXdkeDJNVjg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for any responses\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
