Before the 1.03 update I launched the rover to the Mun and it drove alright.\n\nBecause of another mission fail I reverted to an early savegame and had to launch the rover again. But now it is uncontrollable. Its like driving on soap. No steering or mostly it turns in the wrong direction. No braking and so on. It can\u0027t even drive straight when not on 100% flat terrain.\n\nI have other mods installed but no other than the above mentioned is used in the rover build.\n\nI have tried to change steering, brake and motor configuration in different setup, but nothing helps.\n\nWhat is wrong?"},{"CreatedByName":"kludermor","CreatedById":146880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:10:21Z","Content":"Little update after having landed the rover on the Mun again again.\n\nWhen I use Q and E I can make the rover turn. The wheels are not turning, but the rover does turn. Before the update I could use A and D and it was the wheels that made the rover turn.\n\nQ and E turns the rover regardless of stability assist (T) being on or off. I do have reaction wheels mounted near the center of the rover.\n\nWhen I drive the same rover on Kerbin, it is very stable and can turn easy and safe, also at speeds around 15 m/s. Going faster and making tighter turns will flip the rover."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:30:50Z","Content":"Could you upload the savefolder to dropbox please kludermor, and some pics of what\u0027s going on to imgur, it\u0027s really hard to tell what\u0027s going on."},{"CreatedByName":"kludermor","CreatedById":146880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T16:59:27Z","Content":"I found out it was the inline reaction wheels. Turning them off made the rover drive as on Kerbin. Sort of.\n\nMust have turned the reaction wheels off without knowing on my first landing.\n\nThanks for the reply though.\n\nEDIT: Maybe it was a bug. Turning the inline reaction wheels off and on again solved the problem. Now the rover is stable regardless of the state of the reaction wheels.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T19:16:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kludermor**"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxwellsDemon","CreatedById":147660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T17:15:06Z","Content":"I\u0027m having rover issues as well when using the MechJeb2 autopilot. I thought it was perhaps the version of MechJeb, so I made sure to install the latest version, but it doesn\u0027t seem to have fixed the issue.\n\nBasically, my navball shows as if it\u0027s pointed straight up at the sky (no horizon line as I used to have), and no matter if I set waypoints or a fixed heading, the rover just drives around aimlessly. It also does not stick to the requested speed-- not normal small variations, but running at 16 m/s when I\u0027m trying to get it to stick to 10 m/s, and so forth.\n\nI took the rover back into the VAB to ensure that the MechJeb unit is installed pointing the right way (i.e., on the left side of the rover box) and it is. I\u0027m not sure why the autopilot worked at one time and now doesn\u0027t; I haven\u0027t installed any mods (other than the MechJeb update) in the meantime. I\u0027m running mostly vanilla KSP, 1.0.4, but with MechJeb, ScanSat, and Asteroid Day.\n\n(ETA: Spacecraft do not seem to be behaving abnormally, so I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s either the specific rover design or the rover autopilot. I\u0027m going to test a couple of rover designs to see if it makes a difference)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T17:19:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MaxwellsDemon**\n  \nAdditional comment"},{"CreatedByName":"kludermor","CreatedById":146880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T18:01:53Z","Content":"@maxwellsDemon: I don\u0027t think the orientation of the Mechjeb Unit matters.
