A stuck kerbal can also by luck be unstucked by another kerbal grabbing the ladder and going in to and will eject the previous one ending himself free or stuck it depend.\n\nMostly might be related to offset value, collider and *ladders properties* within 3dtools\u0026unity =\u003E may be see if a few adjustements can be made around the ladders grabbing method regarding this kind of colliders conflicts occurences ?)\n\n[Craft file (google drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5JHmZea7s91TnVSemtOSE8xSlE/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T15:51:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 03:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WinkAllKerb\u0027\u0027**"}]}
