Usually this happens when it doesn\u0027t get saved properly (most commonly due to a crash, but even then it tends to be pretty rare). You\u0027ll need to open up your KSP folder and look through the \\Saves directory. Check each save folder (not counting the \\scenarios and \\training folders, naturally) and look at its persistent.sfs file -- the busted save will invariably be the one with the smallest file size. If you open it up, you\u0027ll see a bunch of code which then inexplicably cuts off at a certain point. Once you\u0027ve determined which one is bust, you can either copy in a backup or a quicksave (if you have one) and rename the new one to persistent.sfs, or you can just delete the save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither of those should resolve the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pacemaker00","CreatedById":120299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T05:14:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven when all of the save files are deleted, on a fresh install i have the same issue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Exception]: TypeLoadException: Could not load type \u0027CrewRoster\u0027 from assembly \u0027Assembly-CSharp, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\u0027. it was is showing in the debug\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T05:26:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat exception means you have a mod that does something with individual kerbals that hasn\u0027t been updated for 0.24.
