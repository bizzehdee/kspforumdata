During loading, most times when loading the TextureAssets (14000, if that helps), it gradually starts using more and more ram, until it maxes out my 32gb and hard-crashes. (The Unity-popup with the exclamation mark and the kerbal briefly appears before entirely closing KSP)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know 190 mods are much, but i\u0027ve succesfully run other Instances with more than 200 mods just fine (although with about 15 fps, but you know, they took their 60 mins to load and were fine after that).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any mods known to often cause crashes? I\u0027m gonna attach a mod list and my logs, any help is appreciated \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELogs and Modlist:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y5pzjC9QogbV9usg1IGGWU1UU-yoRB0X?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y5pzjC9QogbV9usg1IGGWU1UU-yoRB0X?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-23T09:07:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2023 09:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 23\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Sonk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EForgot to attach promised files\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbalsaurus","CreatedById":222386,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-25T22:45:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are your specs?
