That said, having spent many hours designing my mach 2 and mach 3 prop planes it makes me sad when\u00A0they\u00A0 no longer can accelerate past 150m/s or so. The same goes for my cannon which now just goes splat when\u00A0 activated.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf anyone knows a fix to make these work in the latest update please let me know
