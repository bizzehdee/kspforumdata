So mods help me out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm posting this because I made a discovery with regards to KSP physics. If I launch an object at ridiculous velocities within the atmosphere, the object will travel a certain distance before it reverses its trajectory and flies back to its starting point, almost as if it bounced off on the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelated mods, BDARMORY, NK dynamics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I normally do when I get bored in KSP, I revert to my go to physics game exercise, launch things at ridiculous velocities and or nuke something.

I put together a quick shell (really a single crew pod), mounted it on top of a nuclear testing tower, and dropped the bomb.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs expected the pod flew upwards at a few thousand m/s, only to slingshot back into the launcher a second later.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure exactly why the atmosphere becomes a rubber band, but I suspect it\u0027s a side effect of an atmospheric drag calculation in the code where the drag becomes high enough to push the pod back to its origin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm going to test later to see if I can bounce pods off of the atmosphere from orbit at high speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I can get around the rubber-air bug, the applications of atomic space guns are very fun, but slamming into the runway to 3k m/s isn\u0027t good for a kerbals health.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-10T14:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223144912\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164268\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221502375272\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177181\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ArmchairPhysicist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, ArmchairPhysicist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I can get around the rubber-air bug, the applications of atomic space guns are very fun, but slamming into the runway to 3k m/s isn\u0027t good for a kerbals health.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOr\u003C/em\u003E, there could be applications if you could\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eharness\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eit rather than get around it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairPhysicist","CreatedById":177181,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-10T14:57:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly no, the oscillation is exactly that, it oscillates.
