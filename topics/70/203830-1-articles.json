I\u0027ve since removed it from my game and I haven\u0027t had the problem occur anymore (I\u0027ve run a few missions since I removed it in my career game and I should of had the problem it at least once by now as it occured frequently enough for me piror). I\u0027ll keep playing and if it does occur again I\u0027ll let you know but it might be worth checking if removing that mod fixes the issue for you. Looks like the mod author is looking into it this too so if it is the cause, it probably won\u0027t be long before it is patched up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni do have better timewarp . will try it out. this would be amazing thx\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dudefan","CreatedById":217321,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-09T22:11:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy testing suggests timewarp is indeed the culprit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sleepy068","CreatedById":183553,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-10T05:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I haven\u0027t had the issue since I\u0027ve removed it.
