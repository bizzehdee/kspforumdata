It shows the parts in-game, but they do nothing. Mod and game are up to date. I tried with other mods as well, but the same thing happened. I used CKAN and didn\u0027t use it. I\u0027m using the steam version, so I don\u0027t know if that is a problem. I also am using the x64 version. Any help?\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T16:40:13Z","Content":"Post your output log file (found in KSP\\_Data).\n\nAlso, [was this you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3eza9v/need_a_little_help_with_mods/) Because that\u0027s Windows and unless you mean the OS is 64bit, there\u0027s currently no official support for KSP x64 on Windows and you\u0027re advised to use the x86 version instead. But, if your OS is x64, that\u0027s fine. I doubt KSP would even run if the OS was x86.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T17:11:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 05:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP**"},{"CreatedByName":"ch3dd4r_ch33z","CreatedById":148988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T01:51:52Z","Content":"Is there any specific part of it that you need?
