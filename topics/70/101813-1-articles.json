I hooked two engines up with two suggested nuclear power plants and built a huge lifter to test. In closed cycle mode at about 75k altitude, heading into orbit, the whole lifter just zoomed out of the camera range and was just a blue speck far in the distance...was this a glitch? I didnt get a chance to do a screenshot. It just accelerated away so fast, it was crazy... Just wondering. I can post some pictures of the lifter when I get home from work\n\nEDIT: I tried many times to get the engines to repeat the strange event, with no luck, I guess it was just a one time thing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T12:24:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 12:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vixr**"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T20:39:47Z","Content":"Not a glitch, unrelated to B9...
