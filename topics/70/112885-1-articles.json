I am going to highlight my main questions to try to understand this and see if there is a workaround.\n\nI have a modded install and running win 7 64 bit, it crashes straight to windows with no messages or anything. It started when I was trying to land on Eve and it would crash within 20km of the surface every time. I only had the mods Kerbal engineer and mechjeb. So I came here posted the logs, etc....and nada, nothing. Just a whole bunch of views no replies (I even tried to reply to add more information and it wouldn\u0027t post it...hmmm). So I went through the posts and saw that 60%-70% of the posts were about the same thing just happening in different points or actions in the game. The common reply was \u0022we can\u0027t help because you didn\u0027t post the correct information\u0022. they would post the correct information and the next reply was either nothing or \u0022you ran out of memory\u0022...then at that point everything gets a bit disorganized in that out of the different posts, people were given slightly different advice depending upon who was answering. As far as I can tell, nobody from Squad has ever answered or given solutions to try. If I am wrong - please link the information.\n\nThe point of this isn\u0027t to whine or cry but to try again to get a solid answer as to what is going on and what to do about it, because KSP is getting unplayable and that makes me sad.\n\nMilestones and Steps taken:\n\n1. Game has been pretty buggy from day one with no mods installed.\n\n2. I installed KE \u0026 MechJeb because, hey, it was already buggy so why not try these?\n\n3. Computer Crash upon trying to land on Eve\n\n4. Posted on Forums - no love...so went looking and searching for help.\n\n5. Discovered CKAN\n\n6. Uninstalled the mods and reinstalled using CKAN, installed [Active Texture Management](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005) in aggressive mode made modules turn black.\n\n7. Was able to land\n\n8. Still random crashes and the further I go or more complex the more it crashes...\n\n9. Why hasn\u0027t Unity 5 been implemented yet?

In heavily modded installs, this eventually causes a crash due to memory usage on Windows. This also occurs on other OS builds, but because they are lucky enough to have 64 bit builds, their memory usage is allowed to grow and does not cause crashes.\n\nThis bug has existed since at least version 0.21, I became very *fond* of it on my stream with KSPI, B9, and KW rocketry, Remote Tech, FAR, and Deadly Reentry with other various mods strewn about.
