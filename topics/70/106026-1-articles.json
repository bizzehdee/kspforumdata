I did reload a quicksave (or two) during the mission, but otherwise it was nothing special. I surely didn\u0027t cancel it, it was just suddenly gone after loading a quicksave.\n\nI even [have a screenshot](http://imgur.com/TA3o8Qc) of me going faster than the required speed, with the goal not completed. The screenshot was taken (relatively deep) in atmo, but I also reached a high enough speed outside / in space. Also note that it\u0027s a prograde orbit, so the displayed \u0022surface\u0022 velocity is lower than the orbial velocity would be.\n\nI had to reload a quicksave, and the contract (or goal) was just gone. I checked mission control, it\u0027s not in the archives (speed records ends at 1050 m/s), it\u0027s not available or active, and when manually checking the savegame files (both various quicksaves and the persistent file) this entry is also nowhere to be found.\n\nSo all in all I\u0027m just mostly confused now. What could\u0027ve possibly happened that vanished this entry? As far as I know you can\u0027t manually cancel them or even fail them. I don\u0027t know how important that goal is, but the larger milestones usually have a significant payout (which I wouldn\u0027t mind)\n\nI do have a couple of mods installed, mostly GUI-stuff or tools though: kerbal engineer, PlaneMode, WaypointManager, Enhanced NavBall, ContractsWindow Plus, Alternate Resource Panel KSP-AVC and Module Manager. Everything is up to date as of noon CEST today."},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:57:31Z","Content":"I sort of replied to this on the Contracts Window \u002B thread:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, playing around with it, I didn\u0027t see anything that would explain the behaviour of the contracts not completing (I assume that has nothing to do with the auto-accept nature). I\u0027m fairly certain that it kicks off based on the various ProgressTracking events, which would either be OnProgressAchieved, OnProgressReached or OnProgressComplete. There would \\*have\\* to be discrete steps at which those fire, maybe the steps for the contracts and progress tracking are out of sync? That\u0027s my best guess....\n\nAnyway, nothing really conclusive - maybe Arsonide will see this and fill us in. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T22:57:03Z","Content":"There is also a mention of this contract not completing in the [thread=117365]hotfix thread[/thread]; it might be necessary to be out of the atmosphere.\n\nI\u0027ve seen the disappearing problem too though, this is the only contract it\u0027s happened to so far."},{"CreatedByName":"Creat","CreatedById":27315,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T13:36:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There is also a mention of this contract not completing in the [thread=117365]hotfix thread[/thread]; it might be necessary to be out of the atmosphere.\n\u003E I\u0027ve seen the disappearing problem too though, this is the only contract it\u0027s happened to so far.\n\nFor at least one of my attempts I was outside of the atmosphere, it still didn\u0027t complete. At the time I wasn\u0027t much over the required speed, but I was over (both for Orbit and for Surface readings). I wasn\u0027t much outside of the atmo either, but still outside (71 km or so). So after that try I basically gave up and reentered (where I took the screenshot), and I went over by a whole lot and it still didn\u0027t complete.\n\nIt was just confusing, but this whole thing makes it much more unlikely that it has anything to do with ContractsWindow\u002B, which is the only mod I use that has anything to do with contracts...

I had the speed record contract for 2500 m/s vanish as well.\n\nI had a rocket go straight up and down, so that it met the three contracts for 70 km altitude, escape the atmosphere and (on the way back down) 1050 m/s speed respectively. After having clicked around the KSC and entered the mission control building I noticed the contract had vanished. Ten new contracts had appeared as available and one of them was a visual survey (don\u0027t know what information will help debug the issue).\n\nI exited KSP, started KSP again, loaded a save from before the rocket launch and did the mission exercise again, so that the three contracts (70km, escape and 1050m/s) completed. This time the 2500 m/s contract stayed. On this occasion \u0027only\u0027 eight new available contracts appeared and not the visual survey one.\n\nIs it possible there is some mix-up in the random contract generation that can make the world record contract disappear?"}]}
