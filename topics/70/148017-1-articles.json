It is literally impossible to play the game like this, because finding the parts i want is now a struggle. I only want the 7 default categories.\u00A0Here\u0027s a screenshot showing what I mean;struggle. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022K9XDbbd.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K9XDbbd.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0PLS HELP\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-18T17:19:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi those categories are created via the mods plugin code and unless you uninstall the mod I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible to remove them.

I don\u0027t think those words mean what you think they mean...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is actually considered good practice among modders to make a custom category for their modded parts, so players can easily see all the new parts added by a mod without having to scroll through the (potentially super-crowded) standard categories. However: part of this good practice is that parts are supposed to appear both in the custom category, \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E in one of the standards. An engine should always show up under Propulsion, even if there\u0027s an extra category for everything added by SuperEngineMod2000. Do you actually have parts that \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E show up inside custom categories, and don\u0027t also appear in one of the eight stock ones?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that is the case, you have some work to do, because you need to change (or patch) the config file of every single part that doesn\u0027t show up in a standard category before you can remove the custom categories. (I mean sure, you \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E remove them first, but then you\u0027d lose access to those parts completely...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-19T07:50:58Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2016 07:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gruff46","CreatedById":168915,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-19T14:17:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWoo!
