Hopefully someone here knows what the issue is, but thanks for reading either way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem: I can not exit either the VAB or the Admin building in my primary game. Once I enter them it is impossible to use the exit button to click out. The other buildings are not affected. The problem does not occur in a newly created game. The problem occurred first building a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of my last check, I was able to enter and leave the astronaut complex. But after doing this I was unable to enter any building from the space center view. The escape key no longer brings up the menu and the sound from the astronauts playing pool continues to play over the space center view. Some other game functions are available (debug screen).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame exits immediately when the window kill button (X) is pressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP build id = 00705 2014-12-15_13-42-05 Branch: master\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edownloaded via steam\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emods prior to problem: Kerbal Engineer and Jebmech.

Since it isn\u0027t a 64-bit question and \u0022The problem does not occur in a newly created game\u0022 I\u0027d have to think it was a memory issue, but you say you have 8GB so KSP \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E have more than it can use. Before starting KSP, what amount of that is free? Having looked at the log file (^^ shoot first, aim later) all the end reports are bit miffed about your 560, which is a pretty old graphics card. On the other hand - KSP ran fairly well on the (really old) 8300 card that I had, until it cooked it, so I\u0027d be surprised if it\u0027s a hardware incompatibility issue and there\u0027s nothing else to indicate that your system is incompatible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFWIW, I think you\u0027re getting serious memory-leaks from Unity scene changes and might - but probably don\u0027t - have a \u0027bad install\u0027 (general IT advice along the lines of; \u0027unplug it and plug it in again\u0027).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[This, possibly very embarassing, post courtesy of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105607-cool-game?p=1641828#post1641828\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpecialist290\u003C/a\u003E]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mundiver","CreatedById":133921,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T17:21:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys.
