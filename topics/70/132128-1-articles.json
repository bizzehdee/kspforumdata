To start with this should probably be somewhere else but I don\u0027t know where that is. Also I cant figure out how to make a picture visible without having to follow a link. But any way the help I need is this. I got on today to continue dominating the mun for a YouTube series (the challenge is the Munar crusade in the challenges section) but I was confronted with this (see link). After re loading and re booting several times it is still the same. And when I go to the main menu (esc is the only key that does anything) nothing is clickable. If it helps you help me at all the things I was doing last before this save went bottoms up is trying to undock some rescue rockets from my mun station and for some reason every time i tried this they went beserk and exploded. I may have a clip of this if anyone wants to see it. Thats pretty much it, if this belongs somewhere else then please move it. sorry as you can tell by my 40ish posts i dont have a whole lot of experience with the forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/z4RXCnM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewhat the screen looks like\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-15T01:39:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2016 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jhawk1099\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ethe link was being iffy\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wibou7","CreatedById":155221,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T02:19:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get this if I click out of the KSP window while it is loading.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy guess is that squad generates mouse displacement or click to recenter the camera on the KSC, if the window does not have focus, it fails.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSooo...first make sure the KSP window has focus the complete time it is loading.
