If this happens while they\u0027re still on the plane/ship, the game will sometimes crash when I press a key to have them stand up. If they manage to stand, while on the plane they bounce constantly as if they\u0027re jumping while on Eve. \n\nI\u0027m running a few mods which I installed using CKAN, but I didn\u0027t notice this happening until after a long Mun mission, and after several mods had been updated (I\u0027m not sure which ones).\n\nI tried unloading all mods then reinstalling them one by one, and thought I\u0027d narrowed it down to Pilot Assistant, but the bug came back later on, and I can\u0027t isolate it to any one mod. \n\nThe list of mods I\u0027m using is below. All are up to date with the latest versions from CKAN.

Will edit if I find anything. It is no feature as I do not have KAS or KIS.\n\nEDIT: After some process of elimination I think the culprit is Pilot Assistant. I removed it for the time being and am now issue free, walking on top my planes like it ain\u0027t no thang. I don\u0027t mind holding off until the next PA release given some other issues, like not being able to edit the heading value.

They still have the \u0022bouncing on plane wings\u0022 thing going on but I love Pilot Assistant too much to get rid of it. I\u0027m hoping for a fix, and PA gets updated pretty often, so I\u0027ll post a note on their forum page to alert them to the issue.\n\nPS -- to edit the heading in PA select the course header (to turn it red (brown?)), then type the new heading in the heading field (left of the green heading difference field), then click on the course button (left of the heading field). My planes usually start turning to the new heading. This saves me lots of time and effort on those \u0022fly to a waypoint\u0022 contracts. Hope that helps. \n\nOh, and I clicked the \u0027Add to Rep\u0027 button for both of you.
