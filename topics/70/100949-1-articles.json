It has MechJeb, OuterPlanets Mod, and Distant Object Enhancement. \n\nEverytime I do something major and return to the Space Center, the game is either a weird blue ball (I\u0027ve seen this happen to someone in a video) or completely black other than the top menus. I restart the game and its fine but it is really annoying. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nI think if I do Space Center through the upper menu its black and through the ESC menu its blue. When I load another saved game it works fine but I have to restart to fix the main game.\n\nAny advice?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-28T17:17:20Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2015 05:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by whiterafter**"},{"CreatedByName":"whiterafter","CreatedById":66064,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T22:03:44Z","Content":"Can someone please help ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceExplorer","CreatedById":138160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T00:23:06Z","Content":"I have three suggestions:\n\n1. If you are running the x64 bit version, don\u0027t. Stick to x32 bit.\n2. Remove your mods, and try booting up KSP again, it may be a mod conflict which is causing this issue.\n3. Re-install KSP (most likely this will solve your problem).\n\nI hope this helps! This type of Kraken is the worst, and it sucks that you have had to encounter this..."}]}
