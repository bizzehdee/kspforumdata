In the GameData folder you will find some mechJeb cache files. delete them... you will lose window positions and such, but should correct the issue.\n\nEdit. maybe I\u0027m out to lunch.. I do remember cache files, but I just looked at my install and don\u0027t see them.. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) The ones I see are Module manager related...\n\nWhen you reverted, did you delete the MJ2 folder completely before installing the older version? \n\n If not then could be this file: GameData\\MechJeb2\\Plugins\\PluginData\\MechJeb2\\mechjeb\\_settings\\_global.cfg. Delete it. MechJeb will automatically rebuild it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T19:43:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 07:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Loup","CreatedById":144301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T22:09:21Z","Content":"I dont think its a bug since i already had the Ascent Guidance and such other unlocked Mechjeb modules with b4 last version.\n\nNow with 1.0.2 one i dont own it anymore (Ascent guidance and others), but can see it further in the tech tree."},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T23:03:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I dont think its a bug since i already had the Ascent Guidance and such other unlocked Mechjeb modules with b4 last version.\n\u003E Now with 1.0.2 one i dont own it anymore (Ascent guidance and others), but can see it further in the tech tree.\n\nAh... career game... my apologies...
