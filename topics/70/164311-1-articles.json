You have a physic range of 2,5km I believe. Every (active) object that gets out of that range and is on a crash trajectory with the planet. Will eventually disappear when hitting the ground. This is because KSP won\u0027t calculate any physics beyond this range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are several mods to counter this.
