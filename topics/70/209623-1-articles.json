When i reached the SpaceDock site it said that Interstellar Extended was compatible with 1.12.2 however when i installed it says that some mods were outdated. Does Interstellar extended work in 1.12.2 and if yes is there a download with updated mods or do i have to manually update all outdated ones?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superluminal Gremlin","CreatedById":221533,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-05T02:39:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.12.3 i believe was a bug patch and graphics update.
