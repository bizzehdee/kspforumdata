I had not counted them but my game took 15 minutes to start( and it was installed on an SSD). But yesterday, i just wanted to explode some rockets, sorry, of Course i wanted to send Kerbals into space hehe. So i deleted all my mods( i cried while doing so) and updated the game to 1.3. Then i went to Curse.com and downloaded some Basic mods( to be exact: Mechjeb, RealScaleBoosters, FuelTanksPlus, KerbalReusabilityExpansion, MOLE, SpaceY-Lifters, SpaceY-Expanded, NearFutureSolar, NearFuturePropulsion, NearFutureConstruction).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ENow to my Problem:\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShortly after starting a completely new carrer game my KSP just freezed.
