I recently installed OPT and the game was working fine, I then realized I had no display in the cockpit without RasterProp so i manually installed that since it is no longer available in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E. I then tried launching a spaceplane to orbit and the game crashed when i reached about 10,000m. I uninstalled RPM and the game still crashes around the same altitude, I have only tried launching spaceplanes with OPT parts. Have not tried with regular stock parts to see if it still crashes. I will upload the Crash reports when i get home from when RPM was installed and when it was uninstalled. I would really like to solve the issue rather than doing a clean install of KSP and all mods. I could live without OPT as i have had a lot of trouble getting these parts to orbit anyway.
