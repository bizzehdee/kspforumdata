Saying that I have found a few mods I love but some of them don\u0027t work right. I\u0027ve installed the right, the parts show up, but the action buttons that are supposed to come up when you right click just don\u0027t show up. I\u0027m using the latest version of KSP on Steam, but I have tried to use older versions\u00A0\u00A03.1, 3.3, 4.2, 4.3, and still nothing! I\u0027m using the construction mod from Magic smoke industries, the FTL mod, and the near future construction mods. I\u0027ve looked in the forums and tried to install them again and again. This is my last stop for any help.
