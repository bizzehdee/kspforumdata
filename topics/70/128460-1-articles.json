Even the simplest crafts yield low fps rates. Then I noticed, that I can provoke this by rotating the camera continously. I made a screenshot of the debug window:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vgRejUy.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vgRejUy.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust when the graph drops, I started rotating the camera by holding the arrow key.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is the latest steam version, x64, running on a intel i5, nvidia 760 GTX, 16GB Ram, Linux Mint 17.2 Cinnemon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstalled mods: Mechjeb, Kerbal Alarm Clock, New Horizons (and Kopernicus), ScanSat, TAC Fuel Balancer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also just noticed, that it may have started after upgrading the tracking station ... and I saw that if I show unknown objets I get a couple of hundret objects. Now, in normal gameplay they are apparently not shown, but maybe their position is still calculated when the camera looks at them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny other ideas?

It turned out that indeed the 971 asteroids were a huge impact on performance.

Afterall it is not fixed. Yes, the drop in Performance comes from the large number of asteroids. But I just saw, while have time warp in the tracking station, that there are continously new asteroids beeing created. I already have 134 asteroids back... at this rate, the performance will drop again. Where is this coming from????\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
