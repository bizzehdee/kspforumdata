It was working when I launched it into orbit yesterday. But, after loading into my savegame today, everytime when I try to do a rightclick on the part nothing would happen. I also can\u0027t rightclick any other parts of the Vessel after rightclicking the lab. Furthermore I did put 4 Kerbals into this part, wich were also showing up just fine after the launch.
