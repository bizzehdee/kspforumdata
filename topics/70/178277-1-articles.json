Yesterday\u00A0I noticed I was being offered contracts, but I couldn\u0027t accept any new ones. It finally dawned on me that\u00A0my reputation was in the toilet at -94% which was severely limiting the number of contracts I could have concurrently and I had more active contracts than the limit.\u00A0Looking through old saves on the system I found that it changed from \u002B72% to -94% during a 5 hour period (game time) between two of my\u00A0saves from\u00A0Monday\u00A0night.\u00A0No logs exist because like I say, I didn\u0027t notice the problem for a couple days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI rarely pay attention to reputation.\u00A0I just avoid killing Kerbals and failing\u00A0or cancelling contracts if I can help it. This save does have a dead Kerbal (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/127423-what-is-the-most-horrible-way-one-of-your-kerbals-died/\u0026amp;page=13\u0026amp;tab=comments#comment-3427983\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ERIP Sanbree\u003C/a\u003E), 2\u00A0or 3 failed contracts and at least one cancellation, but none in the last couple of weeks.\u00A0I can\u0027t think of anything out of the ordinary that might have happened in the game during the time period where the reputation tanked.\u00A0I may have turned down a couple contracts, but that isn\u0027t unusual for me and I haven\u0027t changed my strategies in weeks. But they are set to the options that trade away reputation. Other than\u00A0updates I haven\u0027t changed my mods for this save for a couple weeks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may have used the ALT-F12 menu to delete the list of completed contracts. I flushed the archive sometime recently,\u00A0I just don\u0027t remember exactly when and haven\u0027t spent the time to compare saves. I\u0027ve done this several times in the past and thought it was just a housekeeping shortcut to clear the archive of completed contracts.\u00A0 Does the game need the archive of completed contracts for anything? I\u0027d prefer completed contracts disappear after about a week. The only time I look at it is when a contract completes unexpectedly and I only notice because it\u0027s no longer in the list of active contracts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no problem taking a hit to the reputation for things that I know I did (or failed to do), but something like this where the reputation seemed to flip-flop for no reason\u00A0seems like a bug. I ended up treating it as a one time fluke and just edited\u00A0my save to put the reputation back to where it was before the crash. It would be nice to know what could have changed my reputation so radically to avoid it in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-16T10:36:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe quick save is to use the ALT F12 menu to add repotation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*starts imagining the 16 bit to 64\u00A0bit transfer code on the ariane v*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
