I guessed this might be caused by mods, so I played on an unmodded install and lo and behold, barely any\u00A0stutter whatsoever. So I began to reinstall my mods one by one, trying to find if it was some specific mod that\u0027s causing the stutter, and so far I found that it was the contract packs that caused the stutters (I mentioned so far because I\u0027ve installed like, a hundred mods, and haven\u0027t gotten to test them all). While waiting for me to find\u00A0if there\u0027s another mod that cause\u00A0the stutters, maybe someone could share some light as to why\u00A0contract packs would\u00A0cause stutters? And maybe other mods that cause stutters as well?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ratchet freak","CreatedById":119895,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T11:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can instead of going 1 by 1 is split the stuttering pack in half and check each half-pack for stutter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you can split the stuttering half-pack and repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speadge","CreatedById":145302,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T14:48:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmight not be the fault of a mod\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/129562-its-been-6-months-since-i-asked-about-the-stutter/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/129562-its-been-6-months-since-i-asked-about-the-stutter/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T18:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me save you the pain and time of going through the process of trying to find the cause of the stutter. \u00A0I\u0027ve wasted literally days\u00A0trying to find which mod was the cause\u00A0and you\u0027ll think you\u0027ve managed to get rid of it and then a little while later find that it\u0027s crept back in again. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stutter will happen in a pure stock game, and while some mods may emphasise it, the main factor seems to be the number of craft you have in flight. \u00A0With around 30 objects (craft, debris, flags) the stutter is apparent even when flying a very low part craft (can even be observed when looking at space center view and panning the camera about). \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis issue has become a little heated and some of us regard it as a major problem, but the best we can do at present is wait and hope that 1.1 improves it (although given what is believed to be the cause, the garbage collector, we don\u0027t expect 1.1 to actually \u003Cem\u003Efix \u003C/em\u003Ethe issue, but other performance improvements may alleviate it somewhat).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a couple other threads in addition to the one \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145302-speadge/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022145302\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145302-speadge/\u0022\u003E@Speadge\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0posted\u00A0that collect some of the thinking (and frustration) regarding this;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/95993-slight-freeze-every-5-seconds-or-so/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/116463-serious-answer-to-the-stutter-issue/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Algiark","CreatedById":83907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T12:20:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid any of you\u00A0read what I wrote?
