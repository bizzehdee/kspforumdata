The rocket was a bit over-the-top, but overall managed to do it just fine. At least into solar orbit. The rocket then just simply disassembled itself and exploded, killing the three Kerbals boarded in it. When I went into the map screen, it told me that the vessel was on the Launch Pad:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aKphuol.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aKphuol.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, I had been Krakened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had an earlier quicksave, but upon loading it, the LaunchPad Kraken would just strike me again once physics kicked in. Thankfully, I was able to acess the menu before that, and I could easily go back into KSC. From the safety of the Tracking Station, I could simply select the vessel and even time warp ahead, and it would continue its\u0027 trajectory safely, but if I control it, then LaunchPad Kraken immediatly attacks it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, not all work is lost, as I have a backup quicksave from in case the Duna trip went wrong(I always do this when I do career-mode explorations), but still, I am pretty bummed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMOD LIST:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Toolbar(stable, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Load on Demand(stable, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Active Texture Management(stable, old, outdated)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Crew Manifest(stable, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbal Engineer Redux(stable, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Real Roster(not working, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-FinePrint(stable, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Image Viewer(unknown, new)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbal Joint Reinforcement(stable, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-HyperEdit(stable, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-KPseudonym(stable, new)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-NavBall Docking Aligment Indicator(never used, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-PreciseNode(stable, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-RealChute(stable, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Stock Scaling Bug Fix(unknown, new)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Texture Replacer(stable, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Time Control(stable, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Trajectories(stable, old)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbal Alarm Clock(stable, old)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-14T19:48:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2014 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Commissioner Tadpole\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stickyhammy","CreatedById":110509,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T23:28:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have had stations do that, and rockets with probes on it that break apart as soon as they reach space.

Long and spindly sections with lots of mass on the end tend to cause problems particularly if the controll is out on one end. if the ship is floppy just a little bit of wobble can amplify as the SAS tries to correct it. You still need enough struts to keep things somewhat ridged on larger craft, theres just many more situations where you can get by without now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also had a few bugs (normaly mod related) where some part just decides it does not want to go beyond a particular speed or altitude. Once the part hits that limit it just decides its going to stop in place and pout reguardless of what the rest of the ship is doing. Unplaned dissasimbly follows as the rest of the parts keep going at orbital velocity and shatter on the imovable part. Strangely the game often reports this as impacting the launchpad of all things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T18:09:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have had this happen with a probe in a mid-to-high Kerbin Orbit.
