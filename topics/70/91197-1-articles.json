You also need to stop using MechJeb (unless you really tweak the gravity turn profile), because MechJeb is tailored to stock aero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1 of ascent: Make sure you have fins to drag center of lift/center of pressure behind center of mass. Also, aim for a launch TWR of 1.2-1.6. Also, in general, wobbly payloads and long fairings are bad news. Strut it up, try to make it wider, and if you must have a long vehicle, consider assembling in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2 of ascent: At around 60-100 m/s, turn about 2-5 degrees in the direction you want to turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3 of ascent: Wait for prograde marker to catch up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 4 of ascent: Look Ma, no hands!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 5 of ascent: Once past 20-25 km, you can start to have your own ideas about where to point the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing about FAR is that, if you do not deviate far from prograde, you benefit from aerodynamic stability: if Center of Lift is properly behind CoM, aerodynamic forces will try to keep your rocket pointed in the direction of travel. If you deviate too far, you will start to flip over. This is most noticeable in the 10-20 km range, where you\u0027ve built up a lot of speed but still haven\u0027t gotten through the thickest of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T03:13:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStarman4308 is dead on, but another problem you are having is your cargo is long and not strutted to the fairing, causing it to wobble out and then affect aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T04:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have to agree with Alshain and Starman.
