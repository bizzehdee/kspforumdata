I get lag (yellow mission clock) at anywhere between 300 and 1000 parts, depending upon what those parts are.

I see a lot of complaints that games are not optimized well simply because they do not use all of the cores on the processor, but this is almost always due to a lack of understanding on the part of the user as to how a modern computer works and what the limitations are. The extra cores are there in case they are needed, they are not full processors. The only reason you have 4 cores is that it takes very little die space to do that compared to extra cache memory, but the vast majority of the time they are expected to be idle, even if your processor is maxed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing about the multiple cores your processor has is that they all share cache and memory, and very few programs are actually limited by the number of calculations your CPU can do. It is *far* more common for a task to be limited by either the amount of data which can be transferred from memory, or the latency of those requests (which can sometimes be hidden by clever programming tricks.) Multithreading a program which is limited by memory almost always gives you worse performance, and removes the ability to use certain very important optimizations (those threads compete for the same resources, and knowing what a thread is up to in relation to other threads requires very expensive synchronization commands.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually produce a program which has a multithreaded version which is not something we just distribute. You can get it by contacting support, but they have been instructed to ask if the computer it will run on is multi-processor, or multi-core. It works well if you truly have multiple processors, but running the multithread version on a single processor which has multiple cores results in much worse performance as the threads compete for cache space and memory transfer (8x - 50x slower.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may think it should not be worse regardless when the task is split across two threads, but a cache miss leads to an extra transfer from memory. If you have two similar tasks competing for cache space and memory access, the extra cache misses make extra memory requests, which delay all other memory requests. This leads to a far worse than linear performance degradation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my case, very intense complaints by a specific important client who was annoyed that it did not use \u0022all of their processor\u0022 led to a version of the program which maxes out all cores. It does this by querying the processor for how many cores it has, and starting up enough threads to fill it. The trick is that only one thread processes relevant information, the rest add 1 to a register in an infinite loop (which took a little effort, as the compiler really wanted to optimize it out). This results in about a 5% speedup overall, as it prevents other programs from running well (I also set the priority pretty high, so it stops almost anything else from getting CPU time). Be careful of what you wish for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP may or may not benefit from multithreading, but the assumption that is it poor optimization is not necessarily correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-27T23:23:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2015 11:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cerberusti\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T23:30:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cerberusti\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cerberusti\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn my case, very intense complaints by a specific important client who was annoyed that it did not use \u0022all of their processor\u0022 led to a version of the program which maxes out all cores.
