Lots of mods so don\u0027t make me go through all of them to test one by one...\n\nI\u0027m running this version since my modset is not compatible with 1.0.4, so it would be best if I don\u0027t have to update my KSP install in order to fix these issues.\n\nFor the first problem, I\u0027ve dug through my output\\_log file and found this entry being spammed. I think it\u0027s something related but I couldn\u0027t figure out where this .Part.temperature file was supposed to be in. So I\u0027d like to get some advice on what this might be and where I\u0027m supposed to have this file in.\n\n    (Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 56)MissingFieldException: Field \u0027.Part.temperature\u0027 not found.  at JSI.RasterPropMonitorComputer.UpdateCheck () [0x00000] in :0   at JSI.RasterPropMonitorComputer.OnUpdate () [0x00000] in :0   at Part.ModulesOnUpdate () [0x00000] in :0   at Part.Update () [0x00000] in :0 \n\nI also had this spammed too but I don\u0027t know what this is causing. Anyone have an idea?\n\n    (Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 56)MissingFieldException: Field \u0027.CelestialBody.maxAtmosphereAltitude\u0027 not found.  at JSI.RasterPropMonitorComputer.OnUpdate () [0x00000] in :0   at Part.ModulesOnUpdate () [0x00000] in :0   at Part.Update () [0x00000] in :0 \n\nAnd on to my second problem, I\u0027ve found this in the output\\_log file which seemed related to the issue.\n\nI\u0027ve only recently started getting this issue and was fine before so I don\u0027t see whats wrong here. If anyone has an idea on what might be causing this, it would be very nice.\n\nOnly my engine sounds don\u0027t play, and all the other sounds play just like normal. So I\u0027m really confused on whats going on.\n\n    (Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 56)Cannot assign AudioClip \u0027KWRocketry/Soundbank/sound_spsloop\u0027 to AudioFX\n\nI\u0027ll leave my complete modset list below for reference.\n\nMODS:\n\nActive Texture Management (Agressive)\n\nAstronomer\u0027s Visual Pack\n\nAuto Pruner (pruned KW Tank/Fairing/SRB, Stock Tank/Fairing/Heat Shield, KOSMOS SSPP, RO Global Tank, RS Capsuledyne Tank)\n\n --Original Prune list: KOSMOS\\_SSPP\\_ebigunso, KW\\_SRB\\_ebigunso, RSCapsuledyne\\_Tank\\_ebigunso, Stock\\_Fairings\\_ebigunso, Stock\\_HeatShield\\_ebigunso, Renewed Stock Tanks list/RO Global Tanks list/Stock Wings list(incomplete)\n\nB9 Aerospace (Infodrive only/adjusted mass to 0.01)\n\nBoxSat\n\nCloud configurations for OPM (EVE)\n\nCrowd Sourced Science\n\nConnected Living Space (/w TaurusHCV config)\n\nContract Window\u002B\n\nDeadly Reentry\n\nDefault Throttle\n\nDistant Object Enhancement bis\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator\n\nEditor Extensions\n\nEngine Ignitor (0.90 patched)\n\nEnhanced Navball\n\nEnvironmental Visual Enhancements\n\nFASA Launch Towers\n\nFerram Aerospace Resarch\n\nFinal Frontier\n\nFlight Manager for Reuseable Stages\n\nInfernal Robotics\n\nK2 Command Pod\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\nKerbal Attachment System\n\nKerbal Construction Time\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux\n\nKerbal Inventory System\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement\n\nkOS\n\nKOSMOS SSPP\n\nKSP TOT\n\nKW Rocketry\n\nNear Future Technologies (Propultion, Electirc, Solar)\n\nOuter Planets Mod\n\nPortrait Stats\n\nPrecise Node\n\nProcedural Fairings\n\nProcedural Parts\n\nReal Chute\n\nReal Fuels (/w Stock alike engine config)\n\nRemote Tech\n\nSCANsat\n\nShip Manifest\n\nSimple Orbit Calculator\n\nStock Bug Fix\n\nTAC Fuel Balancer\n\nTAC Life Support\n\nTaurus HCV\n\nTemperature Guage Killer\n\nTexture Replacer (/w Rareden\u0027s Real 8k Skybox)\n\nToolbar\n\nTrajectories\n\nTransfer Window Planner\n\nTweak Scale\n\nUSI Kolonization Systems"}]}
