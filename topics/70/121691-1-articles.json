A \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E weird one, so I am looking for pointers. See, some of you might have seen this pic I posted yesterday of me, moving a big potato with lots of patience:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tbFjIFM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tbFjIFM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it all went well, until about when I crossed Mun\u0027s orbit: the [censored] won\u0027t keep thrusting! I mean, I get the engine effects, I get the consumable drain, I get the torque, all indicators including KER show thrust... (yeah, I know, technically non-stock, but please tell me how that mod can mess with the orbital physics). And yet, the freaking maneuver node shows no change in velocity happening. It seems as if the acceleration was too low to register, or something. So I started experimenting, and ended up redoing the whole capture burn again from periapsis... same thing happened, suddenly I couldn\u0027t move the maneuver any further and the dV readout \u0022froze\u0022. Interestingly enough, at high levels of phsyical timewarp, the thing seems to accelerate, but the whole thing becomes so wonky it\u0027s difficult to say whether it is the usual wonky orbits of oscillating vehicles due to CoM changes, or actual sustained thrust, before you start spinning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E thing I can think of, is that this is somehow related to the coordinate system, where I have crossed some boundary where my coordinate changes between timesteps is just the right amount for my acceleration to be ignored as an error or rounded out or something. Because you see, as soon as I let it escape into solar orbit, I again can see progress in the maneuver burns. And when I was thrusting close to periapsis, the same thing. The dev console shows no weird stuff happening (or no weirder than usual). I\u0027m at my wit\u0027s end, and I might just lose 10\u002B hours of gameplay spent in building and flying this mission. So I need your help smart guys! You can take a stab at replicating by loading this savefile, you don\u0027t really need any mods since this ship has no modded parts, just a bunch of vessels will puff out of existence when you load. It\u0027s a quicksave, and excuse my colorful language when naming bug-hunting saves:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/485pcw7zfkvkmz1/....sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/485pcw7zfkvkmz1/....sfs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s set up so you just have to load it from the quicksave menu, and start thrusting and see if that maneuver node goes down. Acceleration \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be visible in a short time, I was making 0.015m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E without issues even with the nuke throttled down to keep up with the refinery output, and that is 0.1 m/s in less than ten seconds, so you will know quickly if things go as wrong as they go for me, every time. Even if you just tell me that maneuver node goes down for you, it would still be a great help, means there is something wrong on my end and I can stop throwing swear words at the game and direct them at myself instead. Thanks for your time in any case!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. Honestly, I am this close to calling \u0022bugs\u0022 and installing hyperedit for the first time in three years.
