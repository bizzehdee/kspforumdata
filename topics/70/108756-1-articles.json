But i can see all the hud but not the ship and launchpad etc.\n\nKJR is not the cause as it worked perfectly till now it is just the time when the scripts load i guess.\n\nIn the log i also do not get imidiate erros about the flight scene, just this:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [LOG 14:43:24.588] Look rotation viewing vector is zero.\n\nCould this cause this ? \n\nAlso when i the go back to the Space center, then the orbit skybox loads and i se the sky and the hud.\n\nLog is here: [http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=05263130485845876732](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=05263130485845876732)\n\nHere are two pics: [https://imgur.com/QLfr4uR](https://imgur.com/QLfr4uR) [https://imgur.com/AhF0B9j](https://imgur.com/AhF0B9j)\n\nThis also happens on a new game!\n\nThanks for giving me a clue, i got no idea.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T13:22:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 01:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ManuxKerb**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T14:01:16Z","Content":"That sounds like the hell kraken bug or something similar. In my exerience, that type of thing is often caused by incompatible, conflicting and/or broken plugins. It can also happen when you have a lot of kerbals on EVA close together. Do you have any pre-1.0 or experimental versions of mods, any mods which are likely to conflict, or a gathering of kerbals near KSC?"},{"CreatedByName":"ManuxKerb","CreatedById":139441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T21:05:07Z","Content":"Hi\n\nAfer some researching yes it is definitly the hell kraken!\n\nIt could be the plugins, but i removed all the ones i added before the last start.
