It\u0027s like a mouse click triggers ALT-F4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLog.txt: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://mega.nz/file/nQAxSSbC#JCDFdbvp2GD7gy1RzT6oMQmKp2EHPMJJJlC9T7DqO0c\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://mega.nz/file/nQAxSSbC#JCDFdbvp2GD7gy1RzT6oMQmKp2EHPMJJJlC9T7DqO0c\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods list: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/W5Ah0VD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/W5Ah0VD\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll mods are latest as hosted on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, and I checked each one that wasn\u0027t updated for 1.11 and they are supposedly compatible. I went through and uninstalled some mods that I thought would be causing the issue, such as ClickThroughBlocker, but no luck.
