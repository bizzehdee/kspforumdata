I\u0027m playing on 1.12.5, I installed mechjeb through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, it automatically installed something called module manager. After I launched the game I noticed each rocket had mechjebs menu enabled, without the mechjeb module on the rocket... So I did some experimenting, when I removed the module manager 4.1.4 DLL, mechjeb functions properly and only works with the mechjeb module on the rocket now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat\u0027s going on?
