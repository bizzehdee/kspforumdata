If it\u0027s not on then probes won\u0027t show up on the map. That seems the most likely explanation given that your third sentence indicates that the probe hasn\u0027t really gone away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jok178","CreatedById":172410,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-11T06:27:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts not that, I just checked again.
