I made a backup first, then deleted everything in gamedata other than the squad folder, and also deleted some other files involving my mods that were stored elsewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthen, after i updated my game, i launched KSP and the flavor text above the loading bar was replaced by somthing saying \u0022#autoLOC_[some numbers].\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nobviously, the part in brackets was actual numbers, not just that....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanyway, the same text appeared basically everywhere. tooltips, flavor text, names of parts, descriptions, even the options on the main menu and my save files all had the \u0022#autoLOC_*********\u0022 thing instead of normal text. They all had different numbers at the end, BTW\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni also tried restoring my backup, hoping it would go back to normal, but it changed nothing. I\u0027ve even changed to a new PC since then, and the same thing occurs, strangely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni still have this problem, and it has not changed since then.\u00A0 has anyone else had this problem? do you know how to fix it? I\u0027ve had this once before, but i don\u0027t remember how i fixed it, unfortunately.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease help me, if you have ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-25T22:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a pretty rare issue and while it is obviously the dictionary which is messed up or even missing, the actual culprit of the issue is still unknown, at least as far as I know. Maybe you are lucky and it is just caused by your update method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, please open \u0022GameData/Squad/Localization\u0022 and check if there is a \u0022dictionary.cfg\u0022 and if the file exists, open it in a texteditor. It should contain all the \u0022autoLOC_xxxxxx\u0022 codes and associated texts for these codes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI assume, the file will be missing. If you got the game on steam and the game files are actually still located in your steam install directory, you can try to verify the file integrity. Right click on the game in the steam library -\u0026gt; properties -\u0026gt; local files -\u0026gt; verify integrity of game files. This will cause steam to replace every missing file, incl. the dictionary. Now repeat the first step to verify, the \u0022dictionary.cfg\u0022 actually got repaired/replaced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch the game at least twice and see if this already fixed your issue.

If moving the game files doesn\u0027t fix it, it is something else on your machine which messes around with your game files. Of course, any Anti-Vir program would be my next guess but a) these programs usually notify you as soon as they find something which seem to be suspicious and b) deactivating didn\u0027t help in previous cases. \u003Cspan\u003EOf course, you can try it anyway.\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe even tried to monitor the file and which programs access or modify it but without any useful results \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EOh btw.: If you got the game on any other platform than steam (or if everything else already failed), I would always suggest to do a clean reinstall, which includes manually deleting every game file so you can be sure, everything is installed properly.
