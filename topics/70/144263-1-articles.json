I think I first noticed this before I installed most of my mods; I don\u0027t think the mods are relevant but I\u0027ve noticed two other people report this issue so I\u0027m going to see if I can get them to contribute to this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T14:07:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy issue may or may not be relevant.

Each of our crafts contain landing legs, wheels, and docking ports. I am forcing the bouncing by manipulating the landing legs. In your case, it looks like before the physics loads, the craft is resting on the wheels. When physics kick in, the legs extend and the craft bounces. (Keep in mind, that before I edited the config file to change impactTolerance from 150 to 300, I wasn\u0027t seeing the bouncing, but rather the legs were exploding.) I believe that the problem can be alleviated with some more config file adjustments, it\u0027s just that I don\u0027t have, and frankly don\u0027t want to spend, the time to \u0022trial and error\u0022 the problem away.
