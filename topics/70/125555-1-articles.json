I can change the camera angle with right-drag, but I cannot upgrade buildings or create maneuver nodes (I have a fully upgraded tracking station). The only way I have found to fix the problem is to restart the game. I looked around these forums but did not see any recent threads on this. There are a few in the Steam forums as recent as October but none that have a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T19:01:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138802-Kerbal-Space-Program-1-0-5-New-Issues-Repository#tricky_nodes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline\u0022\u003EThis may help with the nodes\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, if it\u0027s the issue I think it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t a clue about the buildings, sorry, try opening the debug log (alt\u002BF2) when clicking them, look for errors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Netskimmer","CreatedById":144822,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T19:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t see anything in the debug log.

The craft I was having the initial problem with was a probe as well, though I found the problem persisted with manned craft also. I was launching a ship with a probe core attached to a command pod for a rescue contract. Spent several hours in the game yesterday night and this morning before work and everything seems to be functioning normally. Hoping Kerbal Engineer gets updated before I get into the really complicated builds on this playthrough. Doing all the calculations manually on these simpler craft isn\u0026#39;t too bad, but the more complex ones...\n"}]}
