You have ModuleResourceIntake defined twice, and in the Spaceplane Hangar the engine has \u0022Close Intake\u0022 listed twice. I also can\u0027t seem to open either intake on the runway, so they stay closed at all times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust comparing this engine to the other engine with an integrated intake, the Goliath, I tried copying some of the Goliath\u0027s properties to this thing. For instance, apparently ModuleResourceIntake needs to be first before any other module is added. But that alone didn\u0027t fix things; it still came up as Closed. Maybe try enabling surface attachment for this engine to see if exposing the front of it lets it work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never tried adding an intake module to a non-intake part before. Not sure what other requirements there are. But that\u0027s all I can try for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
