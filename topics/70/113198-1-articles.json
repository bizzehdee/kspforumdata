I have one engine marked as \u0022experimental\u0022 because i had a contract for testing it. Somehow, due to mods installation, the contrracts got reseted, but the engine keeps appearing as experimental in the VAB ans SAS. Do you know how to remove the label ?"},{"CreatedByName":"eightiesboi","CreatedById":133828,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T12:44:09Z","Content":"Silly question for your silly question: have you unlocked the part in your tech tree? Contracts will give you access to parts you haven\u0027t unlocked and then mark them experimental."},{"CreatedByName":"juvilado","CreatedById":106978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T15:18:03Z","Content":"Yes the part was unlocked after i had enough scy pts, but it\u0027s still marked as experimental.

Can you upload your logs and what mods you use? Also, can you create a simple craft (no modded parts) with an \u0022experimental\u0022 part in it and upload it?"}]}
