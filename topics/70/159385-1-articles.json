It\u0027s huge. I want to move the complete project temporarily to Minmus. Starting on the runway I\u0027m using F12 to set orbit to Minmus. The Alt orientation never matches the runway - this is true even when setting orbit to Kerbin. It tends to stand the base (or rocket)\u00A0on end despite the control from here being set on the runway. I added \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E so it can be reoriented. All\u0027s good. Now switching to Hyper Edit and using landing, the base rotates about 45 degree from the east/west Az orientation of the runway. I\u0027m using hold rotation (or whatever it is called in HE) to keep the base upright. None of the Navball indicators match what I am after and trying to manually use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E isn\u0027t working. Once\u00A0the base starts rotating, getting it to stop is proving impossible. I have plenty of electricity. What am I missing here? Is there a way in HE to rotate about an axis?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-18T23:47:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo idea how to delete my original post.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI solved the problem by tapping\u00A0warp on and off once I rotated to the orientation I wanted.

I\u0027ve yet to figure what the reference point is that KSP uses to define the starting direction.
