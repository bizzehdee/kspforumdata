I\u0027m able to transfer resources across a docking port to a craft on the other side of the decoupler, but not from one part of my craft to another through the decoupler itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I right-click on the decoupler, I can see the \u0022Enable Crossfeed\u0022 button, but clicking on it doesn\u0027t do anything. There\u0027s no change in state, and the button doesn\u0027t switch to \u0022Disable Crossfeed\u0022 either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve checked that both parts on either side of the decoupler have fuel tanks that are not empty, and that the decoupler is properly attached. I\u0027ve also tried restarting the game and reloading my save, but the issue persists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else encountered this issue, or does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix it? Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-16T14:45:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u2019re in science or career mode, fuel crossfeed across decouplers is unlocked in the tech tree by unlocking fuel lines.
