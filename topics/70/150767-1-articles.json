I discovered that in my legacy saves (that is, saves I created in 1.1.3) every probe that has one of the new relay antennae attached doesn\u0027t show up in the tracking station (ones with direct antennae do), and therefore can\u0027t be switched back to once one has switched from the probe to the Space Center after launch. After I\u00A0uninstalled all mods the problem in the old save persisted. However, in\u00A0a new\u00A0sandbox save,\u00A0the probes with relay antennae did\u00A0show up as expected. To test the issue I built three identical rovers (one with a direct antenna, one with a relay antenna, and one with both) in each save and launched them. I included the logfile (in the file the save in which it worked is above the one where the problem occurred). Does anybody know if there is a chance to fix this issue for my old savegames from 1.1.3? I\u0027d hate to start all over...again.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ob3wvaebwfypuq/KSP.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELogfile - Dropbox-Link\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T02:40:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s rule out\u00A0the most obvious possibility first\u00A0- there\u0027s a new vessel category (Relay) - is that vessel category filter \u003Cem\u003Eoff \u003C/em\u003Ein your TS/map\u00A0view\u00A0for your old save?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flow","CreatedById":135718,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T08:50:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh god.
