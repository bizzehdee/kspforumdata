The ship makes it to orbit just find, stabilizes orbit just fine. I detach the satellite and all is still well.\n\nI then deorbit the lift vehicle leaving just the satellite in orbit. I switch to the satellite and all is well, it works perfect.\n\nThe problem starts when I quit KSP and reload it and try to switch to the satellite again. Upon switching to the satellite, it shudders, then goes completely crazy flipping around for a moment before finally exploding most every component off of it and out into space.\n\nAny insight/ideas on what might be causing this would be appreciated. Thank you!"},{"CreatedByName":"Bandus","CreatedById":8358,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T18:30:21Z","Content":"I apologize for bumping this post, however, I am quite eager to try to find a resolution to this.

Are you using any kind of part clipping in the satellite?"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T18:47:26Z","Content":"Have you got any clipping parts on your satellite?

It must have been a part clipping issue I suppose. Thank you all for attempting to help, I greatly appreciate your time!"}]}
