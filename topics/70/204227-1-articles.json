The issue I have found is that when vessels approach within 2.5 KM for some reason the game interprets the craft at rest as \u0022on rails\u0022 and then determines via some weird physics that it should blow up. Happens mostly with modded parts, and very rarely with all stock parts. Like you I\u0027ve found no rhyme or reason to it. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
