City lights, they\u0027re great, yeah. But are they supposed to disappear once you get closer? I vaguely recall reading something that suggested this. I\u0027ve provided some images to demonstrate my problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFigure No. 1: As you can see below, the city lights are working properly from orbital and even aerial altitude.
