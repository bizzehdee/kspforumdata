Starting at about 5500 m alt the camera starts to fall behind the ship. by the time I have reached orbit my camera is centered about 3 km behind my ship, as if the center of gravity is dragged back on a tether to the actual ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere seems to be no single part that causes it, and ships that have worked normally sometimes develop the problem when reused. Eventually the ship is lost to the tracking station, not listed at all in the tracker screen, but still exists. If I get close enough I can reselect it but the misaligned camera persists. Reloading the game does nothing and the Kerbins are forever trapped in the ship till flight is terminated. Hyper edit can not rescue them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy install is heavily modded, and the problem is intermittent so forcing it to reproduce results has been a problem. I removed to Kerbin Konstructs hoping it might be the issue but no luck. Any help with this problem would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlacrity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS it seems to happen at 6k meter intervals. At 6k it falls behind to the bottom of the ship, 12k falls back some more etc... Staging seems not to be the problem, whether staging before 6k or after the camera still falls behind.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-23T21:31:03Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2015 09:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by alacrity\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-25T22:45:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm.
