Im using KSP for my senior college project and I\u0027m trying to wrap my head around how \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s log system works. Im able to see flight logs in the log file and can read the data, but I\u0027m only getting logs for portions of the flight as opposed to the whole thing. I\u0027ve tinkered with the log period and flush period numbers but to little avail. Any advice?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, is there an easy way to get delta V values along with the other values on the logs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLovingly yours,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Compression Lift enjoyer\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
