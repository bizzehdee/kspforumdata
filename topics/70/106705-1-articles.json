Launch Stability Enhancers, you can get them much earlier in the tech tree now, put them on all rockets."},{"CreatedByName":"Maolagin","CreatedById":129708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:13:42Z","Content":"Well that\u0027s just my poor luck then! For whatever reason I guess I never encountered this last time I started a career game. Now in my 1.0 career I spent all my science to get early airplane parts just before encountering this. No launch gantry for me until I figure out how to earn another 40 science then.\n\nHmm ... its already at 30 parts too, I wonder if I can shave something off and shim a decoupler under there."},{"CreatedByName":"dewin","CreatedById":96372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:16:37Z","Content":"Sometimes I can get around the problem by moving the ship in the VAB so it launches on a different part of the launchpad."}]}
