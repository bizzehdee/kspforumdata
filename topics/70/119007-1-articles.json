Please forgive me if I missed something obvious. I have a few steps I\u0027ll be taking once I\u0027m off work, but I wanted to check to see if this was a known issue. Also, this is my first bug report so any feedback on the formatting or presentation of the issue would be greatly appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Issue:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting \u0022phantom\u0022 thrust forces, even when all engines are off and RCS is disabled.

The first stage burn went well, but I overshot the target apoapsis. I killed the engines with X to coast and circularize/ correct. When I went to the map to time-warp, I got the message \u0022you cannot time warp while the ship is under acceleration\u0022. I then exited map view, hit X again and confirmed that I didn\u0027t have RCS or SAS enabled. I then disabled the main engine via the right-click menu and went back into the map. Once in the map view, I saw that my orbit had radically changed and was continuing to change as if I was firing the engine. I reverted the flight back to launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECase 2:\u003C/strong\u003E I duplicated the error as described in Case 1 with the same results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECase 3:\u003C/strong\u003E I reverted to the VAB and checked my staging, action groups and overall setup - everything looked good.

This is exceptionally odd since the issue was noticed in space as well as in atmosphere! The other problem was a massive derp on my part, I was running KSP 1.0.2 with mods made for 1.0.4.... no wonder I had problems! Of the list of mods, FAR was the only one that caused a noticeable problem. However, I had an issue with Raster Prop Monitor as well that I didn\u0027t catch: many of the values in the MFDs were \u0022NaN\u0022. I had originally attributed this to not having a specific module installed or a missing mod (the \u0022Engine Igniter\u0022 mod for instance). After patching to 1.0.4 all the displays worked, I\u0027ll also be trying FAR again to make sure it was a version mismatch. Since the cause of the error is known and there is a workaround in place, I\u0027ll call this problem \u0022resolved\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your input innomin8, I gave trim resetting a try as soon as possible.
