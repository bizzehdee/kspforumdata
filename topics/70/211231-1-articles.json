Like it still working but not so correct. When I changing the size of part (It happend with allmost all kindda parts) it slids inside/outside, like, not staying at spot that usual for part, but moving away inside or outside from initial attachment pont. Like it can be all good, but then, when you doing undo or loading the craft, parts are\u00A0slids inside/outside from initial attachment pont. How can I fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nick533a","CreatedById":174472,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-01T21:18:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhow many other mods are you using?
