The DLC are the size of some of the larger mods and once I installed Galaxies Unbound and a couple interplanetary travel mods my memory usage is insane. I have 16GB ram and the game takes up 90%\u002B of my ram. Even when task manager tells me ksp is only using 6GB of ram the memory usage is over 90%. When I close the game it\u0027s back down to like 4% memory usage. I used to be able to play with more parts and planets and only use 10GB but since I came back to KSP recently it\u0027s up at 14GB\u002B on the main menu even when task manager says it\u0027s only using 6GB.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m really just trying to shave off a bit of unnecessary bloat in the DLC so it won\u0027t crash every time I try go to the launchpad with a small sounding rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-20T23:04:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParts-heavy mods will use more RAM than the DLCs, but if you\u2019re set on cutting down on the DLC content you should look at the Making Less History mod which disables the missions content from Making History, as well as the ability to launch from the Woomerang and Dessert launch sites; I\u2019m not sure if this is the case with the 1.12 launch sites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatHomelessGuy","CreatedById":170351,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-24T19:50:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224211271\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211125\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221671577493\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/20/2022 at 11:04 PM, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParts-heavy mods will use more RAM than the DLCs, but if you\u2019re set on cutting down on the DLC content you should look at the Making Less History mod which disables the missions content from Making History, as well as the ability to launch from the Woomerang and Dessert launch sites; I\u2019m not sure if this is the case with the 1.12 launch sites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI removed 4GB of mods and still found KSP using up all of my ram. even with an install of 8GB total I\u0027m looking at 12GB\u002B ram usage.
