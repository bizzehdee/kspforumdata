When i do an EVA the kerbal just spins out of control even with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E switched on he is always slowly rotating, meaning constant corrections and usually over corrections. Turning on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E also has no stabilising effect to the Kerbal. I\u0027ve noticed that the navball on the screen does not link to the Kerbal either. It seems to still just show the reading for the ship i just got out of. Spinning the Kerbal around does not\u00A0move the navball at all. It did used to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is all made worse by not having a camera angle that locks you to the kerbal. The camera is always pointing in one direction and he is just spining on the screen, making it incredibly difficult to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to bring him to a halt because he is rotating on all three axis so it is very difficult to work out which way to thrust to get him to stabilise if you are currently looking at him from an odd angle, not directly at his back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have installed some mods lately, previously using stock i do not remember having these issues. EVA\u0027s were always quite easy. Is anyone aware of a mod that has caused these issues previously? I\u0027m using 1.2.2. It seems to be Navball related as both the direction heading and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E found on the Navball are just not tying to the Kerbal. The only Navball mod i use is Draggable Navball. Any ideas appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDaniel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weywot8","CreatedById":146603,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-29T12:58:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight be a silly question but does spacebar not work for you either? Followed by square brackets till you get back to your kerbal again, then spacebar? And the final resort, switch to a completely different ship outside physics range, then switch back?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes KSP can act up on the first few EVAs after installing mods - never tracked down which but it goes back to normal in my experience. If none of the above works, then you might have to do the \u0022uninstall half your mods\u0022 rinse, repeat , till you narrow down which one is giving problems. \u00A0(if you uninstall half of them and the problem is fixed, then you know it\u0027s in the half you uninstalled - replace everything with that half, repeat)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: there was also a time back with mk1pods when on occasion, EVAs would suddenly eject them into an uncontrollable state even with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E but I thought they fixed that sort of thing in the newer versions. Maybe you were unlucky.
