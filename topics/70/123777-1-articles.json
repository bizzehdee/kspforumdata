That bug you describe I have experienced before, but not repeatedly and it usually happens after I have saved and launched and reverted back to hanger a few times. Is your tech try messed up or modified when this happens? That would indicate it is a bug in the actual parts available and loaded vs just a hanger interface bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
