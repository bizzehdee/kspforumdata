For some reason, the game completely freezes as soon as I hit 69 km. The sound will still be playing but the screen is frozen and the game doesn\u0027t respond at all (have to shut it down with task manager).\n\nI\u0027ve done some tests, and it seems like this only happens in career mode. If I fly the exact same rocket in sandbox or science mode, everything works fine.\n\nI did a search, but the only thing I could find similar to what I\u0027m experiencing was a couple messages in the KScale2 thread. I\u0027m not using that mod, but I am using Kerbol 3.7, which is another similar Kopernicus mod, but I don\u0027t really understand how either would only break in career.\n\nAny ideas? I\u0027m so baffled!"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T11:26:17Z","Content":"The fact it only happens in career mode makes me think there\u0027s something wrong with the game when you complete the \u0027Escape the atmosphere\u0027 contract. Do you have any mods that could affect this, like contract packs?"},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T13:40:07Z","Content":"Known bug in kopernicus. \n\nBasically the contracts are looking for something that ends up being under the surface causing a crash.\n\nIt is detailed here: [https://github.com/BryceSchroeder/Kopernicus/issues/48](https://github.com/BryceSchroeder/Kopernicus/issues/48)\n\nI believe this is the fix. Change the following lines in GameData\\Squad\\Contracts\\Contracts.cfg\n\n    TrivialHomeNearbyRange = 200000SignificantHomeNearbyRange = 400000ExceptionalHomeNearbyRange = 600000\n\nI increased the values by 100 times.\n\nYou could probably write a MM file to do the same thing."}]}
