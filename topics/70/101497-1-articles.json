It looks like someone poured glowing goo all over half the planet. I suspect it may have something to do with Ferram since the bug appeared immediately after I installed it.\n\nAnyone else experience this?"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T02:26:59Z","Content":"that\u0027s because they are .jpg\u0027s. either delete the files or turn them into .png\u0027s."},{"CreatedByName":"spacedoctor42","CreatedById":138696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T02:46:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E that\u0027s because they are .jpg\u0027s. either delete the files or turn them into .png\u0027s.\n\n Which files are those?"},{"CreatedByName":"spacedoctor42","CreatedById":138696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T04:30:11Z","Content":"I\u0027m serious, I can\u0027t find any .jpg\u0027s in the gamedata folder and this bug is driving me nuts."},{"CreatedByName":"Secret Agent Kirrim","CreatedById":98579,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T05:22:03Z","Content":"Just let Kerbin be taken over by the yellow goo.

After I manage to fix it, a few days lat4er it reoccurs. I have installed Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack and followed the instructions to the letter, which instructs in what order to install the mods, including EVE city lights and clouds. I have the aurora working. In the clouds mod I see a second ghosted layer which seems like you are cross-eyed. They are awesome mods when working and I believe I did something wrong. I will reinstall Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack and eve again to see if these items are fixed."}]}
