I have 1.04 on a Windows 7 system, and have installed MechJeb, Asteroid Day, and ScanSat (in that order).\n\nMechJeb is working fine. But I do not see the parts for either Asteroid Day or ScanSat in the tech tree; do they become available at certain nodes? Or since I began my Science campaign before installing them, does that mean I\u0027d need to restart the campaign with those mods already installed?"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T21:54:46Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think you necessarily need to restart the campaign - you should be able to go back to the updated tech tree and unlock the missing parts individually."},{"CreatedByName":"MaxwellsDemon","CreatedById":147660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T17:36:56Z","Content":"I don\u0027t see them show up in the tech tree, in either techs I\u0027ve researched or ones I have yet to research-- other than the MechJeb parts, which do show up properly."},{"CreatedByName":"MaxwellsDemon","CreatedById":147660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T15:20:46Z","Content":"Update: I discovered my problem-- I had unzipped the other mods in GameData, just like I did for MechJeb, but the folder hierarchies in the ZIP files for the other mods were not consistent with MechJeb.
