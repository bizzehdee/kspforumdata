Use 32bit.\u003C/strong\u003E Are you using KSP Windows x64? If so, expect problems. KSP Windows x64 is a work in progress that has been shown to be unstable for the majority of modded installs and crashes easily. This is not due to problems in the mods themselves but in the Unity player and KSP assemblies. In particular, if you have a large number of plugins or parts (i.e. high memory usage for textures and on the stack) KSP Win x64 is incredibly unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*] \u003Cstrong\u003E32bit KSP? Keep your memory usage low.\u003C/strong\u003E Mac OS X KSP and the 32bit clients for Windows and for Linux are limited to around 3.3GB of memory in use (it varies--reports show the limit is closer to, or even below, 3GB for Macs, whereas sometimes even 3.5GB survives on Windows). This has nothing to do with how much RAM you have installed; 32bit processes simply have a limited address space, and Unity does not handle allocation errors gracefully: it crashes to desktop. If you\u0027re running lots of mods, you\u0027re probably near the limit; try removing part-heavy mods and/or installing \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EActive Texture Management\u003C/a\u003E in aggressive mode, which will reduce memory usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]\u003Cstrong\u003ECheck to see if the issue was already reported.\u003C/strong\u003E Search the mod\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s thread (using the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csearch in thread\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u009D option) and search this forum (using the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csearch this forum\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u009D option) to see if the issue was already reported.
