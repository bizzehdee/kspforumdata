In addition, under both stripped installs I now cannot select any parts in the VAB in order to test a new craft. Restoration of full mod list removes the VAB issue.\n\nIssue does not recur, so far as I can tell, with a new save.\n\nI also am now blind from repeatedly slamming my head into my keyboard in bafflement, but that\u0027s a separate issue.\n\nIf anyone could point me at ideas of how to test this further, preferably without spending sixteen hours setting up a single test case (because if that\u0027s the only option I\u0027m going to throw up my hands in horror and go get drunk), I\u0027m all ears.\n\nEDIT: Someone else in the [KCT thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92377-1-0-Kerbal-Construction-Time-1-1-6-%2804-29-15%29-Unrapid-Planned-Assembly/page104) is having the same issue; in our case, it appears to be a bad \u0022idx\u0022 assignment with onboard tourists. Manually changing the tourists\u0027s idx from -1 to 0 in persistent.sfs fixes the issue. Hope that helps, OP.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T22:44:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 10:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jackson Mackenzie**"},{"CreatedByName":"SnakyLeVrai","CreatedById":135852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T12:10:54Z","Content":"Hi,\n\nSolved it differently, I guess the problem can have different sources.\n\nI had the same problem with my Science Career save.

I was on Minmus and brought back a Kerbal from EVA, as soon as I selected her to board the craft the game glitched out for a split second then left me viewing the same Kerbal attached to the side of the craft, yet I could not control her. I couldn\u0027t switch to another craft from map view either, nor the tracking station.

I updated from 1.5.7 to 1.6.1 and it busted my save. All went back to normal when I reverted. BUT, it took me 2 hours to figure it out because I haven\u0027t been playing KSP for a month and I forgot I had updated this DOE mod 1 or 2 weeks ago without even testing it ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m having trouble recognizing any line in your log, do you mind uploading the KSP.log file? It should be found in the same folder where the KSP executable is located. Just search for any .log file in you KSP directory if you don\u0027t find it, it should be the biggest one.\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, if you have KSP\\_AVC mod, start your game, wait for it to reach the main menu and look for a \u0022version checker\u0022 bar in a corner of the screen, it shows the number of the mods you have. Unfold the bar so it shows you the entire list of the mods and click \u0022copy to clipboard\u0022, then paste the list in the thread you mentioned above, so everyone can see it and have a good idea of what you\u0027ve got installed.\n\u003E \n\u003E Generally, the method to solve something as annoying as this is the following:\n\u003E \n\u003E - First, backup your \u0022saves\u0022 folder somewhere, just to be safe, that will avoid screwing up your game when trying to solve this.\n\u003E \n\u003E - I suggest you backup your \u0022saves\u0022 folder.\n\u003E \n\u003E - Check the 2 lines above, it\u0027s important.\n\u003E \n\u003E - Are you sure you backuped your \u0022saves\u0022 folder? you should seriously consider it before going any further.\n\u003E \n\u003E Now:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1- Can you reproduce the problem 2 times in the same situation?\n\u003E \n\u003E 2- Does it happen with another ship?\n\u003E \n\u003E 3- In the tracking station (not the map mode when you are flying something, I really mean the tracking station from space center), can you click on the various ships/stations/etc you have launched? is there any of them that will freeze the tracking station when selecting it?\n\u003E \n\u003E 4- Does it happen when you start a brand new game, launch something into orbit, go back to space center and try to switch back to it from tracking station?\n\u003E \n\u003E 5- Do you have any other career/science/sandbox game left untouched for a long time? Try to load a save from those and see if you can also reproduce it here.\n\u003E \n\u003E 6- What changed since the last time it worked?\n\u003E \n\u003E 7- When was that? did you last play a month ago or something? did you change anything long ago without testing it right away?\n\u003E \n\u003E 8- What new mod did you install?\n\u003E \n\u003E 9- What mod did you update?\n\u003E \n\u003E 10- What mod did you delete, even something you thought was useless?\n\u003E \n\u003E 11- What mod did you modify (a config file, a part... ?)\n\u003E \n\u003E 12- What config file did you tamper with? (like modifying some KSP stock config file to tweak something)\n\u003E \n\u003E 13- Did you move the KSP directory somewhere else?\n\u003E \n\u003E 14- Did you change anything on your computer? graphic card, hard drive, ... ?\n\u003E \n\u003E 15- I\u0027ve had a weird problem with KAS one day. Did you do the following:\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E attach something to your ship/crane/whatever with a pipe or a winch,\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E then (and only then) saved your game or switched to another ship or Kerbal,\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E then played around (like move the charge or anything)\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E then reloaded the game or went back to the ship with the attached thing,\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E then detached the link\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E then enter the flawed craft?\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E ... because sometimes glitches happen with KAS: when objects are attached to each other, sometimes the whole thing may be considered as a whole spaceship, and there could be conflicts with the saves...\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E I am not sure of the mechanics of those KAS / save glitches. When it happened to me, I sent a rescue ship and blew the hell out of the glitchy one. That worked pretty well.\n\u003E \n\u003E Most problems come from a modification you did in KSP files (in the mods, 90% of the time). You\u0027ll have to think really hard about everything you did prior to your issue. It\u0027s sometimes so tiny and stupid it will have you pull your hair for hours before finding what it is.\n\u003E \n\u003E Good luck,\n\u003E \n\u003E SnakyLeVrai\n\nI hope you don\u0027t mind that I\u0027ve posted your very helpful private message responding to my problem as there\u0027s a lot of helpful information in there that others would find useful.\n\nI definitely agree that it is file related but I just check CKAN and upgrade the mods it tells me too on an adhoc basis, I really don\u0027t know which mod it is that has failed because of that. so I\u0027m hoping someone can take 5 mins to point me in the right direction.\n\nHere\u0027s the updated player.log and ksp.log as well as my mod list.
