I can place it alright, but not click it again to (re)move it, or to set it up with an action group. That\u0027s only in SPH/VAB -- it works fine in flight. Only that I have to find and pick it every time because I can\u0027t hook it to AGs.\n\nAnyone seen something like this before?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T16:14:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 04:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T08:27:41Z","Content":"Update: I still have no idea which mod has caused this, or if this is a mod issue at all.
