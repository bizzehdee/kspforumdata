I\u0027m experiencing some weirdness with Pwings and/or FAR, and I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s intentional or due to issues with one or both of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI updated to 0.25 yesterday and installed the latest versions of the mods, and then copied across my favourite builds from 0.24.2. First thing that I noticed was that the root thickness was messed up. It seems that \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhen adjusting root chord length on a wing, it also vastly increases the root thickness\u003C/strong\u003E. I re-adjusted it so it was visually the same as in 0.24.2, and the main wing now has a root thickness of 0.6 and a tip thickness of 0.68. Is this intentional?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rTtHR70.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rTtHR70l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rTtHR70l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/g8e1Kp5.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/g8e1Kp5l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022g8e1Kp5l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also noticed that the CoM and CoL have shifted, and the dry mass is now 11.47 where before it was 8. I\u0027m guessing this is due to mass and lift being calculated differently for the wings, but can someone confirm whether this is the case?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qyq4D7a.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qyq4D7al.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qyq4D7al.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W8S5KnA.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W8S5KnAl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022W8S5KnAl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The left picture is from 0.24.2, and the right one from 0.25.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis aircraft used to fly very smoothly in 0.24.2. I\u0027ve adjusted the CoL backwards and fiddled with the control surfaces but it still has some niggling problems in 0.25, chief among which is that it\u0027s not stable in level flight at low altitude above 200m/s. I can manually fly it level with only a small downward pitch (because the main wing has positive AoA it wants to pitch up), but the SAS doesn\u0027t seem to want to use the control surfaces. It\u0027s as though it can\u0027t deflect them more than a couple of degrees, so after a few seconds the aircraft gently pitches up to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SAS also seems to be overcorrecting. When I leave it in level flight the pitch of the aircraft oscillates up and down. This never happened in 0.24.2, so it\u0027s either something that Squad has changed, or it\u0027s an issue with FAR and/or Pwings. Is anyone else having the same issues? \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2jzywf/bug_my_planes_keeping_pitching_up_and_down_rapidly/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI\u0027ve spoken to one person on Reddit who is experiencing this\u003C/a\u003E, but no one else seemed to have a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t seem to revert the flight to the runway. It bugs out and the Procedural Parts structural pieces disappear, the all-moving canards are messed up, it floats motionless in the air regardless of physical time warping, and the navball markers are all superposed (see pic below).
