If i launch and complete the contract in one go i have no issues. but should i launch the craft and put it into a non contract orbit. save my game and close then later return to the craft, my contract requirement of launch a new satellite is no longer checked for the craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can get the original craft into the right orbit, where it will mark off stable and correct orbit, but not the launch new.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould the two mods I\u0027m running cause this? or do the contacts reset the objectives if i close my game?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
