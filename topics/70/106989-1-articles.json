I might have accidentally pressed F4 some time back.**\n\nSo, here\u0027s my problem. For a while I have had no target indicator on any craft. I by this, I mean I cannot see an icon on any other craft (in the world) and thus cannot double click to target them. I can still target craft by using the map view. I am currently running **KSP version 1.0.0**. I have been having this problem since 0.90. It makes playing with BDArmoury very hard, and also makes orbital rendevous rather bloody hard as I cannot see where the target craft is or its distance from me.\n\n**Here\u0027s some illustrations:**\n\nThere is a Kerbal X stock ship sat on the launchpad. As you can see, there is no green diamond surrounding it, and I cannot double-click to target it.\n\n\u003E ![56d64533ec.jpg](http://puu.sh/hz9X3/56d64533ec.jpg)\n\nThe following screenshot shows a close-up of the launchpad from the IVA view of my craft. Just to prove there is actually a craft there.\n\n\u003E ![8a30ef73bd.jpg](http://puu.sh/hz9YQ/8a30ef73bd.jpg)\n\n**Below is a list of my mods:**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Blizzy98\u0027s toolbar\n\u003E - BahamutoD\u0027s Armory\n\u003E - CollisionFX\n\u003E - HyperEdit\n\u003E - RealChute\n\u003E - ModuleManager\n\u003E - StageRecovery\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nI am about to test my KSP install without any mods, to see if the problem persists.
