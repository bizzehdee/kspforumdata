I\u0027ll post this here because I have Kerbal Engineer and TAC Fuel Balancer, although I do not think it is at all related to these mods. Please move this\u00A0if it\u00A0is in the wrong place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not have video, and I cannot seem to reproduce my steps.

I do not have any pictures of these steps, as I did not know that this would happen. I had a small probe with the claw and a docking port on the rear end. The claw was attached\u00A0to another long probe made of Oscar B tanks, which I will refer to as\u00A0the probe. Since the probe that was grabbed with the claw would not fit into the cargo bay, I set the claw to free pivot, and managed to dock with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. I then disabled the free pivot, but it didn\u0027t help, the probe still waved wildly. It began to clip through the cargo bay, at which point I tried to stabilize it by entering time warp. As soon as I hit the timewarp button, I heard many explosions, and everything vanished. The rest of what happened is described in the Imgur with the two pictures I have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t actually figure out how to put the log file on here, it is too big for Pastebin and I cannot access my Google account to use Dropbox. I can\u0027t seem to access File2web either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for lack of a better description, but it is all I have for now. I will try to reproduce it to get many more pictures, as I cannot record either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this is an absolutely terrible bug report, sorry about that.
