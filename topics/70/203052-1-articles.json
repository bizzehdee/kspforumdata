I have a save where I\u0027ve been playing around with lots of separate craft instead of large ones to increase performance. With 10 roughly 40 part craft I get a CPU usage of only 17% on a 6 core CPU, which is only one core loaded to max. GPU sits below 30% the whole time.. Any idea why its putting them all on one core or is this intended behavior?
