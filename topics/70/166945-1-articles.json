But I don\u0027t think the problem is with any of these mods. I think the problem is with KSP 1.3.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo put it bluntly: Physics easing is scrod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now I\u0027m trying to perform a simple ore-mining mission on Minmus. Ore mining takes a long while, especially with just two drills on my lander. But I can\u0027t speed it up by going to warp. Why? Because as soon as I come out of warp, my lander sproings way up in the air, breaking both my drills. So I have to just let it run in the background for several hours in order to complete a one-star mission. I can\u0027t save my game partway through and reload later. As soon as I reload, sproing, break.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is happening with roughly one-third of my landing craft. It happens when I drive a rover within 200 m of the lander that\u0027s supposed to pick my rover-driving Kerbals up and take them home. It happens, pretty much, on every world I\u0027ve landed on that has lower gravity than Kerbin. It even happens on Kerbin: I brought in an asteroid, sent my retrieval vehicle to bring it back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to add it to my collection; as soon as the retrieval vehicle came within 200 m, the 9-ton asteroid hopped and rolled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is untenable. Squad should be doing nothing else right now but fixing this game-breaking problem. Version 1.3.1 is the Windows ME of KSP. We need 1.3.2, with properly functioning physics easing, yesterday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aaronsta1","CreatedById":177675,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-29T12:58:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI came here to post this.. its new from 1.3 or 1.3.1. anything with wheels, as soon as i load it or come out of warp\u00A0boom it gets launched.. enough to put me in orbit on minmus lol..\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni dont think its the physics.. i think its the terrain.. if you notice vehicles slightly clip into the ground now.. before not so much.. they changed something recently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-01T15:34:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncreasing terrain detail to High helps somewhat with this problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-02T15:23:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I understand this isn\u0027t actually being caused by physics easing, but rather by KSPs vessel-reload-and-position code.\u00A0 It is restoring the vessel as being slightly clipped into the terrain, and the standard collision response is what is causing the leaping.\u00A0 Gravity/physics easing has nothing to do with it (physics easing only effects gravity, not collisions; it is the collisions that are at fault here).\u00A0 It is a known issue and has several tickets on the official bug tracker already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe proper solution will have to come with some analytics to ensure that when a vessel is reloaded it is not colliding with the terrain.\u00A0 I\u0027m not sure why it is happening currently (no KSP source access), but I would have to infer that they are trying to re-position the vessel on load mathematically (restoring the previous latitude/longitude, or x/y/z relative to parent body, with no further checks), rather than physically (which would involve lots of raycasts/collider sweep tests to find the proper position).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
