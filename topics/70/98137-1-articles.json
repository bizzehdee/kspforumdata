First, you need to launch when your launch site crosses the orbit. That will mean you can launch into the plane of the orbit (assuming the orbit\u0027s inclination is equal to or greater than your launch site\u0027s latitude--if not, you will have to match planes later, just get as close as you can or pick another launch site). Launch and try to match inclination on the way up. Once you get into orbit, try matching planes by burning at the AN or DN of your-orbit-vs-the-target-orbit. If that is too expensive, burn prograde at the AN (or DN) to move the apogee to the opposite node, and make it very far out; when you are at the apogee of a highly eccentric orbit you\u0027re nearly standing still so plane changes are cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve matched planes within a degree or three, it\u0027s time to shift Ap and Pe around. Find a spot where your orbital track is at the same altitude as the target orbit, and create a node there, burning radially (and prograde/retrograde as necessary) to make the Ap and Pe match the target ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T09:31:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may benefit from some tutorials I made on just this subject:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/DH-Jii4PhzU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/DCWinnHjkVo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never got to the Mun/Minmus satellite tutorials but this should hopefully get you headed in the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cosmos33","CreatedById":132144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T13:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk but when lunching how do i know which degree to follow on the navball ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
