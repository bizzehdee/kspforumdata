It was fine before hand. I also made sure to update the graphics driver for 10.

I had a problem with Windows 10 not loading the proper video driver (I have an Nvidia GeForce 740M video card). for some reason during the initial install the video driver caused an error. I had to reboot a couple of times and then reinstall it manually. After that my KSP game actually ran better than in Windows 8.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJR\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T06:52:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne warning about Windows 10 for those who use Arduino based custom controllers with the Serial IO mod... Multiple users have had failures to establish communication between the Arduino and KSP. One user actually reinstalled Windows 7, just to get things working, cause he was taking his hardware controller to a maker fair, or something like that. Just be aware that it IS a new OS, and that things can break in transition. Time will fix it, but you should never buy a console at launch, and never update an OS at launch. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DanTheMan96","CreatedById":132923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T12:51:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys I\u0027ll look in to that .
