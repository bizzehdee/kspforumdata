They just go straight down the runway. I\u0027m working on a giant rover, but when I found this problem I built a tiny rover (just two Mk2 cans back to back, with 4 XL3 wheels on a very short wheelbase) and even that doesn\u0027t steer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI checked the wheel settings, and even tried reversing the direction of steering, but to no avail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/195426-steering-with-rovemax-model-xl3/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EIt seems I\u0027m not the only one with this problem\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not yet found a resolution tho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe in the past I\u0027ve used these wheels successfully, but it\u0027s been a while.

It tends to work OK when you\u0027re stationary, but that often results in the vehicle starting to move forwards or backwards and then the reverse side stops reversing, meaning you speed up and stop turning properly again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless you need them for the size and carrying capacity it\u0027s usually better to go for the TR-2 wheels instead which have normal steering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redchrome","CreatedById":132090,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-10T12:19:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the feedback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThing is, I never saw any indication that either side was speeding up, even on my short-wheelbase test vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-10T12:58:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223892034\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022198544\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221607602785\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022132090\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Redchrome\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n36 minutes ago, Redchrome said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the feedback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThing is, I never saw any indication that either side was speeding up, even on my short-wheelbase test vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt usually shows itself as one side\u2019s wheels\u00A0jumping to full motor power when you try to steer the other way e.g. right side wheels when turning left; try driving with the wheels\u2019 PAWs pinned open and see if that\u2019s happening.\u00A0You might need to add some hefty reaction wheels and drag it around with torque, or use some smaller wheels on the front/back to steer with and disable the differential steering on the XL3 wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redchrome","CreatedById":132090,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-10T13:10:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223892040\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022198544\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221607605133\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt usually shows itself as one side\u2019s wheels\u00A0jumping to full motor power when you try to steer the other way e.g. right side wheels when turning left; try driving with the wheels\u2019 PAWs pinned open and see if that\u2019s happening.\u00A0You might need to add some hefty reaction wheels and drag it around with torque, or use some smaller wheels on the front/back to steer with and disable the differential steering on the XL3 wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for the hint on watching the wheel information windows!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had considered adding some trailing small wheels for steering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-11T01:56:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs your control point facing forward or up?
