It consisted of three launches, An alcor based lander for Vall (or failing that, Pol), a venerable old 3.75M tug that I first built in 2014, it\u0027s the biggest tug from that era that still survives, and a shuttle for 10 tons of\u00A0\u0022Kibbal\u0022 a Station Science resource intended to resupply a massive 500 ton rig that\u0027s currently trying to refuel itself at Dres. The flight plan was to use the tug to pull the kibbal shipment up to interplanetary velocity then cut it loose. The burn was about 17 minutes but it was successful and it looks like the tug will have enough to make it to vall, and at least start the return voyage with the lander after it does it\u0027s thing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight plan for the kibbal shipment was to do a direct insertion into Jool orbit in the parking zone (between Tylo and Bop) and camp until the big rig arrives.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lander was to perform a \u0022Laythe Snag\u0022 then directly shunt over to Vall on the same orbit and insert at a high enough inclination to reach the ruins...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo each mission needs to enter the jool system on it\u0027s own trajectory so each has to do a corridor correction burn at roughly the same instant....
