So I tried uninstalled and reinstall the game to see if it would fix it but it didn\u0027t, so I was wondering how I might be able to fix this problem?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T14:37:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you deleted the entire GameData folder, then go to KSP_win (assuming you\u0027re on Windows), and \u0022saves\u0022 folder; then backup your save folder (the one with the name of your game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo a clean install, ie: delete KSP_win, and download it again from the website or Steam, and paste your saved folder in the new \u0022saves\u0022 folder inside KSP_win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this kind of problem, doing a clean install will always solve your issue.
