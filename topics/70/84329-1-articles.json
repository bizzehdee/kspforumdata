I need some advice on paring down my mods and I hope this is the right place to post. I have the following installed at the moment:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/qv6bj89n6xtf9it/Clipboard01.jpg?dl=0\u0022 alt=\u0022Clipboard01.jpg?dl=0\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that B9-Aerospace is not actually installed, it\u0027s just the few .cfg files that one of the mods installs (USI MKS I think).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to at least keep using Deadly Reentry, KW Rocketry, TAC life support, SCANSat, and RemoteTech 2. I really would like to use USI\u0027s MKS mod so i can build nice orbital and planetary bases. I think it takes a lot of resources, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI run in x64 mode, but I have also tried x32 mode (changing the ActiveTextureManager to x32 bit of course). I hit over 3.5GB in x32 mode with all of these mods so of course it crashes. In x64 mode I hit over 4GB, but I can usually run it okay with all of the mods minus MKS (or any other mod for that matter - It\u0027s like that\u0027s the straw that broke the camel\u0027s back)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know enough about mods, but do you see anything on my list that maybe I should dump that also happens to fit in the same memory footprint that MKS does? I play in Sandbox mode. I\u0027m just having a tough time deciding what mods to dump in favor of MKS, and I don\u0027t know which ones are the most resource hungry and least impactful on enjoyment of the game. Maybe you can make a suggestion on what to dump so i can get down below 3.5GB memory usage and use x32 KSP?

You are right in that I rarely use IVA. I didn\u0027t realize the customization of ATM.

What I am unsure of is how I can do that with individual parts of a mod. I am not sure how to isolate a part to raise the scale.
