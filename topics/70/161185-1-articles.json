Unfortunately though I\u0027m running into an odd problem with an existing test-save from KSP 1.2.2. Whenever I try to load the save, I get this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iF898Yi.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iF898Yi.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClearly there\u0027s an input string that\u0027s not in the correct format in the save, but I\u0027m at a loss as to how to resolve it. For my test save it\u0027s not a big deal, but for my career save, it is. Any ideas on how to troubleshoot this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-28T06:07:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurns out the problem can occur if you change the format of one of your scenario variables from, say, float to integer...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
