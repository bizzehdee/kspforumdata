I\u0027d like to diagnose the problem but will settle for just making it stop. My KSP defaults to DX 11 and has the \u0022random\u0022 crash problem. I already tested \u0022-force-d3d12\u0022 and got a worse problem of crashing as soon as I load a save. I uninstalled a lot of mods and still have the problem (while another heavily modded install is stable).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy next steps are to try -force-opengl and -force-glcore.
