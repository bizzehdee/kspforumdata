I have had \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E for a while but i recently installed scatterer, parallax 2.0, and Kopernicus. After restarting ksp looked better then ever.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then, tragedy struck.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile i was at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, i decided to tinker around with the eve configurations a bit to see what it would do. It appeared to do nothing so i switched back to a vessel. I then noticed ksp to look rather dull and found that the typical beautiful clouds that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E brings have VANISHED!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI checked planets like Eve and found that all of the visuals including stuff like the bubbles were still totally fine. Stuff on the kerbin terrain seemed to be completely unaffected as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would provide a screenshot of the config thing i messed with and the after affects, but i don\u0027t know how to upload images. Soooooo, knowing how to do that would help too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.
