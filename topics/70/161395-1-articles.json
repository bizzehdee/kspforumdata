There\u0027s also an issue in that it can land anywhere, it will not choose an nice smooth site, and if you are operating on the coast then there\u0027s a 50% chance you\u0027ll be landing in the ocean. Also when force\u00A0 landed\u00A0 it doesn\u0027t automatically put on the brakes, so it carries on rolling until it encounters a suitable obstruction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile that may sound less than great , it should be noted that the AI pilot is designed for combat scenarios\u00A0 not general flying. In general most of these scenarios\u00A0 are reverted\u00A0 and rerun ,\u00A0 once the results of the scenario are finalised, with one team obviously the victor\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wing commander function allows a little more control but is still combat oriented and works only with multiple aircraft and operates in a similar way to the normal AI with regard to landings\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour best bet for landing of remote aircraft is likely Burn Together, though that relies on you being in control of 1 of the aircraft,\u00A0 BT basically mirrors control inputs on a slaved craft , so anything you do is matched by the following aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are however a couple of other very good autopilot mods out there and if it\u0027s not combat you\u0027re after I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve seen at least one of those run an autoland procedure\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
