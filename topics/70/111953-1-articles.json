It showed two ghost images only one of which seemed to have a node while both were captured by the mouse.\n\nI am aware that by copying an item which has a parent, the copy loses it\u0027s child status. This isn\u0027t the same thing at all. It was almost as if it had symmetry but the two multipart items appeared to be at right angles to each other. The station Hub of course has no symetry and nodes can only be connected or disconnected individually. It threw up a couple of exceptions in the debug window. Hence my concern."}]}
