Didn\u0027t seem to make a difference\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was going to Minmus, and saw that it was totally black when I was close. So, I tried to do some debugging:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I removed ALL mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I recopied the two folders in the GameData directory from the install zip file: NASAmission and Squad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I reinstalled the KSP_Data directory from the zip file\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I loaded new sandbox game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I created a simple ship (capsule, 3 tanks and an engine), used the alt-12 to get infinite fuel, and blasted off to Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got the ship in an orbit, and observed Minmus as it went around. Above a height of about 180,000 m, it shows normally. When it goes below that height, it goes black, but with the edge lit up, kind of as if it was between my ship and the sun, however, I am on the sun side when I see this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I noticed, was that at this \u0022edge\u0022, when I flipped back and forth between the map mode and the normal view, it shows Minmus normally for about 1/10 second, then it gets blacked out. It seems that this gets worse the closer I get to Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve tried to reduce this as much as possible, and have gotten to the point where there is nothing left to remove\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I created a new install, copied the save into it and started it up. The basic startup without changing any options. It worked, Minmus is there. I then turned on all options to their max, restarted the game, Minmus was still there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions? I don\u0027t mind debugging, but need a direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I copied ALL of my mods into the new install, and started it up. Minmus was there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking about this, I remembered that a few days ago I had used Hyperedit to get a lander close to Minmus for a test. That\u0027s when I first noticed this. I dismissed it assuming that Hyperedit had screwed up something, but am now wondering if it might have corrupted a file. My big problem is that I have no idea which file, I\u0027ve replaced all the ones I can think of.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-18T22:28:40Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2015 10:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by linuxgurugamer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENot solved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T13:31:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow we go into the rabbit hole!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI renamed the directory of my old install, then took my new install, with all the mods, and moved it to the same place as the old directory, so that it was in the same logical location.
