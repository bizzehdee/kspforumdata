I\u0027ve launched two using different methods to try to work this bug out. For some reason, despite the fact that bases are generally landed vehicles, these stations are considered bases. I did use hyperedit for the initial orbits, but the second station was supposed to eliminate that as a possible reason by having the station parts dock in orbit. It\u0027s still considered a base\u00A0for some reason rather than a station. Both are in orbit around Kerbin at around 240km. I really don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to do these contracts at all, but I do find it mildly annoying that it\u0027s giving the vessels different types from what they should have.
