When I went back again to the crafts, they were unattached but the 2 winches are in a \u0022plugged\u0022 status. If I hit the unplug button the winch kinda redeploys itself but is still plugged. I cannot retract the winch or grab the connector either, it says \u0022connected parts not alligned\u0022 and \u0022cant grab a connector already deployed\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the connecting port is both used and not used: the unplug button gives \u0022there is nothing to unplug\u0022 and the plug button (when carrying another not bugged winch connector) gives \u0022connector port already used.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny idea how to reset the winch and/or the port?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Numero_deux","CreatedById":154593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T18:11:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell actually it\u0027s any game load (in game from a save or booting the game), and time warping that unplug the winches so it looks more serious than I though and I guess I won\u0027t find a solution. Hopefully fixed one day, KAS is awesome otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
