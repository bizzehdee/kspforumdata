Its the same on all engines that have it as a resource nothing seems to work. Still shows the same as intake air when in flight on the right click menu.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh?\u00A0Was about to mention the VA1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E Jet Engine from B9 too. Its intake has air and atm but the engine itself only has air as a propellant same for the TFE371.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I misunderstanding\u00A0how it works? Or is something broken? Tried googling but couldn\u0027t find anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Just saw one of the propfans from Karbonite has atm as a propellant. Tried it. Worked.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuess was just being dumb. Assumed the engines with it as an intake would work with that intake open. Didn\u0027t help so many intakes had it but so few engines but yeah whatever \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0problem solved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-15T09:47:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2019 09:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Ocid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
