I had a contract that included retrieving the capsule in low minmus orbit ~ 7.2km. All is fine until you get within say 300m of the object. Then it speeds past you out to about say 600 meters. Then it seems to reset to 300 and keeps repeating this zoom by and reset. In map mode it looks fine. Has anyone run across this before? Is this the macjeb bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDestroyer111","CreatedById":160216,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T09:01:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm... things like this happen every day on DarkMultiPlayer. But if you don\u0027t use DMP... If this is a MechJeb autopilot bug, your thrusters/engines would be clearly visible working when this happens. Note that it can\u0027t be an autopilot issue if you move faster than your engines/thrusters allow. Try doing the same thing without MechJeb to see if this is a MechJeb bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
