I already encountered this problem couple of builds ago.\n\nI\u0027m using only a Navball texture replacer mod, can this cause the problem? I used the Enhanced Navball mod before 1.0\n\n![YWMdiOF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YWMdiOF.jpg)\n\n![2Q3Jzrz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2Q3Jzrz.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhartek","CreatedById":144648,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T09:30:37Z","Content":"Is your command pod flipped over?
