I know that are not major but I would like the game to run to perfection.\n\n1. Whenever I change screen or the game is loading something, there is a pink rectangular box in the bottom right of the screen. It disappears when the new screen loads but I\u0027m afraid that it\u0027s consuming more memory than it should because of that.\n2. (Possibly related) The IVA cams in the bottom right whenever I control a manned ship are EXTREMELY laggy and it looks like they run at 4 fps. The strange thing is that everything else in the game runs perfectly smoothly and also using the debug menu (performance) I have constant 40 fps \u002B.\n\nDo you maybe know what that could be? I can provide you the list of my mods if needed (there are a lot of them but to be honest I tried removing the ones that affect the IVA and the problem persists).\n\nPlease help ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
