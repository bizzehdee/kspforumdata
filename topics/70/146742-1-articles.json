Do any of you have apparently random lock\u00A0in your flight profile? My plane\u00A0just REFUSES any input to pull up, while all the control surfaces animate to perfection. I can roll, yaw and pitch down sometimes. Not one single degree of pitching up.\u00A0I\u0027m on a cell right now, so you can expect more info on the subject very soon at request, but here\u0027s what happened most recently...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy one great love in KSP revolves around the aerodynamics and the Good Ol Infernal Robotics. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E. A bit o\u0027 Tweakscale too though. No, I\u0027m not placing multiple radial engines around just to switch between them to fly horizontal or vertical... That\u0027s a huge waste of parts and my poor lil\u00A0laptop suffers\u00A0enough, thanks. Not to mention you\u0027ll have some serious efficiency concerns... I use Infernal Robotics Rotatrons to maximize thrust vectoring with various engines and designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, I digress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built this adorable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E jet,\u00A0\u0022Lil Paw,\u0022\u00A0and have been having a blast landing atop the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, island airstrip\u0027s control tower roof, and each of the heights of Tut-Uhn Jeb-Ahn even. But apparently random disaster is creeping into my good times...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI note a strange downward lurch first each time and automatically get liquided off because I know my Kerbal is screwwed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI vie for control of Lil Paw\u00A0by shifting the jumpjets around to maintain altitude, and I might even have some success getting stable, but no matter what I do, Lil Paw has absolutely no pitch UP. I even tried flying upside down, pitching down (which translates to up, away from gravity of course,) \u00A0to no avail. Ultimately, the result is a total loss of control and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E(rapid unplanned disassembly, AKA BOOM.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m thinking this may be a physics bug with the 1.1.3 update, but I\u0027m not coding-savvy, so here I am, screaming all the way to the ground lulz....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running Win7 x64bit 1.1.3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods used: Kerbal Engineer Redux, Infernal Robotics, Kerbal Attachment Systems, Kerbal Inventory Systems, Kerbal Aircraft Xpansion(with Firespitter,)\u00A0Kerbal Planetary Base Systems and Tweakscale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to all in advance for helping me solve this buzzkill.
