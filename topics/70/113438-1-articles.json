And this affects his/her manoeuvrability. Try walking on Minmus for example. Without stored equipment they bunny-hop across the surface. WITH equipmen the run more or less like the would back home on Kerbin.\n\nTo avoid this the solution is simple: loose the equipment."},{"CreatedByName":"Bogeyman","CreatedById":136919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T09:32:40Z","Content":"Jeb did not have any equipment. I had equipment in a storage container attached to the space ship, but Jeb exited the capsule with the EVA button. He did not have anything with him.
