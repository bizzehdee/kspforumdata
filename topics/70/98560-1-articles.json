This is most likely having an impact on your disks as Windows is continually using your swap because of this excessive memory usage. This is also why it only happens after quite a period of time, as KSP only gets bloated enough from it\u0027s memory leak after a while. I could explain it more if you wish, but in ways of fixing this there is not much that can be done apart from purchasing more RAM or removing some mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gkirmathal","CreatedById":135480,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T20:09:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the feedback TotheMun.
