And if you did, did you place the .zip or the folder? Because if I recall KSP won\u0027t accept mods in a .zip file. Additionally do you have Kopernicus and the other requirements for that mod? Small solar system is a bit vague but I assume you meant Stock Size Real Solar System. That I believe is not updated for KSP 1.7 yet I believe. But since it\u0027s just a planet pack, it\u0027s likely it will work with 1.7.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GungaDin","CreatedById":92717,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-27T15:51:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Capture.JPG\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022330\u0022 src=\u0022http://peteyboy.net/PICS/Capture.JPG\u0022 width=\u0022613\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a shot of my Gamedata files.\u00A0 Right now my KSP launches and runs but when I start a new game under sandbox and head over to the tracking station I still see Kerbin and Mun etc...\u00A0 Can you spot anything I did wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-27T16:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223590262\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183975\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221556380273\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002292717\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GungaDin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, GungaDin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a shot of my Gamedata files.\u00A0 Right now my KSP launches and runs but when I start a new game under sandbox and head over to the tracking station I still see Kerbin and Mun etc...\u00A0 Can you spot anything I did wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the \u0022-master\u0022 part is a GitHub thing that generally means you downloaded the wrong file for that mod (source instead of releases).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that,\u00A0you\u0027ve only got ModuleManager, Kopernicus, and some textures.
