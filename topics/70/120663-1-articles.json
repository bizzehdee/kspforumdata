I built a base on Minmus which is mining ore and converts it to fuel. I connected a big red tank to it using a pipe (KIS/KAS) without any problems. After that I built a vessel (basicly a red tank which can depart and dock to a orbital station) on wheels (the really big stock ones). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first problem is that this vessel although it has wheels and worked perfectly on Kerbin is moving soooooo slowly on Minmus. It just doesnt really excellerate. It needs like 5 sec to get 0,1 m/s of velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second problem is that once I also connect it to my base using a pipe it starts to move. First really slowly but the movement becomes harder and harder, until the whole base is shaking and eventually lifts off the ground and explodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks pretty cool but still not the porpuse of the whole thing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had this problem as well on the moon. When I connect a second pipe to a base it slowly slowly starts to move and in the end gets destroyed. When it happended on the moon, I didnt actually see it. Just when I switched to the base it was a cementery of parts laying around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody have the same problem or knows whats causing it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDavid\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-11T15:43:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2015 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by David104\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vixr","CreatedById":133940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T16:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would try disabling all SAS and applying the brakes.

Minmus is often like skating on ice, though the coming wheel changes in 1.1 will hopefully improve things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, make sure you have decoupled your rover driving controls from your attitude adjustment controls (wasd). Otherwise, when you try to drive forward any reaction wheels will try to tip you forward which will reduce the grip of your rear wheels even more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-11T16:37:13Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2015 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Padishar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vixr","CreatedById":133940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T16:38:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used those giant wheels too, mine did basically the same thing...I\u0027m pretty sure all I did was add more batteries.

The reason for the slowness is that the craft actually is floating a bit over the ground. Dont know why it does that. When I looked at the status of the craft in map view it said suborbital....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just used smaller wheels (a lot of them) and its working like charme. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the floating is also the cause for the movement when connecting a pipe to it. Also, for the craft with the smaller wheels I had to put landing legs on there in order to \u0022connect\u0022 it to the ground. Without them, the vessel would spin out of control again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that the problem gets fixed with future updates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheerio! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
