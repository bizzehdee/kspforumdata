However, When I have a target selected for docking, as I approach, I don\u0027t have any indication of where my target is. Used to having the brackets [ ] and a distance i.e. 650m show in view. Right now nothing, and only can see my target ship if I manage to get with 200m or so. NavBall looks good so I can kinda get there but with no distance reference, makes it really difficult to judge approach speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a setting I need to adjust?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-17T20:36:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry pressing \u0022F4\u0022 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-17T20:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you accidentally hit F4 - that toggles the target marker on \u0026amp; off.\u00A0 I\u0027ve hit it by mistake (instead of quicksave) and didn\u0027t realize a few times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dan Kerman","CreatedById":193616,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-17T23:40:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat fixed it...\u00A0 didn\u0027t know about F4 toggle...\u00A0 problem solved!
