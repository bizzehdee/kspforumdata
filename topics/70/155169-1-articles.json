Staging and steering still work, but throttle does not. What also doesn\u0027t work, are the parachutes. They\u0027ve already been activated, but their own internal pressure/altitude/speed computation freezes. It\u0027s not that they deploy at the wrong time and get destroyed; they NEVER deploy. A few hundred meters above the sea, at about 230m/s, they still read \u0022Safe to deploy?: unsafe\u0022 have dark (I\u0027m colorblind, so I can\u0027t say what color) icons and are quite intact and undeployed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExperimentation has shown that I have full control until I drop below just under 26,000m. Around 25,800m. Before that, tapping the throttle makes the engine fire. After, nothing. If I leave the throttle set to full, at this point it drops to 0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis does correspond with my starting to use Trajectories, so I will pull that and try again once I get Jeb safely home, but I don\u0027t see how that would cause this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-18T04:13:58Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2017 04:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by cjdbass\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cjdbass","CreatedById":172996,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-18T04:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fde.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/454/997/fde.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m embarrassed.
