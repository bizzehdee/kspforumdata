It\u2019s common for larger structures with lots of parts to take longer to load and make the game run slower while loaded, but usually smaller vessels won\u2019t have much/any impact. If the base is landed on Minmus, switch off the terrain scatters as these can have a considerable effect on your frame rate when they\u2019re loaded, and double check your part count on the base itself and the vessel you\u2019re approaching it with- once you get to about 100 parts you\u2019ll start to see performance dropping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-25T04:11:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223857279\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197032\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221600655068\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201201\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Neil Kermstrong\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/21/2020 at 5:24 AM, Neil Kermstrong said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have an outpost in minmus and I\u0027m trying to upgrade it but every time I get close to it (like 2.5km) my game becomes unplayable, with fps that looks like 0FPS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really don\u0027t know why, it only has 10 parts in the base and was working just fine some time ago\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry to have many separate small vessels rather than one big one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat way you can combat the lag and improve the fps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you start docking bases on the ground and the parts go high things get ugly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-25T04:12:42Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2020 04:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Boyster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
