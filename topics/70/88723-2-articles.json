The 25fps could be from V-Sync being enabled in combination with physics calculations. I had that issue too and those were the causes of it. Sadly, I could either get 25fps constant like that and stay in the Yellow no matter what or disable V-Sync and lower my physics calculations a bit and jump between normal and yellow with the framerate jumping between 9fps and 45fps depending on where I\u0027m looking, where I\u0027m currently at (orbit, Mun, launchpad, etc) or if my trajectory leaves the planet or not -- not sure why, but the second my trajectory exits the atmosphere I gain a massive FPS boost regardless of what\u0027s going on.\u003Cp\u003EIf you can, run a 3.17 kernel and update Mesa to 10.3. You\u0027ll get a decent increase in performance. If the AMD Radeon development keeps on like it is, we should have some awesome drivers around the 3.19 or 3.20 kernel releases. It looks like AMD missed the deadline to get the AMDGPU driver added to the 3.19 kernel. Hopefully Mesa 10.4 and Kernel 3.18 will be released soon and we\u0027ll be able to use those (Mesa 10.4 due in December IIRC; Kerenl 3.18 was RC3 the last time I checked).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonaire is the codename of the R7 260x.

I apologize. I am very grateful for all of your help you guys are giving me. after 20 years I have apparently completely lost my Linux mojo, but it\u0027s slowly coming back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHowever, all this does is \u0022pipe\u0022 (|) the results of the ldd command to another command that filters the output. Grep simply outputs all the lines of input that contain the string given so it should simply output all the lines that contain \u0022Not found\u0022.\u003Cp\u003EAs for your problem with 32bit, I suspect that whatever mechanism you are using to run the 32 bit version is not setting up the path to the lib32 folder correctly.

The next problem was trying to get the dependency seen by the program. Before all that happened though, I let Manjaro do its updates (there were several hundred it kept hounding me about and I figured perhaps that might solve some problems). It proceeded to completely nuke itself, so I finally got fed up and reinstalled Mint. Trying to install the proprietary drivers using the instructions provided (essentially mkconfig and it compiles deb files, yadda yadda) resulted in bricking THAT installation, so now I\u0027ve moved onto Ubuntu 14.04. Had to head back to work so didn\u0027t get to try to blow that up with new vid drivers, so I\u0027ll proceed in doing that tomorrow, at which point I will concede defeat and just deal with the limitations of the 32 bit Winblows app until such time as Unity gets its crap together with the 64 bit stuff....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I remember why I got out of the IT business.
