It works with stock and has no MM patches or anything specifically for those modules. So if it requires Interstellar, then something Interstellar does breaks the stock intake module. If the bug doesn\u0027t require Interstellar, then the intake parts (which i note, you still haven\u0027t bothered to mention which mod they are) are likely to be set up incorrectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, I can\u0027t see any issue on FAR\u0027s end, it looks more like something else is breaking the stock code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eactually, it was on linux 64 bit. sorry about that, i think i might have just copied over the gamedata folder FROM the windows version, and it worked alright, so i really didnt care about using the unfixer on it, thought it didnt interfere much. but it turns out there was some leftover files, so yeah, sorry about that. anyways, i dont know what will fix this. i dont know what from interstellar would mess with it, so i just dont know... hm.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T19:19:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBump? any help? im not using windows 64bit atleast, actually linux.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
