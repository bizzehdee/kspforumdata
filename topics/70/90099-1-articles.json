However, a clean install with NO mods works fine. So it seems to be tied to either a corrupt save file (but all 50\u002B of them can\u0027t be corrupted), or a corrupt mod. But why would this anomaly all of a sudden appear, then will not go away with a fresh install of everything and using non-corrupt saves from months ago? (And fyi, removing EVE has no effect.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made no recent changes to my system, video card, driver, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any ideas?
