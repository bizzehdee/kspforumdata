When I am piloting any craft, when I switch to the map screen the point is always on my current ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that this is pretty shoddy writing but it\u0027s late and I just want this fixed. If you have any suggestions please just fire away! I have screenshots but imgur is down atm.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
