Yeah, I\u0027ve been around here before 2013, my stuff just got erased after the crash. I think the first build of KSP I played was when eve and the other planets were introduced... 0.16 right? Such a long way it\u0027s come and there\u0027s people here that have been around since build 1. Fantastic community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: Before trying texture compression, I tried Opengl.
