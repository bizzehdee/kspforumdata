Before I opened KSP I redownloaded all of the mods I currently use. I am currently having a problem with the aerospike engine. Whenever I load a craft with the engine all that loads is the Flame affect at 90 degrees out of alignment. I cannot click on the engine to remove it. The craft that I am trying to load is 100% stock, and loads perfectly when I remove all my mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything else seems to be working correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/SPsHV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

MechJeb and Kopernicus just to name two. ChuteSafety should be removed because it is a stock feature in the newest version of KSP. Also, Make sure you have updated all your mods to the newest version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you want some more assistance, I would try loading the game with the mods, press Alt\u002BF2 to open the debug console, let us know if you have any weird error messages. It would probably help even more if you post your Output_log file as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
