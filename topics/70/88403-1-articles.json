I\u0027ve just started trying to use my Saitek X52 joystick to fly in KSP with FAR, BDA and AGX. The axes work great, but I\u0027m facing that age-old joystick problem of not being able to use my action groups with my hand on the throttle and stick. So I went to the settings menu, and tried binding buttons on my stick to the custom actions. Fine. The buttons were recognised in the settings menu. When I went to try ingame, the action groups were not activated by pressing the buttons I\u0027d just bound to them. I tried using AGX to select the correct joystick button for the action group, and still nothing. Can anyone help me out here? Has anyone else had a similar issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Sorry about the thread placement. I know this isn\u0027t a mod problem, but I have a modded install, so with the way the forum\u0027s set up, I figure this is the place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T20:04:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAGX dev here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you go to assign the joystick button in AGX on the joystick buttons page, there should be a text box in the bottom right corner of that window that will display the name of the last button pressed, as detected by the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you press a button on the joystick, does that button name come up in the textbox? Or does the text in the textbox not change?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the text does in fact change, that means that the game is detecting the joystick button press but not executing. We should be able to do something about that. (Also, please file a bug report in AGX, the code used to display the button name is the same code used to activate the group so I need to fix that.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the text does not change, that means Unity/KSP is not recognizing the button press and you are going to have to look at something at the system level to fix this.

Despite Unity apparently recognising the button presses in the Settings menu, the action group editor isn\u0027t detecting them. Oddly, I\u0027ve managed to make my trigger (Button0 in Unity) work, by selecting it manually, and my lower trigger is working fine bound to \u0027Brakes\u0027 in the settings menu, but none of the other buttons seem to do anything at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T21:03:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the KSP settings screen allows you to bind a joystick button?

Now that is weird. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll see if I can take a look at this tomorrow, I would expect if the settings screen allows you to bind it, AGX would show it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T21:13:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that\u0027s what I thought, it\u0027s very odd. Don\u0027t break your back looking for it, because I think I\u0027m having some driver issues. (I tried to install the Saitek drivers and discovered they cause direct input lag so I deleted them and now buttons are working oddly) but that happened after this issue started, so it should be a non-issue. Again, it\u0027s looking very much like a Unity/KSP issue, because of the fact that ingame it detects my trigger presses as action group 2/brake button as bound, but none of the other buttons that it detected worked. I do think it\u0027s not worth wasting too much energy on, because apparently anyone who\u0027s gone to SQUAD suggesting an update to joystick controls recently (As in, September recently) has been given the \u0027Not interested in fixing at this time\u0027 treatment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
