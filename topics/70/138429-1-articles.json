I did a few missions, all of which were probes as I have unmanned before manned installed, and I was just about to get into manned flights and I had zero issues. That was until I accepted a tour contract. In this contract, I have to ferry 3 Kerbals from point A to point B which they all waited on KSC grounds for me to pick them up. It was after I made my vehicle in the SPH and hit launch, that KSP shot from 30% cpu usage to 85% cpu usage on a 20-part plane. I\u0027m fine going to my satellites, and I\u0027ve tried going back to the launch pad, all 85% cpu usage with heavy stuttering and VERY low FPS. I believe it is most likely these loose kerbals that are causing the heavy CPU usage. Why would they? I don\u0027t know, but everything was working perfectly until those three kerbals showed up on my doorstep. Anyway, I tried to slog through the lag to get far enough away with my plane, but KSP crashed my computer with a BSOD before I could get off the runway. Gunna try to see if a clean install will help at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2647636/Crashes/KSP.log\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP.log\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-29T06:02:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2016 06:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Budz42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
