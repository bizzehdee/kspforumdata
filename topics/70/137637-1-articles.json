In the scenario you are supposed to follow the purple rabb...eh...target into the orbital manouver, but, no matter what, after the decoupling of the expended thrusters the tutorial breaks: the instructor tells you you\u0027re off course even if you are using the SAS autopiloting function. That\u0027s amazingly annoying!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play Kerbal via CKAN (v 1.16.1) and the only mod installed is the Enivronmental Visual Enhancements (v 2:EVE-1.1-1).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny guess?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
