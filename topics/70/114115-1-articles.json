I\u0027ve found similar problem descriptions when searching the forums, however the suggested\n\ncauses didn\u0027t really seem to fit my symptoms, most were related to 32bit KSP running out of memory.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any help, as the game is turning more unplayable the further I progress. I attached the log files suggested by the \u0022get help\u0022 thread,\n\nif you need any further information please let me know.\n\nOS: Xubuntu 15.04\n\nKSP: 1.0.2 Linux 64-bit\n\nRAM: 8GB\n\nGPU: Radeon 5770 with latest catalyst driver\n\nDescription:\n\nWhen reverting a flight back to the VAB or Launch, the game crashes. I can briefly (~1sec) see the correct scene loaded. \n\nThe issue seems to correlate with the number of parts in the ship, I have never seen it with small (\u003C50parts vessels). \n\nHowever, I\u0027ve also had problem-free launches with ships with well over 100 parts. \n\nI have attached a craft (~250parts) that crashes the game everytime I reproduce the steps above. \n\nThe game hovers around 3.5GB of memory usage (so there is plenty available) with the ship loaded in the VAB or flying.\n\nI\u0027ve had similar problems using the windows version, I was hoping that switching to 64bit (and therefore linux) would help.\n\nNote: I ran the game as root, otherwise (part of) the log file would say that it could not attach the debugger...\n\nList of installed mods: [http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=fp7L8Dp6](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=fp7L8Dp6)\n\nplayer.log: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/l95gcwb6vx9vx8p/Player.log.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l95gcwb6vx9vx8p/Player.log.zip?dl=0)\n\ncraft file: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/jcc82dx6g7ea4rf/K%C3%A4fa%20I.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jcc82dx6g7ea4rf/K%C3%A4fa%20I.craft?dl=0)\n\nThank you in advance for your help and best regards!"},{"CreatedByName":"Owand","CreatedById":146968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T16:17:06Z","Content":"Hello, same problem.\n\nOS: Windows 7 x64\n\nKSP: 1.0.4\n\nRAM: 8GB\n\nGPU: GeForce GTX 760\n\nI only use Kerbal Engineer Redux 1.0.17 (released for KSP 1.0.4 compatibility) as a mod\n\nMaybe a specific vanilla part creating a crash, or Kerbal En?\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"Owand","CreatedById":146968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T17:30:57Z","Content":"Ok, for now the game crashes for me with one specific ship ONLY when I attach a rover subassembly inside a Service Bay (2.5m), as Scott Manley does in his career mode video :\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/LzQ4t7gjKcs?start=570\u0026feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nBUT, rather than attaching it with a decoupler as he does (works for me too, without a crash ; EDIT: Crashed today), I\u0027d attach it with two Jr. docking ports.
