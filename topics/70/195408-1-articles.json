The problem is, the mod changes the default planet, so the gravity, atmospheric density, and aerodynamic forces are all different. I also have a world where I\u0027ve done lots of thing with the planets in the mod. I don\u0027t know if removing the mod to work on planes with Kerbin in one world would corrupt another that needs the mod, even if I didn\u0027t interact with the modded world while the mod was uninstalled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-07T11:08:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would suggest you don\u2019t uninstall planet packs if you have anything orbiting and especially don\u2019t open the save game or things can get ugly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can just copy\u00A0the entire KSP directory and create\u00A0a second version, remove the mods from that and test your plane on Kerbin before copying the craft file into the modded version and using it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ravioley","CreatedById":205858,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-07T11:12:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m mostly new to a lot of stuff with file editing, so how would I copy the KSP directory?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-07T11:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223816421\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195408\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221594120332\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205858\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ravioley\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, Ravioley said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m mostly new to a lot of stuff with file editing, so how would I copy the KSP directory?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust find your Kerbal Space Program folder, right click, click \u0027copy\u0027, navigate to a different folder, and right click to paste.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
