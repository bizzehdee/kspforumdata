I am 100% certain there is an encounter. After the Minmus encounter there will be a Mun encounter, and this one is showing up. If I burn in any direction, sufficiently to avoid entering the Mun SOI, the Minmus encounter appears. So the bug only happens if in the same orbit happens an encounter with the Mun.\n\nI tried restarting the game and the computer, and nothing changed. I waited to see if it was just a numerical non-convergence problem, but apparently not.\n\nScreenshot: ![rxwUrrk.png](http://i.imgur.com/rxwUrrk.png)\n\nThe Minmus encounter will happen at the 2nd intersection, after 15d 6h (even without the maneuver mode, it is just a slight correction to enter Minmus orbit with desired inclination), and the Mun encounter will happen after 20d 4h.\n\nI\u0027m using KSP v1.0.4.861.\n\nI have some mods installed, but none that alters gameplay:\n\nAsteroid Day 1.0\n\nChatterer 0.9.6\n\nCollisionFX 3.2\n\nDistant Object Enhancement bis 1.5.7\n\nPlanetShine 0.2.3.1\n\nIt happend in a carrer save with level 2 Tracking Station. I will try to replicate the problem in sandbox, but it may take a while."}]}
