Not having a nVidia GFX would not have required installation of GeForce Experience; however please check it really isn\u0027t around on your system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe above doesn\u0027t exclude other software could do the same (intercepting Alt-F12). However no other software doing so is currently known. You may have to stop background applications one-by-one and test each time to find when the functionality is restored (in Windows, Task Manager conveniently allows to terminate anything running), be careful however about not shutting system services unless you know what they do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
