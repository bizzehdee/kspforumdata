(UNLESS, IIRC, you have WU set to NEVER check for updates)\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese processes are memory sucking PIA\u0027s... They do not shut down until ALL updates are either downloaded \u0026amp; installed, OR hidden. I\u0027ve found that even though these processes do not max out RAM, my computer will be VERY sluggish with them running... So I\u0027m guessing, they somehow are very CPU intensive, as well?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve found once you download updates, its best to immediately shutdown, and reboot EVEN if Windows Update does NOT give you warning that you have to restart.... I\u0027ve ALSO found that once you restart, its best to restart YET again... This 2nd restart clears out the Windows Update processes that open again even after the 1st restart, I assume to re-check for updates to make sure you got them all, AND to make sure the ones that got installed, are installed correctly... Unfortuntaely, those processes seem to sometimes stay open indefinately, until a 2nd restart...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is one reason, of several, why I HATE Windows Update, and one reason why I have been using Linux more and more as my main OS... It also doesnt help Microsoft\u0027s case, that they have that \u0022Get Win10\u0022 abomination of a horrible marketing tool they try to slyly pass off as an update, that is constantly triggering updates if you ignore it or dont keep hiding it, even if there are no updates available.
