However, though I can see the broken part, I can do nothing on it. I cannot select or highlight it whatever I tried. I launched 2 times, as the first time I thought it was because I had only 3 repair kits onboard, and from what I could read the Gigantor needs 4. But the two times I was unable to do anything.

This time, the \u0022original panel\u0022 was clickable and hoverable, but the opposite panel, the one to repair was his turn unclickable and unselectable, exactly like the other one was.
