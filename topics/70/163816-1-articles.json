I am really just curious on why, it does not show up in non modded, the moment I drop in the mods it shows there. I was wondering why that is, and does it mean I have done something wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The Blank Screen - Alright this one is new and I have no clue why or what happened I have tried removing things to see what is causing it and I am at the point where I have a list of mods that worked in another GameData Folder, but not in this one. SO, here is what happens, \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETHIS IS NOT A CRASH\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0I need to stress that, there is no crash log. the game loads, it patches, it come ups to main menu. I select the format I want to play in. It loads, then it just keeps loading. and loading. and loading. and loading. It sits at a blank screen with the loading animation in the lower right corner. I can move the mouse, I can click everywhere. When I click it turns green like it should to show the button you are clicking. The one interesting thing that happens is, it will show the \u003Cem\u003ERemoteTech\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0mod popup window, that explains what to use RT for and how to change it, etc. Then when I close that, we get the blank loading screen. I am not sure why....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is running in the 64-bit client, I am testing a fresh install with some things removed, (Visual Enhancement Wise) to see if it is a texture loading issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you need any other information, obviously ask I will provide what ever I can.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Update: As I am about to post this, I got it to work. I removed Kopernicus and all Visual Enchantment Mods... Will try slipping Kopern\u00A0Back in and see if it changes the game still would like a plausible explanation so I can self Diagnose next time more effectively)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
