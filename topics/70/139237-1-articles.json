This bug (that I\u0027ll explain in a sec) went away temporarily (for some reason) when I started KSP via the launcher and it began updating something. But then the next day, I started up KSP again and the bug re-appeared. I investigated further and came to the conclusion that it only happens when I add the \u003Cem\u003ETailFin\u003C/em\u003E to my craft. But basically, where ever I place the TailFin, that part of my craft gets glued to the runway, and is partially floating in the air. As shown here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fG4EhWFl.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fG4EhWFl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Front of craft is floating above runway, stuck and can\u0027t move)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022O77TR0Ol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O77TR0Ol.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Front of craft floating above runway, can\u0027t move)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it doesn\u0027t matter if I have the landing gear or not. This will happen without the landing gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also (In the 2nd picture) turned on SAS and pitched forward while going full throttle, and the rear of my craft lifted up into the air, but it couldn\u0027t move because the front was still glued to the ground (or air above it) for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I have a few mods:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BbIhCdL.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BbIhCdL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027ve also come to the conclusion that this only occurs when I have ModularFuelTanks(Which depends on MM) and FAR (Which depends on MFI \u0026amp; MM) installed at the same time. But I\u0027ve talked to the developers and they can\u0027t find anything wrong.
