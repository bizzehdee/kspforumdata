Untill I had a manned mission on the pad.\n\nThe game started to stutter extensively and become somewhat unresponsive. \n\nThe in game performance graph showed continues very short fsp drops to below 8fps, while the tops stayed around 38.\n\nFirst of all, I noticed this **only occured** when a capsule is **manned** with a kerbal(s), **unmanned all is smooth**.\n\nSo started to remove all mods that might have script relations to crews. \n\nFinally removed all mods untill the game was completely stock. Still it stutters when any capsule is manned, unmanned is still smooth as silk.\n\nThe ksp logs doesn\u0027t show anything odd, like errors or missing data.\n\nAnyone know what is going on, or if this is a known issue?\n\nMy system specs:\n\nOS: Win7 x64\n\nCPU: Intel X5460 @3.8\n\nRAM: 6Gb ddr800\n\nGPU: (2x) HD5770\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T22:47:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gkirmathal**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gkirmathal","CreatedById":135480,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T22:55:58Z","Content":"Did a full clean install of KSP just now and on -force-d3d11 the game still stutters severly when a craft has a crew in it.

I would like to know a few technical things about KSP, not related to d3d11/ogl/d3d9c: \n\n- how are the Kerbal 3d models \u002B 3d internals handled? As the issue only occurs when craft is crewed: \n\n*- What is the difference in what KSP does/renders/loads between: a crewed craft and the same non crewed craft, when it is loaded into the world space?*\n\n*- Does KSP 1.0.x, when you view the craft from the outside, render the crew 3d models and internals that are within the craft 3xternal 3d model??* \n\nReason to ask the above: \n\nwhen I increased *Max Physics D-Time per Frame* from 0.04 \u003E 0.12, the fps dips/stutters became less on said manned craft.\n\nThis led me to think: UNITY might be rendering Kerbal 3d models within the external 3d model of a craft when viewed in the 3rd person (?) and that there are then physics calculations being done on those Kerbal 3d models within the craft.\n\nRender technique then indeed could be an influence and there might also be a difference in how NV and AMD handles them with each technique.\n\nAs everything else with d3d11 in 1.0.4 works flawlessly compared to 0.90, only thing now: what are those those pesky crews doing? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAre these questions that need to be asked on the UNITY forums as well, or are they KSP specific enough?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T21:45:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 09:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gkirmathal**"}]}
