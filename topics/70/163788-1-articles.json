When I install something like SVE,\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E or even just scatterer, I\u0027m often getting yellow when physics warping, and sometimes red. Is that an indication that my processor cannot handle the additional workload of those mods, or will a faster GFX card help that? My system currently has an i7 7700, so I rarely see even yellow when not using visual mods, but my GFX card is only a HD7870.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo","CreatedById":150430,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-28T05:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, you are bottle necking pretty bad with that card.

Most players will have a yellow/red timer during physics warp, also if no mods are installed. Your GPU is upper middle class nowadays, the HD 7870 GHz Edition is (nearly) identical to the R9 370X, and the HD 7870 XT is even slightly faster than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom my experience \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E causes quite some CPU load (maybe, if I get extremely bored, I might profile it one day...), and most visual mods have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E as a dependency. For that reason I would not automatically assume that upgrading your GPU will yield green time display during high physics warp when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E is installed, though it will certainly help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-28T19:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnical kind of question has been moved to the technical subforum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
