Secondly, afaik, there\u0027s no compatibility with 1.05 at all. Thirdly, did you follow all the instructions? You say you installed scatterer, rve and eve. You can\u0027t just install EVE. You need specific versions of it to work with RVE. You don\u0027t say which versions of what you have installed so without knowing more information there\u0027s little anyone can do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pingopete","CreatedById":74168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-30T20:58:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is an old\u00A0eve\u00A0bug, please read the rve forums page op, and install instructions, when you launch you need to open eve gui and hit apply.
