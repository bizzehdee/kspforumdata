Sometimes it also \u0022accelerates\u0022 (acts as if an engine is on) and the orbit changes when it\u0027s not supposed to. It happens under acceleration or freefall, with autopilot or SAS on or off, with torque wheels on or off. It has happened in Kerbin orbit, sun orbit, Ike escape trajectory into Duna orbit, in atmo during Duna aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is actually two ships: the nuclear tug in the back and the lander/science ship in the front. The lander/science ship seems to be the problem: it has happened once or twice just to that with the tug undocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can I design the ship so this won\u0027t happen? KSP is pretty much unplayable with this relatively uncomplicated ship, it took countless quick-saves to get to Duna. I did use the terrible barely-working \u0022Rockomax HubMax Multi-Point Connector\u0022 piece, and the four \u0022arms\u0022 on the lander attached to that piece wouldn\u0027t work with symmetry. I created one arm, and then had to copy/rotate it to create the other 3. Is that the problem? Or is it something entirely unrelated to the hub max piece?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT see this thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92341-Return-of-the-Kraken\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92341-Return-of-the-Kraken\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-30T20:49:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2014 08:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jaevko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
