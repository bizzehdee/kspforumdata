As long as you don\u0027t have a really cool craft you built using KW, you may consider some replacement like AIES or HGR. Of course, if the community fixes work (I haven\u0027t tried them yet) you can ignore the last sentence. But yeah, update ModuleManager and see what gives. If it doesn\u0027t work, you can try going to the ModuleManager forum page, there might be more qualified people there."},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-20T18:09:40Z","Content":"[https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/KW-Rocketry-Community-Fixes](https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/KW-Rocketry-Community-Fixes)\n\nthat\u0027s your solution right there."},{"CreatedByName":"NemesisBosseret","CreatedById":160131,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T17:25:40Z","Content":"Lol I\u0027ve currently got a similar issue but I get stuck in different spots.

Or is it a possible other issue?   Yes I know 64bit is unsupported and I\u0027m not trying to cry about me getting around this,  I\u0027m just trying to find a way to make it fully work.   \n\nA majority of mods I\u0027m using probably should be in the stock Game as well\n\nMcjeb \n\nScan sat\n\nRemote tech\n\nSeti \n\nEVE\n\nStage recovery \n\nLots of stock alike parts\n\nMk4 \n\nKw  (yes it fully works)\n\nTrajectories \n\nKerbal engineer\n\nVoid\n\nAnd assortment of science mods, ie biomes better science,  better stations etc\n\nFasa is also installed but that\u0027s because I love the old school rockets \n\nAnd so on.  Almost everyone of the mods I currently have worked fine in 1.0.4.  A few where a little buggy, otherst like OPT I didn\u0027t install because a majority of them was broken. \n\nSo if you might have an idea hit me up, I\u0027ll try it in 64 bit, if I can get it to work then we can start a thread on a work around or fix for 64 bit... might help developers get the game back out in 64"}]}
