I then went on to do an Apollo style munar landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first thing that didn\u0027t work was the Ascent Guidance. My orbit should be at 100km and the craft flew until the apoapsis was at 100km and then waited till it is at the apoapsis to start a prograde burn to get the periapsis up. However, the craft never burns prograde at the apoapsis. It does nothing and will crash into Kerbin. The second thing is when I try to make and let MEchJeb execute a manouver node to get to the mun, MechJeb sets the manouver node but doesn\u0027t execute it (I clicked execute). When I\u0027m in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of the Mun I can make a note and execute it to get the periapsis and apoapsis up. This time it works. The docking works. Then I undock the lander and click on Landing Guidance and pick a landing spot. Now MechJeb does absoulutely nothing. I tried all of the above multiple times and I have the same issues over and over again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I tried the Mun landing with the stock Accapello (I think that\u0027s the name. It\u0027s from the Making History DLC)\u00A0rocket and these problems occured. I then tried a Mun landing with the stock PT Series Munsplorer\u00A0and everything worked fine with MechJeb. Maybe this helps\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone help me with this problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-10T20:25:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2020 08:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by lars163\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
