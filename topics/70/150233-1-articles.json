I didnt see this issue in a stock build either but there is an issue if you set the UI scale above 100% so it could be related to that. Totally guessing but I do believe its a mod issue of some sort, maybe related to triple screen setups or something strang like that. Hopefully someone will figure it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
