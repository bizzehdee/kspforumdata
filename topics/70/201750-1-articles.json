After around 10 sounding rockets, I finally had enough science to attempt orbit, and I did so by copying YouTubers Carnasa\u0027s beginner orbital rocket design. It works perfectly, and MechJeb has helped me fly it, but the last stage has completely flopped. The final stage is an uncontrollable rocket with the aerobee engine, the tank is pressurized and has enough Delta V to get my periapsis to 140 km, but when I try to ignite the engine, a prompt with the text \u0022Insufficient avionics 0.000t out of 0.625t supported.\u0022 In my previous uncontrollable rockets this wasn\u0027t and issue, and they flew perfectly fine without this prompt. For some reason however, this stage of this specific rocket is causing problems.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/gallery/jdp7c9U\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/gallery/jdp7c9U\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(this picture might help \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy probe is set to Avionics Prototype and Scientific - Core, and in Carnasa\u0027s video, the prompt popped up on the screen but the engine still fired up.
