Upon trying to fix these issues, the game crashes. I decide to check ksp.log as I usually do to try to find the thing which crashed the game. The logfile itself was extremely large, and I found out why; something was spamming \u0022Ignore collision failed. Both colliders need to be activated when calling this IgnoreCollision\u0022 every millisecond or half-millisecond. I\u0027m not sure if it relates to my plane\u0027s exploding issues (as it was being caused by a part colliding into another part, it may.) I have no idea which addon could be causing this, as of course if I remove one, the plane will not be spawnable. Is this a known issue with one of my mods (linked below) or is it just 2 mods hating each other?\n\nKSP Gamedata Folder as of now:\n\n![434271196c8d11e384f079b4210d813d.png](http://i.gyazo.com/434271196c8d11e384f079b4210d813d.png)\n\nThanks in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T18:05:18Z","Content":"Could you post the entire output log?
