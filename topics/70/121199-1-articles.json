I\u0027m a mod addict, unfortunately, and I might have installed some incompatible mods without realizing it. Next thing I know, some of the planes I had previously made suddenly don\u0027t have any lift. Here\u0027s an ADFX-01 Morgan replica that I had made previously as an example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YDV93pB.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022YDV93pB.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMakes it handle like a rocket. I uninstalled the mods to get it to a previously working state and even did a complete reinstall of KSP to make sure the physics went back to vanilla. Even so, it still gets this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd weirdly, for some aircraft, it still works, like this CFA-44 Nosferatu I built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IEXV2eQ.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022IEXV2eQ.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, whenever I try to adjust the wings or place new ones down, the indicator for the lift doesn\u0027t change, and from what I can tell, the flight performance stays the same as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8Lgm8BH.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u00228Lgm8BH.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny pointers would be helpful, like what data I can get to help debug.
