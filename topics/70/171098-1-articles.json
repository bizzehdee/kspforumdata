The good method I know is to make a folder outside of gamedata, then move all elements, except \u0022Squad\u0022 and ModuleManager.* there.\u00A0 Afterwards, for each step, add the mod - either one by one; or add a half of original amount(paying attention to dependencies) and then if regression is detected, move the half after half outside of the gamedata. The \u0022half\u0022 method is faster than one-by-one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. There are several bottlenecking possibilities, if KSP hits one of them - it will influence framerate. Mods that add contracts, cause background polling, modify drag calculations, vehicle distances, texture and geometrical complexities, increase graphic effects in all possible ways(shaders, smoke fx, extra models, extra textures etc), also shadows and light sources. Of course, also, open docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome mods may actually increase memory usage,yet also increase framerate(!). This is happened to me with Stock Visual Terrain on surface of Val. I was very surprised! Also I got no penalty for Terrain Detail neither on\u00A0 Kerbin, nor on Mun - but visually quality went down. I also recommend to test how stock terrain detail, scene rendering quality and aerodynamic effects influence the fps, when running fully stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a good way to find mods that affect performance. In general, the way current KSP works, single-thread performance of your CPU plays major role. Mostly because bottleneck happens in draw calls, which are connected with geometry complexity and amount of models. Here welding mod will not help, because it does not weld the models themselves. But if you happen to have a lot of joints - then either part-mod or welding is a way to go, as it would be physics calculation that drags fps down. However using mod which gives larger capacity parts (reducing total part count) or models with less polygons - should improve performance. \u0022Should\u0022 because the OS environment also matters - the graphic card driver, graphic card itself, CPU scheduler of OS kernel, - they all contribute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there is mod method and text-edit method to reduce the underwater details of the Kerbin at certain altitude, which will help performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eberkain","CreatedById":157548,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-26T11:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223305055\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171098\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221519629479\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175313\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Krakatoa\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Krakatoa said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould you care to share what those might be?
