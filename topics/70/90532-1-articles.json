That said -- I\u0027m a power-user of Windows with more than twenty five years experience using it. I have other always-on programs that I use on an employment basis that are Windows-only that will not port to Linux. My willingness to this point to use Linux at all (read: formatted and repartitioned my ssd to accommodate a dualboot Linux partition) has been for this specific task -- making mod-heavy KSP videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease understand, I recognize the whiney nature of my post here. I\u0027m not complaining about KSP performance directly, I\u0027m complaining about interactivity, which is NOT Squad\u0027s problem. I get that. I\u0027ve run into references to JACK and other utilities. I don\u0027t doubt that they would be very useful -- \u003Cem\u003Eif I knew how to frickin use them\u003C/em\u003E, which I don\u0027t, and cannot afford to invest the time to learn.

I can\u0027t do that with my computer, still enjoy what I\u0027m accomplishing, and maintain my offline responsibilities at the same time. Have you seen the smug attitudes on even the Ubuntu forums, let alone those on Arch? Microsoft evolved away from command line command interfaces twenty years ago. I still can\u0027t seem to disable duplicated HDMI audio devices, I do NOT have an innate understanding of Terminal or bash commands, and it took me four days of pulling my hair out to finally discover that this \u0022sudo apt-get\u0022 nonsense was actually case-sensitive for all terms and operands. The fact that my NumLock key won\u0027t cooperate, and cut/paste don\u0027t work the same as I have learned to expect, only add fuel to my ire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr Thank you. I\u0027ve tried what I\u0027m willing to try in Linux. One might as well suggest to me, \u0022Have you tried buying a MacBook? The Mac x64 version of KSP works pretty decent, too.\u0022 I haven\u0027t tried that, and I\u0027m sure there are Linux things I haven\u0027t tried. (If someone were willing to actively work with me -- I \u003Cstrong\u003Elike\u003C/strong\u003E the idea of learning Linux more thoroughly and becoming more of a power user -- please PM me. I\u0027ll me happy to invest some more time.) My question here is in parallel to all of that: while I lick my wounds and try to make up for twenty five years of Linux-ignorance in doses of a few hours per week, what\u0027s the state of Win64? We all know that by the time I get stable and usable in Linux, Win64 will be here, and I\u0027ll have to migrate back. :-\\\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T21:25:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn case you didn\u0027t know, Mac doesn\u0027t actually have a x64 build. Mac only has a x32 build. Just FYI. @Padishar made a good point that U5 is still in beta, so it\u0027s unlikely that Squad will even use it. And as @sarbian pointed out, even if Squad did change to U5, its likely that most of the scripting will have to be changed to accommodate the new structure of U5. And also that new wheel system. I would say that at this point in time, it is unlikely that the x64 build will be COMPLETELY stable at version 0.90, but I would think that some bugs would be fixed at least making the x64 build playable/less unstable than it currently is.
