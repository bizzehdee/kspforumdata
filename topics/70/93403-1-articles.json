I\u0027m having a couple of issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I can\u0027t use openGL anymore to conserve memory anymore - when I try to use it in 0.90, the game has problems loading, only 1/4th of the screen shows up and the anti-aliasing doesn\u0027t work. I\u0027m not sure why this would quit working, anyone have ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) MK3 cockpit - okay, so I\u0027m wondering if this is a bug related to a mod I have or if the cockpit is actually broken. First of all, the IVA on the MK3 is completely broken. Did they really leave it out or is my game acting up? There is literally no IVA view, if I go to IVA I get blackness and the kerbal portraits even show blackness behind them on the bottom right. Second, it would appear the MK3 doesn\u0027t have SAS - is this normal or is my game acting up? It\u0027s telling me no kerbals are aboard the ship (when they are) and no vessels have SAS installed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"justspace103","CreatedById":64088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T01:47:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had the same problem with the Open GL thing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziff","CreatedById":27566,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T02:20:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Mk3 IVA view was left out of the update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T02:21:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Use -popupwindow parameter.

Kinda surprised they would leave it out the way they did. I thought at the very least it would have the original MK-3 cockpit until a new one was implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m kinda bummed out about the open GL issues. It saved a decent amount of memory using it. I\u0027m still going to experiment with it. I know a thing or two about Unity, I\u0027m a developer myself. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
