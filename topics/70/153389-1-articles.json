I am playing in career mode and have set so that new parts require an initial purchase. Anything that hasn\u0027t had that initial purchase just doesn\u0027t show up at all now, so I have no way to purchase things. Specifically I have noticed this on some solar panels. I have unlocked the\u00A0SP-W 3x2 Photovoltaic Panels, and those show up, but the\u00A0SP-L 1x6 Photovoltaic Panels are no where to be seen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
