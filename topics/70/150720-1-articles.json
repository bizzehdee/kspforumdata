Turning on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E allows me to use the jets, but it has no impact on the movement of my kerbal. \u00A0It just animates and uses monoprop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe odd thing is, the EVA worked fine the first time when I originally landed, but I knocked my craft over bumping into it. So I reloaded the quick save I did upon landing, and that\u0027s when the problem started. \u00A0I tried going to a different craft and coming back, but the same issue arrises.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother discovery, I decided to take off and try to re-land hoping that would fix the issue. \u00A0However, my craft will not leave the surface. \u00A0It stays at 0 m/s even when the jets are running at full thrust. \u00A0Its almost as if the craft became bound to the surface and thats what is causing my kerbal to glitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve now resolved the issue by completely exiting KSP, and re-loading. \u00A0While I don\u0027t require help, I thought this issue should be documented for anyone else experiencing similar issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal Kommander","CreatedById":167507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-24T05:05:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got some weirdness going on. \u00A0I just went to launch a craft, and my entire craft just started floating off the launchpad before I did anything. \u00A0When I tried to launch, thrust again has no effect on the rocket. \u00A0Seems it probably is a mod causing an issue somewhere. \u00A0Probably related to the last fiasco. \u00A0I\u0027ll report back when I figure this out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo","CreatedById":150430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-24T05:12:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222820632\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022150720\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477285506\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167507\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbal Kommander\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, Kerbal Kommander said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got some weirdness going on. \u00A0I just went to launch a craft, and my entire craft just started floating off the launchpad before I did anything. \u00A0When I tried to launch, thrust again has no effect on the rocket. \u00A0Seems it probably is a mod causing an issue somewhere. \u00A0Probably related to the last fiasco. \u00A0I\u0027ll report back when I figure this out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit is definitely mod\u00A0related.
