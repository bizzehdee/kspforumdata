I have separated the station to 9 parts, what i need to launch. \u003Cstrong\u003EI have 2 more parts and i don\u0027t know why, the eights (8) part I launched and when i\u0027m approaching the station at 200 meters the station destorys itself completly.\u003C/strong\u003E The station is with persistent rotaion oriented with radial in, to Kerbin. I\u0027m controlling the station with a standard coupola, i control from here. So when i approach it, the station I\u00A0don\u0027t know, possibly to normal or antinormal orienting\u00A0instant itself and after that it\u0027s collapsing to little parts. \u003Cstrong\u003EI tried to switch the controlling module, but it doesn\u0027t worked.\u00A0I tried to disable autostruts\u003C/strong\u003E, it doesn\u0027t worked,\u003Cstrong\u003E i tried to disable the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, it doesn\u0027t worked, \u003Cstrong\u003Ei tried to disable the Persistent Rotation mod,\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0it doesn\u0027t worked (Before this I never had problems with the persistent rotation mod, and I\u00A0think, that now not this is the problem too). \u003Cstrong\u003EI tried to enable in the cheat menu (alt\u002BF12) these unbreakable joints, unlimited heat resistence and i dont know what yet (the first 3 things not including the gravity),\u003C/strong\u003E but it doesn\u0027t worked too. Oh yeah, and when I\u00A0switch to the station it happens this thing too with it. Only in warp I\u00A0can make the switch without destroying itself, and when I turn off the warp, it destroys itself too. I don\u0027t know how to fix this, but please help me guys, because I\u00A0worked on this station many hours and days.
