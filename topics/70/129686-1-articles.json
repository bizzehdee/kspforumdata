I don\u0027t understand this, because when I fixed it by updating last time, GPU RAM usage happily went over the 2048 MB I had, up to around 2700 MB usage and was absolutely fine with no crashing of Firefox or KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGTX 670, newest drivers, 16 GB system RAM, Windows 10, newest KSP, a ton of mods (that worked fine earlier), active texture management might be worth mentioning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gajbooks","CreatedById":98553,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T01:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that Active Texture Management doesn\u0027t manage memory as well as OpenGL, and the \u0022read only\u0022 option causes it to crash sometimes.
