The parts that appear to be sagging are batteries (the larger 1000ecs), the Oscar tanks (placed in a line, horizontal to ground, parallel to craft body)\u00A0and the Science Jr,\u00A0when used as part of a body of an aircraft or rover. Not even Rigid Attachment helps here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe behavior occurs BEFORE the craft is ever used, as it loads onto the runway, horizontally. I have not seen this occur on vertical craft (rockets).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue almost seems as if the craft has struck the surface, bending upward, even if the part can never bend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAttempts to reinforce these by clipping fixed length items through them, such as a girder, has limited success. I don\u0027t tend to clip parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut even when I do not use autostrut, the behavior continues. When adding individual strut parts to reinforce these items, they sometimes stay in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods are mostly graphic now, only one non-stock part mod used (Bon Voyage).

I tend to use autostrut on them but never Rigid, which glues the ports permanently on loading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advice or confirmation of issues with bending craft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-10T19:34:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2021 07:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by OrbitsR4Sissies\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
