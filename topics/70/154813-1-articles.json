You can catch it early and stabilize it manually, but the second you let go of the controls it will start spinning again.\u00A0Also, the assignments in the settings sometime revert to one particular axis for each function.\u00A0 These\u00A0have\u00A0happened for me every KSP version since 1.0.4 and usually the way I fix it is to delete the setting file and let the game re-create it...everything works fine and dandy after that...not so this time. I\u0027ve tried searching the internet for a couple of days now and I get nothing. Has anyone ever run on to this issue with this flight stick? Anyone got any ideas at all? If I unplug the flight stick, everything works like normal...but I really like the throttle on the extreme 3d, it allows for precise control of my capable\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E crafts...darned handy for landing on planets with no atmospheres.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-11T02:05:54Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2017 02:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by bsooner77\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-11T16:20:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like the stick is worn out \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123485-bsooner77/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022123485\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123485-bsooner77/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bsooner77\u003C/a\u003E, and one axis is always triggering an input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsooner77","CreatedById":123485,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T01:26:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks very much \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/16426-sal_vager/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002216426\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/16426-sal_vager/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@sal_vager\u003C/a\u003E! \u00A0I tested it a bit further and indeed, the twist control is somehow messed up.
