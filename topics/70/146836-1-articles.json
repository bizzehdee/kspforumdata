I had three small radiators. The escape burn to dres was complete and i was just waiting for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E to alert me when i entered the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of Dres. I switched the ship one day just to check on batteries and such things and all i found was a husk. I am using B9, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and i believe that is it and all their associated mods and recommendations from install with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E. I also had sent a upgrade mission to the probe while it was still in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to add to oscar b tanks and a two fuel cells with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. I have no idea why it blew up but the next transfer window is like 200 days away and im just stumped. When i left the craft the radiators were left on but there should have no excess heat coming from the ship, everything was powered down. Let me know what y\u0027all think. I will try to attach a photo of ship when i get home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeafy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
