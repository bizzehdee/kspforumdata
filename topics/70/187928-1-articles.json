My new monitor is a\u00A0MSI optix mag27c:\u00A0https://www.msi.com/Monitor/Optix-MAG27C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I installed the monitor I set\u00A0the refresh rate at 120\u00A0Hz without encountering any problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday,\u00A0I decided to look at KSP, with my new monitor. Unfortunately, the\u00A0Monitor signalling in/out (look\u00A0random). Outside the game, no problem, but when I played KSP, the\u00A0in/out monitor was a recurring issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe monitor\u00A0is able to display its refresh rate. Outside the game, it was always at 120 Hz. When I played KSP the refresh rate was constantly changing (from 59 to 83 hz). After noticing that, I changed the refresh rate of the monitor to 60 Hz and it solve the KSP problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to know if that situation is normal? Is it possible to play KSP at 120 Hz (or any other refresh rate)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-06T04:33:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2019 04:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Angleton\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
