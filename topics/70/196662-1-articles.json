If not, I\u0027ll continue debugging and testing, then post logs and photos if still unsolved. I\u0027ve just started playing with 1.10.1 and am still testing and debugging mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 1: Sometimes antennas look like they are extended on the launch pad even though they are retracted in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. As a result, the dish passes through the \u003Cu\u003Estock\u003C/u\u003E fairing that contains them. The antenna\u0027s part window says the antenna is still retracted despite what the graphic shows. If I launch, aero forces act like antenna really is deployed. If I use the part window manually to extend and immediately retract the antenna, the graphic glitch and aero behavior seem to fix themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 2: \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EProcedural\u003C/u\u003E Fairings\u003C/em\u003E shape themselves as if a deployable antenna is always extended in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, so I get weird super-wide fairings. Such craft fly okay but are ugly and more draggy than if the fairing were narrower, but the fairing is shielding the parts. If I manually reshape the fairing around the retracted antenna shape, then the antenna is not shielded even though it\u0027s inside the fairing. The extend\u002Bretract workaround for issue 1 does not help procedural fairings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-02T05:43:41Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2020 05:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by DeadJohn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropian","CreatedById":205453,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-04T17:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had a similar thing like issue 1 in 1.9.1 with solar panels.\u00A0 They\u0027re partially extended inflight, but in the editor they are retracted.\u00A0 The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E says they are retracted though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
