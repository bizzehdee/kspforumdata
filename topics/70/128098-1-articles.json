After some time playing I can\u0027t go into any VAB or SPH, launch any vehicle from either the runway or the launch pad, if I\u0027m on the VAB or the SPH I can\u0027t exit them or launch anything from them, if I\u0027m on a launched vehicle I can\u0027t go back to KSC. I tried using the solution posted \u003Ca href=\u0022\u0022 rel=\u0022external\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, but it seems like it doesn\u0027t apply to me as I haven\u0027t fired/killed any kerbal. Still checked and I only have the 4 starting kerbals and 2 that are part of contracts that I haven\u0027t accepted yet. Also read somewhere that apparently Texture Replacer had something to do, but after removing the bug still happens. Since I\u0027m using S.A.V.E and Dated Quick Saves I\u0027ve been able to go back to points where KSC hadn\u0027t bugged\u00A0yet in order to see if it was the case, but still after some time playing it happens again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my list of mods\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html\u0022\u003E\nKerbalEngineerRedux\nScienceAlert\nStationScience\nChuteSafetyIndicator\nActiveTextureManagement-x86-Basic\nAdjustableLandingGear\nAlternateResourcePanel\nAmpYearPowerManager\nAsteroidDay\nAviationLights\nB9\nB9AerospaceProceduralParts\nB9AnimationModules\nBetterCrewAssignment\nBetterScienceLabsContinued\nCapCom\nChatterer\nColorCodedCans\nColorfulFuelLines\nCommunityResourcePack\nCommunityTechTree\nContractConfigurator\nContractConfigurator-FieldResearch\u0022\nContractConfigurator-InitialContracts\nContractConfigurator-KerbinSpaceStation\nContractConfigurator-RemoteTech\nContractConfigurator-Tourism\u0022\nContractsWindowPlus\nCriticalTemperatureGauge\nCrowdSourcedFlags\nCrowdSourcedScience\nCustomBarnKit\nDangIt\nDatedQuickSaves\nKopernicus\nDockingPortAlignmentIndicator\nEnhancedNavBall\nETT\nEVAEnhancements\nEVAOK\nExtraPlanetaryLaunchpads\nFieldExperience\nFilterExtensions\nFilterExtensionsStockRework\nFinalFrontier\nFirespitter\nFirespitterCore\nFirespitterResourcesConfig\u0022\nForScienceContinued\nGregroxsColoredEVAIVASuits\nInfernalRobotics\nInterstellarFuelSwitch\nInterstellarFuelSwitch-Core\nKarbonite\nKarbonitePlus\nKAS\nKerbalAircraftExpansion\u0022\nKerbalAlarmClock\nKerbalJointReinforcement\nKerbalPlanetaryBaseSystems\nKerbalScienceExchange\nKIS\nKSPInterstellarExtended\nKWRocketry\nKWRocketry-CommunityFixes\nLandingHeight\nLSPFlags\nModuleManager\nNavballDockingIndicator\nOuterPlanetsMod\nPortraitStats\nRasterPropMonitor\nRasterPropMonitor-Core\u0022\nRCSBuildAid\nRealChute\nRemoteTech\nRosterManager\nSafeChute\nSAVE\nSCANsat\nScienceFunding\nScienceRevisitedRevisited\nService-Compartments-6S\nSETI-Greenhouse\nSETI-RemoteTech\nShipManifest\nStageRecovery\nStockBugFixPlus\nThrustIndicationModule\nToolbar\nTweakScale\nUKS\nUniversalStorage\nUSI-ART\nUSI-Core\nUSI-EXP\nUSITools\nVNG-Parachute\nVNG-Parachute-EVALoading\nVNG-Plugin\nWaypointManager\nxScience\nFuelTanksPlus\nKerbalStats\nFilterExtensionsDefaultConfig\nTextureReplacer\nBDAnimationModules\nREPOSoftTech-Agencies\nB9-props\nKlockheedMartian-Gimbal\nSmokeScreen\nCrossFeedEnabler\nSpacetuxSA\nMagiCore\nKerboKatzUtilities\nDMagicOrbitalScience\n\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI appreciate any help you can provide\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jofe","CreatedById":101640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T17:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, found a solution, although one that I don\u0027t like. While the solution I linked didn\u0027t work for me, the problem seems to be relate to Kerbals that have some kind of, ermm, physical presence on the game but I don\u0027t own (They seem to exist in the world in some way or another). At first I thought it was a problem with Contract Configurator: Tourism Plus, because the problem happened as soon as I accepted the first contract that appeared from that mod. I removed it and effectively didn\u0027t get the bug for some time. But then it happened again and I noticed that it was as soon as the Recover Asset contracts appeared. Loaded a previous save and disabled that type of contract and so far I haven\u0027t run into the issue again. I Would prefer another solution as I like that type of contracts and would like to use Tourism Plus D:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
