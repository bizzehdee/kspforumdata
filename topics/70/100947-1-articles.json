Is your Windows version 64-bit or 32-bit? On 32-bit Windows, KSP will be limited to 2 GB of memory, but on 64-bit Windows it will be limited to about 3.5 GB.\n\nThe likely culprits here are EVE, Texture Replacer, and the planet packs (if you reinstall them) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 they can involve enormous textures. I\u0027d suggest removing at least one of those mods and/or installing [thread=59005]Active Texture Management[/thread]."},{"CreatedByName":"glen.mack","CreatedById":75413,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T22:29:26Z","Content":"I had been having more success launching the 64 bit version of KSP, (W7 64 bit) I really do need to buy new memory, it was something I had planned to expand 6 years ago when I built this comp and bought 4GB, (I think my mobo can handle 16) but never got round to it. I almost forgot about memory limitations, I hardly ever run into them. Gotta love KSP for testing the system.\n\nTurns out I did buy 8gb. Now I\u0027m even more confused.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-01T14:44:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2015 02:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by glen.mack**"}]}
