I first tried to uninstall and reinstall \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, to no avail. Next, I uninstalled all 3 of those mods and the problem remained, both while they were uninstalled and after reinstalling them and again reinstalling\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, on the same start up.

I guess i\u0027ll share this in case someone else gets the same problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter I uninstalled \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E 1.1.3 from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, I noticed that GameData/KerbalEngineer still residually existed with a settings folder and one other file inside. So, I pulled that out to my desktop and installed 1.1.2.8 into GameData and then the game crashed on start up. I place the residual Kerbal Engineer folder with the settings \u002B1 file back into Gamedata/KerbalEngineer and the game crashed again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI deleted the manual \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E install, residual KE file and all and installed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E 1.1.3 with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E again and my dimensions are fine. In the pic, the file on the left is what was residual and staying in Gamedata during attempts to uninstall and reinstall \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E.
