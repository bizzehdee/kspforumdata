To my dissapointment I find crazy behavior on stations. My KSS which was fine before the update now whenever a new ship docks at station it was wobbles like crazy making the whole station wobble. Switching reaction wheels on ship off helps. But when I want to move the station to a new orbit... more wobble...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI said ok don\u0027t care since it\u0027s an old space station I was planning to build a bigger one on a higher orbit with new tech and 4 large fuel tanks supplied by Mun fuel production, big plans ahead colonies etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I started building Prometheus Station with 2 orbital rings capacity 14 kerbals each, cool everything in place after working hours in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.

There\u0027s no real fix and its a poor way for KSP v1 to go out. There are some things you can do to mitigate the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSave often, in case the wobble disassembles your station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse autostruts when designing large craft and stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbal Joint Reinforcement KJR mods (both forks, \u0022Next\u0022 and \u0022Continued\u0022) do \u003Cu\u003Enot \u003C/u\u003Ework properly in 1.12, and can make problems worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you notice a station starting to wobble, a short burst of x5 time warp sometimes helps. When you come out of timewarp the wobble motion will be paused and might straighten itself out. Be warned that the problem can sometimes get worse after timewarp (see prior advice to save often).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
