I\u0027ve tried using rigid attachment, shifting around the autostruts, etc; the only thing I could do is completely remove autostruts, but the vehicle is so large that it\u0027s dangerously wobbly if I do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd perplexingly, everything is fine until the moment I hit 85km (I\u0027m using the JNSQ planet pack); in atmosphere, there\u0027s nothing amiss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone have any idea what might be happening?
