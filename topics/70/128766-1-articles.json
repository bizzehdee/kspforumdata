Jetpacked 3\u002B k up the crater wall to an arch. Planted flag. Took pictures. Had a picnic (not really). Started back to lander. Ran out of EVA fuel. Walking is soooo sloooow. Tried holding shift \u002B W. Jeb just kept moseying along. After becoming bored holding W decided to give him infinite EVA fuel. Didn\u0027t work. Any clue as to what might be interfering and how to fix it? In the meantime launched a satellite and it worked fine,so it is not the my game or install\u00A0as a whole. My mods are mostly beauty mods and planet packs. I don\u0027t use many part mods.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
