On the right image, we\u0027re inside the bay, so no matter if it is open or closed, the content is clickable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221xwKZ5R.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002246.68\u0022 height=\u0022477\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/1xwKZ5R.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to change this ?
