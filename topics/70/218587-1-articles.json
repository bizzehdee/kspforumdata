I don\u2019t think I did the reinstall wrong I deleted the kerbal space program folder and everything in it then I uninstalled it through steam. I did this for each reinstall am I missing something? Also after reinstalling the first time I load it up it loads a third of the way then freezes and none of the fan art is there just the private division logo. I have done everything I can think of I have verified the files ,I have reinstalled, I have done a virus check, I have run a diagnostics test I am very confused it was fine yesterday.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk it fixed itself I am very confused why though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-25T11:34:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2023 11:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 25\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by CatMasterWill\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatMasterWill","CreatedById":230043,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-01T16:52:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found out why it was happening.
