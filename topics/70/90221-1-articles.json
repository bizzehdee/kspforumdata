I am usually a very clean builder who minimizes part count to the best of my ability, and most of my crafts in space range between 20-30 parts at most. But then I decided to build this OKS mobile colony ship:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/97bWkIB.png\u0022 alt=\u002297bWkIB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith only 64 parts, which is low compared to many of the creations posted around here, and yet took my frame rate to a low 13-15. I also have a base on the Mun with a similar part count but with no lag issue (50-60 fps) at all. Graphics are turned down to minimum as well, so I do think it is due to the part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntel Core i7-4700MQ CPU @ 2.4GHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENvidia GTX 770M\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8 GB RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods installed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadly Reentry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal Frontier\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFine Print\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHangar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Construction Time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInferno Robotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Controller Extended\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemote Tech 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESane Strategies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelect Root\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Life Support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbonite \u002B (including Karbonite)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMKS/OKS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSI Exploration Pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this normal? This computer isn\u0027t the most beastly out there, but the specs on it aren\u0027t exactly bad either. Also, a base with similar part count had no problems, which is also weird. Does anyone have any idea what might be wrong?

If you can\u0027t find an obvious culprit, then come back and post your log files to see if someone can figure it out. You shouldn\u0027t be seeing this much lag with 64 parts unless something is wrong with your KSP install such as an out of date or conflicting mod, or something on your machine is interfering.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
