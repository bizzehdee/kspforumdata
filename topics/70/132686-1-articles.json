I know there was a bug with throttle and having the ISRU running. (Where 1 out of the 4 nukes on my ship would throttle back to ~15% randomly.) So it might be something similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think the fuel lines matter if you are filling tanks with an ISRU. I think the game only uses them in the event of an engine being active.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick fixes might be to dump all your fuel into the center. (If you\u0027re mostly empty), Dump all your fuel into the radial tanks and keep the last little bit in the center (if you\u0027re mostly full). Remember that you can hold down the Option key. (Or whatever the \u0027select multiple tanks to transfer fuel\u0027 transfer key is on your OS) and select more than two tanks. This is a fast way to dump all your fuel into one tank or distribute it evenly into radial tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPics would be greatly helpful in showing us whats\u0027 up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"genericeventhandler","CreatedById":149557,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T14:04:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe irsu is set to stage flow priority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nie it fills the tanks in the same order that an engine drains.
