I landed an engineer and installed an communotron 16 antenna. I still have no signal, even though the lander 100m away from it has full signal with the same antenna. It appears the rovemate does not recognize the external antenna. I also have a relay antenna in mun orbit that passes over the site. The probe control will go from yellow to red when it\u0027s on the far side, but always shows no signal and the question mark on next to the comm status even when in sight of Kerbin and/or the relay antenna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rovemate is powered and not in hibernation.
