How do I generate custom atmosphere colors with Scatterer? None of the variables in the atmo.cfg seem to adjust color, and I can\u0027t figure out how to generate new scattering tables using the config tool. I read through the documentation and searched the forum, but I couldn\u0027t find an answer. Any help would be appreciated.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
