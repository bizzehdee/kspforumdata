It says \u0022Loading PartRecipe for KSPIE Vasimir2\u0022 (Vasimir2 is just the first part it loads, I tried deleting it and the same thing happened to the next part.\u0022\u00A0I am aware that I-E is only updated to 1.4.2, but when I tried to load it on 1.4.2 I had the exact same problem. The game doesn\u0027t freeze, as the loading pictures and flavor text still cycle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a decently hefty mod list, and as I feared, the issue is a mod incompatibility as far as I can tell. I put KSPIE into a clean clean game with no other mods (except it\u0027s dependencies of course) and it functioned fine. The game was even in 1.4.3, so that\u0027s not the problem. I have been unable to identify what mod is causing the problem, but any help would be much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLog:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/0o9oyb1nkxs4lp6/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/0o9oyb1nkxs4lp6/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
