Nothing. No idea what causes it, All I know is that deleting the module manager config cache SOMETIMES fixes it.\n\nNo ideas here, any suggestions heard"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T08:10:33Z","Content":"Youre sparse with information .... pls. read \u0022how to get support\u0022, that\u0027ll make i easier. Otherwise we have to guess ...\n\nJudging from your other problems it could be one of the mods. If KSP runs in clean install (does it ?), add one by one the mods and try to reproduce the error. If you found one then maybe the mods thread can held you."},{"CreatedByName":"unseeingwhale","CreatedById":116871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T12:41:44Z","Content":"Please update texture replacer to the newest version.
