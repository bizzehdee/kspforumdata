I play KSP since march 2016 and I think I would still be around Kerbin without this forum and all those threads \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere comes my question: I restarted a career mode since 1.2 released, in order to do stuff in a more properly and efficient way than my first career play (and sometimes in a more Kerbal way...). Things going on and on, I ultimately unlock custom action group. So I put all my science experiment to group 4, the \u0022Collect All\u0022 option of the science box to group 5 and the reset of all experiences to group 6 (even if I don\u0027t even know if this is necessarry). It seems that the action group 4 works once, and then is not re-runnable. I checked several times, and as soon as I collect all the science, the right-click on any science module offers me the possibility to log again, but the action group won\u0027t work anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny idea of what is going on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nps: I put this on the \u0022modded install\u0022 part of the forum because I have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E installed, but this thread may interest unmodded install players.

It appears that the instruments need a separate reset from\u00A0one action group\u00A0to be triggered by another action group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
