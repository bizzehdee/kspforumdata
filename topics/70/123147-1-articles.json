I am trying to make a line of hulking machines that appear unarmed until a switch is flipped and the cargo bays open up. I\u0027d like the inside to hold an elevator sorta like an air craft carrier, and upon which is a CIWS or cannon, or well anything really.

This is because when you attach a part to another part you are effectively attaching it to the part root not the animation.\u00A0 As for how how do it with IR, simply place a piston under the turret or weapon of choice.\u00A0 for the cargo bay you\u0027d just need to set it up with action groups\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
