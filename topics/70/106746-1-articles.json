Only mods I currently have in are KER (Kerbal Engineer Redux) and Chatterer, both updated to the latest version as of posting. I don\u0027t believe these mods are interfering in any way, but as it is technically a modded install I will post it here. The Bug: I\u0027ve accepted a mission to land a new surface outpost on Mun which has the following requirements for completion:\n\nLanding it on the Mun (obviously) \n\nRequires antenna, docking port, and can generate power \n\nHave a research lab at the outpost\n\nHave a viewing cupola at the outpost\n\nHave 1,000 units of RCS fuel/Monoprop\n\n\\*The outpost must be on wheels\\*\n\nand maintain stability for 10 seconds.\n\nI\u0027ve built flown and landed a craft which meets all specifications, but the outpost must be on wheels has never procced.

I can provide logs if needed, but don\u0027t see a point for it considering the type of bug it is. That and I\u0027m unsure what would be needed in this situation. I think that\u0027s all I need to post, if I forgot something or this needs something I\u0027ll update it/respond below. (I can\u0027t figure out how to shrink the screenshot correctly to show the mission parameters, but you can see the craft)"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T04:27:44Z","Content":"There were two minor KSP releases in the last few hours, and the [1.0.1 release notes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/337-KSP-1-0-1-Is-Up) mention fixing a bug with the \u0022on wheels\u0022 requirement that could be similar to what you\u0027re seeing. \n\nStupid question, but have you updated your KSP to 1.0.2?"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T06:03:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There were two minor KSP releases in the last few hours, and the [1.0.1 release notes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/337-KSP-1-0-1-Is-Up) mention fixing a bug with the \u0022on wheels\u0022 requirement that could be similar to what you\u0027re seeing. \n\u003E Stupid question, but have you updated your KSP to 1.0.2?\n\nThat fix addresses the fixed wheels, whereas he is using a small gear bay. The small gear bay has some collider issues that prevent it from working with this objective at the present time. Pretty much any other wheel will work. I do see one fixed wheel on the front though, so that should be triggering it.
