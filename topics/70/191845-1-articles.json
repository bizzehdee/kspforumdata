Upon starting up the game (through steam) the loading screen had Nyan cats, however in the main menu its gone. The problem is when clicking start game and then click resume saved, i wanted to play one of the saves but it wasn\u0027t loading, i tried other saves but also didn\u0027t work, i wasn\u0027t even able to play any scenarios or any tutorial. Another thing is i was able to click through the resume saves menu and open a new one having them stack up. Is there anyway to fix this? I\u0027ve already tried reloading the game and validating my game using steam.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-22T13:34:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, and welcome to the forum!\u00A0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223745326\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191845\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221582374637\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022202956\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CountryFurry Japan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n58 minutes ago, CountryFurry Japan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon starting up the game (through steam) the loading screen had Nyan cats, however in the main menu its gone.
