Right after I jettison my lower stage I will warp to where I want to cicularize the orbit at and the bug occurrs. It gives me the message cannot warp faster than 1x while the ship is accelerating at the same time I lose ability to turn the ship using the wasd keys and mechjeb SMART.A.S.S. additionally the speed on the navball gets \u0022frozen\u0022 and the orbit changes due to the velocity being frozen (am at speeds around 1700-2500m/s when occurs). after testing I have found that this now occurs with any vessel I launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning 32 bit v.25(latest) on win7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods I have installed are: Mechjeb, kerbal engineer, remotetech2 kerbal alarm clock, and scan sat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eall of the pods tested were manned so remote tech wasn\u0027t causing the loss of control. as a side note the flight computer window said n/a instead of local control like it normally does for manned pods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"holmes323","CreatedById":125109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T21:16:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter Further testing I have learned that the bug is triggered in all modes including training and scenarios and that it is triggered now whenever I try to warp time on any vessel.

Did you turn on the Alt-F12 debug log while it happened? Any screenshots? This sounds very much like the \u0027null reference exception\u0027 bug that would be randomly triggered by switching to a ship clawing an asteroid. Only solution was always quitting and restarting the game. I made a detailed bug report about it a year ago when 0.23.5 came out (where the claw was first introduced). I\u0027ll try to find it and link the thread here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
