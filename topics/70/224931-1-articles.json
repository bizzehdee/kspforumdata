I don\u2019t know what happened and I tried to reinstall it but it didn\u2019t fix anything, I need help. This all started after I did alt f4 because when ever I was trying to go to the main menu it would just close the pop up menu for when you pause the game so I couldn\u2019t close the game at all then after I did that I tried to launch but it started to get stuck on \u201C@thumbs\u201D so I did what it said to do online and I deleted all of the \u201C@thumbs\u201D files for mods and base game plus the 2 expansions then it worked for the last time but some mods weren\u2019t working so I closed the game and added them and now it\u2019s doing this, plus I\u2019m now getting other errors that might be related like windows can\u2019t find downloader_helper.
