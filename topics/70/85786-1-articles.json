The update came and I forgot about it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E. Anyway I took the old install (after updating), deleted everything and downloaded the game from Steam again, just to be sure that nothing would screw anything by accident. Downloaded again most of the mods I had before and a couple of new ones. I start the game and it takes so long I think the game crashed on the background. I time it and it takes around 15 mins to load initially. If I remove B9 aerospace and KW Rocketry it goes down to 12-13 mins. If I don\u0027t use mods it takes around 5 mins (which I feel its still long for stock ksp). I\u0027m already using Active Texture Manager. I\u0027m wondering if everyone gets similar loading times with mods or if maybe something is wrong on my end. If anyone needs my specs I have an i5 650 @3.20 GHz, 4GB of ram and a Radeon HD 5770 and I\u0027m using Windows 7 64bit but running KSP 32 bit.
