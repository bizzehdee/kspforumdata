I\u0027ve used Remote Tech before and never had a problem. Basically when I go to launch a rocket with a satellite, the rocket suddenly stops working around 10,000. The engine just shuts down and I loose control. If I delete Remote Tech it goes away. Anyone know what I\u0027m doing wrong? I\u0027ve never seen this before???\n\nthank you,\n\nE\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T15:30:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ebphoto**"},{"CreatedByName":"ebphoto","CreatedById":144831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T16:03:37Z","Content":"Never mind, I saw a great tutorial on Remote Tech and it answered my question.\n\nE"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T19:17:19Z","Content":"unless i am launching a satellite with a kerbal, i always hide one of the 300km always on antenna in the body somewhere(its a surface attachment so its usually between nodes). try and get atleast a keosynchronous constellation up a soon as possible so you can send satellites up with without having to worry about not having a connection"}]}
