The game definitely detects the Alt key, as I can still adjust trim, force surface attachment and everything else that used that key, but copying doesn\u0027t work. I\u0027ve tried to narrow it down to a specific mod, but even after deleting all installed mods and running with the base game, it still doesn\u0027t work.

I figured it out earlier today, turns out it was a mouse problem. I set up an AutoHotkey script several months ago because the left mouse button is on it\u0027s way out and registers single clicks as doubleclicks sometimes, so I used AHK to stop that happening. For some reason it conflicts with certain things in the VAB. Not a clue why.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
