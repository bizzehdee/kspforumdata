Because of this I can do nothing anymore and I am forced to close the game (simulations also dont start anymore). When I relaunch I can not join my save game again, it is listed as \u201Cjust started\u201D It is now the second time I experienced this and I have been unable to continue the career mode. I am running 1.10.1 should I downgrade to an earlier version?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-06T17:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like your save is getting corrupted by something. If you can, try to reproduce the issue and then grab the logs, put them on a file sharing site and post a link to them here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might also want to try creating a fresh copy of KSP and adding RP-1 etc. through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E with the express install option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
