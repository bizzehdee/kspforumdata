Go to the asteroid via the tracking station and save (asteroid should be proper size here).

If you release an attached ship and attempt to reattach, you will need to close in to the new smaller surface before attachment occurs. I have another E-class asteroid in orbit which has a 7 digit asteroid seed, but no resizing has occurred and the asteroid seed number is unchanged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAdditional reproduction steps:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit the asteroid seed in the persistent file and any saves back to the original number (in my case it was 46564590).
