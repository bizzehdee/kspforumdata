Yesterday I took it into orbit, was able to rendezvous with a target just fine. I did have some other issues...it was a part capture contract, I managed to maneuver the ship around with the cargo bay doors open, and captured the part in the cargo bay. Closed the bay. Of course, as soon as I tried to maneuver, the part casually floated out through the bottom of the cargo bay... I tried putting the Konstruction Krane in the cargo bay to grab the part, BUT the krane _always_ overheats and explodes during ascent, while stowed in teh closed cargo bay!! (I still haven\u0027t gotten to the weird part yet).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI decided to try attaching a heat shield to the front of the cargo bay to see if that would protect the krane. I launch the plane and it looks wobbly, but _not_ at the joints of the new heat shield...no, but other fuselage joints are now flexing unlike the launches yesterday. I tried to take off but about the time I reach take off velocity...\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E...wings fly off, landing gear explodes...it\u0027s just a mess. I thought OK, maybe it\u0027s an issue with the heat shield, and decided I\u0027d try it with no heat shield again. Removed the heat shield and launched again. Before throttling up, everything looks just fine. The flexing has stopped, the plane is sitting on the runway, not bouncing or swiveling etc...engage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, stage the engines, so far so good. Throttle up, release the brakes, plane starts to accelerate as expected. Things so far still going great, until I get to around 80-90m/s, and suddenly, the flexing is back...just as I start to pull up...\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E...wings fly off, landing gear explodes, and the rest of the ship comes apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo mods have been changed on my system in the last 3\u002B days, so it isn\u0027t a mod that changed.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had something similar in spirit happen about 2 months ago...things that were completely stable started having issues, like stations in orbit that were having no issues started to disassemble whenever any new ship docked. As soon as the docking sequence was \u0022complete\u0022, I start hearing the staging sound, and various different parts would suddenly stage...like parachutes on a ship, long docked at the station, or a stack separator or decoupler in the middle of some other docked ship, would suddenly fire. The fix at that time was to reload the game from scratch, including all of the mods in my (fairly) large mod list, and then pulling in a copy of my saves (all of the ships etc) and the stuff backed up by S.A.V.E.S.\u00A0 The reload worked...just annoying to spend more than a day reloading and rebuilding the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the question:\u00A0 \u00A0Has _anyone_ else seen this sort of thing and does anyone have any suggestions, other than a reload, of what to try?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sure hope KSP 2 doesn\u0027t have this sort of \u0027feature\u0027!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fleventeen","CreatedById":220622,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-16T05:44:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMan, where to even start.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have seen similar things before, but maybe not exactly what you mentioned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere may be some hope for your joint wobbling issues. If you haven\u0027t already, check out the mod Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, as It really tightens up the joints between parts. It is strange that your issues are happening so randomly, but it might help out since it changes the joint behaviors so drastically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are actually two different versions of KJR, and they each use different methods to tighten the joints. I guess start with KJR - Next since it seems to still be getting updates.
