I was able to narrow down the problem to the Interstellar Extended mod, and confirmed that uninstalling it allowed me to load the game without issue. When attempting to reinstall it, I noted that the \u0022Community Tech Tree\u0022 suggested add-on had not been installed with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, and since the issue was tech tree related, suspected that might be necessary. Reinstalling Interstellar Extended with the Community Tech Tree mod removed the duplicate entries and the game will now successfully start. So for now, if you\u0027re having this issue, consider Community Tech Tree to be required rather than suggested with Interstellar Extended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
