It normally uses \u0022Rocket Parts\u0022 to build those but in my case it asks for \u0022MaterialKits\u0022 and \u0022Specialised Parts\u0022 instead. It wouldn\u0027t be a problem if I had a container for those but I don\u0027t. I however have different kinds of containers for \u0022Rocket Parts\u0022. Anyone knows how to fix this? Maybe it is another mod that interfere and create this...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cmdr Hawkeyez","CreatedById":170207,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-20T18:31:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhi\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-04T23:49:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2018 11:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Cmdr Hawkeyez\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
