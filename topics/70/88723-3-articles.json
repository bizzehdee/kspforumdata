Let me step back a moment because I took some steps back and forward...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlew out my old KSP folder and reinstalled bone stock game (this is direct download, not Steam, BTW). Then went to work to arrange my screens. I have four screens installed, three on the 7950 head, and one using the built in Intel on-die video. I was having wiggy mouse problems so I disabled the screen that was running through the processor vid and it stabilized that. I don\u0027t need that screen anyway for what I am doing here, so no harm no foul. Got the remaining three screens sorted out and they are arranged properly and working smashingly. Fantastic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERan the bone stock KSP.x86_64 by simply clicking the program. Loads up fine. Set up resolutions and visuals the way I like, loads up fine. Play the game for a few minutes and it\u0027s working fantastically (and it seems to run faster then Windows, or at least smoother).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so I want to run \u0022Realism Overhaul\u0022 on this copy, so I set about installing the required mods for that. Following the instructions by the book I install Advanced Jet Engine, FAR, KJR, Module Mangler, ModuleRCSFX, Real Fuels and Real Solar System (with the huge textures because, hey, I am running the 64 bit stuff so I can enjoy the eye candy). Double and triple check everything is where it needs to be and fire up KSP (via the same way as previously). Game appears to load up fine and gets to the main menu, where a popup window comes up from Real Solar System saying it\u0027s applying some patches to the planets. It gets part way through this and hard locks the interface (no mouse control, keyboard does jack squat, full on hard lock). Ooookay. I reset the system and try it again. Again it loads up fine, gets to the main menu where the RSS interface pops up and says it\u0027s doing its thing, gets to the same spot in the process and HARD LOCKS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo at least now it\u0027s repeatable. And I KNOW I had a working unit when it was bone stock, so its not something inherantly wrong with the video or OS interdependencies. I\u0027m convinced this is something internal to KSP which is blowing up, which leads me to a question. Wasn\u0027t there some talk about \u0022memory offsets\u0022 or something where KSP was getting beyond a certain threshold in memory paging and soiling itself? It seems like this problem manifests itself when I reach some sort of critical mass with memory usage and I remember somebody had a tidbit of hack code that would \u0022fix\u0022 this problem with version 0.24.2, but I didn\u0027t see anything for 0.25. Do you think there is any merit to simply rolling back to 0.24.2? I didn\u0027t really look to see if that version was stable for Linux, nor whether mods rewritten for 0.25 would be backward compatible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say I\u0027m dead in the water again, though this time I KNOW I have a solid installation of Ubuntu 14.04 that is not in danger of grenading on me at a moments notice, so now I can concentrate on getting KSP to stop nuking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gsarducci","CreatedById":98639,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T08:32:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELittle update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92231-The-Linux-Thread?p=1510342\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1510342\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eoffset information\u003C/a\u003E and applied it.
