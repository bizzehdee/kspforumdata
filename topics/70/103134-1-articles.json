I think that I had some kind of old version of RPM, that I dont think was for 0.90.0, and after I updated it to the 3rd party patch, this happened.\n\nI don\u0027t have the mod right now, but I remember this happening when I installed deadly reentry, and it went away after uninstalling that.\n\nSince this happened with 2 different mods, it makes me think that both mods are interfering with the same mod, I just don\u0027t know what that is ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nMod List:\n\n- Toolbar\n- USI Tools (Just the flags and agencies, uninstalled all of the USI mods)\n- BDArmory\n- Connected Living Space\n- Environmental Visual Enhancements (High on my list of suspects)\n- Firespitter (Also EXTREMELY high on my list, im gonna test this one right now and if it doesn\u0027t help then I wont post this.
