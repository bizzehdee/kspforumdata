Like I said on a previous post... My KSP experience so far is all about getting used to a couple of mods I want to use...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreviously I\u0027ve been busy making an SSTO for kerbonauts and kargo whilr using NEAR and DR.. That worked well which makes me happy... :-p\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now I have a new issue... I\u0027m experimenting with RemoteTech2. I decided to start simple so I made a simple satelite with a dish antena to communicate with KSC... I already saw a couple of design flaws on the basic design (I should have extra dish antennas if I wanted a working constellation, one of the solar panels is obstructed, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut none of that matters as I just wanted a basic link with KSC! :-(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... Here\u0027s the problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IyWcJVe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IyWcJVe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat satelite doesn\u0027t seem to have a link to ksc... I\u0027m aware I\u0027ll only get a connection while it\u0027s on KSC\u0027s direct lign of sight... But even if I wait for a full orbit, when they\u0027re on top of each other they don\u0027t connect... :-(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an image with a bit more information: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/80juR62.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002280juR62.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see both of them are aligned but still there\u0027s no connection (upper left corner)! If I\u0027m not mistaken the current antenna I\u0027m using has more then enough range, it has lots of power and is perfectly aligned... So why doesn\u0027t it connect with KSC??? :-(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I find strange is that I was expecting a coverage \u0027cone\u0027 on the map view but instead I get a line... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...
