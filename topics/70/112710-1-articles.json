Indeed the game goes up to 3700MB before crashing (I use the GCmonitor mod) so it \\*seems\\* to use the 4GB but since the log reports a different size, i wonder...\n\n    Initialize engine version: 4.6.4f1 (99f88340878d)Forcing GfxDevice: 0OpenGL:    Version:  OpenGL 4.5 [4.5.0 NVIDIA 353.06]    Renderer: GeForce GTX 970/PCIe/SSE2    Vendor:   NVIDIA Corporation    VRAM:     3072 MB (via DXGI)\n\nAlso, there is a huge difference between the VRAM reported by GCmonitor and GPU-Z: on start screen with DirectX GCM shows 2800MB whereas GPU-Z sensor shows 472MB... Should I start a thread in the GCmonitor mod too ?\n\n\u002B I am running with OpenGL because with DX the game loads 2800MB at the start screen already (KSP.exe -force-opengl -popupwindow)\n\n\u002B OS is Win SEVEN x64 ultimate.\n\n\u002B KSP 1.0.2 legit\n\nthanks for the help ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T22:48:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 10:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by scavenger**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thiagobs","CreatedById":76021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T23:54:55Z","Content":"That\u0027s a known \u0022feature\u0022 of GTX970, apparently the VRAM is split in two banks, one with 3gb and an extra, slower VRAM with 1Gb...\n\nThere was some debate about this until Nvidia finally spoke up.
