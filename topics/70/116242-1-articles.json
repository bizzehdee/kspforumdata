I got Kronal Vessel Viewer via the CKAN (results are the same if I download directly from GitHub). Th image shows a single capsule in the VAB with the KVV window open. Not only does the live pre-view not work but the resulting screenshot looks just like the preview.\n\n![fk4WIhe.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fk4WIhe.jpg)\n\nHas anyone seen this? KVV used to work for me, but it hasn\u0027t since v1.0.4. Again, this is a clean install (from Steam) with only KVV installed."}]}
