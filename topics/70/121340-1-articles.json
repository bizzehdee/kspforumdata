Furthermore, all the other USI mods I installed, specifically Karbonite, Karbonite Plus, Life Support, and Sounding Rockets all work fine, and the game itself loads no problem, and the parts for the non-current mods seem to attach as well, save for the 2.5m Alcubierre drive bubble not being visible in the VAB. Has anyone experienced this problem and/or fixed it? Your input on the matter is greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T06:46:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eckan?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehmmm okay then i will help you... ckan may or may not have the latest up to date version of a particular mod. so it is recommended scouring the add-on releases form for updates \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECkan is also lying that the fact that toolbar is not ready 1.0.4 ( it is totally for 1.0.4)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ego to one of roverdude\u0027s thread there is a link to his github main page for all downloads. use them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enote it is normal for incompatibility messages when updating to minor changes... i think thats it! have a whirl with my advice! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Funky Dare Devil","CreatedById":134393,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T19:46:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for responding.
