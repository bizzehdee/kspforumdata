My Goo canisters (and other bits afterwards) were exploding with no indication of heating at all (no gauges, no color difference on temperature overlay). Though while explosions were happening, I did see flashes of temperature gauges. And the gauges also do show very briefly when switching between map and ship view.\n\nThe upshot is, you can\u0027t see when parts are overheating.\n\nUpdate: You can make the gauges flash briefly by pressing F10 twice to toggle visibility off and on again.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T16:48:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 04:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thanny**"}]}
