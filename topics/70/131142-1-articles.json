The ship had a Jump Drive Beacon which is very power hunger when active. After several Kerbal days doing other mission within Kerbin LKO/HKO, I tried to jump to the beacon but the orbiting ship was gone. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sent out another ship equipped with the beacon and checked on it from time to time and found that the command module and supplies container (MKS/OKS) were heating up. I jumped the waiting ship to its vicinity and EVAd the pilot and saw the poor thing was near red in heat. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a guideline to using EC generating nuclear parts on how far a kerbal should be safe from being... irradiated for long term missions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVist\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-01T04:09:33Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2016 04:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
