It does not act the same way it would do on Windows.\n\nMainly my problem is not being able to copy parts whilst building using the Alt key and the mod Scatterer, which requires me to open a menu with Alt\u002BF9-10 in order to disable anisotropic filtering so it wont render strange lines on the sky.\n\nUbuntu has other plans and it wants to open a drop down menu with Alt\u002BF10 and to do nothing at all with Alt\u002BF9.\n\nAfter some research I found out that \u0027Right Shift\u0027 should have the same functionality has the Windows Alt key in Ubuntu.\n\nIt seems to be working for everything BUT opening the Scatterer menu for reasons unknown to me.\n\nIt also disrupts the work flow having to reach for the \u0027Right Shift\u0027 key every time I need to copy something.\n\n**Things that I have tried:**\n\nI have an AMD GPU so I am running Catalyst Control Centre which I thought I could use to disable anisotropic filtering but it seems the Ubuntu version only allows me to change the levels of it not disable it completely.\n\nSo back to the Alt key, I have tried changing the keyboard shortcuts of Ubuntu and disabling all the Alt key ones. Did not seem to work.\n\nThere is something in Ubuntu called mnemonics which I do not fully understand, but it seems to be related, I have tried disabling it and it did not seem to work either.\n\nNow I am out of ideas so please help if you can : )."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T15:43:29Z","Content":"The modifier key isn\u0027t Alt on Linux for reasons like what you\u0027ve found. In particular Alt-click on most Linux distributions lets you move the window, therefore conflicting with Alt-clicking stuff in KSP.\n\nYou can change the modifier key by editing your settings.cfg. If you want a key that\u0027s better placed perhaps the Windows key if Ubuntu isn\u0027t using it.\n\nAs for Scatterer, it sounds like it might either use its own settings or be hard-coded to use Alt instead of following KSP\u0027s settings. Ask in the scatterer thread I think."}]}
