Saves a lot of time. My latest project seems to have a problem. Any manouver I select, it sets the DeltaV required at 10,000 m/s, and the \u0027time to begin burn\u0027 at 20 seconds, and then the numbers do not change. At all. Even when I set a manoeuvre node manually, it has the same numbers, no matter how large/small a correction it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this something I\u0027ve screwed up, something to do with the mod, or something unrelated?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
