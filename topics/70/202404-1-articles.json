I go from my normal 30 fps to around 1.5 fps. This happens only when my rocket is being launched and will stay like that until I go back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. No matter where I am, pad, sky, or space, the game will always lag. This happened very unexpectedly and I don\u0027t know why. I\u0027m assuming this is because of one of my mods but I haven\u0027t installed one in a while. My specs are fine and so are my drivers. What could be the problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigIsCheese","CreatedById":211642,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-15T04:25:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever mind I was able to fix it by deleting a mod called Actual Sites: Airports\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
