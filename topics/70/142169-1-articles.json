Jeb and Val are in the lander\u0027s command pod while Bill and two other engineers are in the survey station.. I use a survey stake to build a little stationary pod out of an EL Construction workshop, a metal-ore auger and smelter, and a few hex cans. After the build is finished I send Bill out to detach one of the connector ports from the workshop pod, attach it to the lander, then link the two. I then send Bill into the workshop.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt that point, my intent is to send another one of the engineers out and into the workshop, while my last remaining engineer goes out to place a second stake for the main part of my mining base (the workshop is just there to source RocketParts since I\u0027ve already used up what I took with me). However, at that point anytime I go EVA with any of the astronauts in the lander, the game CTD\u0027s right there.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m fairly certain it has something to do with the fact that the ships are now linked together via the connector ports, since Bill is already EVA when the ships are linked, and the first EVA I send out after the link causes the crash. That would point toward \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E being part of the problem - however I won\u0027t rule out EPL as a possible related issue.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is my output log, as well as craft files of my lander and workshop pod so you can try to recreate. For all the parts, you\u0027ll need \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, EPL, TAC Life Support (for the support cans), Tweakscale (for the Minmus lander\u0027s LV) and Nertea\u0027s Near Future mods (NF Spacecraft/Electrical for the lander and NF Solar for the module). The steps are listed below - this is basically the entire process from launch to crash, though you can likely use HyperEdit or somesuch to skip ahead to the lander/construction pod scenario. Also note that by the time the lander lands on Minmus, everything below the 7x RocketParts hexcan container has been decoupled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/1x742nq7qlyw30u/output_log.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003Ecom\u003C/abbr\u003E/s/1x742nq7qlyw30u/output_log.zip?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n====Prep====\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.
