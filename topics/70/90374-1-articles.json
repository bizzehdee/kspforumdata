Great! Having left it in a loose Kerbin orbit, I figured I\u0027d go back, get some more science, and make the orbit a bit neater and maybe use it for a space station, only... it no longer seems to be grabbable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried a manned ship, and an unmanned probe, to rule out weird construction problems. I have nudged gently at the asteroid at 0.3m/s or less, and I have rammed it at 5m/s. I\u0027ve tried disarming and re-arming the claw repeatedly. Consistently, using both vehicles, the claws just slide over the surface but will not bite. Sometimes they dig in and almost seem to connect, but then they spring back out again. I\u0027ve spent the best part of two hours trying to find a \u0022perpendicular\u0022 angle of attack, and the short version is that the first attachment was just not this hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I had a second asteroid inbound, I tried the same again with the same results - the initial attachment is easy and the asteroid can be diverted, but an asteroid cannot seem to be grabbed once it has been moved already. I renamed both asteroids when they were initially grabbed, and I\u0027ve noticed the tracking centre now thinks both are a ships that can be terminated, which feels rather suspicious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first screenshot, you can see a ground pylon from Kerbal Attachment System. This is able to connect its winch in \u0027undocked\u0027 mode, which vaguely tethers the ship in place, but it can\u0027t work in docked mode and can\u0027t be used to move the asteroid. Even using the winch to physically pull the ship against the asteroid, the claw cannot be tempted to grab hold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://foxwoodstudios.co.uk/kerbal/claw-bug.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022claw-bug.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, by the time the unmanned probe arrived, the ship that was tethered in the screenshot had vanished into nothingness, although the ground pylon was still there (just visible in upper right of lower right image).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect this is the same bug as reported a couple of months back: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93796-Advanced-Grabbing-Unit-cannot-re-grapple-an-asteroid?highlight=grabbing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93796-Advanced-Grabbing-Unit-cannot-re-grapple-an-asteroid?highlight=grabbing\u003C/a\u003E although there\u0027s too much appearing in my alt-F2 to work out if it\u0027s logging the same message.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing KSP 0.25 via Steam, with a number of mods (obviously - sorry about the state of the UI, I was getting grouchy by this point and wasn\u0027t in a mood to be neat).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, I\u0027m giving up on doing anything with my new Minimuns, since I can only assume there\u0027s an invisible kraken draped over the asteroids, swatting me away at the last moment \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEddieW\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*edited 2 days later to avoid bumping* Probably the same as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100171-My-Claw-won-t-attach-to-the-asteroid\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100171-My-Claw-won-t-attach-to-the-asteroid\u003C/a\u003E since the asteroids I couldn\u0027t grab are B and C, while I have a mission to fetch an A class.
