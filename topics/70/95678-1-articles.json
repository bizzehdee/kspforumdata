I can\u0027t even right click the part and get info on the part. It\u0027s like the model is there but all functionality is missing. I have gone into the .cfg for all chutes (even real-chute is affected by this) and looked at all the settings, and it all seems in check. I also did the generic \u0022Verify integrity of game cache\u0022 on steam and still it is not working.
