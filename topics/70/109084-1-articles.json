I ran out of fuel in the previous stage so I decoupled it, but after a few seconds, the FL-T800 fuel tanks with aerospikes attached under the nosecones start vibrating for no reason and it soon shakes itself apart. Sometimes it explodes, sometimes it doesn\u0027t, but it always breaks apart.\n\nI managed to quicksave, go back to the space centre, and delete the debris of the previous stage - I had turned down the force percentage of the decouplers which made the debris linger behind the craft for a long time if I didn\u0027t throttle up, and it might have been clipping into the ship and making it go weird. This isn\u0027t the cause of the jiggling because I deleted the debris and it\u0027s still happening. You can see that some of the fuel tanks still have some decouplers attached, that\u0027s because I decoupled them manually to see if decoupling them all at the same time was making this weird thing happen, and it isn\u0027t.\n\nI have tried doing this with SAS turned on and off, I\u0027ve tried throttling up for a few seconds to see if it straightens itself out, I\u0027ve tried doing absolutely nothing. No matter what I do, this happens.\n\nWhat is actually happening? I don\u0027t mind sending up a new craft that\u0027s been fixed since this didn\u0027t cost a lot at all but I\u0027d like to know what the issue is before I send another one up.\n\nI\u0027m not using any mod parts in this ship - everything is stock, I only have things like KER and KAC installed."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T19:52:57Z","Content":"It\u0027s very likely that the craft has NaN (not a number) entries in the save file, these can cause the issue you see here.\n\nTry searching for NaN in the save and changing them all to a 1, back up the save first though."},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:05:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s very likely that the craft has NaN (not a number) entries in the save file, these can cause the issue you see here.\n\u003E Try searching for NaN in the save and changing them all to a 1, back up the save first though.\n\nThere\u0027s no NaNs in the save file in the section of the craft, only for flags, which is how I think it\u0027s meant to be."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:06:58Z","Content":"Maybe it is part clipping, can you upload your save with this craft still alive, so others can try it?"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:17:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maybe it is part clipping, can you upload your save with this craft still alive, so others can try it?\n\nDo I just need to upload the .sfs file or do I need other files with it too to get it to work on other peoples\u0027 games?"}]}
