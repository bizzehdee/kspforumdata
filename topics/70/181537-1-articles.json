I put in over a thousand hours, without even realizing i\u0027d done it. I was building all kinds of cool stuff, and using quite a few mods to do it. Finally, my ideas got so ambitious, that 1.2.2, combined with my hardware, were unable to handle what i was doing. Performance became so poor, that i simply had to put the game down, in the hopes that squad would one day better optimize the game, and plug the memory leaks. According to everything i\u0027ve read, 1.6 does just that..better performance, and no/minimal memory leakage. So i decided it was time to come back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy mods are working with 1.6, problem is that my crafts are broken in various interesting ways.. For example: a couple of my craft use the mk2 expansion tapered tail extension.... there are 2 variants (formerly referred to as meshes) when i built the crafts in 1.2.2, the \u0022elevated\u0022 mesh was used....when i load the craft in 1.6, it has magically changed itself to the standard mesh. Now, it\u0027s simple to just change it back to \u0022elevated\u0022, and it\u0027s fixed...but it begs the question: \u0022if that can magically change, then what else has changed, that i can\u0027t immediately detect?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother example is when i load custom parts, made with UbioZur\u0027s welding, or crafts made with custom welded parts....I loaded a plane, that was using an air intake from mk2expansion....the weldment\u0027s .cfg file shows me that the intake is calling for a specific texture file, that is present in the target directory...yet, when the part loads, the texture is missing, and the part is pure white.. same deal with an engine shroud on the tail end of the part...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother custom welded part is now a jumbled mess, when loaded in 1.6 despite no changes to the .cfg file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, i figured i would try earlier versions of the game, with version-appropriate mods, to see if these issues would come up there, as well....and they did. Testing with 1.4.5, and 1.5.1, i encountered these same issues. I\u0027m thinking there has to be something of a functional nature, that has changed in one of the versions between 1.2.2, and 1.4.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs anyone aware of any changes made by squad, to base KSP, that might cause these issues, introduced between 1.2.2, and 1.4.5? If so, is there any way to make it so my crafts and welds will work properly with the newer versions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIF i can\u0027t fix this, it may mean i just can\u0027t play anymore, because i have WAY too much time, and effort, and creativity invested in what i\u0027ve already built, to simply start over... i\u0027d be completely unable to recreate everything i\u0027ve already done, and it wouldn\u0027t be any fun to even try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-20T03:46:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you need a bit of historical background (damn, I\u0027m that old already?) \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFrom 1.2.2 to 1.3.1, KSP was using a previous version of Unity (I didn\u0027t tested anything on KSP previous to 1.2.2, so I will not include them on my explanation).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EOn 1.4.0 Squad made a bold move: they upgraded to a newer Unity version.
