Here\u0027s the thing:; Every time, I used the claw to grab the satellite to keep it from tumbing and getting away. I now noticed that when I grab the satellite, it changes its name to my vessel\u0027s name. Could that be the reason none of these satellite repair jobs have worked out, some kind of ID issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
