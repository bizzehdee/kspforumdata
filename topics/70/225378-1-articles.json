KSP likely tells you exactly what part is causing the issue. Open the .craft file in any text editor and search for that specific part name. You can then replace it with any other part from the stock game, which should allow the craft to load. Just removing the part is not really an option as doing so would cause parts attached to the removed one to float in the air, and fixing attachments manually in a craft file is a massive pain. So you\u0027re better off replacing it with a different one and fixing it in the editor. You should not have to mess with attachments or modules, any erroneous modules will be replaced by KSP when a craft is loaded. You only need to specify a valid part ID.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
