When I try to pitch up or down, the game seems to fight me - after a few moments of pressing the pitch key I see the pitch meter suddenly reverse direction and go to the other extreme, and I can\u0027t pitch up/down anymore because the ship goes back the other way. Weirdly enough, the yaw and roll controls behave normally. Things I\u0027ve tested:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis happens with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on or off\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I turn off the reaction wheels/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E, the pitch meter still behaves the same though no rotation happens\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt happens both in the atmosphere and in orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I use an old ship that\u0027s already in orbit, it doesn\u0027t have this problem. The bug seems to only apply to new vessels I launch. Previously on this save I have had no issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSaving/reloading doesn\u0027t fix it, nor does restarting ksp, or switching vessels or time acceleration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs best as I can\u2019t tell, this isn\u2019t an issue of trim being accidentally set as alt\u002Bx doesn\u2019t fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone encountered a bug like this before/know of some ways I might try to fix it? This is pretty gamebreaking if I can\u0027t find a fix. I\u0027m on 1.5.1. I\u0027ve been on this save for a while, and I haven\u0027t installed any new mods for quite some time and haven\u0027t had an issue until now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I\u0027ve since tried starting a new save, and reverting to previous saves from long before this problem started. The bug was present in all saves, so this seems to be a persistent problem with my copy of KSP. I also made a recording of the bug in action, linked below. What you see is me holding the pitch up key, and as you can see the input oscillates back and forth. Then I stop pressing pitch, turn off \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and show it still happening. Then I show that this problem does not occur in the yaw or roll directions. Any help would be appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://vimeo.com/316015675\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://vimeo.com/316015675\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT 2: Something really strange is going on here. After reinstalling KSP and then installing mods one by one and not finding one that broke it, I found a workaround. If I log into a different save file (a sandbox file I made for testing the bug) than the one I\u0027m playing right after booting up KSP, I can then load the main save file and have no issues. However, if I load the main file first, the bug occurs. Further, if I switch to the sandbox file, the bug occurs in that one too. It\u0027s almost like the bugged file corrupts the clean one and the clean one cleanses the bugged one. Everything seems to work if I do this extra step, which is fine I suppose, but does anyone have any insight on why this might be happening and how I might come up with a permanent fix?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a (probably) unrelated note, kerbal engineer seems to have broken to be always on even when I don\u0027t have an engineer or the part installed (I have the mod set to career). This is whatever, and is probably not related, but I don\u0027t think it did this before the bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods I have installed, all through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E I believe save for docking port alignment indicator:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClick Through Blockers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB9 Aerospace\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommunity Category Kit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommunity Resource Pack\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeadly Reentry\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDistant Object Enhancement\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnvironmental Visual Enhancements\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirespitter\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Engineer Redux\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModular Flight Integrator\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRaster Prop Monitor\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Planetary Base Systems\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrecise Node\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSci Fi Visual Enhancements\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmokeScreen\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-08T08:17:37Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2019 08:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Wovejulio\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cracky2479","CreatedById":204929,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-25T06:34:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the same bug but my control surface controls dont work.

Every so often my pitch stops working, even though yaw and roll both work fine. I first noticed this when I was troubleshooting my ships uncontrollable tumble during launch when I made my gravity turn. Eventually I noticed that when I pitched my engine there was no visual movement on my engine the way there was for every other control. A couple of times I was able to reassign my pitch and yaw controls and have the engine start responding visually again, and then my stability problem went away even after I reassigned the original mappings of \u0027w\u0027 and \u0027s\u0027.
