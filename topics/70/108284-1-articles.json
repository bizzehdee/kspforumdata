Once you have updated your OP with things like the mods that you are using, as well as any logs that are produced by the game I would be more than happy to help you diagnose and fix your problem. \n\nAgain, I want to state that I am *not* trying to get into an argument, if I come across as being mean or with an attitude, it is not my intention. I would love to help you and I am sure that the community would love to help you too. Problems like the one that you are experiencing can be easy to fix, we just need the background information to pinpoint exactly what is going on. \n\nOne thing that may help you out is to update your [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-1-00-Module-Manager-2-6-3-%28May-4%29-Bonsai-Trimming-Kit-Edition) to the newest version (2.6.3) as the one packaged with Vangard Technologies may be a bit old.\n\nAll the best, SpaceExplorer\n\n---EDIT---\n\nThanks for updating your OP. Quick question, do you also have the plugin that makes it possible for Kerbals to have the parachutes all the time? If not you have to place the parachute box, and then the Kerbal has to go equip it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T22:59:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceExplorer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mrherponaderpsherp","CreatedById":127438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T00:17:16Z","Content":"Yeah.
