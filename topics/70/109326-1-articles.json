At the moment I\u0027ve edited the Scoop CFG file, adding CO2 production = 0.0\n\nThanks\n\nThe Col...\n\n![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T07:45:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 07:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ColKlonk**"}]}
