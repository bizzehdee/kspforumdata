I have an issue on KSP. With some of my planes, I can\u0027t launch without having my wings teared off. I have KJR installed, but it doesn\u0027t change anything.

In the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. As soon as the physics are applied, my plane goes to heck. The wings are ripped off my plane. Even if I add a few SN struts (from B9) on the wings, still, they fall off. Even if I modify the .cfg file of the SN strut by setting angular and straight strength to 5*10e81 (yes, that\u0027s a lot). Still not enough. What could I do?
