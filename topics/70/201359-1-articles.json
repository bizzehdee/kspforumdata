Pre-made crafts will loaded normally and when there existing parts are taken off and put back on they can be launched and flown without anything issues but adding new parts causes the issue unless the craft is saved and loaded again with that new part but that still doesn\u0027t fix the problem with adding new parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried verifying file integrity, uninstalling KSP with clean saves and no existing user data and with or without mods but it has no effect on the bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use Tantares, Tantares SP, Tantares LV, Neptune Camera, Kerbal Engineer and Scatter for mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not seen people experiencing this issue and realized sharing my experience with this bug spreads awareness about it and potential fixes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcuse me if this is not right place for this question I am new to the forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-31T18:51:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry it without Kerbal Engineer to see if it still does it.
