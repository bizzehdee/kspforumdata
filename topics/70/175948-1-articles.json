You can test this easily by deactivating the commnet in your difficulty options. You also got a little symbol\u00A0 the top left corner while controling a probe (looks like the \u0027probe\u0027 symbol shown in the map view, next to the signal strength). This will provide some additional informations if you hover your curser above this symbol. Can be \u0027Full control\u0027 (green symbol), \u0027no control\u0027 (red symbol) and depending on your difficulty settings some kind of \u0027half control\u0027 (orange).
