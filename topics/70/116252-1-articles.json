In any case the base game has memory leaks (such as each scene change).\n\nBest suggestion I have is to use [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118928-1-0-2-Sentinel-Memory-Monitoring-Utility-%28v0-3-Beta%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118928-1-0-2-Sentinel-Memory-Monitoring-Utility-%28v0-3-Beta%29)\n\nThis will give you a warning when you are about to hit the limit, that way you can save and restart the game."},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T22:42:12Z","Content":"Make sure you have PPFX disabled in the graphics settings, Huge leak there"}]}
