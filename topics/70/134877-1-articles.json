Everything is normal the game is also vey smooth but when I revert a\u00A0flight the game crashes. The load screen takes 20 minutes, the gameplay takes 10 minutes then crash !! it is more awful in 32 bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve few quetions about it:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1-) Why this happens because of a incompatible mod ? (I\u0027m also using 64 bit unfixer)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2-) How can I detect the mod that causes crash ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3-) When I start the game it stucks 2 or 3 times\u00A0like in the\u00A0picture below. And I must restart the game so I waste 1 hour with opening the game Is there a solution for this bug it also occurs\u00A0in 32 bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4-) How can I make the load time quicker ? Because as I mentioned above I waste 20 mins for opening the game and after 10 mins it crashes.
