I need some help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy KSP, earlier today, seems to have died this afternoon. Basically when a went to open it up, like you do, it just shows me the windows loading cursor and never opened. The only way to make it start loading is to launch it from the launcher, and then it loads fine. But when I try to load any craft... It is frozen in space, all the RCS thrusters are firing and things are generally broken to the point I\u0027m worried about my save being corrupt (but I have no idea how to figure if it is).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to fix KSP by running the patcher multiple times, and it doesn\u0027t seem to do anything. I tried to overwrite all the stock game files with a clean KSP directory and it didn\u0027t work at all, either. Any help is really appreciated, since this is my 2nd carrer save in the span of a week, although the first one was due to a corrupt save, on a different KSP install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a picture of my Mun ship bugging out:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022jdtNoi4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jdtNoi4.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying the patcher as I write this, so if it gets fixed I\u0027ll just change this to \u0027Answered\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Yep, patcher did nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-19T01:06:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2016 01:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pine\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pilotmaster","CreatedById":149483,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-19T03:22:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat mod you have install?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HazelPine","CreatedById":164526,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-19T03:44:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout 80 of them, but I tried removing all of them and it still bugged everything on a new save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-19T14:22:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222636705\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022142041\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466298262\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022164526\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pine\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, Pine said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to fix KSP by running the patcher multiple times, and it doesn\u0027t seem to do anything.
