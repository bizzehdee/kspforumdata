My recommendation would be to sit tight and wait for an update. It is good for learning piloting skills. Also, do you have any other mods installed? If so, what are they?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silvereagle2061","CreatedById":116341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T03:33:57Z","Content":"\nAll my other mods work fine.

Only mod was Mechjeb and it still wouldn\u0026#39;t work. I do understand that I can just pilot the craft, and I actually avoided using Mechjeb for a long time because I was worried about the complexity of it all.
