After succesfully landing the evac-lander I edited the persistence file to change the names of my Kerbals. When this was all said\u00A0and done, I loaded my game, and all the Kerbals in the astronaut complex are fine, but the moonbase-Kerbals dissapeared, taking large sections of the science lab with them. The observation cupola is just hanging there now. How do I fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PayadorPerseguido","CreatedById":155753,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-19T15:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTell me you have made a backup save before edititing that file.
