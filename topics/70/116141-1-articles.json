I researched fuel lines, added them to a few ships, etc. Then I come back more recently, and fuel lines are no longer available in the VAB or SPH, and my ships with them are listed as invalid. When I look in the R\u0026D Lab, I can see that they\u0027ve been researched and the parts purchased. I\u0027m guessing that something borked when the game was saved at some point. Can this be fixed by editing the save game?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T03:40:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 03:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ixonal**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T21:48:18Z","Content":"I suspect, that your tech tree got an update (SETIctt) and that they are now available later.\n\nUnfortunately it is a \u0022feature\u0022 of ksp 1.0.x tech tree modding, that you do not keep your researched parts but they still show up as researched in the tech tree..."},{"CreatedByName":"Ixonal","CreatedById":79203,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T22:58:21Z","Content":"that\u0027d make sense, though don\u0027t know why they\u0027d move it farther in. it\u0027s pretty far already"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T00:45:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E that\u0027d make sense, though don\u0027t know why they\u0027d move it farther in. it\u0027s pretty far already\n\nNot far enough, since players kept beelining towards them.\n\nThey just enable players to continue with bad stock design habits after a short grind.\n\nMaking the grind more tedious maybe increases the incentive to work on proper craft design instead of just adding more boosters/asparagus to a bad/oversized stock designs.\n\nIt is a transition from the horribly imbalanced stock ksp to a very roughly balanced gameplay, mainly because you grow used to what you encounter first.\n\nIn reality you do not see fuel lines as implemented in ksp at the moment so far, so they should be pretty late."},{"CreatedByName":"Ixonal","CreatedById":79203,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T05:28:50Z","Content":"Huh, well I haven\u0027t been doing much asparagus staging (except for a munar lander design, none on my lifters, though), but I can kinda see your point.
