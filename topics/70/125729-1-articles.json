And I can\u0026#39;t remember the cause. Was hoping for some help.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have just launched two massive halfs of a manned jool mission in my 1.0.5 install. Both launched fine without bugs that I could see. Now docked in LKO.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut in sending up my science pods/probe to the mother ship with a single claw on the top of one probe. And right around 5500m, F3 tells me, i gets structural failures. My girders break off a rockomax 1/8th tank. And my struts shoot off into Infiniti. Everything gets damged. Explosions and crash..\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs this the \u0022klaw bug\u0022 \u003Cbr\u003E\nI used timewarp on the launch pad. An error popped up telling me to quick save and quit NOW.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich I did. Then did a ship redesign. But this keeps happening on every attempt to launch this ship.\n"}]}
