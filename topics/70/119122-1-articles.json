Load distance is well advertised but \u0022pack\u0022 distance is a less well known phenomenon that\u0027s not mentioned much and you only find out about it by interacting with the underlying C# API. I\u0027m only just finding out about it now as it\u0027s causing problems in the kOS mod because increasing the load distance doesn\u0027t seem to do a bit of good at all without also changing the \u0022pack\u0022 distance, which we didn\u0027t know about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoad distance appears to affect when the parts spawn into existence (the range at which the vessel goes from being a pinpoint dot in space to actually being a collection of parts you can see).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPack distance, on the other hand, which tends to be much shorter than Load distance it seems, appears to affect the range at which the vessel freezes into position and refuses to respond to any changing its course or movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the stock game refuses to put a vessel into pack mode if the vessel is moving in atmosphere, and this auto-destruction is it\u0027s response to the attempt to do so?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, for a vessel to truly be properly movable requires that it be within BOTH load distance AND pack distance and pack distance seems to be much much shorter, even though it\u0027s not mentioned much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T15:19:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis actually makes sense, since anything you\u0027d want to remain off rails would normally be detached directly from your active vessel, and thus always be within the pack distance.

But under these circumstances, it is an issue. From the BDArmory FAQ:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ: What\u0027s the deal with the physics range? I heard KSP now has a load range of 22.5km.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA: \u003C/strong\u003EStock KSP has an \u003Cstrong\u003Eunload \u003C/strong\u003Edistance of 22.5km for vessels that are \u003Cstrong\u003Eflying \u003C/strong\u003Eonly. \u0022Unload\u0022 meaning they have to be already loaded in order to remain active to that distance - it\u0027s designed for jettisoned stages. BDArmory extends loading, unloading, packing and unpacking ranges for landed, preflight, flight, orbit, suborbit, and splashed down situations. Whatever you set the load range to, it will never overwrite the default setting if the default is higher. For example, 5km is the default for BDArmory (which can be changed in the settings (alt-\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E) but unload distance for flying vessels is still 22.5km minimum. Without the BDArmory extension, landed pack and unpack is like 200m or 300m which is why normally you can\u0027t switch to landed vessels when flying unless you\u0027re really close. There is, however, a maximum range for landed vessels of about 9-11km. I put this limit on because beyond that distance, landed vessels that aren\u0027t put on rails will fall through the terrain and crash into the \u0022ocean\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-24T00:28:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2015 12:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaiiden\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
