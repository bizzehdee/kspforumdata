Running KSP 1.12.3 with a few mods (heavy visual stuff) but noticed that starting Career I\u0027d much less frames than expected. In this case 55-60fps (I have a pretty power machine) in the Space Center and with a simple rocket on the launch pad.\u00A0I just so happened to try sandbox, same mods, same simple rocket, and it ran at 80-90fps with the same rocket. 50% faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTried this without any mods: Career 50-60fps, Sandbox \u0026gt;180fps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid some google searching and somebody had noticed cheat upgrading facilities in career would fix the problem. It does indeed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I did some experimentation: you only need to upgrade the Astronaut Complex to the first upgrade. Frame rate back to normal! This is true for the Space Center and view on launch pad, but YMMV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
