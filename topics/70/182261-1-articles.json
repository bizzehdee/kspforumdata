Sometimes it will do it as I leave the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to go to Launchpad. It doesn\u0027t do it every time and, after a couple of weeks, I haven\u0027t been able to pin down or reliably replicate its occurrence. But it happens a lot and it is infuriating enough for me to consider giving up the game. I get a sense that it happens on two particular, but very different ships, but not every time of launching. One ship is an early game Minmus satellite launcher, the other is late game Kerbodyne heavy lifter piloted. They do have parts in common, of course, but so do all my others ships which (so far) don\u0027t have the glitch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: It seems to take longer to load on the Launchpad when the reset happens between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and pad\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d welcome any thoughts about tackling this...or if it is an issue other people have.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTIA \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-18T20:33:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2019 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by POllik\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EExtra information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
