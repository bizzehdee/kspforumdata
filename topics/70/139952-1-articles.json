The problem I\u0027m seeing is that Mechjeb and Kerbal Engineer Redux is not taking the fuel from the modules into consideration when calculating the DeltaV, While i should be having easily 3000 dV or more it\u0027s only displaying 200 dV, as a work around I\u0027m using the TAC Fuel Balance mod to get fuel into the main tank.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyone else experienced this issue before?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T12:16:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose as a matter of form I should ask whether you clicked the \u0022disable crossfeed\u0022 button on the ports. It defaults to enabled, but it\u0027s worth checking. Also worth checking is whether you have any separators or decouplers between the ports and the rest of the ship (crossfeed defaults to disabled on those).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malich","CreatedById":152798,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T15:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr enable staging.
