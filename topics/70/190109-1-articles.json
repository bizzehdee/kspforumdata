Although I have experience with both kerbalism and KSPI-E, I have never played with both in the same game. A bit of searching around on the forums revealed that while Kerbalism is not explicitly incompatible with KSPI-E, it wreaks havoc on its waste heat dynamics, as well as stuff related to all the reactors, like their control panels, EC production etc. Is there any way to reconcile the two, with config patches or are these two mods just not meant to be together.
