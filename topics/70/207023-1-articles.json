In the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, I made sure both were set to \u0027open\u0027. I launch the plane, checked the intakes and they are both open. Then I press the space bar to stage, which should activate the engine, which is does, BUT it also sets the intake (both buttons) to closed...one of them I can open, the other one stays closed, and I can\u0027t open it, so my jet engines all flame out, oxygen deprived.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoes anyone have any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-23T15:31:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2022 03:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Michel Bartolone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENew info and eliminated garbage in the original post.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Michel Bartolone","CreatedById":181707,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-23T17:27:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditional info:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI just went in and built a new plane. It was just a cockpit, a bunch of side by side fuel tanks, 2 of each of the subsonic intakes, the shock cone intake, the diverterless intake, and some landing gear to get it up off the ground (no wings as I was only testing the intakes). I checked and all of them have the two intake control buttons. In the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E I made sure both were open on all of the intakes. I launched, and checked again, and all were open. I staged to activate the engines, and both of the intake entries on each of the intakes were closed by staging. I tried to click on both of the control buttons for each intake, and one will open, and the other one will not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Michel Bartolone","CreatedById":181707,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-25T13:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t even begin to understand how this can be...but I decided to do a new fresh load of 1.12.3, with the latest breaking ground, and _all_ of the mods I have installed...guess what...the new install works just fine. I even copied over all of the ships, and the saved games. I have not had the chance to check on the other issue (multiple station parts \u0027staging\u0027. when a new ship docks), but the throttle issue is resolved with the new install.\u00A0 So, since I am using the same saved games in the new install, I have to assume the issue is the game itself somehow got corrupted, rather than the craft files, or the persistence files etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
