The end goal was to dock the two outside sections to each other eventually, but since I can\u0027t seem to control them independently anymore, I\u0027m at a loss.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue? I\u0027ve tried reloading, sending the kerbal on EVA (since one of the pieces doesn\u0027t have a probe core) but I\u0027m unable to separate the two.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T04:25:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 04:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dimenus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dimenus","CreatedById":139713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:54:46Z","Content":"Determined that the behavior is caused by the AES pod.
