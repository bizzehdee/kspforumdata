I\u0027ve seen some \u00A0youtbers having the same issue in the pre-release of 1.2, but This is the first time its happening to me. Has anyone had the same issue? You can see in the screenshot below that both probes are still there (and they have a connection to KSP), but they don\u0027t register as a flight and therefore I can\u0027t switch to them. I haven\u0027t had any issues with space junk , so I\u0027ve been able to square bracket from the junk to the probes every once in a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m on Windows\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion: 1.2.0.1586\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m only running MechJeb Dev.
