The other day I installed RemoteTech and the RemoteTechXF mods. I was able to run the game a few times, and found the omni-antennas were not functioning, so I removed RT and RTxf. Now the game is stalling during the parts loading when I boot it up. The Task Manager on my computer says it is still running, the loading jokes continue to scroll, but about 90% of the way through loading, it just stops... I\u0027ve tried removing both and reinstalling, but still just halts loading without crashing. If need be, I can list the mods I\u0027m using, but its up to 20\u002B at this point...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hesitant to go into the persistent file and start deleting things.
