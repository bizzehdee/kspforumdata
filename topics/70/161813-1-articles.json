Also I don\u0027t know if this helps or not but every time it crashes the loading bar on the bottom is at loading asset bundle definitions. \u00A0If you know the solution for this please comment it. I was thinking about factory resetting the computer but I want to do something else.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal101","CreatedById":157058,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-09T00:08:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo to your GameData folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake sure that \u0022ModuleManager\u0022 DLL file \u003Cu\u003Eis present only once\u003C/u\u003E, and its the highest version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDelete all other/older clones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it continues, make sure that there is no ModuleManager DLL file inside the subfolders in GameData.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
