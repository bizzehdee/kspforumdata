Posting this both to the KSP subreddit and here, hoping someone can help!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI\u0027ve pretty recently started playing KSP - having known of it for a long time and thought \u0027that\u0027s something I should try someday\u0027, I finally got my arse into gear and did so. I\u0027ve played Orbiter before, albeit not for a couple of years.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EAnyway, up until a couple of days ago I had left the game in its completely vanilla form. I wanted to at least learn the basics of the game before diving into mods, but at the same time I was drawing up a big wish list of mods that I wanted to install in due course - based on a number of videos and recommendations and so on. The list got fairly extensive, but that\u0027s an aside.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003EAnyway, time comes when I feel I\u0027m up to trying out some mods. One of the first ones I tried to load into the game was FASA, the mod that adds a whole load of Apollo-era parts.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003EQuickly to address points raised in the Support Instructions thread - I ensured in all instances that the mods I was attempting to use were up to date and correctly installed. Generally I would have no issue getting the mod to show up in the game, just that the game would crash before too long. I\u0027m aware of the perennial issues involving memory usage on 32-bit versions of the game, but having read up on those issues this seems to me like it\u0027s a particularly severe instance of this problem, so I believe it warrants this thread. You\u0027ll see further down that I tried to use Active Texture Management and it did not aid the situation.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ESo - I opened up the game with just FASA installed over the stock install, just to take a look at what I was getting, and I immediately began to get crashes in the VAB, pretty much whenever I\u0027m looking at anything to do with the mod. The bigger rockets - the Saturn V and Nova - \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003Einvariably\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E produced crashes when I tried to load them from FASA\u0027s self-contained save file, but it would also regularly happen that I\u0027d get crashes in the VAB even when just playing around with 3 or 4 FASA parts. No launch of any sort was possible when any FASA part was involved - even if I managed to avoid crashing in the VAB, clicking the launch button would invariably produce a crash. These crashes took the form of a beach-ball-of-death requiring a forced quit of the application.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ESo I did some reading and learned that what was probably going on was that I was running out of memory. For information, I am on OSX Mavericks (10.9), still, and I\u0027m running it on a mid-2011 13\u0022 non-retina MacBook Pro, with (I believe) 4GB of RAM. I am beginning to get the horrible feeling that the computer I\u0027m using just plain isn\u0027t up to the task of dealing with hefty mods, but I hope I\u0027m wrong there.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI have tried this with other mods as well. It seems FASA has the most pronounced effect, and I will get these crashes even when FASA is the only mod loaded into the game, but I have also had crashes with other mods such as the SpaceY stuff, Infernal Robotics and others. It does not seem as if mods such as MechJeb, KAS, KIS, KER, DMagic ScanSat, the RCS placement assistant, TweakScale and so on produce any crashes - it seems to be that it\u0027s mods that involve new parts that produce these issues.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI\u0027ve tried a number of things thus far, having found these recommended online in various places. Firstly I tried reducing the texture resolution in the game\u0027s settings - this seemed not to have any effect. I also tried running KSP with absolutely zero other applications open - again, didn\u0027t seem to change things.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI then tried the \u0027Active Texture Management\u0027 mod - this had a noticeable effect in that it reduced the texture resolution on the FASA parts, but I was still getting crashes pretty much as frequently as before.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI then followed the steps in this\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E video - \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/sTtOy4tQzt4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E - which provides steps for making KSP on OSX a 64-bit app.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThis has had the effect of stopping there from being any crashes in the VAB view. I am able to view the biggest rockets FASA has to offer in that view no problem after making the changes in that video. However, I still almost always get a crash when I try to go to launch anything involving FASA parts. Anything bigger than about a Mercury-Redstone sized rocket will produce a crash every single time without exception.
