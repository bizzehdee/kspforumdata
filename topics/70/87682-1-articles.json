I am new and have run into an issue I can\u0027t figure out. I\u0027ve used this method multiple times now, but this is the first I\u0027ve encountered this issue and I can\u0027t seem to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have one tank of fuel, and then have 3 outside tanks with fuel lines going from the outside tanks to the inner, once the 3 have ran out I can drop them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, the outside tanks empty together but currently on this rocket one is emptying at a time which is causing major balance issues leading to an uncontrollable spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy aren\u0027t they emptying in unison anymore and how do I fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T20:39:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA picture of your ship might help so we can see what\u0027s happening. Off the top of my head though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radial separators allow fuel crossfeed. It also seemed to me that any fuel tank that did not have an engine attached to it allowed crossfeed from the sides. This could be overriding your fuel lines. A fix I\u0027d suggest for that would be to design a custom radial separator with the girder segments and the inline stack separators. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake 1x small Girder segment, 1x TR-18A\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttach the small girder segment radially to your ship, then attach the TR 18A to that by turning it sideways and attaching to the top attachment indicator on it. You can then attach your tanks to the TR 18A with surface mounting and get around the problem of crossfeed since fuel doesn\u0027t flow through the stack separator. This is also an excellent way to get to orbit with only the first tech unlocked in a new career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MHI","CreatedById":126284,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T00:19:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat worked, thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
