Let\u0027s just say I didn\u0027t have a lot of time to get them out! Went EVA, gathered half of them, entered into the capsule. Attempted to go EVA again to get the other half, but the EVA button was greyed out and states \u0022Tourists may not disembark from the vessel.\u0022 What\u0027s worse, now that he was classified as a tourist by the game he couldn\u0027t control the ship!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone run into this issue before? I couldn\u0027t find any related posts, but that\u0027s more likely due to the fact that there a tons of \u0022tourists can\u0027t eva\u0022 posts, making it difficult to search for an answer to my particular problem. I thought maybe it was the 2 man capsule mod, but I tried it on the standard Mk1 and had the same issue on the launchpad. As it wasn\u0027t a crash would this even show up in the logs? To avoid his death I downloaded Hyperedit (Don\u0027t judge me!) and used the land feature to keep him from burning up on reentry. When it comes to Mun landings this is going to be a real problem....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Did some checking, and in sandbox or a brand new career game this doesn\u0027t occur. Went back to my bugged game, and I see now that anyone I EVA\u0027d has lost their job title and is now listed as a tourist. Weirder still, after upgrading the astronaut complex from stage 2 to stage 3 a freshly hired pilot does not turn into a tourist upon going EVA on the launch pad and re-entering the capsule as happened to Valentina and Bill. Weird weird weird. Reloaded a quick save, tried this again with orange suits and it appears that it\u0027s only Bill, Bob, Jeb, and Val that are affected by this issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-31T19:02:34Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2015 07:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vladthemad\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vladthemad","CreatedById":100533,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T20:31:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter an hour of testing, I tracked it down to the USI life support mod.
