Inside saves/(your save name)/backups there should be some backup copies of the persistent.sfs file which you can copy out of that folder, paste in the one above and rename to persistent.sfs to load your save that way; you might lose a little bit of progress, but that\u2019s better than starting completely from scratch,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you do a game update recently? Save incompatible is usually due to opening a save file that was made in a newer version of KSP than what you\u2019re using so e.g. if you updated to 1.11.2 you can open a save file made in 1.11.1, but if you go back to 1.11.1 you can\u2019t then open that same save file as it\u2019s been updated to 1.11.2 as well; you can just edit the version inside the save file but this is risky, especially going back to a previous major version (e.g. 1.10) as parts/systems will be different or missing and the save can easily get broken that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daanm","CreatedById":208834,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-22T19:11:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cpre dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003EI did what you told me but now I\u0027m back on the part of: Erro Accesing this save.\nand then I looked up what it could be.
