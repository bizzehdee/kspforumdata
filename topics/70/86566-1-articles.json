I have a kethane converter and storage tank stacked with a drill on the side. I have drilled and filled the tank. I am using KAS to connect the converter to a rover with empty fuel tanks. I try and run the converter to produce Fuel and Ox, but the only option I get it rocket fuel and mono. I tried taking KAS out if the picture in the VAB and redesigned to just a converter, kethane tank and empty fuel tank...all stacked and many different configurations. Still no luck. I can only choose to convert to mono and jet fuel. Not sure where to start looking for the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecal\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T00:33:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy don\u0027t you ask in the Kethane thread.
