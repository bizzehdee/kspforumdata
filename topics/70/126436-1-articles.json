I have that 15\u0022 retina w/ GT750M discrete gpu. Like from the version 1.0.4, the game started to crash more often and nowadays it crashes on every few loading page. I play it on Steam, so checked the missing files if there are. Every time, it finds a few files to download. Then, nothing changes. It crashes again maybe on 3rd loading screen, or 4th. I mean, when I click on a building at KSC it may crash, if it doesn\u0026#39;t, it crashes when I click on Launch button after I build a rocket. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only mods I use is Kerbal Engineer Redux and Chatterer. Nothing else, and the things go worse every time I play. Also, I fear re-installing game because the last time I lost my saved games, although I saved them and then put in the game folder again. It just didn\u0026#39;t work..\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T14:09:10Z","Content":"\nHi ondert.
