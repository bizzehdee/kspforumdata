I have a heavily modded installed that has been going fine thus far, except I noted when I launched one particular ship (which had quite a few probe cores), I was getting some strange lag. The lag cleared up after I uninstalled recoupler (which I wasn\u0027t actually using), except that I noticed whenever I came out of time warp, the game would freeze for about 30 seconds. I could live with that, but now, whenever I enter the screen with that ship, I inevitably will get a crash. I usually can detach one of the probe ships, and sometimes set a maneuver node, but rarely can I set the pathing for more than one ship before I get a crash to desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLogs here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://1drv.ms/f/s!AoyHZiRU1jT-ybQFDaHzIwDo1z-6HQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://1drv.ms/f/s!AoyHZiRU1jT-ybQFDaHzIwDo1z-6HQ\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eightiesboi","CreatedById":133828,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-03T23:20:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, so I left the computer on the Tracking Screen (waiting for a long maneuver node and I don\u0027t like to time warp) and I came home to another crash. This is the first to happen outside of the Flight Screen since I began this (latest) career. Any suggestions? Logs from today added to the same folder link in the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
