I had KSP on a really slow computer with the aforementioned mods, so I downloaded it onto a flash drive and downloaded it onto my laptop. It worked. I then built a better computer, so I copied KSP onto the same flash drive, And downloaded it onto the good PC. I tried to load it up, but for some reason, the actual application of KSP was missing off of my PC, but the weirdest thing is that it is missing off of my laptop, too. I took the file off of my slow PC onto my good PC, and it works. I just wanted to know if anyone else has had this problem, or something like it, and if in your experience is it a recurring problem. And if so, is there a permanent fix?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-05T20:26:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat sounds more like a problem with the copying and pasting of files than a problem with KSP itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
