If there\u0027s already a thread for this, feel free to merge this. I\u0027ve been experiencing an issue intermittently where I get a vessel into orbit, and try to warp to the circularization burn. After a few seconds of warping, the vessel is suddenly sailing out of orbit, but with no change in velocity, it just starts gaining altitude like crazy. Throttling up increases velocity, but does not alter the rate of ascent. The vessel becomes unmaneuverable like it\u0027s still on rails, and it won\u0027t let me re enter warp because it claims the vessel is under acceleration, even with all engines deactivated and/or the batteries dead. Trying to switch to another vessel or the KSC gives a revert warning. I didn\u0027t post logs because there\u0027s no crash, the vessel just goes rogue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning on a MacBook Pro mid-2014. Running several mods, but appears to happen most often during a mechjeb auto-warp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
