This is all using KSP 1.2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I downloaded a newer version of Remote Tech which came with\u00A0ModuleManager.2.8.1. The game loaded fine, then I noticed there were more procedural parts than I usually notice, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks and other parts. These I had never seen, so I am assuming the new modulemanager triggered\u00A0 all of the parts to work. The only problem now is that even when using older versions of modulemanager with the 2.8, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E texture do not load, and I\u0027m stuck with the default Kerbin textures.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else experienced this at all? am I missing something super obvious?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
