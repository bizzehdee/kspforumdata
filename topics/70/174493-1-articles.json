Recently I put a refuelling station on Mun and wanted to go back to my reusable stages, and fly them back to Kerbin, using FMRS. I was waiting about 5-10 minutes before the game rolled back to the moment of stage separation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame happens when I try to turn off the game - it takes ageeeeeeees to properly shut it down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d appreciate any help given, log file below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ufile.io/wn7yi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ufile.io/wn7yi\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
