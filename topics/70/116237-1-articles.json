I\u0027ve Googled for anyone else having this problem and while others randomly have a ship explode I\u0027ve come across a total catastrophe. After playing for many hours/days into my current game tonight when I switched ships and engaged Time Warp it exploded. I loaded my save, tried again, same result. I loaded my save, switched to another ship, it also exploded. \n\nRestarting the game fixes the problem but after doing some work one one and switching to the next it will explode. It is happening for every ship; even ones that have been stable and in operation for nearly a game year. It only started today and I have had the same mods installed for over a week; no new changes to my game I can roll back.\n\nI\u0027ve recorded a video to demonstrate what\u0027s happening.

It broke the game for me. I just spent 4\u002B hours trying to debug my save, I am left to ponder if I should continue playing this or try to find a different physics based construction game that is less messed up and bugged. Seems very sad the game was super fun a few weeks or months ago, then this whole heat BS and is anyone even playing or just endlessly restarting and trying to figure out why stuff blew up and if it was \u0027normal\u0027 or a bug? tuning ships is 95% of the game, can anyone tune a ship right now with unknown thermal issues? So bummed out, this was my relaxation, now its a nightmare of restarting and deleting the physics cache to get maybe 1 in 5 trys a \u0027normal\u0027 game where when I throttle back, engines cool off. 85% of the time its bugged and they stay hot for days, weeks, months, infinity, until I clear the physics file from the root folder and from game data (module manager physics cache) restart, over and over, for that one time it works and they cool off.\n\nUGH! I have a huge station that fits 95 kerbals, I have 50\u002B in space, I feel so bad abandoning them I will likely never come back to this for the trauma of building a story about there adventures, then having some super bad update make me waist literally 20\u002Bhours now since 1.0.3 dealing with bugs trying to \u0027save them\u0027.

One way you can solve it is to bring up the cheat menu (alt\u002BF12) and tick off the box for \u0022ignore max temperature\u0022. I figured it was a mod that was causing it. I moved my save files to a safe location, then deleted the entire game directory and did a clean install. After that I reinstalled only some of my mods, and I haven\u0027t had the problem since then. Now I\u0027m not saying these mods caused the issue, but I did NOT reinstall HGR, Infernal Robotics and Quantum Struts Continued. Since then I haven\u0027t had this issue once. It\u0027s also a possibility that it\u0027s caused because you modified one or more of Squad\u0027s stock parts, or modified some of the game\u0027s other cfg files. All I can tell you is that once I did a clean install and was very careful about what I did and what mods I installed, I haven\u0027t had the issue once. On the down side, in my case I started a new game.\n\nOne habit I\u0027ve gotten myself into with Unity games is to make a \u0022clean copy\u0022 of the current version of the game and stored it in a different folder. Whenever there\u0027s a fairly well-behaved, stable version that I like, I make a copy of it. That way if an update messes up the game and no patch is forthcoming, I can always go back to the previous version. FWIW, if you bought the game on Steam you can \u0022revert to previous stable version\u0022 which will give you v0.90."},{"CreatedByName":"interface","CreatedById":122370,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T18:52:05Z","Content":"The ship exploding, versus just engines and radiators staying overheated, started the first time I opened the f12 screen, now my ships explode after about a minute, no warp or setting adjustments, ships that had over a year in space now just blow up for no reason. It seems to happen on ships with part clipping. Is it possible that no part clipping is allowed now with the new heat system and internal heat? Why in the world would they do that? I have been playing KSP since .24 and clipping parts to make things \u0027cooler\u0027 is part of this, or was. Game is ruined for me if I am forced to \u0027go stock\u0027 and all my ships look like stock generic ships. Are devs taking a \u0027not sandbox, play like we imagine spaceships look not how you do\u0027 approach now? I liked adding nose cones clipped into bodies to create aerodynamic fairings for blocky-ugle models that can take heat but look \u0027unrealistic\u0027 like much of the science parts, it seemed like it was working well even in 1.0.4 for a while, but now every clipped ship (most of my fleet) blows up. I guess I am not posting a bug as much as agreeing this sucks. Others have posted the same issues, for weeks, with no help. Some just say they are giving up and I guess I am as well.

But yesterday I read on forum about f12 menu, opened it, and somehow ruined my game trying to fix the engines never cooling off.

I am guessing, I may need to reinstall 1.0.4 clean? This makes sense that the times I have verified local files through steam while online it has occasionally had the right physics and engines cool off. trying new physics cfg now hope it improves things but I suspect a deeper problem I may have created trying to fix things. Fingers crossed my newest science vessel doesn\u0027t blow up. I have about a minute usually before it does the only option is to bail out 12 kerbals and pick them all up, assuming they are not scattered in the explosion to different orbits.

It seems to be fairly intermittent, and I usually just quit/restart and it stops happening, however recently it is more consistent. I have a ship that recently undocked from an orbital station and I have two planned maneuver nodes. I can time warp to the first node, perform the planned burn, then when I try to warp to the second the ship explodes. When I quickload the game, the ship explodes at the first attempt to time warp to the first node. I haven\u0027t tried to delete any physics files or anything of that nature. I just recently found out about the alt-f12 menu from reading these threads as well.
