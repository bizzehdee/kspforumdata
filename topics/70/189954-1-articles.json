I deleted near future manually to get rid of the \u0022AD\u0022 status in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, and checked \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E and checkboxed version is 1.3.1-1.7.99, but I still get the warning. What do I need to do either to the game files or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E to get near future electrical working again under KSP 1.7.3 (the beta in steam)?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EI hope I described this well enough. Let me know if you have any questions. I tried researching and experimenting on my own before posting, but ultimately hit a wall. Thank you all in advance. I\u0027m just confused as to how I was able to navigate around the Kopernicus issue just to get stuck with a Near Future Electrical issue.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EEDIT: So I investigated in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E more and learned about the tab on the lower right and found I canselect which version of the mod I want t use. I selected all of the to the version in which correspond to the version of KSP I had (the dark green). This fixed most of the issues with loading the game. I only had to roll back near future electrical one additional mod release and all those parts work too. So now I am back to where i was before 1.8.0 came out and KSP is working great for me again!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-25T16:17:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2019 04:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by PsychoMuffin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
