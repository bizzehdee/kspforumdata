There is an official bug tracker but it is only for unmodded games. There is a good chance that your crashes are due to mods that the game developers are not responsible for, especially if you are running mods that haven\u0027t been updated yet for 1.2. Any out of date mods need to be removed until they can be made compatible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion would be to post your report in the forum subsection for \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/70-technical-support-pc-modded-installs/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ETechnical Support, Modded Installs\u003C/a\u003E and include more information about your computer system, exactly which mods you have installed, what is happening in the game when it crashes, and a copy of your error and output logs to help narrow down the cause of your crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also suggest running a copy of the game with no mods installed and see if the crashes keep happening. If it doesn\u0027t crash then start adding your mods in one by one until you can find out which might be causing the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-16T16:40:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2016 04:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-16T17:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to technical support.
