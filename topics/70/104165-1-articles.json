Is something in my design causing this? Basically I have no (or very little) control over the heading the rocket takes once I start the turn."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T09:57:08Z","Content":"You know that with FAR drag is based on shape and the more you expose your shape to the wind the more the wind tries to push you in that direction. The basic rules of thumb are to keep your initial TWR below 1.5 and to keep your heading somewhat inside the yellow prograde marker until you reach around 30km where the atmospheric pressure is low enough to turn as fast as you want. But there should be loads of tutorials in the tutorial section that explain it all in more detail."},{"CreatedByName":"funkcanna","CreatedById":138944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T16:12:59Z","Content":"Im doing that but its got a mind of its own! Ive read lots of tutorials etc and I\u0027m following them, but very often my rockets just veer off at any angle they want and I don\u0027t know why! Im keep rockets slim and symmetrical."}]}
