It really is the only thing that reduces performance in my install. When I am over some really high altitude then performance is great. But when I am reaching orbit, FPS go way down if I look down towards Kerbin, and up if look at the sky. So I think that when it stops calculating polygons I get good FPS. but it is unneccesary for it being so high.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
