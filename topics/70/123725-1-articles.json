I\u0027m able to make it close, but then I run into an issue, which you can see by the pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first picture shows me getting cm away from the docking port (albeit at the wrong attitude, which I\u0027ve thus far been unable to fix since I put my RCS thrusters in the wrong spot and thus they don\u0027t turn my craft around like I want it to... and also because I\u0027m horrible at docking)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi57.tinypic.com/vmw2fs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vmw2fs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll well and good, right?

No explosion, nothing, it just disappears and the space on the hub becomes empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know why this is happening or what I can do to fix it?
