I\u0027ve realized that, but after dropping the plane from a height (Using VesselMover), the plane can fly, just a bad pitch response\u00A0I\u0027ll fix later on. The plane still can pitch up, but the problem is that the plane won\u0027t even pass 1 m/s at full throttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-20T09:58:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2019 09:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by FahmiRBLXian\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commodore_32","CreatedById":200414,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-23T01:18:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that the prop engines you are using are not powerfull enough to make that beast to takeoff\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recommend you empty all the fuel tanks and put alt \u002B f12 infinite fuel hack\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen see if its working, if not that means that your craft has something wrong\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coyotesfrontier","CreatedById":181596,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-24T17:13:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose prop engines are from Airplane Plus, and are pretty underpowered in my opinion.
