I know that after some time things even without power can appear turned somewhere else than before. Now solar panel gets enough energy, but nothing gets transferred to the probe/batteries. Visible mods: SCANSat and I believe one of the mods with surface experiments, that\u0027s where solar panels come from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cratercracker","CreatedById":171449,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-14T20:00:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you have way too much instruments consuming power?

First, it gives you Backup Power. if your drone dies, you can route a small amount of backup power to your main to revive the machine. Second, it shows you your energy use and even a list of parts that use and generate energy. It may not work with all mods that add EC generating devices to the game but most of the time it works great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and in that screenshot, you have only 215 EC capacity. You need a bigger battery. That antenna will eat through it in about 5 seconds when transmitting data and once the battery is dry, your probe is useless. Again, AmpYear will help with such situations but you need more power storage and generation. Balance solar and batteries. Devices drain power from batteries. No matter how big solar panels you have, if your battery is small you will run into this problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-17T00:30:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2017 12:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbital\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
