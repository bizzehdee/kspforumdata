FAR nerfs the jet engines to be more in-line with the way a real jet is supposed to work, but as I understand they are still quite off.

Since FAR gives you realistic drag, the jets\u0027 thrusts are lowered to match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey still *far* outperform real jets, because they\u0027re still modeled as rockets (KSP don\u0027t actually model jets, just airbreathing rockets) so thrust does not decrease with air density. Also they\u0027re ~16x as fuel efficient as they should be, since due to another bug, IntakeAir is included in Isp calculatons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheFlyingPigs","CreatedById":122671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T08:08:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see what you did there with the FAR Nathan...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#PUNSAREPUNNY\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
