This issue started after I had to force shutdown my computer due to it getting stuck on the restart screen. The computer operated fine after being turned on, and I shut it down for the night, and in the morning, I turned it on and booted up KSP, and then KSP took minutes to load each file. I don\u0027t know what is causing this, and I didn\u0027t have the time to wait for it to load. The only mods I have are restock and restock plus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-06T18:50:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA log file will help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
