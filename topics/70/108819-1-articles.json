(and latest module manager)\n\nFirst I installed tweakscale, and it acted normally - when I changed the size of a tank, its physical shape as well as the amount of fuel it holds changed.\n\nHowever, then I installed Modular Fuel Tanks, which seems to break this behavior. Tweakscaled tanks change in physical shape but the amount of fuel it holds does not change.\n\nHelp would be greatly appreciated\n\nThanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T21:28:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 09:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by samwise800**"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:25:21Z","Content":"Try contacting the owner of both mods and tell them about this."}]}
