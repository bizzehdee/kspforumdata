I have a few mods installed (Modular Launch Pads, Shuttle Orbiter Konstruktion Kit, reDirect for SOCK, Feline Utility Rovers), but most of my mods are just enhancing the gameplay (mechjeb or Kerbalengineer). I got it to start two times yesterday, but at the third time it froze again.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nHas someone here got\u00A0a solution for this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-05T13:13:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou must have some hardware or driver issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo userspace software should be able to lock up the OS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
