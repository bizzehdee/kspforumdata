The cause is easily a number of hungry add-ons (E.V.E. \u002B Astronomer Pack again, being among the largest to load), but sure the memory leak (tied to the overheated parts while the temperature gauges are shown) may also take its share. The log shows the crash happened when exiting from flight to space center, ans sure KSP has to reload some assets when doing so, if RAM use was already too high before there would not be enough left to complete the operation.\n\nOne suggestion that always worked for me (on Win32 system): try the OpenGL mode (use \u0022-force-opengl\u0022 suffix in the commandline to start KSP), it will save a sizable amount of RAM and may easily mean the ability to run a heavily modded KSP install."},{"CreatedByName":"Merit","CreatedById":144322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T18:06:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E To start, I would uninstall all the Astronomer\u0027s pack parts in your mod list.
