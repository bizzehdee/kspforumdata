It wasn\u0027t a problem for me because the 64bit version of the game was working absoluterly fine.\n\nUnfortunately now i found out that ALL the 64bit data and EXE has been removed from my game (steam version, integrity cache ok) and so I am NO longer able to play the game at all !!!! ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif):mad:![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)\n\nIs there any way i can have back my 64bit version??? This would solve my problem in a splitsecond because i never had any problem with that version!!!!\n\nIs very frustating to be forced to renounce to some part of the game when before the 64bit cancellation everything was working absolutely smoothly!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"axehandle99","CreatedById":141175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T01:14:20Z","Content":"i too am experiancing these dificulties and would like the 64bit version back"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T01:23:49Z","Content":"Squad removed it in preparation for 1.0.
