I\u0027m installing some graphic mods and I keep running into this issue with textures overlapping each other on the planets. I posted a screenshot of my mod list. I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s scatter but if I remove it, then the other graphic mods don\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod list: https://i.imgur.com/99DGnSs.png\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTexture overlapping: https://i.imgur.com/JsXfCyi.jpg\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt night, the textures appear to be \u0022city lights\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-23T22:32:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you use the \u201Cinsert image from URL\u201D button at the bottom right of the text box, you can paste those links into it and it will embed the image like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JsXfCyi.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002249.17\u0022 height=\u0022417\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JsXfCyi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust looking at the image of your GameData I see a few things that look wrong- first of all, there\u2019s a GameData folder inside your GameData folder which is never right- take the contents of that second GameData and put it in the first, then delete the duplicate. The \u201CExtras\u201D folder is a bit odd too, I suspect that one needs to have its contents moved to the GameData folder too. I don\u2019t see Module Manager on the list, but that could just be because it hasn\u2019t scrolled down far enough? And I have no idea what ModuleManagerWatchDog is, where did you get that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this issue is arising because Parallax is interfering with the city textures in AVP- either remove Parallax or delete the city/city-lights co figs from AVP and it *should* fix this issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
