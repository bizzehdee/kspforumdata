The stock small rover wheels won\u0027t support the rover when they are colliding with other parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImages of the full lander, little hard to see.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/YBLLu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/YBLLu\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0The first image is with the decoupler still holding the rover to the lander. The second is after, instead of the suspension of the wheels extending to support the rover, it collapses. The wheels spin helplessly as if there is no contact whatsoever. The rover works flawlessly if started without the lander and can drive on the launchpad and ground no issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m on linux 1.0.5. I can\u0027t imagine what\u0027s causing this and I don\u0027t have any mods that effect wheels installed. Absolutely any help would be terrific.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tfin","CreatedById":27558,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T12:23:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was posted Tuesday!
