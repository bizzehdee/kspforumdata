of my mods for that version.\u00A0 and then I have to go and up date all the threads.\u00A0 It takes a lot of time to do.\u00A0 I do it for fun, and I don\u0027t get paid.\u00A0 Yes, I do get some small contributions, but believe me, it doesn\u0027t pay all my bills.\u00A0 Far from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, once my mods are working in a new version of the game, AND all the

and Spacedock, some problems are inevitably going to be found in the first batch of mods I update.\u00A0 Even though they are listed as compatible with whatever version is current.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the .version files contain information as to what version the release is for.\u00A0 It can contain, among other things, a specific version of KSP, or a range of versions for KSP.\u00A0 For example, a mod can be specific to 1.4.1, or it can be compatible with 1.4.1-1.4.9.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I did my updates to 1.4, initially I made them specific to 1.4.1 because of the way 1.4 and then Making History was released, and I did not want to bother supporting a version of the game which was literally only available for a week.\u00A0 So, most of the version files got set to 1.4.1 specifically.\u00A0 Then 1.4.2 was released, then 1.4.3, and eventually 1.4.4 and 1.4.5.\u00A0 As I continue to work on mods, I do update the .version files, but in most cases, I don\u0027t.\u00A0 I do try to keep the titles of the threads updated, and as time goes on I do slowly update the older .version files.\u00A0 But, because of this, and because I don\u0027t have hours of time to go back through all of the mods, the situation ends up with KSP-AVC telling you that the mods weren\u0027t made for that version of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a bit annoying, and I do have plans to eventually fix KSP-AVC, but that won\u0027t help you now.\u00A0 But all of my mods will work on all versions of 1.4, regardless of the messages you receive.\u00A0 If you don\u0027t want to receive those messages, then there is an option:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBefore you do, if any message
