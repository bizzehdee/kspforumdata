I uninstalled every mod I have, and the issue was corrected. This has only popped up in the last two days, and those are the only mods I\u0027ve added in that span of time. Any idea how to fix this?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: I\u0027ve tried them each in isolation, and none of them are causing it to happen. Also, I\u0027m using the latest versions of everything.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit 2: I\u0027ve ruled out the following mods: DMagic, KAS, KIS, TakeCommand, SpaceY, MRS, Kerbal Planetary Base Systems, SCANsat, MechJeb2, and Infernal Robotics.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit 3: After finally getting some more free time, I\u0027ve found that it seems to happen when I install QuizTech with B9 (though not when using QuizTech by itself). The issue seems to be resulting from QuizTech\u0027s version of Firespitter being out of date. Issue seems to be fixed by replacing the version in QuizTech\u0027s GameData folder with the most recent version of the plugin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-24T01:13:39Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2015 01:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Grenartia\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T23:28:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the same issue, sometimes.
