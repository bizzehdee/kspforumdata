I\u0027ve got the impression that this is probably not a proper memory leak. It seems that the game caches a second copy of the assets that have actually been used, and then fails to clear the cache when the assets are no longer needed. As a result, the 4 GB memory limit (more like 3-3.2 GB on a Mac) not only has to be enough for preloading all assets on startup, but also for caching a second copy of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMac has 8 gigs memory and ksp uses about 1 gig and when caches/assets are created, it\u00A0over loads the memory\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
