In a lot of flights, at some point one side of the fairing (2 sided) will break due to \u0022structural failure between fairing base and conic fairing\u0022. They usually don\u0027t break anything and just stick to the rocket until I cut acceleration (which makes me waste some fuel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore people ask and stuff, I can\u0027t be bothered narrowing down the cause by removing mods\u00A0(I have 60\u002B mods installed) and I know I\u0027m playing an outdated version. I\u0027m not asking for a proper fix or investigation. I\u0027m just writing this thread to see if anyone ever had this issue before; or if people knew which files to edit to increase the structural strength of these parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a link to my list of mods somewhere in my sig.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
