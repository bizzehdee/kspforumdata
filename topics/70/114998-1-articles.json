I had hired a scientist from the worker pool and sent her to Ike with Jeb, Bob, Bill, and Val, and when I go to EVA her it tells me you can\u0027t EVA a tourist. I think maybe it\u0027s a mistake and I put a tourist in the ship by accident, but no it is definitely the scientist I hired. I don\u0027t even have any tourist contracts active. Is there a file I can edit that will have her switch back?\n\nThis is the list of mods active:\n\nAsteroid Day\n\nCommunity Resource Pack\n\nContract Window \u002B\n\nCrowd Sourced Science\n\nFinal Frontier\n\nHabitat Pack\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\nKerbal Attachment System\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux\n\nKerbal Inventory System\n\nLayered Animations\n\nModule Manager\n\nModule RCSFX\n\nPrecise Node\n\nScience Alert\n\nStock Plugins\n\nUSI - Exploration/Freight Transport/Kolonization/Life Support/Survival Pack/Tools\n\nThat is all.
