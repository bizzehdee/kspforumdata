Now, the idea of setting up a network with probes to controll your unmanned rockets is in the stock game. Nevertheless, RemoteTech was a little bit more complicated, cause I had to stay in sight of the station center and have to set up a network of 4 probes which I had to link together to do unmanned missions more far away (but still in the Kerbin orbit). Now, every probe is connected to Kerbin as long as it is in the Kerbin Orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is fine for me but I want to know, what do I have to do if I launch probes, who will left the Kerbin Orbit? Like for Duna missions and so on....cause RemoteTech seems not to work any more, which is, as I already have said it, fine for me - I just want to know how the new systems work cause I couldnt find something precisely on the internet....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

I decided to disable all the extra ground stations and have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E as my only ground station. Since I\u0027m fairly low in the tech tree right now, my most powerful relay is the RA-2 (2 million kilometer range). My network is still limited to just the Kerbin system with 3 synchronous RA-2\u0027s in orbit about Kerbin. I know I didn\u0027t need to go to the effort of making them synchronous, but having a satellite stationed directly over \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E has some nice advantages over just communications. If I want to launch into Minmus\u0027s orbital plane, I switch to the satellite over \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, target Minmus and then wait until the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E approaches the satellite. Then switch back to the craft on the launchpad and take off with the correct inclination. No mess, no fuss, and nearly perfect match every time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, those 3 RA-2 form the core of my expanding network. Around the Mun, I have 3 more satellites, each with 4 HG-5\u0027s acting as a relay. They can get a signal strength of about 99% from any of the RA-2\u0027s in orbit around Kerbin and they serve to provide control and science reports for probes and ships working around the Mun. And the network has also expanded to another set of 3 satellites each having 4 HG-5\u0027s around Minmus. Unfortunately, there was an ... incident ... upon inserting the 3rd satellite and one of it\u0027s HG-5\u0027s was destroyed leaving it with only 3 HG-5\u0027s. But the signal strength from Kerbin to Minmus was unsatisfactory so there\u0027s a 4th satellite in a highly eccentric polar orbit with a RA-2 (orbit has periapsis of 15 km and apoapsis of 2000 km so that it\u0027s rarely blocked from contact with Kerbin. This satellite serves to get a 100% strength signal from the Kerbin RA-2\u0027s and then relays that signal to the constellation of HG-5\u0027s to service any other probes or ships in the area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to date, there are 10 relays in the Kerbin system. 3\u00A0RA-2\u0027s around Kerbin itself. 3 sets of HG-5x4\u00A0around the Mun and another set of 3 HG-5x4 around Minmus (one damaged)\u00A0and a RA-2 around Minmus to boost the signal so Minmus has a 100% strength signal. Future plans are to add some powerful relays in highly eccentric polar orbits around Kerbin as the tech for RA-15\u0027s and RA-100\u0027s gets unlocked. Figure on an apoapsis of about 84,000 km and a periapsis of about 80 km. Those to be built relays will form the core of my future interplanetary network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-21T01:07:07Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2016 01:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by John Cochran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECorrected number of RA-2\u0026#039;s around Kerbin\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnaxeX","CreatedById":164313,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-21T12:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk then thank you guys a lot!
