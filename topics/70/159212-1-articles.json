MechJeb and Alarm Clock are my only mods.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI plan a maneuver with advanced planetary transfer, and the node shows up as usual. Plot looks good and leads to an intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhether I have MechJeb do the \u0022execute maneuver node\u0022 or I do it myself with just \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E heading hold, I get about three quarters through my burn when several\u00A0things happen instantly and simultaneously. First, the targeted planet is un-targeted. Next, the maneuver node pops instantly to a new heading several degrees away. Third, the delta V required jumps up to a few thousand m/s\u00A0to some seemingly random number (maybe the original \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E?). Obviously if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E-follow-node or MechJeb is on, I\u0027m thrown way off course as they follow the new node to nowhere fast. If I free hand it and just hold the original heading, I have to guess my way to engine cutoff, as I\u0027m now no longer pointing towards a node and my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E countdown is inaccurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis only happens during interplanetary transfers- in system works fine. It happens on every ship, not just one in particular.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas why a new maneuver node is created mid maneuver? If needed I can upload a video-\u00A0it\u0027s a large file and I\u0027d rather see if this description suffices first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-15T01:44:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2017 01:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by UH60guy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
