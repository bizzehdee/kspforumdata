I also have no other mods that modify the visuals of the planet.

I was able to save what remained of the plane with some parachutes I put on for landing. when on the water surface, I noticed that, when the water is looked at from specific camera angles, or in some cases just all the time, the water detail was not present, there was only a blank sphere where the water should be darkening the ground under it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nas I have said before, I don\u0027t have any other mod that change how planets look, which leads me to believe scatterer is causing the issue\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
