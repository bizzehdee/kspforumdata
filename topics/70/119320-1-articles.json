I found that when Kerbal doesn\u0027t have permissions to write in the save directory in your Kerbal install directory, it switches to some folder buried under my \\Users\\[my users] folder somewhere. Perhaps KPS launcher is launching with admin rights and your direct launch isn\u0027t, or the other way around, and that may be causing a difference. Try creating a new game in either, using distinctive and different name, and do a search on your harddisks for directories with those name to find where it actually thinking it needs to get your saves from.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T13:43:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved this over to Modded Support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ald","CreatedById":121195,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T15:32:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried moving whole installation folder to some other partition?

Just place it somewhere else. I bet it should solve your problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso you\u0027ve mentioned that you\u0027ve moved your career. Just to be 99% sure, reinstall base game, copy the GameData folder items (excluding Squad folder) from your old game to your new ksp dir and saves dir (and screenshots if any). For a 100% reinstall all mods that were used on old game from scratch one by one (newest versions available). You simply can\u0027t go wrong with this.
