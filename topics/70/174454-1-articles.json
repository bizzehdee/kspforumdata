The first time I start a fresh ksp with fresh DMP I get an incompatible mods detected message and A message with terms of service of darkmultiplayer. Darkmultiplayer works just fine the first time I start KSP. the second time I start KSP the incompatible mods message is still there but there is no DarkMultiPlayer window.
