Thought I\u0027d post the solution here just on the off-chance that someone else has the same issue and sees this thread:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe issue was the relationship between the Breaking Ground expansion and the old Space Suits. The old suits still had the jetpacks drawn on t hem by default but didn\u0027t allow the new inventory system. (No inventory slots would appear on EVA or in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or anywhere else)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs soon as I tried switching to the new suits, I was able to add them into the kerbal\u0027s inventory and use them as per normal.
