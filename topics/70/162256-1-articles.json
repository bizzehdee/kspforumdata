I went up to the control tower, got into the top, jumped up on a window, took a screenshot, and then jumped down from the window to the floor, so I could walk down the stairs again and fly back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Only this time, when I jumped down from the window, the altimeter started going negative, and then was blank. The screen went black. I pressed F3 to check the flight log: \u0027Jebediah Kerman: Currently on escape trajectory out of the Sun\u0027. \u0027Highest speed: NanM/s. Most ground covered: NanM/s\u0027. According to the KSP Wiki, this type of Kraken causes this: \u003Cem\u003EThe navball also disappears, and when returning to the space center, the screen remains black and the game must be manually closed from the desktop. This kraken is particularly dangerous because when encountered on the surface of a planet, it causes all craft in the vicinity to be destroyed, and those left are shot out of Kerbol orbit. The log in Debug Toolbar shows \u0022look viewing vector is zero\u0022. As of V1.1, the altitude GUI will go blank, and the game will crash. \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when I got back to the space center, I could see empty space.

Try a\u00A0install for best in a as high as possible subdirectory order. Best C:\\KSP?\\ if you mode then you have a much easier job to controll your install.
