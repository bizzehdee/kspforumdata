Weirdly the red dot wich (i suppose) is the point supposed to be the KSC where the communications come from is not situated near the launchpad (that is in florida in RSS) but in south america... : as a result my probes on the launchpad have no connections and can not be controlled. Is that a bug or did i go wrong somewhere ?\n\n![615423Capturedcran100.png](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/615423Capturedcran100.png)\n\nCan you guys help me ? or is Remote tech not compatible with RSS and i have to go back to the original downscaled Kerbin ? Thanks\n\n**EDIT :** **Actually, i have another problem...**\n\n**I decided to install RT on a non-RSS save, but i can still launch probes without antennas and without connection... i could control a stayputnik probe core with no antenna on the other side of Kerbin, at 300km...**\n\n**The RT connection tab under the MET shows a red calculator, as if there was no connection, and the delay tab shows N/A**\n\n**What did i do wrong ?**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T20:31:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 08:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hcube**"},{"CreatedByName":"Landwalker","CreatedById":92710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T13:55:36Z","Content":"Sounds like you need [this config](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84689?highlight=remotetech%20rt2).\n\nRecall that KSC in stock is located on the equator...

Therefore it is in the beginning not possible to launch an uncrewed vessel. You can however, launch crewed vessels that put uncrewed satellites in orbit. Those can connect to uncrewed vessels, e.g. directly near your favourite launch site and from there an omni antenna can be used to directly target vessels on the launchpad.\n\u003E Other Options:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1. You can also install the patch that creates mission control centers at every launch site. To do so, you can either install it directly ([https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/80983870/RemoteTech_Settings.cfg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/80983870/RemoteTech_Settings.cfg)), or you can delete the file GameData/RemoteTech/RemoteTech\\_Settings.cfg, then use ckan install RemoteTech-Config-RSS 0.0\n\u003E 2. Put a 6-kerbal craft with the appropriate hardware directly near the launch site, so that you have a mission control center there. (To send science back however, you have to go to the original mission control.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T19:34:44Z","Content":"Moved to modded support."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T10:06:46Z","Content":"Cool, thanks !\n\nActually, i have another problem...\n\nI decided to install RT on a non-RSS save, but i can still launch probes without antennas and without connection... i could control a stayputnik probe core with no antenna on the other side of Kerbin, at 300km...\n\nThe RT connection tab under the MET shows a red calculator, as if there was no connection, and the delay tab shows N/A\n\nWhat did i do wrong ?\n\nEDIT : updated the problem here and in the OP\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T10:49:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 10:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hcube**"}]}
