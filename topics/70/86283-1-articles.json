I\u0027ve always thought Windows crash logs left much to be desired. On the one hand they\u0027re completely incomprehensible, using hex error IDs that I\u0027d have to go look up somewhere to even know what the crash WAS, let alone why it happened. And yet, on the other hand, they provide so little information on what actually caused the issue that even if I knew what the crash was I\u0027m unlikely to ever find out why, and, therefore, have any chance of stopping it from happening in the future. I end up doing what I imagine most plebs do and pray that the error boogeyman doesn\u0027t return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t played KSP on anything but Windows so I\u0027m not sure if the error logs are any more insightful on other platforms, all I know is they mean very little to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy most recent crash shows up as \u0022mono.dll caused an Access Violation (0xc0000005) in module mono.dll at 0023:10118f0a.\u0022 Which is a stupid thing to say, because of course it caused an error in itself, it certainly didn\u0027t cause a bank error in my favor (is it common for DLLs to cause errors in other DLLs? That would seem to be rather problematic from a security standpoint). I assume that hex number is the ID code of the error (How many errors do they have coded that they need a 64-bit number to designate them all? Actually, I can tell you, judging by the c (1100), it\u0027s at least 18 quintillion), I\u0027m glad they\u0027ve finally started to give us the name of the error in addition to the ID, I\u0027d hate to have to flip through what must be a gigantic manual consisting of several hundred trillion pages to look it up. I don\u0027t know where \u00220023:10118f0a\u0022 is, that might make some bit of sense if I had the code in front of me, though I kinda doubt it, but otherwise it\u0027s meaningless gibberish. Based on what little programming experience I have, I\u0027m assuming that \u0022access violation\u0022 means \u0022buffer overflow\u0022 due to running out of memory. There\u0027s a section for \u0022Context\u0022 which provides no context whatsoever, it\u0027s clearly using an extremely obscure definition of the word. Similarly \u0022Bytes at CS:EIP\u0022 appears to be of very little help. As is, for that matter, the stack, which appears to be a dump of some section of memory, presumably the stack, with no readily apparent structure, basically just the apparently random noise you get with arbitrary memory dumps (like uninitialized arrays). This is followed by an apparently arbitrary subset of the DLLs, I can only assume, the game had loaded, it\u0027s not all of them that must be loaded (since none of the addons are in there), but they also seem to be related to the game in some way (like xinput and that damnable mono.dll, which might as well be aids.dll, though in this context I imagine it\u0027s referring to the software compatibility platform rather than the viral disease).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay what you will about Java (and I agree, it\u0027s a godawful language and platform that, in trying to be good at everything, has ended up not really been being good for anything) at least when it crashes, which it does often and with great enthusiasm, its error messages are somewhat understandable and helpful in avoiding similar errors in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
