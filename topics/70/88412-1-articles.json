A few thoughts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane probes have a rather high power draw. I would start be making sure that the probe is turned off, as even if your panels are generating charge it might not be enough to charge the batteries while the scanner is on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly obviously if the panels aren\u0027t facing the sun then they won\u0027t generate electricity.

That will lock out all controls and could make it seem like you\u0027re out of power when you\u0027re not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Incidentally, equatorial orbit isn\u0027t particularly efficient for scanning with probes such as Kethane and ScanSat (although there are sometimes good reasons for doing this anyway).
