Stock system is boring me after so many hours spent on KSP so I want to make it little harder (I know about Real Solar System but I want to stay on Kerbal system). So I\u0027ve found mods which makes Kerbal system 4x bigger. I speak about this one:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/145178-1xx-4x-solar-system/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/145178-1xx-4x-solar-system/\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nand this:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/142673-113-4x-kerbol-system-clouds-opm/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/142673-113-4x-kerbol-system-clouds-opm/\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here is problem:\u00A0No matter what mod I choose, they have same problem - water has no collision. When I back from orbit and try to land on water, all objects simply fly through water surface and crashing on the bottom of ocean. Without these mods water is fine. Is there any way to solve this? There is no log\u00A0because I don\u0027t know which log\u00A0should I attach. If you tell me I will give it. Thank you in advance.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: Ok I managed to fix that. It was caused by lack of the Ocean section in config. after adding it everything is fine now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-18T15:55:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2018 03:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by BlackAndWhite\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EProblem solved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
