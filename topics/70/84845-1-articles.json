Dynamic load stresses are proportional to both speed and air density (EAS). If unpowered, speed isn\u0027t very controllable, but air density is. You would need to bleed off speed while remaining at higher altitudes for longer, before descending to the lower strata of the atmosphere. Depending on how conservative your bleed-off passes are, you may need to perform multiple orbital passes. It\u0027s been a while (and a few FAR versions) since I had an assembly like yours that would have required this, but if I recall correctly, the sweet spot is when I can get the AP (on stock-size Kerbin) below 80km while still keeping PE above 60km. MUCH easier said than done, I\u0027ll grant, but once that scenario plays out, you likely won\u0027t have enough speed to remain aloft for more than one more orbital pass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
