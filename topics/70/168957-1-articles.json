The icon appeared on the taskbar, and the music kicked in after a minute, signalling that it had finished loading... but it was not showing up on screen. I restarted my PC a few times, I re-launched KSP a few times, I tried clicking on the taskbar icon and moving it, I un-installed and then re-installed KSP, I updated my driver, I tried opening it\u00A0again, I tried everything I could think of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I launch the game, the window does not show up, but it does load and then play the main menu music. It\u0027s there on my taskbar. It acts like it\u0027s there on my screen, as when I right click it and select \u0022move,\u0022 my cursor appears in the middle of the screen, like the game \u003Ci\u003Eis\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Ethere, but is just invisible. I checked the log, to no avail. KSP is acting normally. It\u0027s just not showing up on-screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI highly doubt mods have anything to do with this, as my game launched fine yesterday, and I haven\u0027t installed any new mods since then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else experienced anything else like this?

I am telling this a lot to a lot of people, but im ussualy not helpful that much. However, this time I might be. Let me ask you a question, how many screens do you use? Beacuse, on my computer, sometimes some programs do the exact same thing, and then when I switch my TV (second screen) to AV I can see the window. Now, to my understanding, it should be impossible for ANY game to load on a different screen, except if somehow your PC decided that it just won\u0027t start the window on the main screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI highly doubt this is your issuse, but you can at least try to completely disconnect your other screens, it might do the trick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this didn\u0027t help, then, at least I tried.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NISSKEPCSIM","CreatedById":173812,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-28T10:35:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only have one screen.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NISSKEPCSIM","CreatedById":173812,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-28T16:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: I reaslied that, even though the window didn\u0027t follow my cursor when I right-clicked the icon in the taskbar and selected \u0022move,\u0022 pressing the left arrow key made the window snap back into view again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem solved?\u00A0Not really...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, my KSP window is black.
