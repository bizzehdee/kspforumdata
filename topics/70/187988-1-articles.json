I believe I may have used a mod that has corrupted or changed part of the base games launch and patch loading code, and then the broken patch loader has been updated to the Steam cloud. I still have no idea why this is happening though, as I am sure that the Steam cloud VERIFIES all files that get sent to it to make sure they are only creating a backup of base-game files, hence why I keep my saves over my three separate computers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidSquid","CreatedById":196199,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-05T04:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d need the crash.dmp file for running an analysis with Windbg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-05T04:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBack up your saves, like in an entirely different directory.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNote the Steam install directory.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUninstall from Steam\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDelete that Steam install directory you noted earlier.

A lonesome save file! The save file was, somehow, causing the initialisation to fail part-way by making the game search for a file that didn\u0027t exist. I don\u0027t know what the file was, possibly a dependency for a mod that changed the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E buildings or some other fundamental part of the game.
