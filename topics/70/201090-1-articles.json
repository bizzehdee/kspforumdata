I have extended tweakables enabled and for testing purposes maxed out all facility upgrades and completed the tech tree. Iam using the \u0022less real than realism\u0022 with a hand full of accompanying mods. I am not that competent with file fiddling. But I could imagine, that the requirement for unlocking the feature in career are not met by the techtree of the mod. In sandbox it works just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be much appreciated? Sadly I am not able to provide a full list of mods used at the moment, but could post it tonight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pehvbot","CreatedById":182810,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-21T20:55:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, this is on me.\u00A0 As you guessed, it\u0027s looking for the wrong techtree node.\u00A0 LRTR uses the custom RP-1 tech tree which doesn\u0027t have the same node names.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you feel comfortable with adding a ModuleManager cfg you can create a new text file (call it mypatches.cfg or something similar) and save it to the GameData folder.\u00A0 Add the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003E@PHYSICSGLOBALS\n{\n\t@autoStrutTechRequired = materialsScienceHuman\n}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want it right away you can change materialsScienceHuman to start.\u00A0 I\u0027ll fix this in the next update.\u00A0 Not sure when this will happen though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
