I post this here, as, the game is not generating a log that I can find, and the console depicted in the final images shows no errors either. Is anyone encountering this themselves or have some clue as to what is going on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonal Supposition: I think either my craft is borked some how, or something is going on with mechjeb. Or its a kraken.

It should be noted, one the first stage is cut lose, I begin taking pictures once a second until manual deployment of the payload fairing. I have never had MechJeb do this. I have used it since I discovered it back in KSP 0.21, and never had need to command it to stop short of any stages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInitial Post Posting Edit Note of additional Information: I just tried something. I tore off the boost stage, leaving the final orbital stage/payload intact. I replaced the mechjeb unit, zeroed the mainsails thrust and launched. I found that even if I manually stage the thing using space bar, the moment that fairing is deployed and mechjeb is active, it instantly fires the sepatrons. IF I use the action group or manually stage with mechjeb OFFLINE the sepatrons do not engage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondary Post Posting Edit Note of additional additional Information: I just altered the vehicle again, moving the mechjeb unit up onto the payload itself. This had no effect on the aforementioned issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTertiary Post Posting Edit Note of additional additional additional Information: I found I was missing a probe core on the payload. Thought adding one would fix it along with swapping to stock sepatrons. It did allow for control of the payload post undocking on orbit, but, the sepatrons are still being fired by the mechjeb. cause remains unknown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImages:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the pad:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MZ6HcGc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MZ6HcGc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInitial Ascent:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Fm3gaPK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Fm3gaPK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStage One MECO, This image and all the rest to follow are taken roughly at 1 to 1.5 second intervals:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YM58BqO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YM58BqO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechJeb is now just sitting there as we coast:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GZT3peb.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/GZT3peb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechJeb still sitting there doing nothing as we coast:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hpQYQeq.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/hpQYQeq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI press 1 button, action group 1 to deploy the payload fairing, suddenly mechjeb wakes up and cooks the payload:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Frt7nTo.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Frt7nTo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have 0 clue what is going on here. I have never seen mechjeb do this since I first found it way back at 0.21. I wish I knew what was going on. And before someone asks if I have an output log, no, no I do not, as it has not created one. The last log I see that has the title of output log is from october 2016, and thats in both the KSP_Data and KSP_X64_Data folders. If I am not looking in the correct place to find one dated for September 4, 2017 please guide me to it, and I will gladly file dropper it into this post with a big ol edit showing it off.

I\u0027m pretty sure what\u0027s happening here is that Mechjeb thinks that the interstage fairing are the actual fairings, so during that coasting stage, it\u0027s waiting to get to the part of the atmosphere where it can drop fairings safely. You can probably get it to activate the stage immediately by setting the fairing deployment altitude to 40000km ish? or maybe that would activate that stage too early. I haven\u0027t tested that but it\u0027s an idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as a result of that it doesn\u0027t decouple the actual fairings because it think it already did.
