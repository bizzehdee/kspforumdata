My game WAS pretty heavily modded, but it never lagged like this before. Playing stock sort of helped, but not a lot. If you know how to make KSP fast again or something like that, it\u0027d be very appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T20:34:26Z","Content":"PC specs?
