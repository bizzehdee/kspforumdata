I had been playing for quite some time, until a few months ago. Now with the release of 1.0 I\u0027ve decided to restart. However, I have some questions.\n\nFirst and foremost, what will happen to the 400\u002B crafts I\u0027ve made over time? Most, if not all include mod parts, from mods such as tweakscale, firespitter, mechjeb, spaceplane plus etc. For one, I know spaceplane has been integrated to the full game. What about the rest. If I were to reinstall them, would I be able to play?\n\nSecondly, has anything changed considering non-steam updates? I had purchased from the website and wasn\u0027t able to transfer over to steam, for better or worse!\n\nThanks a bunch!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T15:40:42Z","Content":"Well, I\u0027d back up all my saves and craft first.\n\nModded craft and saves may break if the mods they use have not been updated or have changed significantly, even stock saves and craft may break which is why it\u0027s important to make back-ups.\n\nThe patcher is AWOL so non-Steam updates require a full re-download.\n\nHope this helps ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"MrUberGr","CreatedById":78026,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T15:52:24Z","Content":"And where does one shop for mods these days?
