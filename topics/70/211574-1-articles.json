Other vessels load properly but this one particular vessel (which I really need, lol) is not playing nice. I have a heavily modded install and it could very well be a memory leak but it\u0027s only this one vessel, and the vessel is only around 200 parts. If anyone has ideas or even can point out just what mod is conflicting I can dig into it more, but I have no clue at this moment. I was getting a NaN floating point related to a radiator panel, but removing said panels had no effect so it\u0027s something even more sinister going on. Right now I\u0027m having to load the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, try to remove a suspicious part, crash, repeat. I don\u0027t want to have to reinstall until absolutely necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/6b1og0703jimre7/Offshore%20Facility.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft file of vessel in question\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/vhevp4dh25q12k4/PlayerUnknownCrashes.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELog\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/osw9u3t8dyknqqs/MMcache.ConfigCache?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emodule manager cache in case that has useful info\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime to start using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, I think.
