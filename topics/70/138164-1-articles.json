I had to use a compatibility layer (Crossover, a commercial version of Wine) to get the game running properly. I\u0027m using CKAN, and the only issue is the fact that the program doesn\u0027t see the /home/USER/.cxoffice/ folder. Because of CKAN\u0027s lack of a text input for navigation, I cannot find my way to that particular folder. There\u0027s probably a file somewhere that I can just do a quick edit to - so, I hope I receive help soon. CKAN is a lifesaver when it comes to convenience w/ installing mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
