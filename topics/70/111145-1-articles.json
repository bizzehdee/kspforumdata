It just flat out closes the entire program, As far as hardware i have an Azrock Extreme 3 Gen 3 motherboard, I5 quad core, 290x Video card, 16gb Ram and I am running 64bit. If anyone can help me I would love you .... seriously this game is an addiction as I am an engineer but i just cant get my fix ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\nI do have a screenshot of the mods I have currently installed \\*which is about 30 or so\\* but mind you I recently wiped the program all mods and everything and only downloaded mods at the latest version 1.2 but still getting the same problems as usual. Other recent problems were no ammo boxes showing up for guns and whatnot, Missiles would just release not fire or lock on to anything at all parts sometimes looking flat white."},{"CreatedByName":"Seaview123","CreatedById":130421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T13:26:45Z","Content":"I think you\u0027ll need to provide a little more information before anyone will be able to help. If you\u0027re \u0022running 64bit\u0022 version of KSP, there are some issues that folks have reported with that version and you might have better luck running the 32bit version."}]}
