There is no guarantee they are well optimized, it is entirely possible that they lag more than others. Also, take a look at your Alt-F2 log and see if there are any errors popping up. If that\u0027s the case, even if it was only a single piece, having it throw errors every frame is going to add a lot of slowdown. Even so, that\u0027s going to be a lot of pieces and you will lag. Most people experience reasonable lag at five hundred parts, and eight or nine hundred is definitely going to damage performance. As has been said, it is because of how KSP handles physics and parts, even in space where none seem to be happening calculations are being done for each part. Combine that with what I said in my first sentence and you may find you have a larger recipe for slowdown than you think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, it\u0027s not like 1500\u002B is a small number of parts. Squad actually did a large optimization to the game in 0.23 to make five and six hundred part craft playable, but a lot of the limitations of KSP are caused by Unity. It\u0027s a fast development pipeline but I\u0027ve never been impressed with it\u0027s performance and it will always be a restriction on how much optimization the developers can actually do. Squad said they do not intend to put a part cap in the game because if your computer can handle it, or you are willing to put up with it, they aren\u0027t going to stop you from building it. Will optimizations come? Are the developers working on it? Yes and no. If they can see one they can make they will but is not their focus right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat all being said, here is my advice: that space station is uglier than sin and wasteful to boot. De-orbit it and enjoy watching the slide show of it break up and explode. I can see your lifting stages are still attached, and if those aren\u0027t lifting stages, where exactly do you intend to fly this thing? You can fly ten parts \u003Cem\u003Eacross the solar system easily\u003C/em\u003E; the best advice for space stations is to GET RID OF EXTRA PARTS. In a scene of fifteen hundred you could get rid of three hundred and never know they went missing. Stations are big and laggy because you contend not only with the parts within the station itself, but any ships that plan on coming near it. Abandon your plans of bringing thousands of parts to the same 5km area, or accept lag as your religion. I don\u0027t rely on theoretical optimizations, I got over my \u0027intricately detailed\u0027 stage long ago and that is really the best approach if you are interested in performance right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-07T16:33:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2014 04:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razparaz","CreatedById":128508,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T16:57:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanx for the answers.. does not help tho.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirst 3 answers: how come NONE of my cores are at 100%..
